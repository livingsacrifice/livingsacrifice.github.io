1 Corinthians,10,3,"They all ate the same spiritual food,"
1 Corinthians,10,4,"and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ."
1 Corinthians,10,5,"But God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the wilderness."
1 Corinthians,10,6,"Now these things became examples for us, so that we will not desire evil things as they did."
1 Corinthians,10,7,"Don’t become idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and got up to play."
1 Corinthians,10,8,"Let us not commit sexual immorality as some of them did, and in a single day 23,000 people fell dead."
1 Corinthians,10,9,Let us not test Christ as some of them did and were destroyed by snakes.
1 Corinthians,10,10,"Nor should we complain as some of them did, and were killed by the destroyer."
1 Corinthians,10,11,"Now these things happened to them as examples, and they were written as a warning to us, on whom the ends of the ages have come."
1 Corinthians,10,12,"So, whoever thinks he stands must be careful not to fall."
1 Corinthians,10,13,"No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to humanity. God is faithful, and He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation He will also provide a way of escape so that you are able to bear it."
1 Corinthians,10,14,"Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry."
1 Corinthians,10,15,I am speaking as to wise people. Judge for yourselves what I say.
1 Corinthians,10,16,"The cup of blessing that we give thanks for, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of Christ?"
1 Corinthians,10,17,"Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for all of us share that one bread."
1 Corinthians,10,18,Look at the people of Israel. Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in what is offered on the altar?
1 Corinthians,10,19,"What am I saying then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?"
1 Corinthians,10,20,"No, but I do say that what they sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God. I do not want you to participate with demons!"
1 Corinthians,10,21,You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot share in the Lord’s table and the table of demons.
1 Corinthians,10,22,Or are we provoking the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?
1 Corinthians,10,23,"“Everything is permissible,” but not everything is helpful. “Everything is permissible,” but not everything builds up."
1 Corinthians,10,24,"No one should seek his own good, but the good of the other person."
1 Corinthians,10,25,"Eat everything that is sold in the meat market, asking no questions for conscience’ sake,"
1 Corinthians,10,26,"for the earth is the Lord’s, and all that is in it."
1 Corinthians,10,27,"If one of the unbelievers invites you over and you want to go, eat everything that is set before you, without raising questions of conscience."
1 Corinthians,10,28,"But if someone says to you, “This is food offered to an idol,” do not eat it, out of consideration for the one who told you, and for conscience’ sake."
1 Corinthians,10,29,"I do not mean your own conscience, but the other person’s. For why is my freedom judged by another person’s conscience?"
1 Corinthians,10,30,"If I partake with thanks, why am I slandered because of something I give thanks for?"
1 Corinthians,10,31,"Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for God’s glory."
1 Corinthians,10,32,"Give no offense to the Jews or the Greeks or the church of God,"
1 Corinthians,10,33,"just as I also try to please all people in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, so that they may be saved."
1 Corinthians,11,1,"Imitate me, as I also imitate Christ."
1 Corinthians,11,2,Now I praise you because you always remember me and keep the traditions just as I delivered them to you.
1 Corinthians,11,3,"But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ."
1 Corinthians,11,4,Every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head dishonors his head.
1 Corinthians,11,5,"But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since that is one and the same as having her head shaved."
1 Corinthians,11,6,"So if a woman’s head is not covered, her hair should be cut off. But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, she should be covered."
1 Corinthians,11,7,"A man, in fact, should not cover his head, because he is God’s image and glory, but woman is man’s glory."
1 Corinthians,11,8,"For man did not come from woman, but woman came from man."
1 Corinthians,11,9,"And man was not created for woman, but woman for man."
1 Corinthians,11,10,"This is why a woman should have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels."
1 Corinthians,11,11,"In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, and man is not independent of woman."
1 Corinthians,11,12,"For just as woman came from man, so man comes through woman, and all things come from God."
1 Corinthians,11,13,Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
1 Corinthians,11,14,"Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair it is a disgrace to him,"
1 Corinthians,11,15,"but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her as a covering."
1 Corinthians,11,16,"But if anyone wants to argue about this, we have no other custom, nor do the churches of God."
1 Corinthians,11,17,"Now in giving the following instruction I do not praise you, since you come together not for the better but for the worse."
1 Corinthians,11,18,"For to begin with, I hear that when you come together as a church there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it."
1 Corinthians,11,19,"There must, indeed, be factions among you, so that those who are approved may be recognized among you."
1 Corinthians,11,20,"Therefore, when you come together, it is not really to eat the Lord’s Supper."
1 Corinthians,11,21,"For at the meal, each one eats his own supper ahead of others. So one person is hungry while another gets drunk!"
1 Corinthians,11,22,Don’t you have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you look down on the church of God and embarrass those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I do not praise you for this!
1 Corinthians,11,23,"For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: On the night when He was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread,"
1 Corinthians,11,24,"gave thanks, broke it, and said, “This is My body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of Me.”"
1 Corinthians,11,25,"In the same way, after supper He also took the cup and said, “This cup is the new covenant established by My blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”"
1 Corinthians,11,26,"For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes."
1 Corinthians,11,27,"Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy way will be guilty of sin against the body and blood of the Lord."
1 Corinthians,11,28,So a man should examine himself; in this way he should eat the bread and drink from the cup.
1 Corinthians,11,29,"For whoever eats and drinks without recognizing the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself."
1 Corinthians,11,30,"This is why many are sick and ill among you, and many have fallen asleep."
1 Corinthians,11,31,"If we were properly evaluating ourselves, we would not be judged,"
1 Corinthians,11,32,"but when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord, so that we may not be condemned with the world."
1 Corinthians,11,33,"Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another."
1 Corinthians,11,34,"If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you gather together you will not come under judgment. And I will give instructions about the other matters whenever I come."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"Now concerning what comes from the Spirit: brothers, I do not want you to be unaware."
1 Corinthians,12,2,"You know that when you were pagans, you used to be led off to the idols that could not speak."
1 Corinthians,12,3,"Therefore I am informing you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,4,"Now there are different gifts, but the same Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,5,"There are different ministries, but the same Lord."
1 Corinthians,12,6,"And there are different activities, but the same God activates each gift in each person."
1 Corinthians,12,7,A demonstration of the Spirit is given to each person to produce what is beneficial:
1 Corinthians,12,8,"to one is given a message of wisdom through the Spirit, to another, a message of knowledge by the same Spirit,"
1 Corinthians,12,9,"to another, faith by the same Spirit, to another, gifts of healing by the one Spirit,"
1 Corinthians,12,10,"to another, the performing of miracles, to another, prophecy, to another, distinguishing between spirits, to another, different kinds of languages, to another, interpretation of languages."
1 Corinthians,12,11,"But one and the same Spirit is active in all these, distributing to each person as He wills."
1 Corinthians,12,12,"For as the body is one and has many parts, and all the parts of that body, though many, are one body—so also is Christ."
1 Corinthians,12,13,"For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and we were all made to drink of one Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,14,So the body is not one part but many.
1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot should say, “Because I’m not a hand, I don’t belong to the body,” in spite of this it still belongs to the body."
1 Corinthians,12,16,"And if the ear should say, “Because I’m not an eye, I don’t belong to the body,” in spite of this it still belongs to the body."
1 Corinthians,12,17,"If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?"
1 Corinthians,12,18,But now God has placed each one of the parts in one body just as He wanted.
1 Corinthians,12,19,"And if they were all the same part, where would the body be?"
1 Corinthians,12,20,"Now there are many parts, yet one body."
1 Corinthians,12,21,"So the eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” Or again, the head can’t say to the feet, “I don’t need you!”"
1 Corinthians,12,22,"But even more, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are necessary."
1 Corinthians,12,23,"And those parts of the body that we think to be less honorable, we clothe these with greater honor, and our unpresentable parts have a better presentation."
1 Corinthians,12,24,"But our presentable parts have no need of clothing. Instead, God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the less honorable,"
1 Corinthians,12,25,"so that there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same concern for each other."
1 Corinthians,12,26,"So if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it."
1 Corinthians,12,27,"Now you are the body of Christ, and individual members of it."
1 Corinthians,12,28,"And God has placed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, next miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, managing, various kinds of languages."
1 Corinthians,12,29,Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all do miracles?
1 Corinthians,12,30,Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in other languages? Do all interpret?
1 Corinthians,12,31,But desire the greater gifts. And I will show you an even better way.
1 Corinthians,13,1,"If I speak human or angelic languages but do not have love, I am a sounding gong or a clanging cymbal."
1 Corinthians,13,2,"If I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can move mountains but do not have love, I am nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,3,"And if I donate all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body in order to boast but do not have love, I gain nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Love is patient, love is kind. Love does not envy, is not boastful, is not conceited,"
1 Corinthians,13,5,"does not act improperly, is not selfish, is not provoked, and does not keep a record of wrongs."
1 Corinthians,13,6,Love finds no joy in unrighteousness but rejoices in the truth.
1 Corinthians,13,7,"It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."
1 Corinthians,13,8,"Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for languages, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will come to an end."
1 Corinthians,13,9,"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part."
1 Corinthians,13,10,"But when the perfect comes, the partial will come to an end."
1 Corinthians,13,11,"When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put aside childish things."
1 Corinthians,13,12,"For now we see indistinctly, as in a mirror, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, as I am fully known."
1 Corinthians,13,13,"Now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Pursue love and desire spiritual gifts, and above all that you may prophesy."
1 Corinthians,14,2,"For the person who speaks in another language is not speaking to men but to God, since no one understands him; however, he speaks mysteries in the Spirit."
1 Corinthians,14,3,"But the person who prophesies speaks to people for edification, encouragement, and consolation."
1 Corinthians,14,4,"The person who speaks in another language builds himself up, but he who prophesies builds up the church."
1 Corinthians,14,5,"I wish all of you spoke in other languages, but even more that you prophesied. The person who prophesies is greater than the person who speaks in languages, unless he interprets so that the church may be built up."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in other languages, how will I benefit you unless I speak to you with a revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?"
1 Corinthians,14,7,"Even inanimate things that produce sounds—whether flute or harp—if they don’t make a distinction in the notes, how will what is played on the flute or harp be recognized?"
1 Corinthians,14,8,"In fact, if the trumpet makes an unclear sound, who will prepare for battle?"
1 Corinthians,14,9,"In the same way, unless you use your tongue for intelligible speech, how will what is spoken be known? For you will be speaking into the air."
1 Corinthians,14,10,"There are doubtless many different kinds of languages in the world, and all have meaning."
1 Corinthians,14,11,"Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker will be a foreigner to me."
1 Corinthians,14,12,"So also you—since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek to excel in building up the church."
1 Corinthians,14,13,Therefore the person who speaks in another language should pray that he can interpret.
1 Corinthians,14,14,"For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful."
1 Corinthians,14,15,"What then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with my understanding. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with my understanding."
1 Corinthians,14,16,"Otherwise, if you praise with the spirit, how will the uninformed person say “Amen” at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?"
1 Corinthians,14,17,"For you may very well be giving thanks, but the other person is not being built up."
1 Corinthians,14,18,I thank God that I speak in other languages more than all of you;
1 Corinthians,14,19,"yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, in order to teach others also, than 10,000 words in another language."
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brothers, don’t be childish in your thinking, but be infants in regard to evil and adult in your thinking."
1 Corinthians,14,21,"It is written in the law: I will speak to these people by people of other languages and by the lips of foreigners, and even then, they will not listen to Me, says the Lord."
1 Corinthians,14,22,"It follows that speaking in other languages is intended as a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers. But prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers."
1 Corinthians,14,23,"Therefore, if the whole church assembles together and all are speaking in other languages and people who are uninformed or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your minds?"
1 Corinthians,14,24,"But if all are prophesying and some unbeliever or uninformed person comes in, he is convicted by all and is judged by all."
1 Corinthians,14,25,"The secrets of his heart will be revealed, and as a result he will fall facedown and worship God, proclaiming, “God is really among you.”"
1 Corinthians,14,26,"What then is the conclusion, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, another language, or an interpretation. All things must be done for edification."
1 Corinthians,14,27,"If any person speaks in another language, there should be only two, or at the most three, each in turn, and someone must interpret."
1 Corinthians,14,28,"But if there is no interpreter, that person should keep silent in the church and speak to himself and to God."
1 Corinthians,14,29,"Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should evaluate."
1 Corinthians,14,30,"But if something has been revealed to another person sitting there, the first prophet should be silent."
1 Corinthians,14,31,"For you can all prophesy one by one, so that everyone may learn and everyone may be encouraged."
1 Corinthians,14,32,"And the prophets’ spirits are under the control of the prophets,"
1 Corinthians,14,33,"since God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,"
1 Corinthians,14,34,"the women should be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak, but should be submissive, as the law also says."
1 Corinthians,14,35,"And if they want to learn something, they should ask their own husbands at home, for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church meeting."
1 Corinthians,14,36,"Did the word of God originate from you, or did it come to you only?"
1 Corinthians,14,37,"If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, he should recognize that what I write to you is the Lord’s command."
1 Corinthians,14,38,"But if anyone ignores this, he will be ignored."
1 Corinthians,14,39,"Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in other languages."
1 Corinthians,14,40,But everything must be done decently and in order.
1 Corinthians,15,1,"Now brothers, I want to clarify for you the gospel I proclaimed to you; you received it and have taken your stand on it."
1 Corinthians,15,2,"You are also saved by it, if you hold to the message I proclaimed to you—unless you believed for no purpose."
1 Corinthians,15,3,"For I passed on to you as most important what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,"
1 Corinthians,15,4,"that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,"
1 Corinthians,15,5,"and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve."
1 Corinthians,15,6,"Then He appeared to over 500 brothers at one time; most of them are still alive, but some have fallen asleep."
1 Corinthians,15,7,"Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles."
1 Corinthians,15,8,"Last of all, as to one abnormally born, He also appeared to me."
1 Corinthians,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
1 Corinthians,15,10,"But by God’s grace I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not ineffective. However, I worked more than any of them, yet not I, but God’s grace that was with me."
1 Corinthians,15,11,"Therefore, whether it is I or they, so we proclaim and so you have believed."
1 Corinthians,15,12,"Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say, “There is no resurrection of the dead”?"
1 Corinthians,15,13,"But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised;"
1 Corinthians,15,14,"and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is without foundation, and so is your faith."
1 Corinthians,15,15,"In addition, we are found to be false witnesses about God, because we have testified about God that He raised up Christ—whom He did not raise up if in fact the dead are not raised."
1 Corinthians,15,16,"For if the dead are not raised, Christ has not been raised."
1 Corinthians,15,17,"And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins."
1 Corinthians,15,18,"Therefore, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have also perished."
1 Corinthians,15,19,"If we have put our hope in Christ for this life only, we should be pitied more than anyone."
1 Corinthians,15,20,"But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep."
1 Corinthians,15,21,"For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also comes through a man."
1 Corinthians,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive."
1 Corinthians,15,23,"But each in his own order: Christ, the firstfruits; afterward, at His coming, those who belong to Christ."
1 Corinthians,15,24,"Then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father, when He abolishes all rule and all authority and power."
1 Corinthians,15,25,For He must reign until He puts all His enemies under His feet.
1 Corinthians,15,26,The last enemy to be abolished is death.
1 Corinthians,15,27,"For God has put everything under His feet. But when it says “everything” is put under Him, it is obvious that He who puts everything under Him is the exception."
1 Corinthians,15,28,"And when everything is subject to Christ, then the Son Himself will also be subject to the One who subjected everything to Him, so that God may be all in all."
1 Corinthians,15,29,"Otherwise what will they do who are being baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, then why are people baptized for them?"
1 Corinthians,15,30,Why are we in danger every hour?
1 Corinthians,15,31,I affirm by the pride in you that I have in Christ Jesus our Lord: I die every day!
1 Corinthians,15,32,"If I fought wild animals in Ephesus with only human hope, what good did that do me? If the dead are not raised, Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
1 Corinthians,15,33,Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.”
1 Corinthians,15,34,"Come to your senses and stop sinning, for some people are ignorant about God. I say this to your shame."
1 Corinthians,15,35,"But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? What kind of body will they have when they come?”"
1 Corinthians,15,36,Foolish one! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
1 Corinthians,15,37,"And as for what you sow—you are not sowing the future body, but only a seed, perhaps of wheat or another grain."
1 Corinthians,15,38,"But God gives it a body as He wants, and to each of the seeds its own body."
1 Corinthians,15,39,"Not all flesh is the same flesh; there is one flesh for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish."
1 Corinthians,15,40,"There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is different from that of the earthly ones."
1 Corinthians,15,41,"There is a splendor of the sun, another of the moon, and another of the stars; for one star differs from another star in splendor."
1 Corinthians,15,42,"So it is with the resurrection of the dead: Sown in corruption, raised in incorruption;"
1 Corinthians,15,43,"sown in dishonor, raised in glory; sown in weakness, raised in power;"
1 Corinthians,15,44,"sown a natural body, raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body."
1 Corinthians,15,45,So it is written: The first man Adam became a living being; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.
1 Corinthians,15,46,"However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, then the spiritual."
1 Corinthians,15,47,The first man was from the earth and made of dust; the second man is from heaven.
1 Corinthians,15,48,"Like the man made of dust, so are those who are made of dust; like the heavenly man, so are those who are heavenly."
1 Corinthians,15,49,"And just as we have borne the image of the man made of dust, we will also bear the image of the heavenly man."
1 Corinthians,15,50,"Brothers, I tell you this: Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, and corruption cannot inherit incorruption."
1 Corinthians,15,51,"Listen! I am telling you a mystery: We will not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed,"
1 Corinthians,15,52,"in a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed."
1 Corinthians,15,53,"For this corruptible must be clothed with incorruptibility, and this mortal must be clothed with immortality."
1 Corinthians,15,54,"When this corruptible is clothed with incorruptibility, and this mortal is clothed with immortality, then the saying that is written will take place: Death has been swallowed up in victory."
1 Corinthians,15,55,"Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting?"
1 Corinthians,15,56,"Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law."
1 Corinthians,15,57,"But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!"
1 Corinthians,15,58,"Therefore, my dear brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the Lord’s work, knowing that your labor in the Lord is not in vain."
1 Corinthians,16,1,Now about the collection for the saints: You should do the same as I instructed the Galatian churches.
1 Corinthians,16,2,"On the first day of the week, each of you is to set something aside and save in keeping with how he prospers, so that no collections will need to be made when I come."
1 Corinthians,16,3,"When I arrive, I will send with letters those you recommend to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem."
1 Corinthians,16,4,"If it is suitable for me to go as well, they can travel with me."
1 Corinthians,16,5,I will come to you after I pass through Macedonia—for I will be traveling through Macedonia—
1 Corinthians,16,6,"and perhaps I will remain with you or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I go."
1 Corinthians,16,7,"I don’t want to see you now just in passing, for I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord allows."
1 Corinthians,16,8,"But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,"
1 Corinthians,16,9,because a wide door for effective ministry has opened for me—yet many oppose me.
1 Corinthians,16,10,"If Timothy comes, see that he has nothing to fear from you, because he is doing the Lord’s work, just as I am."
1 Corinthians,16,11,"Therefore, no one should look down on him. Send him on his way in peace so he can come to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers."
1 Corinthians,16,12,"About our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers, but he was not at all willing to come now. However, he will come when he has an opportunity."
1 Corinthians,16,13,"Be alert, stand firm in the faith, act like a man, be strong."
1 Corinthians,16,14,Your every action must be done with love.
1 Corinthians,16,15,"Brothers, you know the household of Stephanas: They are the firstfruits of Achaia and have devoted themselves to serving the saints. I urge you"
1 Corinthians,16,16,"also to submit to such people, and to everyone who works and labors with them."
1 Corinthians,16,17,"I am pleased to have Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus present, because these men have made up for your absence."
1 Corinthians,16,18,For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore recognize such people.
1 Corinthians,16,19,"The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, along with the church that meets in their home."
1 Corinthians,16,20,All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1 Corinthians,16,21,This greeting is in my own hand—Paul.
1 Corinthians,16,22,"If anyone does not love the Lord, a curse be on him. Marana tha that is, Lord, come!"
1 Corinthians,16,23,The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
1 Corinthians,16,24,My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus.
2 Corinthians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will, and Timothy our brother: To God’s church at Corinth, with all the saints who are throughout Achaia."
2 Corinthians,1,2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Corinthians,1,3,"Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort."
2 Corinthians,1,4,"He comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any kind of affliction, through the comfort we ourselves receive from God."
2 Corinthians,1,5,"For as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so through Christ our comfort also overflows."
2 Corinthians,1,6,"If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is experienced in your endurance of the same sufferings that we suffer."
2 Corinthians,1,7,"And our hope for you is firm, because we know that as you share in the sufferings, so you will share in the comfort."
2 Corinthians,1,8,"For we don’t want you to be unaware, brothers, of our affliction that took place in Asia: we were completely overwhelmed—beyond our strength—so that we even despaired of life."
2 Corinthians,1,9,"Indeed, we personally had a death sentence within ourselves, so that we would not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead."
2 Corinthians,1,10,"He has delivered us from such a terrible death, and He will deliver us. We have put our hope in Him that He will deliver us again"
2 Corinthians,1,11,while you join in helping us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gift that came to us through the prayers of many.
2 Corinthians,1,12,"For this is our confidence: The testimony of our conscience is that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you, with God-given sincerity and purity, not by fleshly wisdom but by God’s grace."
2 Corinthians,1,13,Now we are writing nothing to you other than what you can read and also understand. I hope you will understand completely—
2 Corinthians,1,14,"as you have partially understood us—that we are your reason for pride, as you are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus."
2 Corinthians,1,15,"I planned with this confidence to come to you first, so you could have a double benefit,"
2 Corinthians,1,16,"and to go on to Macedonia with your help, then come to you again from Macedonia and be given a start by you on my journey to Judea."
2 Corinthians,1,17,"So when I planned this, was I irresponsible? Or what I plan, do I plan in a purely human way so that I say “Yes, yes” and “No, no” simultaneously?"
2 Corinthians,1,18,"As God is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes and no.”"
2 Corinthians,1,19,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me and Silvanus and Timothy—did not become “Yes and no”; on the contrary, a final “Yes” has come in Him."
2 Corinthians,1,20,"For every one of God’s promises is “Yes” in Him. Therefore, the “Amen” is also spoken through Him by us for God’s glory."
2 Corinthians,1,21,"Now it is God who strengthens us, with you, in Christ and has anointed us."
2 Corinthians,1,22,He has also sealed us and given us the Spirit as a down payment in our hearts.
2 Corinthians,1,23,"I call on God as a witness, on my life, that it was to spare you that I did not come to Corinth."
2 Corinthians,1,24,"I do not mean that we have control of your faith, but we are workers with you for your joy, because you stand by faith."
2 Corinthians,2,1,"In fact, I made up my mind about this: I would not come to you on another painful visit."
2 Corinthians,2,2,"For if I cause you pain, then who will cheer me other than the one being hurt by me?"
2 Corinthians,2,3,"I wrote this very thing so that when I came I wouldn’t have pain from those who ought to give me joy, because I am confident about all of you that my joy will also be yours."
2 Corinthians,2,4,"For I wrote to you with many tears out of an extremely troubled and anguished heart—not that you should be hurt, but that you should know the abundant love I have for you."
2 Corinthians,2,5,"If anyone has caused pain, he has caused pain not so much to me but to some degree—not to exaggerate—to all of you."
2 Corinthians,2,6,The punishment inflicted by the majority is sufficient for that person.
2 Corinthians,2,7,"As a result, you should instead forgive and comfort him. Otherwise, this one may be overwhelmed by excessive grief."
2 Corinthians,2,8,Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love to him.
2 Corinthians,2,9,I wrote for this purpose: to test your character to see if you are obedient in everything.
2 Corinthians,2,10,"If you forgive anyone, I do too. For what I have forgiven—if I have forgiven anything—it is for you in the presence of Christ."
2 Corinthians,2,11,I have done this so that we may not be taken advantage of by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his schemes.
2 Corinthians,2,12,"When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, the Lord opened a door for me."
2 Corinthians,2,13,"I had no rest in my spirit because I did not find my brother Titus, but I said good-bye to them and left for Macedonia."
2 Corinthians,2,14,"But thanks be to God, who always puts us on display in Christ and through us spreads the aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place."
2 Corinthians,2,15,For to God we are the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.
2 Corinthians,2,16,"To some we are an aroma of death leading to death, but to others, an aroma of life leading to life. And who is competent for this?"
2 Corinthians,2,17,"For we are not like the many who market God’s message for profit. On the contrary, we speak with sincerity in Christ, as from God and before God."
2 Corinthians,3,1,"Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some, letters of recommendation to you or from you?"
2 Corinthians,3,2,"You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, recognized and read by everyone."
2 Corinthians,3,3,"It is clear that you are Christ’s letter, produced by us, not written with ink but with the Spirit of the living God—not on stone tablets but on tablets that are hearts of flesh."
2 Corinthians,3,4,We have this kind of confidence toward God through Christ.
2 Corinthians,3,5,"It is not that we are competent in ourselves to consider anything as coming from ourselves, but our competence is from God."
2 Corinthians,3,6,"He has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit produces life."
2 Corinthians,3,7,"Now if the ministry of death, chiseled in letters on stones, came with glory, so that the Israelites were not able to look directly at Moses’ face because of the glory from his face—a fading glory—"
2 Corinthians,3,8,how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious?
2 Corinthians,3,9,"For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, the ministry of righteousness overflows with even more glory."
2 Corinthians,3,10,"In fact, what had been glorious is not glorious now by comparison because of the glory that surpasses it."
2 Corinthians,3,11,"For if what was fading away was glorious, what endures will be even more glorious."
2 Corinthians,3,12,"Therefore, having such a hope, we use great boldness."
2 Corinthians,3,13,"We are not like Moses, who used to put a veil over his face so that the Israelites could not stare at the the end of what was fading away,"
2 Corinthians,3,14,"but their minds were closed. For to this day, at the reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains; it is not lifted, because it is set aside only in Christ."
2 Corinthians,3,15,"Even to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts,"
2 Corinthians,3,16,"but whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is removed."
2 Corinthians,3,17,"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."
2 Corinthians,3,18,"We all, with unveiled faces, are looking as in a mirror at the glory of the Lord and are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory; this is from the Lord who is the Spirit."
2 Corinthians,4,1,"Therefore, since we have this ministry because we were shown mercy, we do not give up."
2 Corinthians,4,2,"Instead, we have renounced shameful secret things, not walking in deceit or distorting God’s message, but commending ourselves to every person’s conscience in God’s sight by an open display of the truth."
2 Corinthians,4,3,"But if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing."
2 Corinthians,4,4,"In their case, the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers so they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God."
2 Corinthians,4,5,"For we are not proclaiming ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves because of Jesus."
2 Corinthians,4,6,"For God who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of God’s glory in the face of Jesus Christ."
2 Corinthians,4,7,"Now we have this treasure in clay jars, so that this extraordinary power may be from God and not from us."
2 Corinthians,4,8,We are pressured in every way but not crushed; we are perplexed but not in despair;
2 Corinthians,4,9,we are persecuted but not abandoned; we are struck down but not destroyed.
2 Corinthians,4,10,"We always carry the death of Jesus in our body, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body."
2 Corinthians,4,11,"For we who live are always given over to death because of Jesus, so that Jesus’ life may also be revealed in our mortal flesh."
2 Corinthians,4,12,"So death works in us, but life in you."
2 Corinthians,4,13,"And since we have the same spirit of faith in keeping with what is written, I believed, therefore I spoke, we also believe, and therefore speak."
2 Corinthians,4,14,We know that the One who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and present us with you.
2 Corinthians,4,15,"Indeed, everything is for your benefit, so that grace, extended through more and more people, may cause thanksgiving to increase to God’s glory."
2 Corinthians,4,16,"Therefore we do not give up. Even though our outer person is being destroyed, our inner person is being renewed day by day."
2 Corinthians,4,17,For our momentary light affliction is producing for us an absolutely incomparable eternal weight of glory.
2 Corinthians,4,18,"So we do not focus on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal."
2 Corinthians,5,1,"For we know that if our temporary, earthly dwelling is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal dwelling in the heavens, not made with hands."
2 Corinthians,5,2,"Indeed, we groan in this body, desiring to put on our dwelling from heaven,"
2 Corinthians,5,3,"since, when we are clothed, we will not be found naked."
2 Corinthians,5,4,"Indeed, we groan while we are in this tent, burdened as we are, because we do not want to be unclothed but clothed, so that mortality may be swallowed up by life."
2 Corinthians,5,5,"And the One who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave us the Spirit as a down payment."
2 Corinthians,5,6,"So, we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord."
2 Corinthians,5,7,"For we walk by faith, not by sight,"
2 Corinthians,5,8,and we are confident and satisfied to be out of the body and at home with the Lord.
2 Corinthians,5,9,"Therefore, whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to be pleasing to Him."
2 Corinthians,5,10,"For we must all appear before the tribunal of Christ, so that each may be repaid for what he has done in the body, whether good or worthless."
2 Corinthians,5,11,"Therefore, because we know the fear of the Lord, we seek to persuade people. We are completely open before God, and I hope we are completely open to your consciences as well."
2 Corinthians,5,12,"We are not commending ourselves to you again, but giving you an opportunity to be proud of us, so that you may have a reply for those who take pride in the outward appearance rather than in the heart."
2 Corinthians,5,13,"For if we are out of our mind, it is for God; if we have a sound mind, it is for you."
2 Corinthians,5,14,"For Christ’s love compels us, since we have reached this conclusion: If One died for all, then all died."
2 Corinthians,5,15,"And He died for all so that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for the One who died for them and was raised."
2 Corinthians,5,16,"From now on, then, we do not know anyone in a purely human way. Even if we have known Christ in a purely human way, yet now we no longer know Him in this way."
2 Corinthians,5,17,"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away, and look, new things have come."
2 Corinthians,5,18,"Everything is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:"
2 Corinthians,5,19,"That is, in Christ, God was reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed the message of reconciliation to us."
2 Corinthians,5,20,"Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, certain that God is appealing through us. We plead on Christ’s behalf, “Be reconciled to God.”"
2 Corinthians,5,21,"He made the One who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."
2 Corinthians,6,1,"Working together with Him, we also appeal to you, “Don’t receive God’s grace in vain.”"
2 Corinthians,6,2,"For He says: I heard you in an acceptable time, and I helped you in the day of salvation. Look, now is the acceptable time; now is the day of salvation."
2 Corinthians,6,3,"We give no opportunity for stumbling to anyone, so that the ministry will not be blamed."
2 Corinthians,6,4,"But as God’s ministers, we commend ourselves in everything: by great endurance, by afflictions, by hardship, by difficulties,"
2 Corinthians,6,5,"by beatings, by imprisonments, by riots, by labors, by sleepless nights, by times of hunger,"
2 Corinthians,6,6,"by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love,"
2 Corinthians,6,7,"by the message of truth, by the power of God; through weapons of righteousness on the right hand and the left,"
2 Corinthians,6,8,"through glory and dishonor, through slander and good report; as deceivers yet true;"
2 Corinthians,6,9,as unknown yet recognized; as dying and look—we live; as being disciplined yet not killed;
2 Corinthians,6,10,as grieving yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing yet possessing everything.
2 Corinthians,6,11,"We have spoken openly to you, Corinthians; our heart has been opened wide."
2 Corinthians,6,12,"You are not limited by us, but you are limited by your own affections."
2 Corinthians,6,13,"I speak as to my children. As a proper response, you should also be open to us."
2 Corinthians,6,14,Do not be mismatched with unbelievers. For what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?
2 Corinthians,6,15,What agreement does Christ have with Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?
2 Corinthians,6,16,"And what agreement does God’s sanctuary have with idols? For we are the sanctuary of the living God, as God said: I will dwell among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be My people."
2 Corinthians,6,17,"Therefore, come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord; do not touch any unclean thing, and I will welcome you."
2 Corinthians,6,18,"I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty."
2 Corinthians,7,1,"Therefore, dear friends, since we have such promises, let us cleanse ourselves from every impurity of the flesh and spirit, completing our sanctification in the fear of God."
2 Corinthians,7,2,"Accept us. We have wronged no one, corrupted no one, defrauded no one."
2 Corinthians,7,3,"I don’t say this to condemn you, for I have already said that you are in our hearts, to live together and to die together."
2 Corinthians,7,4,I have great confidence in you; I have great pride in you. I am filled with encouragement; I am overcome with joy in all our afflictions.
2 Corinthians,7,5,"In fact, when we came into Macedonia, we had no rest. Instead, we were troubled in every way: conflicts on the outside, fears inside."
2 Corinthians,7,6,"But God, who comforts the humble, comforted us by the arrival of Titus,"
2 Corinthians,7,7,"and not only by his arrival, but also by the comfort he received from you. He told us about your deep longing, your sorrow, and your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more."
2 Corinthians,7,8,"For even if I grieved you with my letter, I do not regret it—even though I did regret it since I saw that the letter grieved you, yet only for a little while."
2 Corinthians,7,9,"Now I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because your grief led to repentance. For you were grieved as God willed, so that you didn’t experience any loss from us."
2 Corinthians,7,10,"For godly grief produces a repentance not to be regretted and leading to salvation, but worldly grief produces death."
2 Corinthians,7,11,"For consider how much diligence this very thing—this grieving as God wills—has produced in you: what a desire to clear yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what deep longing, what zeal, what justice! In every way you showed yourselves to be pure in this matter."
2 Corinthians,7,12,"So even though I wrote to you, it was not because of the one who did wrong, or because of the one who was wronged, but in order that your diligence for us might be made plain to you in the sight of God."
2 Corinthians,7,13,"For this reason we have been comforted. In addition to our comfort, we rejoiced even more over the joy Titus had, because his spirit was refreshed by all of you."
2 Corinthians,7,14,"For if I have made any boast to him about you, I have not been embarrassed; but as I have spoken everything to you in truth, so our boasting to Titus has also turned out to be the truth."
2 Corinthians,7,15,"And his affection toward you is even greater as he remembers the obedience of all of you, and how you received him with fear and trembling."
2 Corinthians,7,16,I rejoice that I have complete confidence in you.
2 Corinthians,8,1,"We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God granted to the churches of Macedonia:"
2 Corinthians,8,2,"During a severe testing by affliction, their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed into the wealth of their generosity."
2 Corinthians,8,3,"I testify that, on their own, according to their ability and beyond their ability,"
2 Corinthians,8,4,"they begged us insistently for the privilege of sharing in the ministry to the saints,"
2 Corinthians,8,5,"and not just as we had hoped. Instead, they gave themselves especially to the Lord, then to us by God’s will."
2 Corinthians,8,6,"So we urged Titus that just as he had begun, so he should also complete this grace to you."
2 Corinthians,8,7,"Now as you excel in everything—faith, speech, knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love for us—excel also in this grace."
2 Corinthians,8,8,"I am not saying this as a command. Rather, by means of the diligence of others, I am testing the genuineness of your love."
2 Corinthians,8,9,"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: Though He was rich, for your sake He became poor, so that by His poverty you might become rich."
2 Corinthians,8,10,"Now I am giving an opinion on this because it is profitable for you, who a year ago began not only to do something but also to desire it."
2 Corinthians,8,11,"But now finish the task as well, that just as there was eagerness to desire it, so there may also be a completion from what you have."
2 Corinthians,8,12,"For if the eagerness is there, it is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have."
2 Corinthians,8,13,"It is not that there may be relief for others and hardship for you, but it is a question of equality—"
2 Corinthians,8,14,"at the present time your surplus is available for their need, so their abundance may also become available for our need, so there may be equality."
2 Corinthians,8,15,"As it has been written: The person who gathered much did not have too much, and the person who gathered little did not have too little."
2 Corinthians,8,16,Thanks be to God who put the same concern for you into the heart of Titus.
2 Corinthians,8,17,"For he accepted our urging and, being very diligent, went out to you by his own choice."
2 Corinthians,8,18,We have sent with him the brother who is praised throughout the churches for his gospel ministry.
2 Corinthians,8,19,"And not only that, but he was also appointed by the churches to accompany us with this gift that is being administered by us for the glory of the Lord Himself and to show our eagerness to help."
2 Corinthians,8,20,We are taking this precaution so no one can criticize us about this large sum administered by us.
2 Corinthians,8,21,"For we are making provision for what is right, not only before the Lord but also before men."
2 Corinthians,8,22,We have also sent with them our brother. We have often tested him in many circumstances and found him to be diligent—and now even more diligent because of his great confidence in you.
2 Corinthians,8,23,"As for Titus, he is my partner and coworker serving you; as for our brothers, they are the messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ."
2 Corinthians,8,24,"Therefore, show them proof before the churches of your love and of our boasting about you."
2 Corinthians,9,1,"Now concerning the ministry to the saints, it is unnecessary for me to write to you."
2 Corinthians,9,2,"For I know your eagerness, and I brag about you to the Macedonians: “Achaia has been prepared since last year,” and your zeal has stirred up most of them."
2 Corinthians,9,3,"But I sent the brothers so our boasting about you in the matter would not prove empty, and so you would be prepared just as I said."
2 Corinthians,9,4,"For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we, not to mention you, would be embarrassed in that situation."
2 Corinthians,9,5,"Therefore I considered it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance the generous gift you promised, so that it will be ready as a gift and not as an extortion."
2 Corinthians,9,6,"Remember this: The person who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the person who sows generously will also reap generously."
2 Corinthians,9,7,"Each person should do as he has decided in his heart—not reluctantly or out of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver."
2 Corinthians,9,8,"And God is able to make every grace overflow to you, so that in every way, always having everything you need, you may excel in every good work."
2 Corinthians,9,9,As it is written: He scattered; He gave to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.
2 Corinthians,9,10,Now the One who provides seed for the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your seed and increase the harvest of your righteousness.
2 Corinthians,9,11,"You will be enriched in every way for all generosity, which produces thanksgiving to God through us."
2 Corinthians,9,12,"For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing in many acts of thanksgiving to God."
2 Corinthians,9,13,"They will glorify God for your obedience to the confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with others through the proof provided by this service."
2 Corinthians,9,14,And they will have deep affection for you in their prayers on your behalf because of the surpassing grace of God in you.
2 Corinthians,9,15,Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift.
2 Corinthians,10,1,"Now I, Paul, make a personal appeal to you by the gentleness and graciousness of Christ—I who am humble among you in person but bold toward you when absent."
2 Corinthians,10,2,I beg you that when I am present I will not need to be bold with the confidence by which I plan to challenge certain people who think we are behaving in an unspiritual way.
2 Corinthians,10,3,"For though we live in the body, we do not wage war in an unspiritual way,"
2 Corinthians,10,4,"since the weapons of our warfare are not worldly, but are powerful through God for the demolition of strongholds. We demolish arguments"
2 Corinthians,10,5,"and every high-minded thing that is raised up against the knowledge of God, taking every thought captive to obey Christ."
2 Corinthians,10,6,"And we are ready to punish any disobedience, once your obedience has been confirmed."
2 Corinthians,10,7,"Look at what is obvious. If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should remind himself of this: Just as he belongs to Christ, so do we."
2 Corinthians,10,8,"For if I boast some more about our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for tearing you down, I am not ashamed."
2 Corinthians,10,9,I don’t want to seem as though I am trying to terrify you with my letters.
2 Corinthians,10,10,"For it is said, “His letters are weighty and powerful, but his physical presence is weak, and his public speaking is despicable.”"
2 Corinthians,10,11,"Such a person should consider this: What we are in the words of our letters when absent, we will be in actions when present."
2 Corinthians,10,12,"For we don’t dare classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. But in measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves to themselves, they lack understanding."
2 Corinthians,10,13,"We, however, will not boast beyond measure but according to the measure of the area of ministry that God has assigned to us, which reaches even to you."
2 Corinthians,10,14,"For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we had not reached you, since we have come to you with the gospel of Christ."
2 Corinthians,10,15,"We are not bragging beyond measure about other people’s labors. But we have the hope that as your faith increases, our area of ministry will be greatly enlarged,"
2 Corinthians,10,16,"so that we may proclaim the good news to the regions beyond you, not boasting about what has already been done in someone else’s area of ministry."
2 Corinthians,10,17,So the one who boasts must boast in the Lord.
2 Corinthians,10,18,"For it is not the one commending himself who is approved, but the one the Lord commends."
2 Corinthians,11,1,"I wish you would put up with a little foolishness from me. Yes, do put up with me."
2 Corinthians,11,2,"For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy, because I have promised you in marriage to one husband—to present a pure virgin to Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,3,"But I fear that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your minds may be seduced from a complete and pure devotion to Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,4,"For if a person comes and preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or you receive a different spirit, which you had not received, or a different gospel, which you had not accepted, you put up with it splendidly!"
2 Corinthians,11,5,Now I consider myself in no way inferior to the “super-apostles.”
2 Corinthians,11,6,"Though untrained in public speaking, I am certainly not untrained in knowledge. Indeed, we have always made that clear to you in everything."
2 Corinthians,11,7,"Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge?"
2 Corinthians,11,8,I robbed other churches by taking pay from them to minister to you.
2 Corinthians,11,9,"When I was present with you and in need, I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my needs. I have kept myself, and will keep myself, from burdening you in any way."
2 Corinthians,11,10,"As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia."
2 Corinthians,11,11,Why? Because I don’t love you? God knows I do!
2 Corinthians,11,12,"But I will continue to do what I am doing, in order to deny the opportunity of those who want an opportunity to be regarded just as our equals in what they boast about."
2 Corinthians,11,13,"For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,14,And no wonder! For Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
2 Corinthians,11,15,So it is no great thing if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their destiny will be according to their works.
2 Corinthians,11,16,"I repeat: No one should consider me a fool. But if you do, at least accept me as a fool, so I too may boast a little."
2 Corinthians,11,17,"What I say in this matter of boasting, I don’t speak as the Lord would, but foolishly."
2 Corinthians,11,18,"Since many boast in an unspiritual way, I will also boast."
2 Corinthians,11,19,"For you, being so wise, gladly put up with fools!"
2 Corinthians,11,20,"In fact, you put up with it if someone enslaves you, if someone devours you, if someone captures you, if someone dominates you, or if someone hits you in the face."
2 Corinthians,11,21,I say this to our shame: We have been weak. But in whatever anyone dares to boast—I am talking foolishly—I also dare:
2 Corinthians,11,22,Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.
2 Corinthians,11,23,"Are they servants of Christ? I’m talking like a madman—I’m a better one: with far more labors, many more imprisonments, far worse beatings, near death many times."
2 Corinthians,11,24,Five times I received 39 lashes from Jews.
2 Corinthians,11,25,Three times I was beaten with rods by the Romans. Once I was stoned by my enemies. Three times I was shipwrecked. I have spent a night and a day in the open sea.
2 Corinthians,11,26,"On frequent journeys, I faced dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the open country, dangers on the sea, and dangers among false brothers;"
2 Corinthians,11,27,"labor and hardship, many sleepless nights, hunger and thirst, often without food, cold, and lacking clothing."
2 Corinthians,11,28,"Not to mention other things, there is the daily pressure on me: my care for all the churches."
2 Corinthians,11,29,"Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn with indignation?"
2 Corinthians,11,30,"If boasting is necessary, I will boast about my weaknesses."
2 Corinthians,11,31,"The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is praised forever, knows I am not lying."
2 Corinthians,11,32,"In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to arrest me,"
2 Corinthians,11,33,so I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.
2 Corinthians,12,1,"Boasting is necessary. It is not profitable, but I will move on to visions and revelations of the Lord."
2 Corinthians,12,2,"I know a man in Christ who was caught up into the third heaven 14 years ago. Whether he was in the body or out of the body, I don’t know, God knows."
2 Corinthians,12,3,"I know that this man—whether in the body or out of the body I don’t know, God knows—"
2 Corinthians,12,4,"was caught up into paradise. He heard inexpressible words, which a man is not allowed to speak."
2 Corinthians,12,5,"I will boast about this person, but not about myself, except of my weaknesses."
2 Corinthians,12,6,"For if I want to boast, I will not be a fool, because I will be telling the truth. But I will spare you, so that no one can credit me with something beyond what he sees in me or hears from me,"
2 Corinthians,12,7,"especially because of the extraordinary revelations. Therefore, so that I would not exalt myself, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to torment me so I would not exalt myself."
2 Corinthians,12,8,"Concerning this, I pleaded with the Lord three times to take it away from me."
2 Corinthians,12,9,"But He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.” Therefore, I will most gladly boast all the more about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may reside in me."
2 Corinthians,12,10,"So I take pleasure in weaknesses, insults, catastrophes, persecutions, and in pressures, because of Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong."
2 Corinthians,12,11,"I have become a fool; you forced it on me. I should have been endorsed by you, since I am not in any way inferior to the “super-apostles,” even though I am nothing."
2 Corinthians,12,12,The signs of an apostle were performed with great endurance among you—not only signs but also wonders and miracles.
2 Corinthians,12,13,"So in what way were you treated worse than the other churches, except that I personally did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!"
2 Corinthians,12,14,"Now I am ready to come to you this third time. I will not burden you, for I am not seeking what is yours, but you. For children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but parents for their children."
2 Corinthians,12,15,"I will most gladly spend and be spent for you. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?"
2 Corinthians,12,16,"Now granted, I have not burdened you; yet sly as I am, I took you in by deceit!"
2 Corinthians,12,17,Did I take advantage of you by anyone I sent you?
2 Corinthians,12,18,"I urged Titus to come, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Didn’t we walk in the same spirit and in the same footsteps?"
2 Corinthians,12,19,"You have thought all along that we were defending ourselves to you. No, in the sight of God we are speaking in Christ, and everything, dear friends, is for building you up."
2 Corinthians,12,20,"For I fear that perhaps when I come I will not find you to be what I want, and I may not be found by you to be what you want; there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambitions, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder."
2 Corinthians,12,21,"I fear that when I come my God will again humiliate me in your presence, and I will grieve for many who sinned before and have not repented of the moral impurity, sexual immorality, and promiscuity they practiced."
2 Corinthians,13,1,This is the third time I am coming to you. Every fact must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
2 Corinthians,13,2,"I gave a warning when I was present the second time, and now I give a warning while I am absent to those who sinned before and to all the rest: If I come again, I will not be lenient,"
2 Corinthians,13,3,"since you seek proof of Christ speaking in me. He is not weak toward you, but powerful among you."
2 Corinthians,13,4,"In fact, He was crucified in weakness, but He lives by God’s power. For we also are weak in Him, yet toward you we will live with Him by God’s power."
2 Corinthians,13,5,Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith. Examine yourselves. Or do you yourselves not recognize that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless you fail the test.
2 Corinthians,13,6,And I hope you will recognize that we do not fail the test.
2 Corinthians,13,7,"Now we pray to God that you do nothing wrong—not that we may appear to pass the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we may appear to fail."
2 Corinthians,13,8,"For we are not able to do anything against the truth, but only for the truth."
2 Corinthians,13,9,"In fact, we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. We also pray that you become fully mature."
2 Corinthians,13,10,"This is why I am writing these things while absent, that when I am there I will not use severity, in keeping with the authority the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down."
2 Corinthians,13,11,"Finally, brothers, rejoice. Become mature, be encouraged, be of the same mind, be at peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you."
2 Corinthians,13,12,Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the saints greet you.
2 Corinthians,13,13,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of you."
2 Corinthians,13,14,DNE for this translation
Galatians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle—not from men or by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead—"
Galatians,1,2,and all the brothers who are with me: To the churches of Galatia.
Galatians,1,3,"Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,"
Galatians,1,4,"who gave Himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father."
Galatians,1,5,To whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Galatians,1,6,I am amazed that you are so quickly turning away from Him who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—
Galatians,1,7,"not that there is another gospel, but there are some who are troubling you and want to change the good news about the Messiah."
Galatians,1,8,"But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel other than what we have preached to you, a curse be on him!"
Galatians,1,9,"As we have said before, I now say again: If anyone preaches to you a gospel contrary to what you received, a curse be on him!"
Galatians,1,10,"For am I now trying to win the favor of people, or God? Or am I striving to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ."
Galatians,1,11,"Now I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel preached by me is not based on human thought."
Galatians,1,12,"For I did not receive it from a human source and I was not taught it, but it came by a revelation from Jesus Christ."
Galatians,1,13,For you have heard about my former way of life in Judaism: I persecuted God’s church to an extreme degree and tried to destroy it.
Galatians,1,14,"I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries among my people, because I was extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors."
Galatians,1,15,"But when God, who from my birth set me apart and called me by His grace, was pleased"
Galatians,1,16,"to reveal His Son in me, so that I could preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone."
Galatians,1,17,I did not go up to Jerusalem to those who had become apostles before me; instead I went to Arabia and came back to Damascus.
Galatians,1,18,"Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to get to know Cephas, and I stayed with him 15 days."
Galatians,1,19,"But I didn’t see any of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s brother."
Galatians,1,20,Now I am not lying in what I write to you. God is my witness.
Galatians,1,21,"Afterward, I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia."
Galatians,1,22,I remained personally unknown to the Judean churches in Christ;
Galatians,1,23,they simply kept hearing: “He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith he once tried to destroy.”
Galatians,1,24,And they glorified God because of me.
Galatians,2,1,"Then after 14 years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also."
Galatians,2,2,"I went up according to a revelation and presented to them the gospel I preach among the Gentiles—but privately to those recognized as leaders—so that I might not be running, or have run the race, in vain."
Galatians,2,3,"But not even Titus who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised."
Galatians,2,4,"This issue arose because of false brothers smuggled in, who came in secretly to spy on the freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, in order to enslave us."
Galatians,2,5,"But we did not give up and submit to these people for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would be preserved for you."
Galatians,2,6,Now from those recognized as important (what they really were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism)—they added nothing to me.
Galatians,2,7,"On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter was for the circumcised,"
Galatians,2,8,since the One at work in Peter for an apostleship to the circumcised was also at work in me for the Gentiles.
Galatians,2,9,"When James, Cephas, and John, recognized as pillars, acknowledged the grace that had been given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to me and Barnabas, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised."
Galatians,2,10,"They asked only that we would remember the poor, which I made every effort to do."
Galatians,2,11,"But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned."
Galatians,2,12,"For he regularly ate with the Gentiles before certain men came from James. However, when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, because he feared those from the circumcision party."
Galatians,2,13,"Then the rest of the Jews joined his hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy."
Galatians,2,14,"But when I saw that they were deviating from the truth of the gospel, I told Cephas in front of everyone, “If you, who are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel Gentiles to live like Jews?”"
Galatians,2,15,We who are Jews by birth and not “Gentile sinners”
Galatians,2,16,"know that no one is justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ. And we have believed in Christ Jesus so that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no human being will be justified."
Galatians,2,17,"But if we ourselves are also found to be “sinners” while seeking to be justified by Christ, is Christ then a promoter of sin? Absolutely not!"
Galatians,2,18,"If I rebuild the system I tore down, I show myself to be a lawbreaker."
Galatians,2,19,"For through the law I have died to the law, so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ"
Galatians,2,20,"and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me."
Galatians,2,21,"I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing."
Galatians,3,1,"You foolish Galatians! Who has hypnotized you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was vividly portrayed as crucified?"
Galatians,3,2,I only want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?
Galatians,3,3,"Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now going to be made complete by the flesh?"
Galatians,3,4,Did you suffer so much for nothing—if in fact it was for nothing?
Galatians,3,5,"So then, does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?"
Galatians,3,6,"Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness,"
Galatians,3,7,then understand that those who have faith are Abraham’s sons.
Galatians,3,8,"Now the Scripture saw in advance that God would justify the Gentiles by faith and told the good news ahead of time to Abraham, saying, All the nations will be blessed through you."
Galatians,3,9,"So those who have faith are blessed with Abraham, who had faith."
Galatians,3,10,"For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, because it is written: Everyone who does not continue doing everything written in the book of the law is cursed."
Galatians,3,11,"Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because the righteous will live by faith."
Galatians,3,12,"But the law is not based on faith; instead, the one who does these things will live by them."
Galatians,3,13,"Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, because it is written: Everyone who is hung on a tree is cursed."
Galatians,3,14,"The purpose was that the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles by Christ Jesus, so that we could receive the promised Spirit through faith."
Galatians,3,15,"Brothers, I’m using a human illustration. No one sets aside or makes additions to even a human covenant that has been ratified."
Galatians,3,16,"Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say “and to seeds,” as though referring to many, but referring to one, and to your seed, who is Christ."
Galatians,3,17,"And I say this: The law, which came 430 years later, does not revoke a covenant that was previously ratified by God and cancel the promise."
Galatians,3,18,"For if the inheritance is from the law, it is no longer from the promise; but God granted it to Abraham through the promise."
Galatians,3,19,Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise was made would come. The law was put into effect through angels by means of a mediator.
Galatians,3,20,"Now a mediator is not for just one person, but God is one."
Galatians,3,21,"Is the law therefore contrary to God’s promises? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, then righteousness would certainly be by the law."
Galatians,3,22,"But the Scripture has imprisoned everything under sin’s power, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe."
Galatians,3,23,"Before this faith came, we were confined under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith was revealed."
Galatians,3,24,"The law, then, was our guardian until Christ, so that we could be justified by faith."
Galatians,3,25,"But since that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian,"
Galatians,3,26,for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
Galatians,3,27,For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ like a garment.
Galatians,3,28,"There is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
Galatians,3,29,"And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to the promise."
Galatians,4,1,"Now I say that as long as the heir is a child, he differs in no way from a slave, though he is the owner of everything."
Galatians,4,2,"Instead, he is under guardians and stewards until the time set by his father."
Galatians,4,3,"In the same way we also, when we were children, were in slavery under the elemental forces of the world."
Galatians,4,4,"When the time came to completion, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the law,"
Galatians,4,5,"to redeem those under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons."
Galatians,4,6,"And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!”"
Galatians,4,7,"So you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God."
Galatians,4,8,"But in the past, when you didn’t know God, you were enslaved to things that by nature are not gods."
Galatians,4,9,"But now, since you know God, or rather have become known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and bankrupt elemental forces? Do you want to be enslaved to them all over again?"
Galatians,4,10,"You observe special days, months, seasons, and years."
Galatians,4,11,"I am fearful for you, that perhaps my labor for you has been wasted."
Galatians,4,12,"I beg you, brothers: Become like me, for I also became like you. You have not wronged me;"
Galatians,4,13,you know that previously I preached the gospel to you because of a physical illness.
Galatians,4,14,"You did not despise or reject me though my physical condition was a trial for you. On the contrary, you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus Himself."
Galatians,4,15,"What happened to this sense of being blessed you had? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me."
Galatians,4,16,Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?
Galatians,4,17,"They are enthusiastic about you, but not for any good. Instead, they want to isolate you so you will be enthusiastic about them."
Galatians,4,18,Now it is always good to be enthusiastic about good—and not just when I am with you.
Galatians,4,19,"My children, I am again suffering labor pains for you until Christ is formed in you."
Galatians,4,20,"I would like to be with you right now and change my tone of voice, because I don’t know what to do about you."
Galatians,4,21,"Tell me, those of you who want to be under the law, don’t you hear the law?"
Galatians,4,22,"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave and the other by a free woman."
Galatians,4,23,"But the one by the slave was born according to the impulse of the flesh, while the one by the free woman was born as the result of a promise."
Galatians,4,24,"These things are illustrations, for the women represent the two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai and bears children into slavery—this is Hagar."
Galatians,4,25,"Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children."
Galatians,4,26,"But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother."
Galatians,4,27,"For it is written: Rejoice, childless woman, who does not give birth. Burst into song and shout, you who are not in labor, for the children of the desolate are many, more numerous than those of the woman who has a husband."
Galatians,4,28,"Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise."
Galatians,4,29,"But just as then the child born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the Spirit, so also now."
Galatians,4,30,"But what does the Scripture say? Drive out the slave and her son, for the son of the slave will never be a coheir with the son of the free woman."
Galatians,4,31,"Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman."
Galatians,5,1,Christ has liberated us to be free. Stand firm then and don’t submit again to a yoke of slavery.
Galatians,5,2,"Take note! I, Paul, tell you that if you get yourselves circumcised, Christ will not benefit you at all."
Galatians,5,3,Again I testify to every man who gets himself circumcised that he is obligated to keep the entire law.
Galatians,5,4,You who are trying to be justified by the law are alienated from Christ; you have fallen from grace.
Galatians,5,5,"For through the Spirit, by faith, we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness."
Galatians,5,6,For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision accomplishes anything; what matters is faith working through love.
Galatians,5,7,You were running well. Who prevented you from obeying the truth?
Galatians,5,8,This persuasion did not come from the One who called you.
Galatians,5,9,A little yeast leavens the whole lump of dough.
Galatians,5,10,I have confidence in the Lord you will not accept any other view. But whoever it is that is confusing you will pay the penalty.
Galatians,5,11,"Now brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished."
Galatians,5,12,I wish those who are disturbing you might also get themselves castrated!
Galatians,5,13,"For you were called to be free, brothers; only don’t use this freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but serve one another through love."
Galatians,5,14,For the entire law is fulfilled in one statement: Love your neighbor as yourself.
Galatians,5,15,"But if you bite and devour one another, watch out, or you will be consumed by one another."
Galatians,5,16,"I say then, walk by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh."
Galatians,5,17,"For the flesh desires what is against the Spirit, and the Spirit desires what is against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you don’t do what you want."
Galatians,5,18,"But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law."
Galatians,5,19,"Now the works of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, moral impurity, promiscuity,"
Galatians,5,20,"idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambitions, dissensions, factions,"
Galatians,5,21,"envy, drunkenness, carousing, and anything similar. I tell you about these things in advance—as I told you before—that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God."
Galatians,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,"
Galatians,5,23,"gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law."
Galatians,5,24,Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
Galatians,5,25,"Since we live by the Spirit, we must also follow the Spirit."
Galatians,5,26,"We must not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another."
Galatians,6,1,"Brothers, if someone is caught in any wrongdoing, you who are spiritual should restore such a person with a gentle spirit, watching out for yourselves so you also won’t be tempted."
Galatians,6,2,Carry one another’s burdens; in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
Galatians,6,3,"For if anyone considers himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself."
Galatians,6,4,"But each person should examine his own work, and then he will have a reason for boasting in himself alone, and not in respect to someone else."
Galatians,6,5,For each person will have to carry his own load.
Galatians,6,6,The one who is taught the message must share all his good things with the teacher.
Galatians,6,7,"Don’t be deceived: God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows he will also reap,"
Galatians,6,8,"because the one who sows to his flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit."
Galatians,6,9,"So we must not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don’t give up."
Galatians,6,10,"Therefore, as we have opportunity, we must work for the good of all, especially for those who belong to the household of faith."
Galatians,6,11,Look at what large letters I use as I write to you in my own handwriting.
Galatians,6,12,Those who want to make a good impression in the flesh are the ones who would compel you to be circumcised—but only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.
Galatians,6,13,"For even the circumcised don’t keep the law themselves; however, they want you to be circumcised in order to boast about your flesh."
Galatians,6,14,"But as for me, I will never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. The world has been crucified to me through the cross, and I to the world."
Galatians,6,15,For both circumcision and uncircumcision mean nothing; what matters instead is a new creation.
Galatians,6,16,"May peace come to all those who follow this standard, and mercy to the Israel of God!"
Galatians,6,17,"From now on, let no one cause me trouble, because I bear on my body scars for the cause of Jesus."
Galatians,6,18,"Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
Ephesians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will: To the faithful saints in Christ Jesus at Ephesus."
Ephesians,1,2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians,1,3,"Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavens."
Ephesians,1,4,"For He chose us in Him, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless in His sight. In love"
Ephesians,1,5,"He predestined us to be adopted through Jesus Christ for Himself, according to His favor and will,"
Ephesians,1,6,to the praise of His glorious grace that He favored us with in the Beloved.
Ephesians,1,7,"We have redemption in Him through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace"
Ephesians,1,8,that He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.
Ephesians,1,9,"He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure that He planned in Him"
Ephesians,1,10,"for the administration of the days of fulfillment—to bring everything together in the Messiah, both things in heaven and things on earth in Him."
Ephesians,1,11,"We have also received an inheritance in Him, predestined according to the purpose of the One who works out everything in agreement with the decision of His will,"
Ephesians,1,12,so that we who had already put our hope in the Messiah might bring praise to His glory.
Ephesians,1,13,"When you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and when you believed in Him, you were also sealed with the promised Holy Spirit."
Ephesians,1,14,"He is the down payment of our inheritance, for the redemption of the possession, to the praise of His glory."
Ephesians,1,15,"This is why, since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,"
Ephesians,1,16,I never stop giving thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers.
Ephesians,1,17,"I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, would give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him."
Ephesians,1,18,"I pray that the perception of your mind may be enlightened so you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the glorious riches of His inheritance among the saints,"
Ephesians,1,19,"and what is the immeasurable greatness of His power to us who believe, according to the working of His vast strength."
Ephesians,1,20,He demonstrated this power in the Messiah by raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavens—
Ephesians,1,21,"far above every ruler and authority, power and dominion, and every title given, not only in this age but also in the one to come."
Ephesians,1,22,"And He put everything under His feet and appointed Him as head over everything for the church,"
Ephesians,1,23,"which is His body, the fullness of the One who fills all things in every way."
Ephesians,2,1,And you were dead in your trespasses and sins
Ephesians,2,2,"in which you previously walked according to the ways of this world, according to the ruler who exercises authority over the lower heavens, the spirit now working in the disobedient."
Ephesians,2,3,"We too all previously lived among them in our fleshly desires, carrying out the inclinations of our flesh and thoughts, and we were by nature children under wrath as the others were also."
Ephesians,2,4,"But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love that He had for us,"
Ephesians,2,5,made us alive with the Messiah even though we were dead in trespasses. You are saved by grace!
Ephesians,2,6,"Together with Christ Jesus He also raised us up and seated us in the heavens,"
Ephesians,2,7,so that in the coming ages He might display the immeasurable riches of His grace through His kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
Ephesians,2,8,"For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift—"
Ephesians,2,9,"not from works, so that no one can boast."
Ephesians,2,10,"For we are His creation, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time so that we should walk in them."
Ephesians,2,11,"So then, remember that at one time you were Gentiles in the flesh—called “the uncircumcised” by those called “the circumcised,” which is done in the flesh by human hands."
Ephesians,2,12,"At that time you were without the Messiah, excluded from the citizenship of Israel, and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world."
Ephesians,2,13,"But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away have been brought near by the blood of the Messiah."
Ephesians,2,14,"For He is our peace, who made both groups one and tore down the dividing wall of hostility. In His flesh,"
Ephesians,2,15,"He made of no effect the law consisting of commands and expressed in regulations, so that He might create in Himself one new man from the two, resulting in peace."
Ephesians,2,16,He did this so that He might reconcile both to God in one body through the cross and put the hostility to death by it.
Ephesians,2,17,"When the Messiah came, He proclaimed the good news of peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near."
Ephesians,2,18,For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.
Ephesians,2,19,"So then you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with the saints, and members of God’s household,"
Ephesians,2,20,"built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the cornerstone."
Ephesians,2,21,"The whole building, being put together by Him, grows into a holy sanctuary in the Lord."
Ephesians,2,22,You also are being built together for God’s dwelling in the Spirit.
Ephesians,3,1,"For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles—"
Ephesians,3,2,"you have heard, haven’t you, about the administration of God’s grace that He gave to me for you?"
Ephesians,3,3,"The mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have briefly written above."
Ephesians,3,4,By reading this you are able to understand my insight about the mystery of the Messiah.
Ephesians,3,5,This was not made known to people in other generations as it is now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit:
Ephesians,3,6,"The Gentiles are coheirs, members of the same body, and partners of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel."
Ephesians,3,7,I was made a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace that was given to me by the working of His power.
Ephesians,3,8,"This grace was given to me—the least of all the saints—to proclaim to the Gentiles the incalculable riches of the Messiah,"
Ephesians,3,9,and to shed light for all about the administration of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things.
Ephesians,3,10,This is so God’s multi-faceted wisdom may now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavens.
Ephesians,3,11,"This is according to His eternal purpose accomplished in the Messiah, Jesus our Lord."
Ephesians,3,12,In Him we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him.
Ephesians,3,13,"So then I ask you not to be discouraged over my afflictions on your behalf, for they are your glory."
Ephesians,3,14,For this reason I kneel before the Father
Ephesians,3,15,from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named.
Ephesians,3,16,"I pray that He may grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power in the inner man through His Spirit,"
Ephesians,3,17,"and that the Messiah may dwell in your hearts through faith. I pray that you, being rooted and firmly established in love,"
Ephesians,3,18,"may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the length and width, height and depth of God’s love,"
Ephesians,3,19,"and to know the Messiah’s love that surpasses knowledge, so you may be filled with all the fullness of God."
Ephesians,3,20,Now to Him who is able to do above and beyond all that we ask or think according to the power that works in us—
Ephesians,3,21,"to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen."
Ephesians,4,1,"Therefore I, the prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk worthy of the calling you have received,"
Ephesians,4,2,"with all humility and gentleness, with patience, accepting one another in love,"
Ephesians,4,3,diligently keeping the unity of the Spirit with the peace that binds us.
Ephesians,4,4,There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to one hope at your calling—
Ephesians,4,5,"one Lord, one faith, one baptism,"
Ephesians,4,6,"one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in all."
Ephesians,4,7,Now grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of the Messiah’s gift.
Ephesians,4,8,"For it says: When He ascended on high, He took prisoners into captivity; He gave gifts to people."
Ephesians,4,9,But what does “He ascended” mean except that He descended to the lower parts of the earth?
Ephesians,4,10,"The One who descended is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things."
Ephesians,4,11,"And He personally gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers,"
Ephesians,4,12,"for the training of the saints in the work of ministry, to build up the body of Christ,"
Ephesians,4,13,"until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of God’s Son, growing into a mature man with a stature measured by Christ’s fullness."
Ephesians,4,14,"Then we will no longer be little children, tossed by the waves and blown around by every wind of teaching, by human cunning with cleverness in the techniques of deceit."
Ephesians,4,15,"But speaking the truth in love, let us grow in every way into Him who is the head—Christ."
Ephesians,4,16,"From Him the whole body, fitted and knit together by every supporting ligament, promotes the growth of the body for building up itself in love by the proper working of each individual part."
Ephesians,4,17,"Therefore, I say this and testify in the Lord: You should no longer walk as the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their thoughts."
Ephesians,4,18,"They are darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them and because of the hardness of their hearts."
Ephesians,4,19,They became callous and gave themselves over to promiscuity for the practice of every kind of impurity with a desire for more and more.
Ephesians,4,20,"But that is not how you learned about the Messiah,"
Ephesians,4,21,"assuming you heard about Him and were taught by Him, because the truth is in Jesus."
Ephesians,4,22,"You took off your former way of life, the old self that is corrupted by deceitful desires;"
Ephesians,4,23,you are being renewed in the spirit of your minds;
Ephesians,4,24,"you put on the new self, the one created according to God’s likeness in righteousness and purity of the truth."
Ephesians,4,25,"Since you put away lying, Speak the truth, each one to his neighbor, because we are members of one another."
Ephesians,4,26,"Be angry and do not sin. Don’t let the sun go down on your anger,"
Ephesians,4,27,and don’t give the Devil an opportunity.
Ephesians,4,28,"The thief must no longer steal. Instead, he must do honest work with his own hands, so that he has something to share with anyone in need."
Ephesians,4,29,"No foul language is to come from your mouth, but only what is good for building up someone in need, so that it gives grace to those who hear."
Ephesians,4,30,And don’t grieve God’s Holy Spirit. You were sealed by Him for the day of redemption.
Ephesians,4,31,"All bitterness, anger and wrath, shouting and slander must be removed from you, along with all malice."
Ephesians,4,32,"And be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving one another, just as God also forgave you in Christ."
Ephesians,5,1,"Therefore, be imitators of God, as dearly loved children."
Ephesians,5,2,"And walk in love, as the Messiah also loved us and gave Himself for us, a sacrificial and fragrant offering to God."
Ephesians,5,3,"But sexual immorality and any impurity or greed should not even be heard of among you, as is proper for saints."
Ephesians,5,4,"Coarse and foolish talking or crude joking are not suitable, but rather giving thanks."
Ephesians,5,5,"For know and recognize this: Every sexually immoral or impure or greedy person, who is an idolater, does not have an inheritance in the kingdom of the Messiah and of God."
Ephesians,5,6,"Let no one deceive you with empty arguments, for God’s wrath is coming on the disobedient because of these things."
Ephesians,5,7,"Therefore, do not become their partners."
Ephesians,5,8,"For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light—"
Ephesians,5,9,"for the fruit of the light results in all goodness, righteousness, and truth—"
Ephesians,5,10,discerning what is pleasing to the Lord.
Ephesians,5,11,"Don’t participate in the fruitless works of darkness, but instead expose them."
Ephesians,5,12,For it is shameful even to mention what is done by them in secret.
Ephesians,5,13,"Everything exposed by the light is made clear,"
Ephesians,5,14,"for what makes everything clear is light. Therefore it is said: Get up, sleeper, and rise up from the dead, and the Messiah will shine on you."
Ephesians,5,15,"Pay careful attention, then, to how you walk—not as unwise people but as wise—"
Ephesians,5,16,"making the most of the time, because the days are evil."
Ephesians,5,17,"So don’t be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is."
Ephesians,5,18,"And don’t get drunk with wine, which leads to reckless actions, but be filled by the Spirit:"
Ephesians,5,19,"speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music from your heart to the Lord,"
Ephesians,5,20,"giving thanks always for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
Ephesians,5,21,submitting to one another in the fear of Christ.
Ephesians,5,22,"Wives, submit to your own husbands as to the Lord,"
Ephesians,5,23,for the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church. He is the Savior of the body.
Ephesians,5,24,"Now as the church submits to Christ, so wives are to submit to their husbands in everything."
Ephesians,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself for her"
Ephesians,5,26,"to make her holy, cleansing her with the washing of water by the word."
Ephesians,5,27,"He did this to present the church to Himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or anything like that, but holy and blameless."
Ephesians,5,28,"In the same way, husbands are to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself."
Ephesians,5,29,"For no one ever hates his own flesh but provides and cares for it, just as Christ does for the church,"
Ephesians,5,30,since we are members of His body.
Ephesians,5,31,"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
Ephesians,5,32,"This mystery is profound, but I am talking about Christ and the church."
Ephesians,5,33,"To sum up, each one of you is to love his wife as himself, and the wife is to respect her husband."
Ephesians,6,1,"Children, obey your parents as you would the Lord, because this is right."
Ephesians,6,2,"Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise,"
Ephesians,6,3,so that it may go well with you and that you may have a long life in the land.
Ephesians,6,4,"Fathers, don’t stir up anger in your children, but bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord."
Ephesians,6,5,"Slaves, obey your human masters with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ."
Ephesians,6,6,"Don’t work only while being watched, in order to please men, but as slaves of Christ, do God’s will from your heart."
Ephesians,6,7,"Serve with a good attitude, as to the Lord and not to men,"
Ephesians,6,8,"knowing that whatever good each one does, slave or free, he will receive this back from the Lord."
Ephesians,6,9,"And masters, treat your slaves the same way, without threatening them, because you know that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with Him."
Ephesians,6,10,"Finally, be strengthened by the Lord and by His vast strength."
Ephesians,6,11,Put on the full armor of God so that you can stand against the tactics of the Devil.
Ephesians,6,12,"For our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world powers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavens."
Ephesians,6,13,"This is why you must take up the full armor of God, so that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having prepared everything, to take your stand."
Ephesians,6,14,"Stand, therefore, with truth like a belt around your waist, righteousness like armor on your chest,"
Ephesians,6,15,and your feet sandaled with readiness for the gospel of peace.
Ephesians,6,16,"In every situation take the shield of faith, and with it you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one."
Ephesians,6,17,"Take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is God’s word."
Ephesians,6,18,"Pray at all times in the Spirit with every prayer and request, and stay alert in this with all perseverance and intercession for all the saints."
Ephesians,6,19,"Pray also for me, that the message may be given to me when I open my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel."
Ephesians,6,20,For this I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I might be bold enough in Him to speak as I should.
Ephesians,6,21,"Tychicus, our dearly loved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you all the news about me so that you may be informed."
Ephesians,6,22,"I am sending him to you for this very reason, to let you know how we are and to encourage your hearts."
Ephesians,6,23,"Peace to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
Ephesians,6,24,Grace be with all who have undying love for our Lord Jesus Christ.
Philippians,1,1,"Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus: To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons."
Philippians,1,2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philippians,1,3,"I give thanks to my God for every remembrance of you,"
Philippians,1,4,"always praying with joy for all of you in my every prayer,"
Philippians,1,5,because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.
Philippians,1,6,"I am sure of this, that He who started a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus."
Philippians,1,7,"It is right for me to think this way about all of you, because I have you in my heart, and you are all partners with me in grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and establishment of the gospel."
Philippians,1,8,"For God is my witness, how deeply I miss all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus."
Philippians,1,9,"And I pray this: that your love will keep on growing in knowledge and every kind of discernment,"
Philippians,1,10,"so that you can approve the things that are superior and can be pure and blameless in the day of Christ,"
Philippians,1,11,filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.
Philippians,1,12,"Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has actually resulted in the advance of the gospel,"
Philippians,1,13,"so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard, and to everyone else, that my imprisonment is in the cause of Christ."
Philippians,1,14,Most of the brothers in the Lord have gained confidence from my imprisonment and dare even more to speak the message fearlessly.
Philippians,1,15,"To be sure, some preach Christ out of envy and strife, but others out of good will."
Philippians,1,16,"These do so out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel;"
Philippians,1,17,"the others proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely, seeking to cause me anxiety in my imprisonment."
Philippians,1,18,"What does it matter? Just that in every way, whether out of false motives or true, Christ is proclaimed. And in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice"
Philippians,1,19,because I know this will lead to my deliverance through your prayers and help from the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
Philippians,1,20,"My eager expectation and hope is that I will not be ashamed about anything, but that now as always, with all boldness, Christ will be highly honored in my body, whether by life or by death."
Philippians,1,21,"For me, living is Christ and dying is gain."
Philippians,1,22,"Now if I live on in the flesh, this means fruitful work for me; and I don’t know which one I should choose."
Philippians,1,23,I am pressured by both. I have the desire to depart and be with Christ—which is far better—
Philippians,1,24,but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you.
Philippians,1,25,"Since I am persuaded of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,"
Philippians,1,26,"so that, because of me, your confidence may grow in Christ Jesus when I come to you again."
Philippians,1,27,"Just one thing: Live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or am absent, I will hear about you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind, working side by side for the faith that comes from the gospel,"
Philippians,1,28,"not being frightened in any way by your opponents. This is a sign of destruction for them, but of your deliverance—and this is from God."
Philippians,1,29,"For it has been given to you on Christ’s behalf not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for Him,"
Philippians,1,30,having the same struggle that you saw I had and now hear that I have.
Philippians,2,1,"If then there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any affection and mercy,"
Philippians,2,2,"fulfill my joy by thinking the same way, having the same love, sharing the same feelings, focusing on one goal."
Philippians,2,3,"Do nothing out of rivalry or conceit, but in humility consider others as more important than yourselves."
Philippians,2,4,"Everyone should look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others."
Philippians,2,5,"Make your own attitude that of Christ Jesus,"
Philippians,2,6,"who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God as something to be used for His own advantage."
Philippians,2,7,"Instead He emptied Himself by assuming the form of a slave, taking on the likeness of men. And when He had come as a man in His external form,"
Philippians,2,8,He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death— even to death on a cross.
Philippians,2,9,"For this reason God highly exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name,"
Philippians,2,10,so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow— of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth—
Philippians,2,11,"and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
Philippians,2,12,"So then, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now even more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
Philippians,2,13,"For it is God who is working in you, enabling you both to desire and to work out His good purpose."
Philippians,2,14,"Do everything without grumbling and arguing,"
Philippians,2,15,"so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God who are faultless in a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine like stars in the world."
Philippians,2,16,Hold firmly to the message of life. Then I can boast in the day of Christ that I didn’t run or labor for nothing.
Philippians,2,17,"But even if I am poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you."
Philippians,2,18,In the same way you should also be glad and rejoice with me.
Philippians,2,19,Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon so that I also may be encouraged when I hear news about you.
Philippians,2,20,For I have no one else like-minded who will genuinely care about your interests;
Philippians,2,21,"all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ."
Philippians,2,22,"But you know his proven character, because he has served with me in the gospel ministry like a son with a father."
Philippians,2,23,"Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with me."
Philippians,2,24,I am convinced in the Lord that I myself will also come quickly.
Philippians,2,25,"But I considered it necessary to send you Epaphroditus—my brother, coworker, and fellow soldier, as well as your messenger and minister to my need—"
Philippians,2,26,since he has been longing for all of you and was distressed because you heard that he was sick.
Philippians,2,27,"Indeed, he was so sick that he nearly died. However, God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have one grief on top of another."
Philippians,2,28,"For this reason, I am very eager to send him so that you may rejoice when you see him again and I may be less anxious."
Philippians,2,29,"Therefore, welcome him in the Lord with all joy and hold men like him in honor,"
Philippians,2,30,"because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up what was lacking in your ministry to me."
Philippians,3,1,"Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write to you again about this is no trouble for me and is a protection for you."
Philippians,3,2,"Watch out for “dogs,” watch out for evil workers, watch out for those who mutilate the flesh."
Philippians,3,3,"For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God, boast in Christ Jesus, and do not put confidence in the flesh—"
Philippians,3,4,"although I once also had confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, I have more:"
Philippians,3,5,"circumcised the eighth day; of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; regarding the law, a Pharisee;"
Philippians,3,6,"regarding zeal, persecuting the church; regarding the righteousness that is in the law, blameless."
Philippians,3,7,"But everything that was a gain to me, I have considered to be a loss because of Christ."
Philippians,3,8,"More than that, I also consider everything to be a loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. Because of Him I have suffered the loss of all things and consider them filth, so that I may gain Christ"
Philippians,3,9,"and be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own from the law, but one that is through faith in Christ—the righteousness from God based on faith."
Philippians,3,10,"My goal is to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,"
Philippians,3,11,assuming that I will somehow reach the resurrection from among the dead.
Philippians,3,12,"Not that I have already reached the goal or am already fully mature, but I make every effort to take hold of it because I also have been taken hold of by Christ Jesus."
Philippians,3,13,"Brothers, I do not consider myself to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and reaching forward to what is ahead,"
Philippians,3,14,I pursue as my goal the prize promised by God’s heavenly call in Christ Jesus.
Philippians,3,15,"Therefore, all who are mature should think this way. And if you think differently about anything, God will reveal this also to you."
Philippians,3,16,"In any case, we should live up to whatever truth we have attained."
Philippians,3,17,"Join in imitating me, brothers, and observe those who live according to the example you have in us."
Philippians,3,18,"For I have often told you, and now say again with tears, that many live as enemies of the cross of Christ."
Philippians,3,19,"Their end is destruction; their god is their stomach; their glory is in their shame. They are focused on earthly things,"
Philippians,3,20,"but our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ."
Philippians,3,21,"He will transform the body of our humble condition into the likeness of His glorious body, by the power that enables Him to subject everything to Himself."
Philippians,4,1,"So then, my brothers, you are dearly loved and longed for—my joy and crown. In this manner stand firm in the Lord, dear friends."
Philippians,4,2,I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to agree in the Lord.
Philippians,4,3,"Yes, I also ask you, true partner, to help these women who have contended for the gospel at my side, along with Clement and the rest of my coworkers whose names are in the book of life."
Philippians,4,4,Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!
Philippians,4,5,Let your graciousness be known to everyone. The Lord is near.
Philippians,4,6,"Don’t worry about anything, but in everything, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God."
Philippians,4,7,"And the peace of God, which surpasses every thought, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus."
Philippians,4,8,"Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable—if there is any moral excellence and if there is any praise—dwell on these things."
Philippians,4,9,"Do what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you."
Philippians,4,10,"I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that once again you renewed your care for me. You were, in fact, concerned about me but lacked the opportunity to show it."
Philippians,4,11,"I don’t say this out of need, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am."
Philippians,4,12,"I know both how to have a little, and I know how to have a lot. In any and all circumstances I have learned the secret of being content—whether well fed or hungry, whether in abundance or in need."
Philippians,4,13,I am able to do all things through Him who strengthens me.
Philippians,4,14,"Still, you did well by sharing with me in my hardship."
Philippians,4,15,"And you Philippians know that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone."
Philippians,4,16,For even in Thessalonica you sent gifts for my need several times.
Philippians,4,17,"Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the profit that is increasing to your account."
Philippians,4,18,"But I have received everything in full, and I have an abundance. I am fully supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you provided—a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God."
Philippians,4,19,And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
Philippians,4,20,Now to our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.
Philippians,4,21,Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. Those brothers who are with me greet you.
Philippians,4,22,"All the saints greet you, but especially those from Caesar’s household."
Philippians,4,23,The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Colossians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will, and Timothy our brother:"
Colossians,1,2,"To the saints in Christ at Colossae, who are faithful brothers. Grace to you and peace from God our Father."
Colossians,1,3,"We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,"
Colossians,1,4,for we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints
Colossians,1,5,"because of the hope reserved for you in heaven. You have already heard about this hope in the message of truth, the gospel"
Colossians,1,6,"that has come to you. It is bearing fruit and growing all over the world, just as it has among you since the day you heard it and recognized God’s grace in the truth."
Colossians,1,7,"You learned this from Epaphras, our dearly loved fellow slave. He is a faithful servant of the Messiah on your behalf,"
Colossians,1,8,and he has told us about your love in the Spirit.
Colossians,1,9,"For this reason also, since the day we heard this, we haven’t stopped praying for you. We are asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,"
Colossians,1,10,"so that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to Him, bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God."
Colossians,1,11,"May you be strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for all endurance and patience, with joy"
Colossians,1,12,"giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the saints’ inheritance in the light."
Colossians,1,13,He has rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son He loves.
Colossians,1,14,"We have redemption, the forgiveness of sins, in Him."
Colossians,1,15,"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation."
Colossians,1,16,"For everything was created by Him, in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities— all things have been created through Him and for Him."
Colossians,1,17,"He is before all things, and by Him all things hold together."
Colossians,1,18,"He is also the head of the body, the church; He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He might come to have first place in everything."
Colossians,1,19,"For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him,"
Colossians,1,20,and through Him to reconcile everything to Himself by making peace through the blood of His cross— whether things on earth or things in heaven.
Colossians,1,21,Once you were alienated and hostile in your minds because of your evil actions.
Colossians,1,22,"But now He has reconciled you by His physical body through His death, to present you holy, faultless, and blameless before Him—"
Colossians,1,23,"if indeed you remain grounded and steadfast in the faith and are not shifted away from the hope of the gospel that you heard. This gospel has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and I, Paul, have become a servant of it."
Colossians,1,24,"Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and I am completing in my flesh what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for His body, that is, the church."
Colossians,1,25,"I have become its servant, according to God’s administration that was given to me for you, to make God’s message fully known,"
Colossians,1,26,the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to His saints.
Colossians,1,27,"God wanted to make known among the Gentiles the glorious wealth of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."
Colossians,1,28,"We proclaim Him, warning and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ."
Colossians,1,29,"I labor for this, striving with His strength that works powerfully in me."
Colossians,2,1,"For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you, for those in Laodicea, and for all who have not seen me in person."
Colossians,2,2,"I want their hearts to be encouraged and joined together in love, so that they may have all the riches of assured understanding and have the knowledge of God’s mystery—Christ."
Colossians,2,3,All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Him.
Colossians,2,4,I am saying this so that no one will deceive you with persuasive arguments.
Colossians,2,5,"For I may be absent in body, but I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see how well ordered you are and the strength of your faith in Christ."
Colossians,2,6,"Therefore, as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him,"
Colossians,2,7,"rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, overflowing with gratitude."
Colossians,2,8,"Be careful that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit based on human tradition, based on the elemental forces of the world, and not based on Christ."
Colossians,2,9,"For the entire fullness of God’s nature dwells bodily in Christ,"
Colossians,2,10,"and you have been filled by Him, who is the head over every ruler and authority."
Colossians,2,11,"You were also circumcised in Him with a circumcision not done with hands, by putting off the body of flesh, in the circumcision of the Messiah."
Colossians,2,12,"Having been buried with Him in baptism, you were also raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead."
Colossians,2,13,"And when you were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive with Him and forgave us all our trespasses."
Colossians,2,14,"He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the cross."
Colossians,2,15,He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; He triumphed over them by Him.
Colossians,2,16,"Therefore, don’t let anyone judge you in regard to food and drink or in the matter of a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day."
Colossians,2,17,These are a shadow of what was to come; the substance is the Messiah.
Colossians,2,18,"Let no one disqualify you, insisting on ascetic practices and the worship of angels, claiming access to a visionary realm and inflated without cause by his unspiritual mind."
Colossians,2,19,"He doesn’t hold on to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and held together by its ligaments and tendons, develops with growth from God."
Colossians,2,20,"If you died with the Messiah to the elemental forces of this world, why do you live as if you still belonged to the world? Why do you submit to regulations:"
Colossians,2,21,"“Don’t handle, don’t taste, don’t touch”?"
Colossians,2,22,All these regulations refer to what is destroyed by being used up; they are commands and doctrines of men.
Colossians,2,23,"Although these have a reputation of wisdom by promoting ascetic practices, humility, and severe treatment of the body, they are not of any value in curbing self-indulgence."
Colossians,3,1,"So if you have been raised with the Messiah, seek what is above, where the Messiah is, seated at the right hand of God."
Colossians,3,2,"Set your minds on what is above, not on what is on the earth."
Colossians,3,3,"For you have died, and your life is hidden with the Messiah in God."
Colossians,3,4,"When the Messiah, who is your life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory."
Colossians,3,5,"Therefore, put to death what belongs to your worldly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry."
Colossians,3,6,"Because of these, God’s wrath comes on the disobedient,"
Colossians,3,7,and you once walked in these things when you were living in them.
Colossians,3,8,"But now you must also put away all the following: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and filthy language from your mouth."
Colossians,3,9,"Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old self with its practices"
Colossians,3,10,and have put on the new self. You are being renewed in knowledge according to the image of your Creator.
Colossians,3,11,"In Christ there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but Christ is all and in all."
Colossians,3,12,"Therefore, God’s chosen ones, holy and loved, put on heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,"
Colossians,3,13,"accepting one another and forgiving one another if anyone has a complaint against another. Just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you must also forgive."
Colossians,3,14,"Above all, put on love—the perfect bond of unity."
Colossians,3,15,"And let the peace of the Messiah, to which you were also called in one body, control your hearts. Be thankful."
Colossians,3,16,"Let the message about the Messiah dwell richly among you, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, and singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, with gratitude in your hearts to God."
Colossians,3,17,"And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him."
Colossians,3,18,"Wives, be submissive to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord."
Colossians,3,19,"Husbands, love your wives and don’t be bitter toward them."
Colossians,3,20,"Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord."
Colossians,3,21,"Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so they won’t become discouraged."
Colossians,3,22,"Slaves, obey your human masters in everything. Don’t work only while being watched, in order to please men, but work wholeheartedly, fearing the Lord."
Colossians,3,23,"Whatever you do, do it enthusiastically, as something done for the Lord and not for men,"
Colossians,3,24,knowing that you will receive the reward of an inheritance from the Lord. You serve the Lord Christ.
Colossians,3,25,"For the wrongdoer will be paid back for whatever wrong he has done, and there is no favoritism."
Colossians,4,1,"Masters, supply your slaves with what is right and fair, since you know that you too have a Master in heaven."
Colossians,4,2,Devote yourselves to prayer; stay alert in it with thanksgiving.
Colossians,4,3,"At the same time, pray also for us that God may open a door to us for the message, to speak the mystery of the Messiah, for which I am in prison,"
Colossians,4,4,so that I may reveal it as I am required to speak.
Colossians,4,5,"Act wisely toward outsiders, making the most of the time."
Colossians,4,6,"Your speech should always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you should answer each person."
Colossians,4,7,"Tychicus, our dearly loved brother, faithful servant, and fellow slave in the Lord, will tell you all the news about me."
Colossians,4,8,"I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know how we are and so that he may encourage your hearts."
Colossians,4,9,"He is with Onesimus, a faithful and dearly loved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you about everything here."
Colossians,4,10,"Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, as does Mark, Barnabas’s cousin (concerning whom you have received instructions: if he comes to you, welcome him),"
Colossians,4,11,"and so does Jesus who is called Justus. These alone of the circumcision are my coworkers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me."
Colossians,4,12,"Epaphras, who is one of you, a slave of Christ Jesus, greets you. He is always contending for you in his prayers, so that you can stand mature and fully assured in everything God wills."
Colossians,4,13,"For I testify about him that he works hard for you, for those in Laodicea, and for those in Hierapolis."
Colossians,4,14,"Luke, the dearly loved physician, and Demas greet you."
Colossians,4,15,"Give my greetings to the brothers in Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her home."
Colossians,4,16,"When this letter has been read among you, have it read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea."
Colossians,4,17,"And tell Archippus, “Pay attention to the ministry you have received in the Lord, so that you can accomplish it.”"
Colossians,4,18,This greeting is in my own hand—Paul. Remember my imprisonment. Grace be with you.
1 Thessalonians,1,1,"Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy: To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you and peace."
1 Thessalonians,1,2,"We always thank God for all of you, remembering you constantly in our prayers."
1 Thessalonians,1,3,"We recall, in the presence of our God and Father, your work of faith, labor of love, and endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ,"
1 Thessalonians,1,4,"knowing your election, brothers loved by God."
1 Thessalonians,1,5,"For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, in the Holy Spirit, and with much assurance. You know what kind of men we were among you for your benefit,"
1 Thessalonians,1,6,"and you became imitators of us and of the Lord when, in spite of severe persecution, you welcomed the message with joy from the Holy Spirit."
1 Thessalonians,1,7,"As a result, you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia."
1 Thessalonians,1,8,"For the Lord’s message rang out from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place that your faith in God has gone out. Therefore, we don’t need to say anything,"
1 Thessalonians,1,9,for they themselves report what kind of reception we had from you: how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God
1 Thessalonians,1,10,"and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead—Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath."
1 Thessalonians,2,1,"For you yourselves know, brothers, that our visit with you was not without result."
1 Thessalonians,2,2,"On the contrary, after we had previously suffered, and we were treated outrageously in Philippi, as you know, we were emboldened by our God to speak the gospel of God to you in spite of great opposition."
1 Thessalonians,2,3,For our exhortation didn’t come from error or impurity or an intent to deceive.
1 Thessalonians,2,4,"Instead, just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please men, but rather God, who examines our hearts."
1 Thessalonians,2,5,"For we never used flattering speech, as you know, or had greedy motives—God is our witness—"
1 Thessalonians,2,6,"and we didn’t seek glory from people, either from you or from others."
1 Thessalonians,2,7,"Although we could have been a burden as Christ’s apostles, instead we were gentle among you, as a nursing mother nurtures her own children."
1 Thessalonians,2,8,"We cared so much for you that we were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us."
1 Thessalonians,2,9,"For you remember our labor and hardship, brothers. Working night and day so that we would not burden any of you, we preached God’s gospel to you."
1 Thessalonians,2,10,"You are witnesses, and so is God, of how devoutly, righteously, and blamelessly we conducted ourselves with you believers."
1 Thessalonians,2,11,"As you know, like a father with his own children,"
1 Thessalonians,2,12,"we encouraged, comforted, and implored each one of you to walk worthy of God, who calls you into His own kingdom and glory."
1 Thessalonians,2,13,"This is why we constantly thank God, because when you received the message about God that you heard from us, you welcomed it not as a human message, but as it truly is, the message of God, which also works effectively in you believers."
1 Thessalonians,2,14,"For you, brothers, became imitators of God’s churches in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, since you have also suffered the same things from people of your own country, just as they did from the Jews"
1 Thessalonians,2,15,"who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and persecuted us; they displease God and are hostile to everyone,"
1 Thessalonians,2,16,"hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. As a result, they are always completing the number of their sins, and wrath has overtaken them at last."
1 Thessalonians,2,17,"But as for us, brothers, after we were forced to leave you for a short time (in person, not in heart), we greatly desired and made every effort to return and see you face to face."
1 Thessalonians,2,18,"So we wanted to come to you—even I, Paul, time and again—but Satan hindered us."
1 Thessalonians,2,19,For who is our hope or joy or crown of boasting in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming? Is it not you?
1 Thessalonians,2,20,For you are our glory and joy!
1 Thessalonians,3,1,"Therefore, when we could no longer stand it, we thought it was better to be left alone in Athens."
1 Thessalonians,3,2,"And we sent Timothy, our brother and God’s coworker in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you concerning your faith,"
1 Thessalonians,3,3,so that no one will be shaken by these persecutions. For you yourselves know that we are appointed to this.
1 Thessalonians,3,4,"In fact, when we were with you, we told you previously that we were going to suffer persecution, and as you know, it happened."
1 Thessalonians,3,5,"For this reason, when I could no longer stand it, I also sent him to find out about your faith, fearing that the tempter had tempted you and that our labor might be for nothing."
1 Thessalonians,3,6,"But now Timothy has come to us from you and brought us good news about your faith and love and reported that you always have good memories of us, wanting to see us, as we also want to see you."
1 Thessalonians,3,7,"Therefore, brothers, in all our distress and persecution, we were encouraged about you through your faith."
1 Thessalonians,3,8,"For now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord."
1 Thessalonians,3,9,"How can we thank God for you in return for all the joy we experience before our God because of you,"
1 Thessalonians,3,10,as we pray very earnestly night and day to see you face to face and to complete what is lacking in your faith?
1 Thessalonians,3,11,"Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you."
1 Thessalonians,3,12,"And may the Lord cause you to increase and overflow with love for one another and for everyone, just as we also do for you."
1 Thessalonians,3,13,May He make your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints. Amen.
1 Thessalonians,4,1,"Finally then, brothers, we ask and encourage you in the Lord Jesus, that as you have received from us how you must walk and please God—as you are doing—do so even more."
1 Thessalonians,4,2,For you know what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians,4,3,"For this is God’s will, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality,"
1 Thessalonians,4,4,"so that each of you knows how to control his own body in sanctification and honor,"
1 Thessalonians,4,5,"not with lustful desires, like the Gentiles who don’t know God."
1 Thessalonians,4,6,"This means one must not transgress against and defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger of all these offenses, as we also previously told and warned you."
1 Thessalonians,4,7,For God has not called us to impurity but to sanctification.
1 Thessalonians,4,8,"Therefore, the person who rejects this does not reject man, but God, who also gives you His Holy Spirit."
1 Thessalonians,4,9,About brotherly love: You don’t need me to write you because you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.
1 Thessalonians,4,10,"In fact, you are doing this toward all the brothers in the entire region of Macedonia. But we encourage you, brothers, to do so even more,"
1 Thessalonians,4,11,"to seek to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you,"
1 Thessalonians,4,12,so that you may walk properly in the presence of outsiders and not be dependent on anyone.
1 Thessalonians,4,13,"We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, concerning those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve like the rest, who have no hope."
1 Thessalonians,4,14,"Since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, in the same way God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus."
1 Thessalonians,4,15,For we say this to you by a revelation from the Lord: We who are still alive at the Lord’s coming will certainly have no advantage over those who have fallen asleep.
1 Thessalonians,4,16,"For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the archangel’s voice, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first."
1 Thessalonians,4,17,Then we who are still alive will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so we will always be with the Lord.
1 Thessalonians,4,18,Therefore encourage one another with these words.
1 Thessalonians,5,1,"About the times and the seasons: Brothers, you do not need anything to be written to you."
1 Thessalonians,5,2,For you yourselves know very well that the Day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night.
1 Thessalonians,5,3,"When they say, “Peace and security,” then sudden destruction comes on them, like labor pains come on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape."
1 Thessalonians,5,4,"But you, brothers, are not in the dark, for this day to overtake you like a thief."
1 Thessalonians,5,5,For you are all sons of light and sons of the day. We do not belong to the night or the darkness.
1 Thessalonians,5,6,"So then, we must not sleep, like the rest, but we must stay awake and be serious."
1 Thessalonians,5,7,"For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night."
1 Thessalonians,5,8,"But since we belong to the day, we must be serious and put the armor of faith and love on our chests, and put on a helmet of the hope of salvation."
1 Thessalonians,5,9,"For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,"
1 Thessalonians,5,10,"who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with Him."
1 Thessalonians,5,11,Therefore encourage one another and build each other up as you are already doing.
1 Thessalonians,5,12,"Now we ask you, brothers, to give recognition to those who labor among you and lead you in the Lord and admonish you,"
1 Thessalonians,5,13,and to regard them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.
1 Thessalonians,5,14,"And we exhort you, brothers: warn those who are irresponsible, comfort the discouraged, help the weak, be patient with everyone."
1 Thessalonians,5,15,"See to it that no one repays evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good for one another and for all."
1 Thessalonians,5,16,Rejoice always!
1 Thessalonians,5,17,Pray constantly.
1 Thessalonians,5,18,"Give thanks in everything, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus."
1 Thessalonians,5,19,Don’t stifle the Spirit.
1 Thessalonians,5,20,"Don’t despise prophecies,"
1 Thessalonians,5,21,but test all things. Hold on to what is good.
1 Thessalonians,5,22,Stay away from every kind of evil.
1 Thessalonians,5,23,"Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely. And may your spirit, soul, and body be kept sound and blameless for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Thessalonians,5,24,"He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it."
1 Thessalonians,5,25,"Brothers, pray for us also."
1 Thessalonians,5,26,Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
1 Thessalonians,5,27,I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the brothers.
1 Thessalonians,5,28,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
2 Thessalonians,1,1,"Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy: To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,1,2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians,1,3,"We must always thank God for you, brothers. This is right, since your faith is flourishing and the love each one of you has for one another is increasing."
2 Thessalonians,1,4,"Therefore, we ourselves boast about you among God’s churches—about your endurance and faith in all the persecutions and afflictions you endure."
2 Thessalonians,1,5,"It is a clear evidence of God’s righteous judgment that you will be counted worthy of God’s kingdom, for which you also are suffering,"
2 Thessalonians,1,6,since it is righteous for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you
2 Thessalonians,1,7,"and to reward with rest you who are afflicted, along with us. This will take place at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with His powerful angels,"
2 Thessalonians,1,8,taking vengeance with flaming fire on those who don’t know God and on those who don’t obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
2 Thessalonians,1,9,These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction from the Lord’s presence and from His glorious strength
2 Thessalonians,1,10,"in that day when He comes to be glorified by His saints and to be admired by all those who have believed, because our testimony among you was believed."
2 Thessalonians,1,11,"And in view of this, we always pray for you that our God will consider you worthy of His calling, and will, by His power, fulfill every desire for goodness and the work of faith,"
2 Thessalonians,1,12,"so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified by you, and you by Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,2,1,"Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to Him: We ask you, brothers,"
2 Thessalonians,2,2,"not to be easily upset in mind or troubled, either by a spirit or by a message or by a letter as if from us, alleging that the Day of the Lord has come."
2 Thessalonians,2,3,"Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way. For that day will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction."
2 Thessalonians,2,4,"He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he sits in God’s sanctuary, publicizing that he himself is God."
2 Thessalonians,2,5,Don’t you remember that when I was still with you I told you about this?
2 Thessalonians,2,6,"And you know what currently restrains him, so that he will be revealed in his time."
2 Thessalonians,2,7,"For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work, but the one now restraining will do so until he is out of the way,"
2 Thessalonians,2,8,and then the lawless one will be revealed. The Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath of His mouth and will bring him to nothing with the brightness of His coming.
2 Thessalonians,2,9,"The coming of the lawless one is based on Satan’s working, with all kinds of false miracles, signs, and wonders,"
2 Thessalonians,2,10,and with every unrighteous deception among those who are perishing. They perish because they did not accept the love of the truth in order to be saved.
2 Thessalonians,2,11,"For this reason God sends them a strong delusion so that they will believe what is false,"
2 Thessalonians,2,12,so that all will be condemned—those who did not believe the truth but enjoyed unrighteousness.
2 Thessalonians,2,13,"But we must always thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God has chosen you for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and through belief in the truth."
2 Thessalonians,2,14,"He called you to this through our gospel, so that you might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,2,15,"Therefore, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions you were taught, either by our message or by our letter."
2 Thessalonians,2,16,"May our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal encouragement and good hope by grace,"
2 Thessalonians,2,17,encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good work and word.
2 Thessalonians,3,1,"Finally, brothers, pray for us that the Lord’s message may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you,"
2 Thessalonians,3,2,"and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men, for not all have faith."
2 Thessalonians,3,3,But the Lord is faithful; He will strengthen and guard you from the evil one.
2 Thessalonians,3,4,"We have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do what we command."
2 Thessalonians,3,5,May the Lord direct your hearts to God’s love and Christ’s endurance.
2 Thessalonians,3,6,"Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from every brother who walks irresponsibly and not according to the tradition received from us."
2 Thessalonians,3,7,For you yourselves know how you must imitate us: We were not irresponsible among you;
2 Thessalonians,3,8,"we did not eat anyone’s food free of charge; instead, we labored and struggled, working night and day, so that we would not be a burden to any of you."
2 Thessalonians,3,9,"It is not that we don’t have the right to support, but we did it to make ourselves an example to you so that you would imitate us."
2 Thessalonians,3,10,"In fact, when we were with you, this is what we commanded you: “If anyone isn’t willing to work, he should not eat.”"
2 Thessalonians,3,11,"For we hear that there are some among you who walk irresponsibly, not working at all, but interfering with the work of others."
2 Thessalonians,3,12,"Now we command and exhort such people by the Lord Jesus Christ that quietly working, they may eat their own food."
2 Thessalonians,3,13,"Brothers, do not grow weary in doing good."
2 Thessalonians,3,14,"And if anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take note of that person; don’t associate with him, so that he may be ashamed."
2 Thessalonians,3,15,"Yet don’t treat him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother."
2 Thessalonians,3,16,May the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with all of you.
2 Thessalonians,3,17,This greeting is in my own hand—Paul. This is a sign in every letter; this is how I write.
2 Thessalonians,3,18,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you.
1 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope:"
1 Timothy,1,2,"To Timothy, my true son in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
1 Timothy,1,3,"As I urged you when I went to Macedonia, remain in Ephesus so that you may instruct certain people not to teach different doctrine"
1 Timothy,1,4,"or to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies. These promote empty speculations rather than God’s plan, which operates by faith."
1 Timothy,1,5,"Now the goal of our instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith."
1 Timothy,1,6,Some have deviated from these and turned aside to fruitless discussion.
1 Timothy,1,7,"They want to be teachers of the law, although they don’t understand what they are saying or what they are insisting on."
1 Timothy,1,8,"But we know that the law is good, provided one uses it legitimately."
1 Timothy,1,9,"We know that the law is not meant for a righteous person, but for the lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinful, for the unholy and irreverent, for those who kill their fathers and mothers, for murderers,"
1 Timothy,1,10,"for the sexually immoral and homosexuals, for kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and for whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching"
1 Timothy,1,11,"based on the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was entrusted to me."
1 Timothy,1,12,"I give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, appointing me to the ministry—"
1 Timothy,1,13,"one who was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an arrogant man. But I received mercy because I acted out of ignorance in unbelief."
1 Timothy,1,14,"And the grace of our Lord overflowed, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus."
1 Timothy,1,15,This saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance: “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners”—and I am the worst of them.
1 Timothy,1,16,"But I received mercy for this reason, so that in me, the worst of them, Christ Jesus might demonstrate His extraordinary patience as an example to those who would believe in Him for eternal life."
1 Timothy,1,17,"Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen."
1 Timothy,1,18,"Timothy, my son, I am giving you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies previously made about you, so that by them you may strongly engage in battle,"
1 Timothy,1,19,having faith and a good conscience. Some have rejected these and have suffered the shipwreck of their faith.
1 Timothy,1,20,"Hymenaeus and Alexander are among them, and I have delivered them to Satan, so that they may be taught not to blaspheme."
1 Timothy,2,1,"First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone,"
1 Timothy,2,2,"for kings and all those who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity."
1 Timothy,2,3,"This is good, and it pleases God our Savior,"
1 Timothy,2,4,who wants everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
1 Timothy,2,5,"For there is one God and one mediator between God and humanity, Christ Jesus, Himself human,"
1 Timothy,2,6,"who gave Himself—a ransom for all, a testimony at the proper time."
1 Timothy,2,7,"For this I was appointed a herald, an apostle (I am telling the truth; I am not lying), and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth."
1 Timothy,2,8,"Therefore, I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or argument."
1 Timothy,2,9,"Also, the women are to dress themselves in modest clothing, with decency and good sense, not with elaborate hairstyles, gold, pearls, or expensive apparel,"
1 Timothy,2,10,"but with good works, as is proper for women who affirm that they worship God."
1 Timothy,2,11,A woman should learn in silence with full submission.
1 Timothy,2,12,"I do not allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; instead, she is to be silent."
1 Timothy,2,13,"For Adam was created first, then Eve."
1 Timothy,2,14,"And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and transgressed."
1 Timothy,2,15,"But she will be saved through childbearing, if she continues in faith, love, and holiness, with good judgment."
1 Timothy,3,1,"This saying is trustworthy: “If anyone aspires to be an overseer, he desires a noble work.”"
1 Timothy,3,2,"An overseer, therefore, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, self-controlled, sensible, respectable, hospitable, an able teacher,"
1 Timothy,3,3,"not addicted to wine, not a bully but gentle, not quarrelsome, not greedy—"
1 Timothy,3,4,"one who manages his own household competently, having his children under control with all dignity."
1 Timothy,3,5,"(If anyone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of God’s church?)"
1 Timothy,3,6,"He must not be a new convert, or he might become conceited and fall into the condemnation of the Devil."
1 Timothy,3,7,"Furthermore, he must have a good reputation among outsiders, so that he does not fall into disgrace and the Devil’s trap."
1 Timothy,3,8,"Deacons, likewise, should be worthy of respect, not hypocritical, not drinking a lot of wine, not greedy for money,"
1 Timothy,3,9,holding the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
1 Timothy,3,10,"And they must also be tested first; if they prove blameless, then they can serve as deacons."
1 Timothy,3,11,"Wives, too, must be worthy of respect, not slanderers, self-controlled, faithful in everything."
1 Timothy,3,12,"Deacons must be husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households competently."
1 Timothy,3,13,"For those who have served well as deacons acquire a good standing for themselves, and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus."
1 Timothy,3,14,"I write these things to you, hoping to come to you soon."
1 Timothy,3,15,"But if I should be delayed, I have written so that you will know how people ought to act in God’s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth."
1 Timothy,3,16,"And most certainly, the mystery of godliness is great: He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory."
1 Timothy,4,1,"Now the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will depart from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons,"
1 Timothy,4,2,through the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared.
1 Timothy,4,3,They forbid marriage and demand abstinence from foods that God created to be received with gratitude by those who believe and know the truth.
1 Timothy,4,4,"For everything created by God is good, and nothing should be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,"
1 Timothy,4,5,since it is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer.
1 Timothy,4,6,"If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished by the words of the faith and the good teaching that you have followed."
1 Timothy,4,7,"But have nothing to do with irreverent and silly myths. Rather, train yourself in godliness,"
1 Timothy,4,8,"for the training of the body has a limited benefit, but godliness is beneficial in every way, since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come."
1 Timothy,4,9,This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance.
1 Timothy,4,10,"In fact, we labor and strive for this, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of everyone, especially of those who believe."
1 Timothy,4,11,Command and teach these things.
1 Timothy,4,12,"Let no one despise your youth; instead, you should be an example to the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity."
1 Timothy,4,13,"Until I come, give your attention to public reading, exhortation, and teaching."
1 Timothy,4,14,"Do not neglect the gift that is in you; it was given to you through prophecy, with the laying on of hands by the council of elders."
1 Timothy,4,15,"Practice these things; be committed to them, so that your progress may be evident to all."
1 Timothy,4,16,"Pay close attention to your life and your teaching; persevere in these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and your hearers."
1 Timothy,5,1,"Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers,"
1 Timothy,5,2,"older women as mothers, and with all propriety, the younger women as sisters."
1 Timothy,5,3,Support widows who are genuinely widows.
1 Timothy,5,4,"But if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must learn to practice godliness toward their own family first and to repay their parents, for this pleases God."
1 Timothy,5,5,"The real widow, left all alone, has put her hope in God and continues night and day in her petitions and prayers;"
1 Timothy,5,6,"however, she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives."
1 Timothy,5,7,"Command this also, so they won’t be blamed."
1 Timothy,5,8,"But if anyone does not provide for his own, that is his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
1 Timothy,5,9,"No widow should be placed on the official support list unless she is at least 60 years old, has been the wife of one husband,"
1 Timothy,5,10,"and is well known for good works—that is, if she has brought up children, shown hospitality, washed the saints’ feet, helped the afflicted, and devoted herself to every good work."
1 Timothy,5,11,"But refuse to enroll younger widows, for when they are drawn away from Christ by desire, they want to marry"
1 Timothy,5,12,and will therefore receive condemnation because they have renounced their original pledge.
1 Timothy,5,13,"At the same time, they also learn to be idle, going from house to house; they are not only idle, but are also gossips and busybodies, saying things they shouldn’t say."
1 Timothy,5,14,"Therefore, I want younger women to marry, have children, manage their households, and give the adversary no opportunity to accuse us."
1 Timothy,5,15,For some have already turned away to follow Satan.
1 Timothy,5,16,"If any believing woman has widows in her family, she should help them, and the church should not be burdened, so that it can help those who are genuinely widows."
1 Timothy,5,17,"The elders who are good leaders should be considered worthy of an ample honorarium, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching."
1 Timothy,5,18,"For the Scripture says: Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain, and, the worker is worthy of his wages."
1 Timothy,5,19,Don’t accept an accusation against an elder unless it is supported by two or three witnesses.
1 Timothy,5,20,"Publicly rebuke those who sin, so that the rest will also be afraid."
1 Timothy,5,21,"I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels to observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing out of favoritism."
1 Timothy,5,22,"Don’t be too quick to appoint anyone as an elder, and don’t share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure."
1 Timothy,5,23,"Don’t continue drinking only water, but use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses."
1 Timothy,5,24,"Some people’s sins are obvious, going before them to judgment, but the sins of others surface later."
1 Timothy,5,25,"Likewise, good works are obvious, and those that are not obvious cannot remain hidden."
1 Timothy,6,1,"All who are under the yoke as slaves must regard their own masters to be worthy of all respect, so that God’s name and His teaching will not be blasphemed."
1 Timothy,6,2,Teach and encourage these things.
1 Timothy,6,3,"If anyone teaches other doctrine and does not agree with the sound teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the teaching that promotes godliness,"
1 Timothy,6,4,"he is conceited, understanding nothing, but has a sick interest in disputes and arguments over words. From these come envy, quarreling, slander, evil suspicions,"
1 Timothy,6,5,"and constant disagreement among people whose minds are depraved and deprived of the truth, who imagine that godliness is a way to material gain."
1 Timothy,6,6,But godliness with contentment is a great gain.
1 Timothy,6,7,"For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out."
1 Timothy,6,8,"But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with these."
1 Timothy,6,9,"But those who want to be rich fall into temptation, a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge people into ruin and destruction."
1 Timothy,6,10,"For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, and by craving it, some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains."
1 Timothy,6,11,"But you, man of God, run from these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness."
1 Timothy,6,12,Fight the good fight for the faith; take hold of eternal life that you were called to and have made a good confession about in the presence of many witnesses.
1 Timothy,6,13,"In the presence of God, who gives life to all, and of Christ Jesus, who gave a good confession before Pontius Pilate, I charge you"
1 Timothy,6,14,to keep the command without fault or failure until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Timothy,6,15,"God will bring this about in His own time. He is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings, and the Lord of lords,"
1 Timothy,6,16,"the only One who has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; no one has seen or can see Him, to Him be honor and eternal might. Amen."
1 Timothy,6,17,"Instruct those who are rich in the present age not to be arrogant or to set their hope on the uncertainty of wealth, but on God, who richly provides us with all things to enjoy."
1 Timothy,6,18,"Instruct them to do what is good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, willing to share,"
1 Timothy,6,19,"storing up for themselves a good reserve for the age to come, so that they may take hold of life that is real."
1 Timothy,6,20,"Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding irreverent, empty speech and contradictions from the “knowledge” that falsely bears that name."
1 Timothy,6,21,"By professing it, some people have deviated from the faith. Grace be with all of you."
2 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will, for the promise of life in Christ Jesus:"
2 Timothy,1,2,"To Timothy, my dearly loved son. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
2 Timothy,1,3,"I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience as my ancestors did, when I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day."
2 Timothy,1,4,"Remembering your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy,"
2 Timothy,1,5,"clearly recalling your sincere faith that first lived in your grandmother Lois, then in your mother Eunice, and that I am convinced is in you also."
2 Timothy,1,6,"Therefore, I remind you to keep ablaze the gift of God that is in you through the laying on of my hands."
2 Timothy,1,7,"For God has not given us a spirit of fearfulness, but one of power, love, and sound judgment."
2 Timothy,1,8,"So don’t be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, or of me His prisoner. Instead, share in suffering for the gospel, relying on the power of God."
2 Timothy,1,9,"He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began."
2 Timothy,1,10,"This has now been made evident through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who has abolished death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel."
2 Timothy,1,11,"For this gospel I was appointed a herald, apostle, and teacher,"
2 Timothy,1,12,"and that is why I suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, because I know the One I have believed in and am persuaded that He is able to guard what has been entrusted to me until that day."
2 Timothy,1,13,"Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,1,14,"Guard, through the Holy Spirit who lives in us, that good thing entrusted to you."
2 Timothy,1,15,"This you know: All those in Asia have turned away from me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes."
2 Timothy,1,16,"May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains."
2 Timothy,1,17,"On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he diligently searched for me and found me."
2 Timothy,1,18,May the Lord grant that he obtain mercy from Him on that day. And you know very well how much he ministered at Ephesus.
2 Timothy,2,1,"You, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,2,"And what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, commit to faithful men who will be able to teach others also."
2 Timothy,2,3,Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy,2,4,No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in the concerns of civilian life; he seeks to please the recruiter.
2 Timothy,2,5,"Also, if anyone competes as an athlete, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules."
2 Timothy,2,6,The hardworking farmer ought to be the first to get a share of the crops.
2 Timothy,2,7,"Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything."
2 Timothy,2,8,Keep your attention on Jesus Christ as risen from the dead and descended from David. This is according to my gospel.
2 Timothy,2,9,"I suffer for it to the point of being bound like a criminal, but God’s message is not bound."
2 Timothy,2,10,"This is why I endure all things for the elect: so that they also may obtain salvation, which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory."
2 Timothy,2,11,"This saying is trustworthy: For if we have died with Him, we will also live with Him;"
2 Timothy,2,12,"if we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He will also deny us;"
2 Timothy,2,13,"if we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself."
2 Timothy,2,14,"Remind them of these things, charging them before God not to fight about words; this is in no way profitable and leads to the ruin of the hearers."
2 Timothy,2,15,"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who doesn’t need to be ashamed, correctly teaching the word of truth."
2 Timothy,2,16,"But avoid irreverent, empty speech, for this will produce an even greater measure of godlessness."
2 Timothy,2,17,And their word will spread like gangrene; Hymenaeus and Philetus are among them.
2 Timothy,2,18,"They have deviated from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and are overturning the faith of some."
2 Timothy,2,19,"Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, having this inscription: The Lord knows those who are His, and Everyone who names the name of the Lord must turn away from unrighteousness."
2 Timothy,2,20,"Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver bowls, but also those of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable."
2 Timothy,2,21,"So if anyone purifies himself from anything dishonorable, he will be a special instrument, set apart, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work."
2 Timothy,2,22,"Flee from youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart."
2 Timothy,2,23,"But reject foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they breed quarrels."
2 Timothy,2,24,"The Lord’s slave must not quarrel, but must be gentle to everyone, able to teach, and patient,"
2 Timothy,2,25,instructing his opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance leading them to the knowledge of the truth.
2 Timothy,2,26,"Then they may come to their senses and escape the Devil’s trap, having been captured by him to do his will."
2 Timothy,3,1,But know this: Difficult times will come in the last days.
2 Timothy,3,2,"For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,"
2 Timothy,3,3,"unloving, irreconcilable, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, without love for what is good,"
2 Timothy,3,4,"traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,"
2 Timothy,3,5,holding to the form of godliness but denying its power. Avoid these people!
2 Timothy,3,6,"For among them are those who worm their way into households and capture idle women burdened down with sins, led along by a variety of passions,"
2 Timothy,3,7,always learning and never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.
2 Timothy,3,8,"Just as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the truth, men who are corrupt in mind, worthless in regard to the faith."
2 Timothy,3,9,"But they will not make further progress, for their lack of understanding will be clear to all, as theirs was also."
2 Timothy,3,10,"But you have followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, and endurance,"
2 Timothy,3,11,"along with the persecutions and sufferings that came to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! Yet the Lord rescued me from them all."
2 Timothy,3,12,"In fact, all those who want to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted."
2 Timothy,3,13,"Evil people and impostors will become worse, deceiving and being deceived."
2 Timothy,3,14,"But as for you, continue in what you have learned and firmly believed. You know those who taught you,"
2 Timothy,3,15,"and you know that from childhood you have known the sacred Scriptures, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,3,16,"All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness,"
2 Timothy,3,17,"so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work."
2 Timothy,4,1,"I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge the living and the dead, and because of His appearing and His kingdom:"
2 Timothy,4,2,"Proclaim the message; persist in it whether convenient or not; rebuke, correct, and encourage with great patience and teaching."
2 Timothy,4,3,"For the time will come when they will not tolerate sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, will multiply teachers for themselves because they have an itch to hear something new."
2 Timothy,4,4,They will turn away from hearing the truth and will turn aside to myths.
2 Timothy,4,5,"But as for you, be serious about everything, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry."
2 Timothy,4,6,"For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time for my departure is close."
2 Timothy,4,7,"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith."
2 Timothy,4,8,"There is reserved for me in the future the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me on that day, and not only to me, but to all those who have loved His appearing."
2 Timothy,4,9,"Make every effort to come to me soon,"
2 Timothy,4,10,"for Demas has deserted me, because he loved this present world, and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia."
2 Timothy,4,11,"Only Luke is with me. Bring Mark with you, for he is useful to me in the ministry."
2 Timothy,4,12,I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
2 Timothy,4,13,"When you come, bring the cloak I left in Troas with Carpus, as well as the scrolls, especially the parchments."
2 Timothy,4,14,Alexander the coppersmith did great harm to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works.
2 Timothy,4,15,Watch out for him yourself because he strongly opposed our words.
2 Timothy,4,16,"At my first defense, no one stood by me, but everyone deserted me. May it not be counted against them."
2 Timothy,4,17,"But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that the proclamation might be fully made through me and all the Gentiles might hear. So I was rescued from the lion’s mouth."
2 Timothy,4,18,The Lord will rescue me from every evil work and will bring me safely into His heavenly kingdom. To Him be the glory forever and ever! Amen.
2 Timothy,4,19,"Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus."
2 Timothy,4,20,Erastus has remained at Corinth; I left Trophimus sick at Miletus.
2 Timothy,4,21,"Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers."
2 Timothy,4,22,The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
Titus,1,1,"Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to build up the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,"
Titus,1,2,"in the hope of eternal life that God, who cannot lie, promised before time began."
Titus,1,3,In His own time He has revealed His message in the proclamation that I was entrusted with by the command of God our Savior:
Titus,1,4,"To Titus, my true son in our common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior."
Titus,1,5,"The reason I left you in Crete was to set right what was left undone and, as I directed you, to appoint elders in every town:"
Titus,1,6,"one who is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of wildness or rebellion."
Titus,1,7,"For an overseer, as God’s administrator, must be blameless, not arrogant, not hot-tempered, not addicted to wine, not a bully, not greedy for money,"
Titus,1,8,"but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, righteous, holy, self-controlled,"
Titus,1,9,"holding to the faithful message as taught, so that he will be able both to encourage with sound teaching and to refute those who contradict it."
Titus,1,10,"For there are also many rebellious people, full of empty talk and deception, especially those from Judaism."
Titus,1,11,It is necessary to silence them; they overthrow whole households by teaching what they shouldn’t in order to get money dishonestly.
Titus,1,12,"One of their very own prophets said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."
Titus,1,13,"This testimony is true. So, rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith"
Titus,1,14,and may not pay attention to Jewish myths and the commands of men who reject the truth.
Titus,1,15,"To the pure, everything is pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; in fact, both their mind and conscience are defiled."
Titus,1,16,"They profess to know God, but they deny Him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, and disqualified for any good work."
Titus,2,1,But you must say the things that are consistent with sound teaching.
Titus,2,2,"Older men are to be level headed, worthy of respect, sensible, and sound in faith, love, and endurance."
Titus,2,3,"In the same way, older women are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not addicted to much wine. They are to teach what is good,"
Titus,2,4,"so they may encourage the young women to love their husbands and to love their children,"
Titus,2,5,"to be self-controlled, pure, homemakers, kind, and submissive to their husbands, so that God’s message will not be slandered."
Titus,2,6,"In the same way, encourage the young men to be self-controlled"
Titus,2,7,in everything. Make yourself an example of good works with integrity and dignity in your teaching.
Titus,2,8,"Your message is to be sound beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be ashamed, having nothing bad to say about us."
Titus,2,9,"Slaves are to be submissive to their masters in everything, and to be well-pleasing, not talking back"
Titus,2,10,"or stealing, but demonstrating utter faithfulness, so that they may adorn the teaching of God our Savior in everything."
Titus,2,11,"For the grace of God has appeared with salvation for all people,"
Titus,2,12,"instructing us to deny godlessness and worldly lusts and to live in a sensible, righteous, and godly way in the present age,"
Titus,2,13,"while we wait for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ."
Titus,2,14,"He gave Himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for Himself a people for His own possession, eager to do good works."
Titus,2,15,"Say these things, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you."
Titus,3,1,"Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work,"
Titus,3,2,"to slander no one, to avoid fighting, and to be kind, always showing gentleness to all people."
Titus,3,3,"For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another."
Titus,3,4,"But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared,"
Titus,3,5,"He saved us— not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to His mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit."
Titus,3,6,"He poured out this Spirit on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior,"
Titus,3,7,"so that having been justified by His grace, we may become heirs with the hope of eternal life."
Titus,3,8,"This saying is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed God might be careful to devote themselves to good works. These are good and profitable for everyone."
Titus,3,9,"But avoid foolish debates, genealogies, quarrels, and disputes about the law, for they are unprofitable and worthless."
Titus,3,10,"Reject a divisive person after a first and second warning,"
Titus,3,11,"knowing that such a person is perverted and sins, being self-condemned."
Titus,3,12,"When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there."
Titus,3,13,"Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey, so that they will lack nothing."
Titus,3,14,"And our people must also learn to devote themselves to good works for cases of urgent need, so that they will not be unfruitful."
Titus,3,15,All those who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you.
Philemon,1,1,"Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother: To Philemon our dear friend and coworker,"
Philemon,1,2,"to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your home."
Philemon,1,3,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philemon,1,4,"I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers,"
Philemon,1,5,because I hear of your love and faith toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints.
Philemon,1,6,I pray that your participation in the faith may become effective through knowing every good thing that is in us for the glory of Christ.
Philemon,1,7,"For I have great joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother."
Philemon,1,8,"For this reason, although I have great boldness in Christ to command you to do what is right,"
Philemon,1,9,"I appeal to you, instead, on the basis of love. I, Paul, as an elderly man and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus,"
Philemon,1,10,"appeal to you for my son, Onesimus. I fathered him while I was in chains."
Philemon,1,11,"Once he was useless to you, but now he is useful both to you and to me."
Philemon,1,12,I am sending him back to you as a part of myself.
Philemon,1,13,"I wanted to keep him with me, so that in my imprisonment for the gospel he might serve me in your place."
Philemon,1,14,"But I didn’t want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed might not be out of obligation, but of your own free will."
Philemon,1,15,"For perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a brief time, so that you might get him back permanently,"
Philemon,1,16,"no longer as a slave, but more than a slave—as a dearly loved brother. He is especially so to me, but even more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord."
Philemon,1,17,"So if you consider me a partner, accept him as you would me."
Philemon,1,18,"And if he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account."
Philemon,1,19,"I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it—not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self."
Philemon,1,20,"Yes, brother, may I have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ."
Philemon,1,21,"Since I am confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say."
Philemon,1,22,"But meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you."
Philemon,1,23,"Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, and so do"
Philemon,1,24,"Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my coworkers."
Philemon,1,25,The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Hebrews,1,1,Long ago God spoke to the fathers by the prophets at different times and in different ways.
Hebrews,1,2,"In these last days, He has spoken to us by His Son. God has appointed Him heir of all things and made the universe through Him."
Hebrews,1,3,"The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of His nature, sustaining all things by His powerful word. After making purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high."
Hebrews,1,4,"So He became higher in rank than the angels, just as the name He inherited is superior to theirs."
Hebrews,1,5,"For to which of the angels did He ever say, You are My Son; today I have become Your Father, or again, I will be His Father, and He will be My Son?"
Hebrews,1,6,"When He again brings His firstborn into the world, He says, And all God’s angels must worship Him."
Hebrews,1,7,"And about the angels He says: He makes His angels winds, and His servants a fiery flame,"
Hebrews,1,8,"but to the Son: Your throne, God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of justice."
Hebrews,1,9,"You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; this is why God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of joy rather than Your companions."
Hebrews,1,10,"And: In the beginning, Lord, You established the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands;"
Hebrews,1,11,"they will perish, but You remain. They will all wear out like clothing;"
Hebrews,1,12,"You will roll them up like a cloak, and they will be changed like a robe. But You are the same, and Your years will never end."
Hebrews,1,13,Now to which of the angels has He ever said: Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies Your footstool?
Hebrews,1,14,Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve those who are going to inherit salvation?
Hebrews,2,1,"We must, therefore, pay even more attention to what we have heard, so that we will not drift away."
Hebrews,2,2,"For if the message spoken through angels was legally binding and every transgression and disobedience received a just punishment,"
Hebrews,2,3,how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was first spoken by the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard Him.
Hebrews,2,4,"At the same time, God also testified by signs and wonders, various miracles, and distributions of gifts from the Holy Spirit according to His will."
Hebrews,2,5,For He has not subjected to angels the world to come that we are talking about.
Hebrews,2,6,"But one has somewhere testified: What is man that You remember him, or the son of man that You care for him?"
Hebrews,2,7,You made him lower than the angels for a short time; You crowned him with glory and honor
Hebrews,2,8,"and subjected everything under his feet. For in subjecting everything to him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. As it is, we do not yet see everything subjected to him."
Hebrews,2,9,But we do see Jesus—made lower than the angels for a short time so that by God’s grace He might taste death for everyone—crowned with glory and honor because of His suffering in death.
Hebrews,2,10,"For in bringing many sons to glory, it was entirely appropriate that God—all things exist for Him and through Him—should make the source of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
Hebrews,2,11,"For the One who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers,"
Hebrews,2,12,saying: I will proclaim Your name to My brothers; I will sing hymns to You in the congregation.
Hebrews,2,13,"Again, I will trust in Him. And again, Here I am with the children God gave Me."
Hebrews,2,14,"Now since the children have flesh and blood in common, Jesus also shared in these, so that through His death He might destroy the one holding the power of death—that is, the Devil—"
Hebrews,2,15,and free those who were held in slavery all their lives by the fear of death.
Hebrews,2,16,"For it is clear that He does not reach out to help angels, but to help Abraham’s offspring."
Hebrews,2,17,"Therefore, He had to be like His brothers in every way, so that He could become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people."
Hebrews,2,18,"For since He Himself was tested and has suffered, He is able to help those who are tested."
Hebrews,3,1,"Therefore, holy brothers and companions in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession;"
Hebrews,3,2,"He was faithful to the One who appointed Him, just as Moses was in all God’s household."
Hebrews,3,3,"For Jesus is considered worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder has more honor than the house."
Hebrews,3,4,"Now every house is built by someone, but the One who built everything is God."
Hebrews,3,5,"Moses was faithful as a servant in all God’s household, as a testimony to what would be said in the future."
Hebrews,3,6,But Christ was faithful as a Son over His household. And we are that household if we hold on to the courage and the confidence of our hope.
Hebrews,3,7,"Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: Today, if you hear His voice,"
Hebrews,3,8,"do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness,"
Hebrews,3,9,"where your fathers tested Me, tried Me, and saw My works"
Hebrews,3,10,"for 40 years. Therefore I was provoked with that generation and said, “They always go astray in their hearts, and they have not known My ways.”"
Hebrews,3,11,"So I swore in My anger, “They will not enter My rest.”"
Hebrews,3,12,"Watch out, brothers, so that there won’t be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart that departs from the living God."
Hebrews,3,13,"But encourage each other daily, while it is still called today, so that none of you is hardened by sin’s deception."
Hebrews,3,14,For we have become companions of the Messiah if we hold firmly until the end the reality that we had at the start.
Hebrews,3,15,"As it is said: Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion."
Hebrews,3,16,For who heard and rebelled? Wasn’t it really all who came out of Egypt under Moses?
Hebrews,3,17,"And who was He provoked with for 40 years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?"
Hebrews,3,18,"And who did He swear to that they would not enter His rest, if not those who disobeyed?"
Hebrews,3,19,So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
Hebrews,4,1,"Therefore, while the promise to enter His rest remains, let us fear that none of you should miss it."
Hebrews,4,2,"For we also have received the good news just as they did; but the message they heard did not benefit them, since they were not united with those who heard it in faith"
Hebrews,4,3,"(for we who have believed enter the rest), in keeping with what He has said: So I swore in My anger, they will not enter My rest. And yet His works have been finished since the foundation of the world,"
Hebrews,4,4,for somewhere He has spoken about the seventh day in this way: And on the seventh day God rested from all His works.
Hebrews,4,5,"Again, in that passage He says, They will never enter My rest."
Hebrews,4,6,"Since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news did not enter because of disobedience,"
Hebrews,4,7,"again, He specifies a certain day—today—speaking through David after such a long time, as previously stated: Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts."
Hebrews,4,8,"For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day."
Hebrews,4,9,"Therefore, a Sabbath rest remains for God’s people."
Hebrews,4,10,"For the person who has entered His rest has rested from his own works, just as God did from His."
Hebrews,4,11,"Let us then make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall into the same pattern of disobedience."
Hebrews,4,12,"For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any double-edged sword, penetrating as far as the separation of soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It is able to judge the ideas and thoughts of the heart."
Hebrews,4,13,"No creature is hidden from Him, but all things are naked and exposed to the eyes of Him to whom we must give an account."
Hebrews,4,14,"Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens—Jesus the Son of God—let us hold fast to the confession."
Hebrews,4,15,"For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tested in every way as we are, yet without sin."
Hebrews,4,16,"Therefore let us approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us at the proper time."
Hebrews,5,1,"For every high priest taken from men is appointed in service to God for the people, to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins."
Hebrews,5,2,"He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he is also subject to weakness."
Hebrews,5,3,"Because of this, he must make a sin offering for himself as well as for the people."
Hebrews,5,4,"No one takes this honor on himself; instead, a person is called by God, just as Aaron was."
Hebrews,5,5,"In the same way, the Messiah did not exalt Himself to become a high priest, but the One who said to Him, You are My Son; today I have become Your Father,"
Hebrews,5,6,"also said in another passage, You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."
Hebrews,5,7,"During His earthly life, He offered prayers and appeals with loud cries and tears to the One who was able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His reverence."
Hebrews,5,8,"Though He was God’s Son, He learned obedience through what He suffered."
Hebrews,5,9,"After He was perfected, He became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey Him,"
Hebrews,5,10,and He was declared by God a high priest in the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews,5,11,"We have a great deal to say about this, and it’s difficult to explain, since you have become too lazy to understand."
Hebrews,5,12,"Although by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the basic principles of God’s revelation again. You need milk, not solid food."
Hebrews,5,13,"Now everyone who lives on milk is inexperienced with the message about righteousness, because he is an infant."
Hebrews,5,14,But solid food is for the mature—for those whose senses have been trained to distinguish between good and evil.
Hebrews,6,1,"Therefore, leaving the elementary message about the Messiah, let us go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, faith in God,"
Hebrews,6,2,"teaching about ritual washings, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment."
Hebrews,6,3,And we will do this if God permits.
Hebrews,6,4,"For it is impossible to renew to repentance those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, became companions with the Holy Spirit,"
Hebrews,6,5,"tasted God’s good word and the powers of the coming age,"
Hebrews,6,6,"and who have fallen away, because, to their own harm, they are recrucifying the Son of God and holding Him up to contempt."
Hebrews,6,7,For ground that has drunk the rain that has often fallen on it and that produces vegetation useful to those it is cultivated for receives a blessing from God.
Hebrews,6,8,"But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and about to be cursed, and will be burned at the end."
Hebrews,6,9,"Even though we are speaking this way, dear friends, in your case we are confident of the better things connected with salvation."
Hebrews,6,10,For God is not unjust; He will not forget your work and the love you showed for His name when you served the saints—and you continue to serve them.
Hebrews,6,11,"Now we want each of you to demonstrate the same diligence for the final realization of your hope,"
Hebrews,6,12,so that you won’t become lazy but will be imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and perseverance.
Hebrews,6,13,"For when God made a promise to Abraham, since He had no one greater to swear by, He swore by Himself:"
Hebrews,6,14,"I will indeed bless you, and I will greatly multiply you."
Hebrews,6,15,"And so, after waiting patiently, Abraham obtained the promise."
Hebrews,6,16,"For men swear by something greater than themselves, and for them a confirming oath ends every dispute."
Hebrews,6,17,"Because God wanted to show His unchangeable purpose even more clearly to the heirs of the promise, He guaranteed it with an oath,"
Hebrews,6,18,"so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us."
Hebrews,6,19,"We have this hope as an anchor for our lives, safe and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain."
Hebrews,6,20,"Jesus has entered there on our behalf as a forerunner, because He has become a high priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."
Hebrews,7,1,"For this Melchizedek— King of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham and blessed him as he returned from defeating the kings,"
Hebrews,7,2,"and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything; first, his name means king of righteousness, then also, king of Salem, meaning king of peace;"
Hebrews,7,3,"without father, mother, or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God— remains a priest forever."
Hebrews,7,4,Now consider how great this man was—even Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the plunder to him!
Hebrews,7,5,"The sons of Levi who receive the priestly office have a command according to the law to collect a tenth from the people—that is, from their brothers—though they have also descended from Abraham."
Hebrews,7,6,But one without this lineage collected tenths from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.
Hebrews,7,7,"Without a doubt, the inferior is blessed by the superior."
Hebrews,7,8,"In the one case, men who will die receive tenths, but in the other case, Scripture testifies that he lives."
Hebrews,7,9,"And in a sense Levi himself, who receives tenths, has paid tenths through Abraham,"
Hebrews,7,10,for he was still within his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.
Hebrews,7,11,"If then, perfection came through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there for another priest to appear, said to be in the order of Melchizedek and not in the order of Aaron?"
Hebrews,7,12,"For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must be a change of law as well."
Hebrews,7,13,For the One these things are spoken about belonged to a different tribe. No one from it has served at the altar.
Hebrews,7,14,"Now it is evident that our Lord came from Judah, and Moses said nothing about that tribe concerning priests."
Hebrews,7,15,"And this becomes clearer if another priest like Melchizedek appears,"
Hebrews,7,16,who did not become a priest based on a legal command concerning physical descent but based on the power of an indestructible life.
Hebrews,7,17,For it has been testified: You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews,7,18,So the previous command is annulled because it was weak and unprofitable
Hebrews,7,19,"(for the law perfected nothing), but a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God."
Hebrews,7,20,"None of this happened without an oath. For others became priests without an oath,"
Hebrews,7,21,"but He became a priest with an oath made by the One who said to Him: The Lord has sworn, and He will not change His mind, You are a priest forever."
Hebrews,7,22,So Jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant.
Hebrews,7,23,"Now many have become Levitical priests, since they are prevented by death from remaining in office."
Hebrews,7,24,"But because He remains forever, He holds His priesthood permanently."
Hebrews,7,25,"Therefore, He is always able to save those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to intercede for them."
Hebrews,7,26,"For this is the kind of high priest we need: holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens."
Hebrews,7,27,"He doesn’t need to offer sacrifices every day, as high priests do—first for their own sins, then for those of the people. He did this once for all when He offered Himself."
Hebrews,7,28,"For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the promise of the oath, which came after the law, appoints a Son, who has been perfected forever."
Hebrews,8,1,"Now the main point of what is being said is this: We have this kind of high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,"
Hebrews,8,2,a minister of the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that was set up by the Lord and not man.
Hebrews,8,3,For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; therefore it was necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.
Hebrews,8,4,"Now if He were on earth, He wouldn’t be a priest, since there are those offering the gifts prescribed by the law."
Hebrews,8,5,"These serve as a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was warned when he was about to complete the tabernacle. For God said, Be careful that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain."
Hebrews,8,6,"But Jesus has now obtained a superior ministry, and to that degree He is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been legally enacted on better promises."
Hebrews,8,7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second one."
Hebrews,8,8,"But finding fault with His people, He says: Look, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah—"
Hebrews,8,9,"not like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day I took them by their hands to lead them out of the land of Egypt. I disregarded them, says the Lord, because they did not continue in My covenant."
Hebrews,8,10,"But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws into their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be My people."
Hebrews,8,11,"And each person will not teach his fellow citizen, and each his brother, saying, “Know the Lord,” because they will all know Me, from the least to the greatest of them."
Hebrews,8,12,"For I will be merciful to their wrongdoing, and I will never again remember their sins."
Hebrews,8,13,"By saying, a new covenant, He has declared that the first is old. And what is old and aging is about to disappear."
Hebrews,9,1,Now the first covenant also had regulations for ministry and an earthly sanctuary.
Hebrews,9,2,"For a tabernacle was set up, and in the first room, which is called the holy place, were the lampstand, the table, and the presentation loaves."
Hebrews,9,3,"Behind the second curtain, the tabernacle was called the most holy place."
Hebrews,9,4,"It contained the gold altar of incense and the ark of the covenant, covered with gold on all sides, in which there was a gold jar containing the manna, Aaron’s staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant."
Hebrews,9,5,The cherubim of glory were above it overshadowing the mercy seat. It is not possible to speak about these things in detail right now.
Hebrews,9,6,"With these things set up this way, the priests enter the first room repeatedly, performing their ministry."
Hebrews,9,7,"But the high priest alone enters the second room, and he does that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance."
Hebrews,9,8,The Holy Spirit was making it clear that the way into the most holy place had not yet been disclosed while the first tabernacle was still standing.
Hebrews,9,9,"This is a symbol for the present time, during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the worshiper’s conscience."
Hebrews,9,10,"They are physical regulations and only deal with food, drink, and various washings imposed until the time of restoration."
Hebrews,9,11,"But the Messiah has appeared, high priest of the good things that have come. In the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands (that is, not of this creation),"
Hebrews,9,12,"He entered the most holy place once for all, not by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood, having obtained eternal redemption."
Hebrews,9,13,"For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow, sprinkling those who are defiled, sanctify for the purification of the flesh,"
Hebrews,9,14,"how much more will the blood of the Messiah, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works to serve the living God?"
Hebrews,9,15,"Therefore, He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance, because a death has taken place for redemption from the transgressions committed under the first covenant."
Hebrews,9,16,"Where a will exists, the death of the one who made it must be established."
Hebrews,9,17,"For a will is valid only when people die, since it is never in force while the one who made it is living."
Hebrews,9,18,That is why even the first covenant was inaugurated with blood.
Hebrews,9,19,"For when every command had been proclaimed by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats, along with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll itself and all the people,"
Hebrews,9,20,"saying, This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you."
Hebrews,9,21,"In the same way, he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the articles of worship with blood."
Hebrews,9,22,"According to the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness."
Hebrews,9,23,"Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves to be purified with better sacrifices than these."
Hebrews,9,24,"For the Messiah did not enter a sanctuary made with hands (only a model of the true one) but into heaven itself, so that He might now appear in the presence of God for us."
Hebrews,9,25,"He did not do this to offer Himself many times, as the high priest enters the sanctuary yearly with the blood of another."
Hebrews,9,26,"Otherwise, He would have had to suffer many times since the foundation of the world. But now He has appeared one time, at the end of the ages, for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of Himself."
Hebrews,9,27,"And just as it is appointed for people to die once—and after this, judgment—"
Hebrews,9,28,"so also the Messiah, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for Him."
Hebrews,10,1,"Since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come, and not the actual form of those realities, it can never perfect the worshipers by the same sacrifices they continually offer year after year."
Hebrews,10,2,"Otherwise, wouldn’t they have stopped being offered, since the worshipers, once purified, would no longer have any consciousness of sins?"
Hebrews,10,3,But in the sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year.
Hebrews,10,4,For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
Hebrews,10,5,"Therefore, as He was coming into the world, He said: You did not want sacrifice and offering, but You prepared a body for Me."
Hebrews,10,6,You did not delight in whole burnt offerings and sin offerings.
Hebrews,10,7,"Then I said, “See— it is written about Me in the volume of the scroll— I have come to do Your will, God!”"
Hebrews,10,8,"After He says above, You did not want or delight in sacrifices and offerings, whole burnt offerings and sin offerings (which are offered according to the law),"
Hebrews,10,9,"He then says, See, I have come to do Your will. He takes away the first to establish the second."
Hebrews,10,10,"By this will of God, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all."
Hebrews,10,11,"Every priest stands day after day ministering and offering the same sacrifices time after time, which can never take away sins."
Hebrews,10,12,"But this man, after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God."
Hebrews,10,13,He is now waiting until His enemies are made His footstool.
Hebrews,10,14,For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are sanctified.
Hebrews,10,15,The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. For after He says:
Hebrews,10,16,"This is the covenant I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws on their hearts and write them on their minds,"
Hebrews,10,17,He adds: I will never again remember their sins and their lawless acts.
Hebrews,10,18,"Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin."
Hebrews,10,19,"Therefore, brothers, since we have boldness to enter the sanctuary through the blood of Jesus,"
Hebrews,10,20,"by a new and living way He has opened for us through the curtain (that is, His flesh),"
Hebrews,10,21,"and since we have a great high priest over the house of God,"
Hebrews,10,22,"let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water."
Hebrews,10,23,"Let us hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful."
Hebrews,10,24,"And let us be concerned about one another in order to promote love and good works,"
Hebrews,10,25,"not staying away from our worship meetings, as some habitually do, but encouraging each other, and all the more as you see the day drawing near."
Hebrews,10,26,"For if we deliberately sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,"
Hebrews,10,27,but a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire about to consume the adversaries.
Hebrews,10,28,"If anyone disregards Moses’ law, he dies without mercy, based on the testimony of two or three witnesses."
Hebrews,10,29,"How much worse punishment do you think one will deserve who has trampled on the Son of God, regarded as profane the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and insulted the Spirit of grace?"
Hebrews,10,30,"For we know the One who has said, Vengeance belongs to Me, I will repay, and again, The Lord will judge His people."
Hebrews,10,31,It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!
Hebrews,10,32,"Remember the earlier days when, after you had been enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings."
Hebrews,10,33,"Sometimes you were publicly exposed to taunts and afflictions, and at other times you were companions of those who were treated that way."
Hebrews,10,34,"For you sympathized with the prisoners and accepted with joy the confiscation of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves have a better and enduring possession."
Hebrews,10,35,"So don’t throw away your confidence, which has a great reward."
Hebrews,10,36,"For you need endurance, so that after you have done God’s will, you may receive what was promised."
Hebrews,10,37,"For yet in a very little while, the Coming One will come and not delay."
Hebrews,10,38,"But My righteous one will live by faith; and if he draws back, I have no pleasure in him."
Hebrews,10,39,"But we are not those who draw back and are destroyed, but those who have faith and obtain life."
Hebrews,11,1,"Now faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen."
Hebrews,11,2,For our ancestors won God’s approval by it.
Hebrews,11,3,"By faith we understand that the universe was created by God’s command, so that what is seen has been made from things that are not visible."
Hebrews,11,4,"By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was approved as a righteous man, because God approved his gifts, and even though he is dead, he still speaks through his faith."
Hebrews,11,5,"By faith Enoch was taken away so he did not experience death, and he was not to be found because God took him away. For prior to his removal he was approved, since he had pleased God."
Hebrews,11,6,"Now without faith it is impossible to please God, for the one who draws near to Him must believe that He exists and rewards those who seek Him."
Hebrews,11,7,"By faith Noah, after he was warned about what was not yet seen and motivated by godly fear, built an ark to deliver his family. By faith he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith."
Hebrews,11,8,"By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed and went out to a place he was going to receive as an inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he was going."
Hebrews,11,9,"By faith he stayed as a foreigner in the land of promise, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, coheirs of the same promise."
Hebrews,11,10,"For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God."
Hebrews,11,11,"By faith even Sarah herself, when she was unable to have children, received power to conceive offspring, even though she was past the age, since she considered that the One who had promised was faithful."
Hebrews,11,12,"Therefore from one man—in fact, from one as good as dead—came offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven and as innumerable as the grains of sand by the seashore."
Hebrews,11,13,"These all died in faith without having received the promises, but they saw them from a distance, greeted them, and confessed that they were foreigners and temporary residents on the earth."
Hebrews,11,14,Now those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.
Hebrews,11,15,"If they were thinking about where they came from, they would have had an opportunity to return."
Hebrews,11,16,"But they now desire a better place—a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them."
Hebrews,11,17,"By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac. He received the promises and he was offering his unique son,"
Hebrews,11,18,"the one it had been said about, Your seed will be traced through Isaac."
Hebrews,11,19,"He considered God to be able even to raise someone from the dead, and as an illustration, he received him back."
Hebrews,11,20,By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
Hebrews,11,21,"By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and he worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff."
Hebrews,11,22,"By faith Joseph, as he was nearing the end of his life, mentioned the exodus of the Israelites and gave instructions concerning his bones."
Hebrews,11,23,"By faith, after Moses was born, he was hidden by his parents for three months, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they didn’t fear the king’s edict."
Hebrews,11,24,"By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter"
Hebrews,11,25,and chose to suffer with the people of God rather than to enjoy the short-lived pleasure of sin.
Hebrews,11,26,"For he considered the reproach because of the Messiah to be greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, since his attention was on the reward."
Hebrews,11,27,"By faith he left Egypt behind, not being afraid of the king’s anger, for Moses persevered as one who sees Him who is invisible."
Hebrews,11,28,"By faith he instituted the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn might not touch the Israelites."
Hebrews,11,29,"By faith they crossed the Red Sea as though they were on dry land. When the Egyptians attempted to do this, they were drowned."
Hebrews,11,30,By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after being encircled by the Israelites for seven days.
Hebrews,11,31,By faith Rahab the prostitute received the spies in peace and didn’t perish with those who disobeyed.
Hebrews,11,32,"And what more can I say? Time is too short for me to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets,"
Hebrews,11,33,"who by faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,"
Hebrews,11,34,"quenched the raging of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, gained strength after being weak, became mighty in battle, and put foreign armies to flight."
Hebrews,11,35,"Women received their dead—they were raised to life again. Some men were tortured, not accepting release, so that they might gain a better resurrection,"
Hebrews,11,36,"and others experienced mockings and scourgings, as well as bonds and imprisonment."
Hebrews,11,37,"They were stoned, they were sawed in two, they died by the sword, they wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, destitute, afflicted, and mistreated."
Hebrews,11,38,"The world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and on mountains, hiding in caves and holes in the ground."
Hebrews,11,39,"All these were approved through their faith, but they did not receive what was promised,"
Hebrews,11,40,"since God had provided something better for us, so that they would not be made perfect without us."
Hebrews,12,1,"Therefore, since we also have such a large cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily ensnares us. Let us run with endurance the race that lies before us,"
Hebrews,12,2,"keeping our eyes on Jesus, the source and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that lay before Him endured a cross and despised the shame and has sat down at the right hand of God’s throne."
Hebrews,12,3,"For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, so that you won’t grow weary and lose heart."
Hebrews,12,4,"In struggling against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood."
Hebrews,12,5,"And you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons: My son, do not take the Lord’s discipline lightly or faint when you are reproved by Him,"
Hebrews,12,6,for the Lord disciplines the one He loves and punishes every son He receives.
Hebrews,12,7,Endure suffering as discipline: God is dealing with you as sons. For what son is there that a father does not discipline?
Hebrews,12,8,But if you are without discipline—which all receive—then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
Hebrews,12,9,"Furthermore, we had natural fathers discipline us, and we respected them. Shouldn’t we submit even more to the Father of spirits and live?"
Hebrews,12,10,"For they disciplined us for a short time based on what seemed good to them, but He does it for our benefit, so that we can share His holiness."
Hebrews,12,11,"No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields the fruit of peace and righteousness to those who have been trained by it."
Hebrews,12,12,"Therefore strengthen your tired hands and weakened knees,"
Hebrews,12,13,"and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated but healed instead."
Hebrews,12,14,"Pursue peace with everyone, and holiness—without it no one will see the Lord."
Hebrews,12,15,"Make sure that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no root of bitterness springs up, causing trouble and by it, defiling many."
Hebrews,12,16,"And make sure that there isn’t any immoral or irreverent person like Esau, who sold his birthright in exchange for one meal."
Hebrews,12,17,"For you know that later, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected because he didn’t find any opportunity for repentance, though he sought it with tears."
Hebrews,12,18,"For you have not come to what could be touched, to a blazing fire, to darkness, gloom, and storm,"
Hebrews,12,19,"to the blast of a trumpet, and the sound of words. (Those who heard it begged that not another word be spoken to them,"
Hebrews,12,20,"for they could not bear what was commanded: And if even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned!"
Hebrews,12,21,"The appearance was so terrifying that Moses said, I am terrified and trembling.)"
Hebrews,12,22,"Instead, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God (the heavenly Jerusalem), to myriads of angels in festive gathering,"
Hebrews,12,23,"to the assembly of the firstborn whose names have been written in heaven, to God who is the Judge of all, to the spirits of righteous people made perfect,"
Hebrews,12,24,"to Jesus (mediator of a new covenant), and to the sprinkled blood, which says better things than the blood of Abel."
Hebrews,12,25,"Make sure that you do not reject the One who speaks. For if they did not escape when they rejected Him who warned them on earth, even less will we if we turn away from Him who warns us from heaven."
Hebrews,12,26,"His voice shook the earth at that time, but now He has promised, Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven."
Hebrews,12,27,"This expression, “Yet once more,” indicates the removal of what can be shaken—that is, created things—so that what is not shaken might remain."
Hebrews,12,28,"Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us hold on to grace. By it, we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and awe,"
Hebrews,12,29,for our God is a consuming fire.
Hebrews,13,1,Let brotherly love continue.
Hebrews,13,2,"Don’t neglect to show hospitality, for by doing this some have welcomed angels as guests without knowing it."
Hebrews,13,3,"Remember the prisoners, as though you were in prison with them, and the mistreated, as though you yourselves were suffering bodily."
Hebrews,13,4,"Marriage must be respected by all, and the marriage bed kept undefiled, because God will judge immoral people and adulterers."
Hebrews,13,5,"Your life should be free from the love of money. Be satisfied with what you have, for He Himself has said, I will never leave you or forsake you."
Hebrews,13,6,"Therefore, we may boldly say: The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?"
Hebrews,13,7,"Remember your leaders who have spoken God’s word to you. As you carefully observe the outcome of their lives, imitate their faith."
Hebrews,13,8,"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever."
Hebrews,13,9,"Don’t be led astray by various kinds of strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be established by grace and not by foods, since those involved in them have not benefited."
Hebrews,13,10,We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle do not have a right to eat.
Hebrews,13,11,For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the most holy place by the high priest as a sin offering are burned outside the camp.
Hebrews,13,12,"Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the gate, so that He might sanctify the people by His own blood."
Hebrews,13,13,"Let us then go to Him outside the camp, bearing His disgrace."
Hebrews,13,14,"For we do not have an enduring city here; instead, we seek the one to come."
Hebrews,13,15,"Therefore, through Him let us continually offer up to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of our lips that confess His name."
Hebrews,13,16,"Don’t neglect to do what is good and to share, for God is pleased with such sacrifices."
Hebrews,13,17,"Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account, so that they can do this with joy and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable for you."
Hebrews,13,18,"Pray for us; for we are convinced that we have a clear conscience, wanting to conduct ourselves honorably in everything."
Hebrews,13,19,And I especially urge you to pray that I may be restored to you very soon.
Hebrews,13,20,"Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus—the great Shepherd of the sheep—with the blood of the everlasting covenant,"
Hebrews,13,21,"equip you with all that is good to do His will, working in us what is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ. Glory belongs to Him forever and ever. Amen."
Hebrews,13,22,"Brothers, I urge you to receive this message of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly."
Hebrews,13,23,"Be aware that our brother Timothy has been released. If he comes soon enough, he will be with me when I see you."
Hebrews,13,24,Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who are from Italy greet you.
Hebrews,13,25,Grace be with all of you.
James,1,1,"James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ: To the 12 tribes in the Dispersion. Greetings."
James,1,2,"Consider it a great joy, my brothers, whenever you experience various trials,"
James,1,3,knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
James,1,4,"But endurance must do its complete work, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing."
James,1,5,"Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without criticizing, and it will be given to him."
James,1,6,"But let him ask in faith without doubting. For the doubter is like the surging sea, driven and tossed by the wind."
James,1,7,That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.
James,1,8,An indecisive man is unstable in all his ways.
James,1,9,"The brother of humble circumstances should boast in his exaltation,"
James,1,10,but the one who is rich should boast in his humiliation because he will pass away like a flower of the field.
James,1,11,"For the sun rises with its scorching heat and dries up the grass; its flower falls off, and its beautiful appearance is destroyed. In the same way, the rich man will wither away while pursuing his activities."
James,1,12,"A man who endures trials is blessed, because when he passes the test he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love Him."
James,1,13,"No one undergoing a trial should say, “I am being tempted by God.” For God is not tempted by evil, and He Himself doesn’t tempt anyone."
James,1,14,But each person is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own evil desires.
James,1,15,"Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death."
James,1,16,"Don’t be deceived, my dearly loved brothers."
James,1,17,"Every generous act and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights; with Him there is no variation or shadow cast by turning."
James,1,18,"By His own choice, He gave us a new birth by the message of truth so that we would be the firstfruits of His creatures."
James,1,19,"My dearly loved brothers, understand this: Everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger,"
James,1,20,for man’s anger does not accomplish God’s righteousness.
James,1,21,"Therefore, ridding yourselves of all moral filth and evil, humbly receive the implanted word, which is able to save you."
James,1,22,"But be doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves."
James,1,23,"Because if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his own face in a mirror."
James,1,24,"For he looks at himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was."
James,1,25,"But the one who looks intently into the perfect law of freedom and perseveres in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but one who does good works—this person will be blessed in what he does."
James,1,26,"If anyone thinks he is religious without controlling his tongue, then his religion is useless and he deceives himself."
James,1,27,Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
James,2,1,"My brothers, do not show favoritism as you hold on to the faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ."
James,2,2,"For example, a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and a poor man dressed in dirty clothes also comes in."
James,2,3,"If you look with favor on the man wearing the fine clothes and say, “Sit here in a good place,” and yet you say to the poor man, “Stand over there,” or, “Sit here on the floor by my footstool,”"
James,2,4,haven’t you discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
James,2,5,"Listen, my dear brothers: Didn’t God choose the poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that He has promised to those who love Him?"
James,2,6,Yet you dishonored that poor man. Don’t the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts?
James,2,7,Don’t they blaspheme the noble name that was pronounced over you at your baptism?
James,2,8,"Indeed, if you keep the royal law prescribed in the Scripture, Love your neighbor as yourself, you are doing well."
James,2,9,"But if you show favoritism, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors."
James,2,10,"For whoever keeps the entire law, yet fails in one point, is guilty of breaking it all."
James,2,11,"For He who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. So if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you are a lawbreaker."
James,2,12,Speak and act as those who will be judged by the law of freedom.
James,2,13,For judgment is without mercy to the one who hasn’t shown mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
James,2,14,"What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can his faith save him?"
James,2,15,If a brother or sister is without clothes and lacks daily food
James,2,16,"and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, keep warm, and eat well,” but you don’t give them what the body needs, what good is it?"
James,2,17,"In the same way faith, if it doesn’t have works, is dead by itself."
James,2,18,"But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I will show you faith from my works."
James,2,19,You believe that God is one; you do well. The demons also believe—and they shudder.
James,2,20,Foolish man! Are you willing to learn that faith without works is useless?
James,2,21,Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar?
James,2,22,"You see that faith was active together with his works, and by works, faith was perfected."
James,2,23,"So the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness, and he was called God’s friend."
James,2,24,You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.
James,2,25,"And in the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by a different route?"
James,2,26,"For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead."
James,3,1,"Not many should become teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive a stricter judgment,"
James,3,2,"for we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a mature man who is also able to control his whole body."
James,3,3,"Now when we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we also guide the whole animal."
James,3,4,"And consider ships: Though very large and driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs."
James,3,5,"So too, though the tongue is a small part of the body, it boasts great things. Consider how large a forest a small fire ignites."
James,3,6,"And the tongue is a fire. The tongue, a world of unrighteousness, is placed among the parts of our bodies. It pollutes the whole body, sets the course of life on fire, and is set on fire by hell."
James,3,7,"Every sea creature, reptile, bird, or animal is tamed and has been tamed by man,"
James,3,8,"but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison."
James,3,9,"We praise our Lord and Father with it, and we curse men who are made in God’s likeness with it."
James,3,10,"Praising and cursing come out of the same mouth. My brothers, these things should not be this way."
James,3,11,Does a spring pour out sweet and bitter water from the same opening?
James,3,12,"Can a fig tree produce olives, my brothers, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a saltwater spring yield fresh water."
James,3,13,Who is wise and has understanding among you? He should show his works by good conduct with wisdom’s gentleness.
James,3,14,"But if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your heart, don’t brag and deny the truth."
James,3,15,"Such wisdom does not come from above but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic."
James,3,16,"For where envy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every kind of evil."
James,3,17,"But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, without favoritism and hypocrisy."
James,3,18,And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who cultivate peace.
James,4,1,What is the source of wars and fights among you? Don’t they come from the cravings that are at war within you?
James,4,2,You desire and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and war. You do not have because you do not ask.
James,4,3,"You ask and don’t receive because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your evil desires."
James,4,4,Adulteresses! Don’t you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? So whoever wants to be the world’s friend becomes God’s enemy.
James,4,5,Or do you think it’s without reason the Scripture says that the Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously?
James,4,6,"But He gives greater grace. Therefore He says: God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
James,4,7,"Therefore, submit to God. But resist the Devil, and he will flee from you."
James,4,8,"Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners, and purify your hearts, double-minded people!"
James,4,9,Be miserable and mourn and weep. Your laughter must change to mourning and your joy to sorrow.
James,4,10,"Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you."
James,4,11,"Don’t criticize one another, brothers. He who criticizes a brother or judges his brother criticizes the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge."
James,4,12,There is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?
James,4,13,"Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will travel to such and such a city and spend a year there and do business and make a profit.”"
James,4,14,"You don’t even know what tomorrow will bring—what your life will be! For you are like smoke that appears for a little while, then vanishes."
James,4,15,"Instead, you should say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.”"
James,4,16,"But as it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil."
James,4,17,So it is a sin for the person who knows to do what is good and doesn’t do it.
James,5,1,"Come now, you rich people! Weep and wail over the miseries that are coming on you."
James,5,2,Your wealth is ruined and your clothes are moth-eaten.
James,5,3,"Your silver and gold are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You stored up treasure in the last days!"
James,5,4,"Look! The pay that you withheld from the workers who reaped your fields cries out, and the outcry of the harvesters has reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts."
James,5,5,You have lived luxuriously on the land and have indulged yourselves. You have fattened your hearts for the day of slaughter.
James,5,6,You have condemned—you have murdered—the righteous man; he does not resist you.
James,5,7,"Therefore, brothers, be patient until the Lord’s coming. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth and is patient with it until it receives the early and the late rains."
James,5,8,"You also must be patient. Strengthen your hearts, because the Lord’s coming is near."
James,5,9,"Brothers, do not complain about one another, so that you will not be judged. Look, the judge stands at the door!"
James,5,10,"Brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the Lord’s name as an example of suffering and patience."
James,5,11,"See, we count as blessed those who have endured. You have heard of Job’s endurance and have seen the outcome from the Lord. The Lord is very compassionate and merciful."
James,5,12,"Now above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath. Your “yes” must be “yes,” and your “no” must be “no,” so that you won’t fall under judgment."
James,5,13,Is anyone among you suffering? He should pray. Is anyone cheerful? He should sing praises.
James,5,14,"Is anyone among you sick? He should call for the elders of the church, and they should pray over him after anointing him with olive oil in the name of the Lord."
James,5,15,"The prayer of faith will save the sick person, and the Lord will restore him to health; if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven."
James,5,16,"Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The urgent request of a righteous person is very powerful in its effect."
James,5,17,"Elijah was a man with a nature like ours; yet he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the land."
James,5,18,"Then he prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the land produced its fruit."
James,5,19,"My brothers, if any among you strays from the truth, and someone turns him back,"
James,5,20,let him know that whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his life from death and cover a multitude of sins.
1 Peter,1,1,"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ: To the temporary residents dispersed in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, chosen"
1 Peter,1,2,according to the foreknowledge of God the Father and set apart by the Spirit for obedience and for sprinkling with the blood of Jesus Christ. May grace and peace be multiplied to you.
1 Peter,1,3,"Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. According to His great mercy, He has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead"
1 Peter,1,4,"and into an inheritance that is imperishable, uncorrupted, and unfading, kept in heaven for you."
1 Peter,1,5,You are being protected by God’s power through faith for a salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
1 Peter,1,6,"You rejoice in this, though now for a short time you have had to struggle in various trials"
1 Peter,1,7,"so that the genuineness of your faith—more valuable than gold, which perishes though refined by fire—may result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,1,8,"You love Him, though you have not seen Him. And though not seeing Him now, you believe in Him and rejoice with inexpressible and glorious joy,"
1 Peter,1,9,"because you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls."
1 Peter,1,10,"Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that would come to you searched and carefully investigated."
1 Peter,1,11,They inquired into what time or what circumstances the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating when He testified in advance to the messianic sufferings and the glories that would follow.
1 Peter,1,12,It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you. These things have now been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Angels desire to look into these things.
1 Peter,1,13,"Therefore, with your minds ready for action, be serious and set your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,1,14,"As obedient children, do not be conformed to the desires of your former ignorance."
1 Peter,1,15,"But as the One who called you is holy, you also are to be holy in all your conduct;"
1 Peter,1,16,"for it is written, Be holy, because I am holy."
1 Peter,1,17,"And if you address as Father the One who judges impartially based on each one’s work, you are to conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your temporary residence."
1 Peter,1,18,"For you know that you were redeemed from your empty way of life inherited from the fathers, not with perishable things like silver or gold,"
1 Peter,1,19,"but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without defect or blemish."
1 Peter,1,20,He was chosen before the foundation of the world but was revealed at the end of the times for you
1 Peter,1,21,"who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God."
1 Peter,1,22,"By obedience to the truth, having purified yourselves for sincere love of the brothers, love one another earnestly from a pure heart,"
1 Peter,1,23,since you have been born again—not of perishable seed but of imperishable—through the living and enduring word of God.
1 Peter,1,24,"For All flesh is like grass, and all its glory like a flower of the grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls,"
1 Peter,1,25,but the word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the word that was preached as the gospel to you.
1 Peter,2,1,"So rid yourselves of all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all slander."
1 Peter,2,2,"Like newborn infants, desire the pure spiritual milk, so that you may grow by it for your salvation,"
1 Peter,2,3,since you have tasted that the Lord is good.
1 Peter,2,4,"Coming to Him, a living stone—rejected by men but chosen and valuable to God—"
1 Peter,2,5,"you yourselves, as living stones, are being built into a spiritual house for a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,2,6,"For it is contained in Scripture: Look! I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and honored cornerstone, and the one who believes in Him will never be put to shame!"
1 Peter,2,7,"So honor will come to you who believe, but for the unbelieving, The stone that the builders rejected— this One has become the cornerstone,"
1 Peter,2,8,"and A stone to stumble over, and a rock to trip over. They stumble because they disobey the message; they were destined for this."
1 Peter,2,9,"But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for His possession, so that you may proclaim the praises of the One who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light."
1 Peter,2,10,"Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people; you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy."
1 Peter,2,11,"Dear friends, I urge you as strangers and temporary residents to abstain from fleshly desires that war against you."
1 Peter,2,12,"Conduct yourselves honorably among the Gentiles, so that in a case where they speak against you as those who do what is evil, they will, by observing your good works, glorify God on the day of visitation."
1 Peter,2,13,"Submit to every human authority because of the Lord, whether to the Emperor as the supreme authority"
1 Peter,2,14,or to governors as those sent out by him to punish those who do what is evil and to praise those who do what is good.
1 Peter,2,15,For it is God’s will that you silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing good.
1 Peter,2,16,"As God’s slaves, live as free people, but don’t use your freedom as a way to conceal evil."
1 Peter,2,17,Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the Emperor.
1 Peter,2,18,"Household slaves, submit with all fear to your masters, not only to the good and gentle but also to the cruel."
1 Peter,2,19,"For it brings favor if, mindful of God’s will, someone endures grief from suffering unjustly."
1 Peter,2,20,"For what credit is there if you sin and are punished, and you endure it? But when you do what is good and suffer, if you endure it, this brings favor with God."
1 Peter,2,21,"For you were called to this, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you should follow in His steps."
1 Peter,2,22,"He did not commit sin, and no deceit was found in His mouth;"
1 Peter,2,23,"when He was reviled, He did not revile in return; when He was suffering, He did not threaten but entrusted Himself to the One who judges justly."
1 Peter,2,24,"He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, so that, having died to sins, we might live for righteousness; you have been healed by His wounds."
1 Peter,2,25,"For you were like sheep going astray, but you have now returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls."
1 Peter,3,1,"In the same way, wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, even if some disobey the Christian message, they may be won over without a message by the way their wives live"
1 Peter,3,2,"when they observe your pure, reverent lives."
1 Peter,3,3,Your beauty should not consist of outward things like elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold ornaments or fine clothes.
1 Peter,3,4,"Instead, it should consist of what is inside the heart with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very valuable in God’s eyes."
1 Peter,3,5,"For in the past, the holy women who put their hope in God also beautified themselves in this way, submitting to their own husbands,"
1 Peter,3,6,"just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. You have become her children when you do what is good and are not frightened by anything alarming."
1 Peter,3,7,"Husbands, in the same way, live with your wives with an understanding of their weaker nature yet showing them honor as coheirs of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered."
1 Peter,3,8,"Now finally, all of you should be like-minded and sympathetic, should love believers, and be compassionate and humble,"
1 Peter,3,9,"not paying back evil for evil or insult for insult but, on the contrary, giving a blessing, since you were called for this, so that you can inherit a blessing."
1 Peter,3,10,"For the one who wants to love life and to see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit,"
1 Peter,3,11,"and he must turn away from evil and do what is good. He must seek peace and pursue it,"
1 Peter,3,12,because the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and His ears are open to their request. But the face of the Lord is against those who do what is evil.
1 Peter,3,13,And who will harm you if you are deeply committed to what is good?
1 Peter,3,14,"But even if you should suffer for righteousness, you are blessed. Do not fear what they fear or be disturbed,"
1 Peter,3,15,but honor the Messiah as Lord in your hearts. Always be ready to give a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you.
1 Peter,3,16,"However, do this with gentleness and respect, keeping your conscience clear, so that when you are accused, those who denounce your Christian life will be put to shame."
1 Peter,3,17,"For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will, than for doing evil."
1 Peter,3,18,"For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, after being put to death in the fleshly realm but made alive in the spiritual realm."
1 Peter,3,19,In that state He also went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison
1 Peter,3,20,"who in the past were disobedient, when God patiently waited in the days of Noah while an ark was being prepared. In it a few—that is, eight people—were saved through water."
1 Peter,3,21,"Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the pledge of a good conscience toward God) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,3,22,"Now that He has gone into heaven, He is at God’s right hand with angels, authorities, and powers subject to Him."
1 Peter,4,1,"Therefore, since Christ suffered in the flesh, equip yourselves also with the same resolve—because the one who suffered in the flesh has finished with sin—"
1 Peter,4,2,"in order to live the remaining time in the flesh, no longer for human desires, but for God’s will."
1 Peter,4,3,"For there has already been enough time spent in doing what the pagans choose to do: carrying on in unrestrained behavior, evil desires, drunkenness, orgies, carousing, and lawless idolatry."
1 Peter,4,4,So they are surprised that you don’t plunge with them into the same flood of wild living—and they slander you.
1 Peter,4,5,They will give an account to the One who stands ready to judge the living and the dead.
1 Peter,4,6,"For this reason the gospel was also preached to those who are now dead, so that, although they might be judged by men in the fleshly realm, they might live by God in the spiritual realm."
1 Peter,4,7,"Now the end of all things is near; therefore, be serious and disciplined for prayer."
1 Peter,4,8,"Above all, maintain an intense love for each other, since love covers a multitude of sins."
1 Peter,4,9,Be hospitable to one another without complaining.
1 Peter,4,10,"Based on the gift each one has received, use it to serve others, as good managers of the varied grace of God."
1 Peter,4,11,"If anyone speaks, it should be as one who speaks God’s words; if anyone serves, it should be from the strength God provides, so that God may be glorified through Jesus Christ in everything. To Him belong the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen."
1 Peter,4,12,"Dear friends, don’t be surprised when the fiery ordeal comes among you to test you as if something unusual were happening to you."
1 Peter,4,13,"Instead, rejoice as you share in the sufferings of the Messiah, so that you may also rejoice with great joy at the revelation of His glory."
1 Peter,4,14,"If you are ridiculed for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you."
1 Peter,4,15,"None of you, however, should suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or a meddler."
1 Peter,4,16,"But if anyone suffers as a “Christian,” he should not be ashamed but should glorify God in having that name."
1 Peter,4,17,"For the time has come for judgment to begin with God’s household, and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who disobey the gospel of God?"
1 Peter,4,18,"And if a righteous person is saved with difficulty, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?"
1 Peter,4,19,"So those who suffer according to God’s will should, while doing what is good, entrust themselves to a faithful Creator."
1 Peter,5,1,"Therefore, as a fellow elder and witness to the sufferings of the Messiah and also a participant in the glory about to be revealed, I exhort the elders among you:"
1 Peter,5,2,"Shepherd God’s flock among you, not overseeing out of compulsion but freely, according to God’s will; not for the money but eagerly;"
1 Peter,5,3,"not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock."
1 Peter,5,4,"And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory."
1 Peter,5,5,"In the same way, you younger men, be subject to the elders. And all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble."
1 Peter,5,6,"Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that He may exalt you at the proper time,"
1 Peter,5,7,"casting all your care on Him, because He cares about you."
1 Peter,5,8,"Be serious! Be alert! Your adversary the Devil is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for anyone he can devour."
1 Peter,5,9,"Resist him and be firm in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are being experienced by your fellow believers throughout the world."
1 Peter,5,10,"Now the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, will personally restore, establish, strengthen, and support you after you have suffered a little."
1 Peter,5,11,The dominion belongs to Him forever. Amen.
1 Peter,5,12,I have written you this brief letter through Silvanus (I know him to be a faithful brother) to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of God. Take your stand in it!
1 Peter,5,13,"The church in Babylon, also chosen, sends you greetings, as does Mark, my son."
1 Peter,5,14,Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
2 Peter,1,1,"Simeon Peter, a slave and an apostle of Jesus Christ: To those who have obtained a faith of equal privilege with ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ."
2 Peter,1,2,May grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
2 Peter,1,3,His divine power has given us everything required for life and godliness through the knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and goodness.
2 Peter,1,4,"By these He has given us very great and precious promises, so that through them you may share in the divine nature, escaping the corruption that is in the world because of evil desires."
2 Peter,1,5,"For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with goodness, goodness with knowledge,"
2 Peter,1,6,"knowledge with self-control, self-control with endurance, endurance with godliness,"
2 Peter,1,7,"godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love."
2 Peter,1,8,"For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they will keep you from being useless or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Peter,1,9,The person who lacks these things is blind and shortsighted and has forgotten the cleansing from his past sins.
2 Peter,1,10,"Therefore, brothers, make every effort to confirm your calling and election, because if you do these things you will never stumble."
2 Peter,1,11,"For in this way, entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly supplied to you."
2 Peter,1,12,"Therefore I will always remind you about these things, even though you know them and are established in the truth you have."
2 Peter,1,13,"I consider it right, as long as I am in this bodily tent, to wake you up with a reminder,"
2 Peter,1,14,"knowing that I will soon lay aside my tent, as our Lord Jesus Christ has also shown me."
2 Peter,1,15,And I will also make every effort that you may be able to recall these things at any time after my departure.
2 Peter,1,16,"For we did not follow cleverly contrived myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; instead, we were eyewitnesses of His majesty."
2 Peter,1,17,"For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, a voice came to Him from the Majestic Glory: This is My beloved Son. I take delight in Him!"
2 Peter,1,18,And we heard this voice when it came from heaven while we were with Him on the holy mountain.
2 Peter,1,19,"So we have the prophetic word strongly confirmed. You will do well to pay attention to it, as to a lamp shining in a dismal place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts."
2 Peter,1,20,"First of all, you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one’s own interpretation,"
2 Peter,1,21,"because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit."
2 Peter,2,1,"But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, and will bring swift destruction on themselves."
2 Peter,2,2,"Many will follow their unrestrained ways, and the way of truth will be blasphemed because of them."
2 Peter,2,3,"They will exploit you in their greed with deceptive words. Their condemnation, pronounced long ago, is not idle, and their destruction does not sleep."
2 Peter,2,4,For if God didn’t spare the angels who sinned but threw them down into Tartarus and delivered them to be kept in chains of darkness until judgment;
2 Peter,2,5,"and if He didn’t spare the ancient world, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others, when He brought a flood on the world of the ungodly;"
2 Peter,2,6,"and if He reduced the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes and condemned them to ruin, making them an example to those who were going to be ungodly;"
2 Peter,2,7,"and if He rescued righteous Lot, distressed by the unrestrained behavior of the immoral"
2 Peter,2,8,"(for as he lived among them, that righteous man tormented himself day by day with the lawless deeds he saw and heard)—"
2 Peter,2,9,"then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment,"
2 Peter,2,10,"especially those who follow the polluting desires of the flesh and despise authority. Bold, arrogant people! They do not tremble when they blaspheme the glorious ones;"
2 Peter,2,11,"however, angels, who are greater in might and power, do not bring a slanderous charge against them before the Lord."
2 Peter,2,12,"But these people, like irrational animals—creatures of instinct born to be caught and destroyed—speak blasphemies about things they don’t understand, and in their destruction they too will be destroyed,"
2 Peter,2,13,"suffering harm as the payment for unrighteousness. They consider it a pleasure to carouse in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes, delighting in their deceptions as they feast with you."
2 Peter,2,14,They have eyes full of adultery and are always looking for sin. They seduce unstable people and have hearts trained in greed. Children under a curse!
2 Peter,2,15,"They have gone astray by abandoning the straight path and have followed the path of Balaam, the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness"
2 Peter,2,16,but received a rebuke for his transgression: A donkey that could not talk spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet’s irrationality.
2 Peter,2,17,"These people are springs without water, mists driven by a whirlwind. The gloom of darkness has been reserved for them."
2 Peter,2,18,"For by uttering boastful, empty words, they seduce, with fleshly desires and debauchery, people who have barely escaped from those who live in error."
2 Peter,2,19,"They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption, since people are enslaved to whatever defeats them."
2 Peter,2,20,"For if, having escaped the world’s impurity through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in these things and defeated, the last state is worse for them than the first."
2 Peter,2,21,"For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy command delivered to them."
2 Peter,2,22,"It has happened to them according to the true proverb: A dog returns to its own vomit, and, “a sow, after washing itself, wallows in the mud.”"
2 Peter,3,1,"Dear friends, this is now the second letter I have written to you; in both letters, I want to develop a genuine understanding with a reminder,"
2 Peter,3,2,so that you can remember the words previously spoken by the holy prophets and the command of our Lord and Savior given through your apostles.
2 Peter,3,3,"First, be aware of this: Scoffers will come in the last days to scoff, living according to their own desires,"
2 Peter,3,4,"saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? Ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they have been since the beginning of creation.”"
2 Peter,3,5,They willfully ignore this: Long ago the heavens and the earth were brought about from water and through water by the word of God.
2 Peter,3,6,Through these waters the world of that time perished when it was flooded.
2 Peter,3,7,"But by the same word, the present heavens and earth are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men."
2 Peter,3,8,"Dear friends, don’t let this one thing escape you: With the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day."
2 Peter,3,9,"The Lord does not delay His promise, as some understand delay, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance."
2 Peter,3,10,"But the Day of the Lord will come like a thief; on that day the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, the elements will burn and be dissolved, and the earth and the works on it will be disclosed."
2 Peter,3,11,"Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, it is clear what sort of people you should be in holy conduct and godliness"
2 Peter,3,12,"as you wait for and earnestly desire the coming of the day of God. The heavens will be on fire and be dissolved because of it, and the elements will melt with the heat."
2 Peter,3,13,"But based on His promise, we wait for the new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will dwell."
2 Peter,3,14,"Therefore, dear friends, while you wait for these things, make every effort to be found at peace with Him without spot or blemish."
2 Peter,3,15,"Also, regard the patience of our Lord as an opportunity for salvation, just as our dear brother Paul has written to you according to the wisdom given to him."
2 Peter,3,16,"He speaks about these things in all his letters in which there are some matters that are hard to understand. The untaught and unstable twist them to their own destruction, as they also do with the rest of the Scriptures."
2 Peter,3,17,"Therefore, dear friends, since you know this in advance, be on your guard, so that you are not led away by the error of lawless people and fall from your own stability."
2 Peter,3,18,But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.
1 John,1,1,"What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have observed and have touched with our hands, concerning the Word of life—"
1 John,1,2,"that life was revealed, and we have seen it and we testify and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us—"
1 John,1,3,"what we have seen and heard we also declare to you, so that you may have fellowship along with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ."
1 John,1,4,We are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.
1 John,1,5,"Now this is the message we have heard from Him and declare to you: God is light, and there is absolutely no darkness in Him."
1 John,1,6,"If we say, “We have fellowship with Him,” yet we walk in darkness, we are lying and are not practicing the truth."
1 John,1,7,"But if we walk in the light as He Himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin."
1 John,1,8,"If we say, “We have no sin,” we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us."
1 John,1,9,"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
1 John,1,10,"If we say, “We don’t have any sin,” we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us."
1 John,2,1,"My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ the Righteous One."
1 John,2,2,"He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not only for ours, but also for those of the whole world."
1 John,2,3,This is how we are sure that we have come to know Him: by keeping His commands.
1 John,2,4,"The one who says, “I have come to know Him,” yet doesn't keep His commands, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."
1 John,2,5,"But whoever keeps His word, truly in him the love of God is perfected. This is how we know we are in Him:"
1 John,2,6,The one who says he remains in Him should walk just as He walked.
1 John,2,7,"Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old command that you have had from the beginning. The old command is the message you have heard."
1 John,2,8,"Yet I am writing you a new command, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining."
1 John,2,9,The one who says he is in the light but hates his brother is in the darkness until now.
1 John,2,10,"The one who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him."
1 John,2,11,"But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness, walks in the darkness, and doesn’t know where he’s going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes."
1 John,2,12,"I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven because of Jesus’ name."
1 John,2,13,"I am writing to you, fathers, because you have come to know the One who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have had victory over the evil one."
1 John,2,14,"I have written to you, children, because you have come to know the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you have come to know the One who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, God’s word remains in you, and you have had victory over the evil one."
1 John,2,15,"Do not love the world or the things that belong to the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him."
1 John,2,16,"For everything that belongs to the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride in one’s lifestyle—is not from the Father, but is from the world."
1 John,2,17,"And the world with its lust is passing away, but the one who does God’s will remains forever."
1 John,2,18,"Children, it is the last hour. And as you have heard, “Antichrist is coming,” even now many antichrists have come. We know from this that it is the last hour."
1 John,2,19,"They went out from us, but they did not belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. However, they went out so that it might be made clear that none of them belongs to us."
1 John,2,20,"But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you have knowledge."
1 John,2,21,"I have not written to you because you don’t know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie comes from the truth."
1 John,2,22,"Who is the liar, if not the one who denies that Jesus is the Messiah? This one is the antichrist: the one who denies the Father and the Son."
1 John,2,23,No one who denies the Son can have the Father; he who confesses the Son has the Father as well.
1 John,2,24,"What you have heard from the beginning must remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, then you will remain in the Son and in the Father."
1 John,2,25,And this is the promise that He Himself made to us: eternal life.
1 John,2,26,I have written these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you.
1 John,2,27,"The anointing you received from Him remains in you, and you don’t need anyone to teach you. Instead, His anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is not a lie; just as He has taught you, remain in Him."
1 John,2,28,"So now, little children, remain in Him, so that when He appears we may have boldness and not be ashamed before Him at His coming."
1 John,2,29,"If you know that He is righteous, you know this as well: Everyone who does what is right has been born of Him."
1 John,3,1,Look at how great a love the Father has given us that we should be called God’s children. And we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it didn’t know Him.
1 John,3,2,"Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him because we will see Him as He is."
1 John,3,3,And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself just as He is pure.
1 John,3,4,Everyone who commits sin also breaks the law; sin is the breaking of law.
1 John,3,5,"You know that He was revealed so that He might take away sins, and there is no sin in Him."
1 John,3,6,Everyone who remains in Him does not sin; everyone who sins has not seen Him or known Him.
1 John,3,7,"Little children, let no one deceive you! The one who does what is right is righteous, just as He is righteous."
1 John,3,8,"The one who commits sin is of the Devil, for the Devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God was revealed for this purpose: to destroy the Devil’s works."
1 John,3,9,"Everyone who has been born of God does not sin, because His seed remains in him; he is not able to sin, because he has been born of God."
1 John,3,10,"Whoever does not do what is right is not of God, especially the one who does not love his brother."
1 John,3,11,"For this is the message you have heard from the beginning: We should love one another,"
1 John,3,12,"unlike Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his works were evil, and his brother’s were righteous."
1 John,3,13,"Do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you."
1 John,3,14,We know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers. The one who does not love remains in death.
1 John,3,15,"Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him."
1 John,3,16,This is how we have come to know love: He laid down His life for us. We should also lay down our lives for our brothers.
1 John,3,17,If anyone has this world’s goods and sees his brother in need but closes his eyes to his need—how can God’s love reside in him?
1 John,3,18,"Little children, we must not love with word or speech, but with truth and action."
1 John,3,19,"This is how we will know we belong to the truth and will convince our conscience in His presence,"
1 John,3,20,"even if our conscience condemns us, that God is greater than our conscience, and He knows all things."
1 John,3,21,"Dear friends, if our conscience doesn’t condemn us, we have confidence before God"
1 John,3,22,and can receive whatever we ask from Him because we keep His commands and do what is pleasing in His sight.
1 John,3,23,"Now this is His command: that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another as He commanded us."
1 John,3,24,"The one who keeps His commands remains in Him, and He in him. And the way we know that He remains in us is from the Spirit He has given us."
1 John,4,1,"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to determine if they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world."
1 John,4,2,This is how you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.
1 John,4,3,"But every spirit who does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist; you have heard that he is coming, and he is already in the world now."
1 John,4,4,"You are from God, little children, and you have conquered them, because the One who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world."
1 John,4,5,"They are from the world. Therefore what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them."
1 John,4,6,We are from God. Anyone who knows God listens to us; anyone who is not from God does not listen to us. From this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.
1 John,4,7,"Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God."
1 John,4,8,"The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love."
1 John,4,9,God’s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent His One and Only Son into the world so that we might live through Him.
1 John,4,10,"Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins."
1 John,4,11,"Dear friends, if God loved us in this way, we also must love one another."
1 John,4,12,"No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God remains in us and His love is perfected in us."
1 John,4,13,This is how we know that we remain in Him and He in us: He has given assurance to us from His Spirit.
1 John,4,14,And we have seen and we testify that the Father has sent His Son as the world’s Savior.
1 John,4,15,Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God—God remains in him and he in God.
1 John,4,16,"And we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him."
1 John,4,17,"In this, love is perfected with us so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, for we are as He is in this world."
1 John,4,18,"There is no fear in love; instead, perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. So the one who fears has not reached perfection in love."
1 John,4,19,We love because He first loved us.
1 John,4,20,"If anyone says, “I love God,” yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For the person who does not love his brother he has seen cannot love the God he has not seen."
1 John,4,21,And we have this command from Him: The one who loves God must also love his brother.
1 John,5,1,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Messiah has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father also loves the one born of Him."
1 John,5,2,This is how we know that we love God’s children when we love God and obey His commands.
1 John,5,3,"For this is what love for God is: to keep His commands. Now His commands are not a burden,"
1 John,5,4,because whatever has been born of God conquers the world. This is the victory that has conquered the world: our faith.
1 John,5,5,And who is the one who conquers the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
1 John,5,6,"Jesus Christ—He is the One who came by water and blood, not by water only, but by water and by blood. And the Spirit is the One who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth."
1 John,5,7,For there are three that testify:
1 John,5,8,"the Spirit, the water, and the blood—and these three are in agreement."
1 John,5,9,"If we accept the testimony of men, God’s testimony is greater, because it is God’s testimony that He has given about His Son."
1 John,5,10,"(The one who believes in the Son of God has this testimony within him. The one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony God has given about His Son.)"
1 John,5,11,"And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son."
1 John,5,12,The one who has the Son has life. The one who doesn’t have the Son of God does not have life.
1 John,5,13,"I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life."
1 John,5,14,"Now this is the confidence we have before Him: Whenever we ask anything according to His will, He hears us."
1 John,5,15,"And if we know that He hears whatever we ask, we know that we have what we have asked Him for."
1 John,5,16,"If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not bring death, he should ask, and God will give life to him—to those who commit sin that doesn’t bring death. There is sin that brings death. I am not saying he should pray about that."
1 John,5,17,"All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin that does not bring death."
1 John,5,18,"We know that everyone who has been born of God does not sin, but the One who is born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him."
1 John,5,19,"We know that we are of God, and the whole world is under the sway of the evil one."
1 John,5,20,"And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know the true One. We are in the true One—that is, in His Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life."
1 John,5,21,"Little children, guard yourselves from idols."
2 John,1,1,"The Elder: To the elect lady and her children: I love all of you in the truth—and not only I, but also all who have come to know the truth—"
2 John,1,2,because of the truth that remains in us and will be with us forever.
2 John,1,3,"Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love."
2 John,1,4,"I was very glad to find some of your children walking in the truth, in keeping with a command we have received from the Father."
2 John,1,5,"So now I urge you, dear lady—not as if I were writing you a new command, but one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another."
2 John,1,6,And this is love: that we walk according to His commands. This is the command as you have heard it from the beginning: you must walk in love.
2 John,1,7,Many deceivers have gone out into the world; they do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
2 John,1,8,"Watch yourselves so you don’t lose what we have worked for, but that you may receive a full reward."
2 John,1,9,"Anyone who does not remain in Christ’s teaching but goes beyond it, does not have God. The one who remains in that teaching, this one has both the Father and the Son."
2 John,1,10,"If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your home, and don’t say, “Welcome,” to him;"
2 John,1,11,"for the one who says, “Welcome,” to him shares in his evil works."
2 John,1,12,"Though I have many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink. Instead, I hope to be with you and talk face to face so that our joy may be complete."
2 John,1,13,The children of your elect sister send you greetings.
3 John,1,1,The Elder: To my dear friend Gaius: I love you in the truth.
3 John,1,2,"Dear friend, I pray that you may prosper in every way and be in good health physically just as you are spiritually."
3 John,1,3,For I was very glad when some brothers came and testified to your faithfulness to the truth—how you are walking in the truth.
3 John,1,4,I have no greater joy than this: to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
3 John,1,5,"Dear friend, you are showing faithfulness by whatever you do for the brothers, especially when they are strangers."
3 John,1,6,"They have testified to your love in front of the church. You will do well to send them on their journey in a manner worthy of God,"
3 John,1,7,"since they set out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from pagans."
3 John,1,8,"Therefore, we ought to support such men so that we can be coworkers with the truth."
3 John,1,9,"I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have first place among them, does not receive us."
3 John,1,10,"This is why, if I come, I will remind him of the works he is doing, slandering us with malicious words. And he is not satisfied with that! He not only refuses to welcome the brothers himself, but he even stops those who want to do so and expels them from the church."
3 John,1,11,"Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God."
3 John,1,12,"Demetrius has a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself. And we also testify for him, and you know that our testimony is true."
3 John,1,13,"I have many things to write you, but I don’t want to write to you with pen and ink."
3 John,1,14,"I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face. Peace be with you. The friends send you greetings. Greet the friends by name."
Jude,1,1,"Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ and a brother of James: To those who are the called, loved by God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ."
Jude,1,2,"May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you."
Jude,1,3,"Dear friends, although I was eager to write you about the salvation we share, I found it necessary to write and exhort you to contend for the faith that was delivered to the saints once for all."
Jude,1,4,"For some men, who were designated for this judgment long ago, have come in by stealth; they are ungodly, turning the grace of our God into promiscuity and denying Jesus Christ, our only Master and Lord."
Jude,1,5,"Now I want to remind you, though you know all these things: The Lord first saved a people out of Egypt and later destroyed those who did not believe;"
Jude,1,6,"and He has kept, with eternal chains in darkness for the judgment of the great day, the angels who did not keep their own position but deserted their proper dwelling."
Jude,1,7,"In the same way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them committed sexual immorality and practiced perversions, just as angels did, and serve as an example by undergoing the punishment of eternal fire."
Jude,1,8,"Nevertheless, these dreamers likewise defile their flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme glorious ones."
Jude,1,9,"Yet Michael the archangel, when he was disputing with the Devil in a debate about Moses’ body, did not dare bring an abusive condemnation against him but said, “The Lord rebuke you!”"
Jude,1,10,But these people blaspheme anything they don’t understand. What they know by instinct like unreasoning animals—they destroy themselves with these things.
Jude,1,11,"Woe to them! For they have traveled in the way of Cain, have abandoned themselves to the error of Balaam for profit, and have perished in Korah’s rebellion."
Jude,1,12,"These are the ones who are like dangerous reefs at your love feasts. They feast with you, nurturing only themselves without fear. They are waterless clouds carried along by winds; trees in late autumn—fruitless, twice dead, pulled out by the roots;"
Jude,1,13,"wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shameful deeds; wandering stars for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved forever!"
Jude,1,14,"And Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied about them: Look! The Lord comes with thousands of His holy ones"
Jude,1,15,"to execute judgment on all and to convict them of all their ungodly acts that they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things ungodly sinners have said against Him."
Jude,1,16,"These people are discontented grumblers, walking according to their desires; their mouths utter arrogant words, flattering people for their own advantage."
Jude,1,17,"But you, dear friends, remember what was predicted by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
Jude,1,18,"they told you, “In the end time there will be scoffers walking according to their own ungodly desires.”"
Jude,1,19,"These people create divisions and are unbelievers, not having the Spirit."
Jude,1,20,"But you, dear friends, as you build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit,"
Jude,1,21,"keep yourselves in the love of God, expecting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for eternal life."
Jude,1,22,Have mercy on those who doubt;
Jude,1,23,"save others by snatching them from the fire; have mercy on others but with fear, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh."
Jude,1,24,"Now to Him who is able to protect you from stumbling and to make you stand in the presence of His glory, blameless and with great joy,"
Jude,1,25,"to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, power, and authority before all time, now and forever. Amen."
Revelation,1,1,"The revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave Him to show His slaves what must quickly take place. He sent it and signified it through His angel to His slave John,"
Revelation,1,2,"who testified to God’s word and to the testimony about Jesus Christ, in all he saw."
Revelation,1,3,"The one who reads this is blessed, and those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep what is written in it are blessed, because the time is near!"
Revelation,1,4,"John: To the seven churches in Asia. Grace and peace to you from the One who is, who was, and who is coming; from the seven spirits before His throne;"
Revelation,1,5,"and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and has set us free from our sins by His blood,"
Revelation,1,6,"and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father—the glory and dominion are His forever and ever. Amen."
Revelation,1,7,"Look! He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, including those who pierced Him. And all the families of the earth will mourn over Him. This is certain. Amen."

Revelation,1,9,"I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of God’s word and the testimony about Jesus."
Revelation,1,10,"I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard a loud voice behind me like a trumpet"
Revelation,1,11,"saying, “Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”"
Revelation,1,12,"I turned to see whose voice it was that spoke to me. When I turned I saw seven gold lampstands,"
Revelation,1,13,"and among the lampstands was One like the Son of Man, dressed in a long robe and with a gold sash wrapped around His chest."
Revelation,1,14,His head and hair were white like wool—white as snow—and His eyes like a fiery flame.
Revelation,1,15,"His feet were like fine bronze as it is fired in a furnace, and His voice like the sound of cascading waters."
Revelation,1,16,"He had seven stars in His right hand; a sharp double-edged sword came from His mouth, and His face was shining like the sun at midday."
Revelation,1,17,"When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. He laid His right hand on me and said, “Don’t be afraid! I am the First and the Last,"
Revelation,1,18,"and the Living One. I was dead, but look—I am alive forever and ever, and I hold the keys of death and Hades."
Revelation,1,19,"Therefore write what you have seen, what is, and what will take place after this."
Revelation,1,20,"The secret of the seven stars you saw in My right hand and of the seven gold lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."
Revelation,2,1,“Write to the angel of the church in Ephesus: “The One who holds the seven stars in His right hand and who walks among the seven gold lampstands says:
Revelation,2,2,"I know your works, your labor, and your endurance, and that you cannot tolerate evil. You have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and you have found them to be liars."
Revelation,2,3,You also possess endurance and have tolerated many things because of My name and have not grown weary.
Revelation,2,4,But I have this against you: You have abandoned the love you had at first.
Revelation,2,5,"Remember then how far you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place—unless you repent."
Revelation,2,6,"Yet you do have this: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."
Revelation,2,7,"“Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give the victor the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in God’s paradise."
Revelation,2,8,"“Write to the angel of the church in Smyrna: “The First and the Last, the One who was dead and came to life, says:"
Revelation,2,9,"I know your affliction and poverty, yet you are rich. I know the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan."
Revelation,2,10,"Don’t be afraid of what you are about to suffer. Look, the Devil is about to throw some of you into prison to test you, and you will have affliction for 10 days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life."
Revelation,2,11,“Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. The victor will never be harmed by the second death.
Revelation,2,12,"“Write to the angel of the church in Pergamum: “The One who has the sharp, double-edged sword says:"
Revelation,2,13,"I know where you live—where Satan’s throne is! And you are holding on to My name and did not deny your faith in Me, even in the days of Antipas, My faithful witness who was killed among you, where Satan lives."
Revelation,2,14,"But I have a few things against you. You have some there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to place a stumbling block in front of the Israelites: to eat meat sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality."
Revelation,2,15,"In the same way, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans."
Revelation,2,16,"Therefore repent! Otherwise, I will come to you quickly and fight against them with the sword of My mouth."
Revelation,2,17,"“Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give the victor some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name is inscribed that no one knows except the one who receives it."
Revelation,2,18,"“Write to the angel of the church in Thyatira: “The Son of God, the One whose eyes are like a fiery flame and whose feet are like fine bronze, says:"
Revelation,2,19,"I know your works—your love, faithfulness, service, and endurance. Your last works are greater than the first."
Revelation,2,20,"But I have this against you: You tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and deceives My slaves to commit sexual immorality and to eat meat sacrificed to idols."
Revelation,2,21,"I gave her time to repent, but she does not want to repent of her sexual immorality."
Revelation,2,22,"Look! I will throw her into a sickbed and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her practices."
Revelation,2,23,"I will kill her children with the plague. Then all the churches will know that I am the One who examines minds and hearts, and I will give to each of you according to your works."
Revelation,2,24,"I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who haven’t known the deep things of Satan—as they say—I do not put any other burden on you."
Revelation,2,25,But hold on to what you have until I come.
Revelation,2,26,The one who is victorious and keeps My works to the end: I will give him authority over the nations—
Revelation,2,27,and he will shepherd them with an iron scepter; he will shatter them like pottery— just as I have received this from My Father.
Revelation,2,28,I will also give him the morning star.

Revelation,3,2,"Be alert and strengthen what remains, which is about to die, for I have not found your works complete before My God."
Revelation,3,3,"Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; keep it, and repent. But if you are not alert, I will come like a thief, and you have no idea at what hour I will come against you."
Revelation,3,4,"But you have a few people in Sardis who have not defiled their clothes, and they will walk with Me in white, because they are worthy."

Revelation,3,7,"“Write to the angel of the church in Philadelphia: “The Holy One, the True One, the One who has the key of David, who opens and no one will close, and closes and no one opens says:"
Revelation,3,8,"I know your works. Because you have limited strength, have kept My word, and have not denied My name, look, I have placed before you an open door that no one is able to close."
Revelation,3,9,"Take note! I will make those from the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews and are not, but are lying—note this—I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and they will know that I have loved you."
Revelation,3,10,"Because you have kept My command to endure, I will also keep you from the hour of testing that is going to come over the whole world to test those who live on the earth."
Revelation,3,11,"I am coming quickly. Hold on to what you have, so that no one takes your crown."
Revelation,3,12,"The victor: I will make him a pillar in the sanctuary of My God, and he will never go out again. I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God—the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God—and My new name."

Revelation,3,16,"So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am going to vomit you out of My mouth."
Revelation,3,17,"Because you say, ‘I’m rich; I have become wealthy and need nothing,’ and you don’t know that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked,"
Revelation,3,18,"I advise you to buy from Me gold refined in the fire so that you may be rich, white clothes so that you may be dressed and your shameful nakedness not be exposed, and ointment to spread on your eyes so that you may see."
Revelation,3,19,"As many as I love, I rebuke and discipline. So be committed and repent."

Revelation,4,1,"After this I looked, and there in heaven was an open door. The first voice that I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.”"
Revelation,4,2,"Immediately I was in the Spirit, and a throne was set there in heaven. One was seated on the throne,"
Revelation,4,3,and the One seated looked like jasper and carnelian stone. A rainbow that looked like an emerald surrounded the throne.
Revelation,4,4,"Around that throne were 24 thrones, and on the thrones sat 24 elders dressed in white clothes, with gold crowns on their heads."
Revelation,4,5,"Flashes of lightning and rumblings of thunder came from the throne. Seven fiery torches were burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God."
Revelation,4,6,"Something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal, was also before the throne. Four living creatures covered with eyes in front and in back were in the middle and around the throne."
Revelation,4,7,The first living creature was like a lion; the second living creature was like a calf; the third living creature had a face like a man; and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.
Revelation,4,8,"Each of the four living creatures had six wings; they were covered with eyes around and inside. Day and night they never stop, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God, the Almighty, who was, who is, and who is coming."
Revelation,4,9,"Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the One seated on the throne, the One who lives forever and ever,"
Revelation,4,10,"the 24 elders fall down before the One seated on the throne, worship the One who lives forever and ever, cast their crowns before the throne, and say:"
Revelation,4,11,"Our Lord and God, You are worthy to receive glory and honor and power, because You have created all things, and because of Your will they exist and were created."
Revelation,5,1,"Then I saw in the right hand of the One seated on the throne a scroll with writing on the inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals."
Revelation,5,2,"I also saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”"
Revelation,5,3,But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or even to look in it.
Revelation,5,4,And I cried and cried because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or even to look in it.
Revelation,5,5,"Then one of the elders said to me, “Stop crying. Look! The Lion from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has been victorious so that He may open the scroll and its seven seals.”"
Revelation,5,6,"Then I saw One like a slaughtered lamb standing between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent into all the earth."
Revelation,5,7,He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of the One seated on the throne.
Revelation,5,8,"When He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and gold bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of the saints."
Revelation,5,9,"And they sang a new song: You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because You were slaughtered, and You redeemed people for God by Your blood from every tribe and language and people and nation."
Revelation,5,10,"You made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will reign on the earth."
Revelation,5,11,"Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels around the throne, and also of the living creatures and of the elders. Their number was countless thousands, plus thousands of thousands."
Revelation,5,12,They said with a loud voice: The Lamb who was slaughtered is worthy to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing!
Revelation,5,13,"I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them say: Blessing and honor and glory and dominion to the One seated on the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever!"
Revelation,5,14,"The four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and worshiped."
Revelation,6,1,"Then I saw the Lamb open one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, “Come!”"
Revelation,6,2,"I looked, and there was a white horse. The horseman on it had a bow; a crown was given to him, and he went out as a victor to conquer."
Revelation,6,3,"When He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come!”"
Revelation,6,4,"Then another horse went out, a fiery red one, and its horseman was empowered to take peace from the earth, so that people would slaughter one another. And a large sword was given to him."
Revelation,6,5,"When He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” And I looked, and there was a black horse. The horseman on it had a set of scales in his hand."
Revelation,6,6,"Then I heard something like a voice among the four living creatures say, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius—but do not harm the olive oil and the wine.”"
Revelation,6,7,"When He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!”"
Revelation,6,8,"And I looked, and there was a pale green horse. The horseman on it was named Death, and Hades was following after him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill by the sword, by famine, by plague, and by the wild animals of the earth."
Revelation,6,9,"When He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the people slaughtered because of God’s word and the testimony they had."
Revelation,6,10,"They cried out with a loud voice: “Lord, the One who is holy and true, how long until You judge and avenge our blood from those who live on the earth?”"
Revelation,6,11,"So a white robe was given to each of them, and they were told to rest a little while longer until the number would be completed of their fellow slaves and their brothers, who were going to be killed just as they had been."
Revelation,6,12,Then I saw Him open the sixth seal. A violent earthquake occurred; the sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair; the entire moon became like blood;
Revelation,6,13,the stars of heaven fell to the earth as a fig tree drops its unripe figs when shaken by a high wind;
Revelation,6,14,the sky separated like a scroll being rolled up; and every mountain and island was moved from its place.
Revelation,6,15,"Then the kings of the earth, the nobles, the military commanders, the rich, the powerful, and every slave and free person hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains."
Revelation,6,16,"And they said to the mountains and to the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the One seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,"
Revelation,6,17,because the great day of Their wrath has come! And who is able to stand?”
Revelation,7,1,"After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, restraining the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree."
Revelation,7,2,"Then I saw another angel, who had the seal of the living God rise up from the east. He cried out in a loud voice to the four angels who were empowered to harm the earth and the sea:"
Revelation,7,3,“Don’t harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we seal the slaves of our God on their foreheads.”
Revelation,7,4,"And I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 sealed from every tribe of the Israelites:"
Revelation,7,5,"12,000 sealed from the tribe of Judah, 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben, 12,000 from the tribe of Gad,"
Revelation,7,6,"12,000 from the tribe of Asher, 12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh,"
Revelation,7,7,"12,000 from the tribe of Simeon, 12,000 from the tribe of Levi, 12,000 from the tribe of Issachar,"
Revelation,7,8,"12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph, 12,000 sealed from the tribe of Benjamin."
Revelation,7,9,"After this I looked, and there was a vast multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language, which no one could number, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were robed in white with palm branches in their hands."
Revelation,7,10,"And they cried out in a loud voice: Salvation belongs to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!"
Revelation,7,11,"All the angels stood around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures, and they fell facedown before the throne and worshiped God,"
Revelation,7,12,saying: Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and strength be to our God forever and ever. Amen.
Revelation,7,13,"Then one of the elders asked me, “Who are these people robed in white, and where did they come from?”"
Revelation,7,14,"I said to him, “Sir, you know.” Then he told me: These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
Revelation,7,15,"For this reason they are before the throne of God, and they serve Him day and night in His sanctuary. The One seated on the throne will shelter them:"
Revelation,7,16,"They will no longer hunger; they will no longer thirst; the sun will no longer strike them, nor will any heat."
Revelation,7,17,"For the Lamb who is at the center of the throne will shepherd them; He will guide them to springs of living waters, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."
Revelation,8,1,"When He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour."
Revelation,8,2,Then I saw the seven angels who stand in the presence of God; seven trumpets were given to them.
Revelation,8,3,"Another angel, with a gold incense burner, came and stood at the altar. He was given a large amount of incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the gold altar in front of the throne."
Revelation,8,4,"The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up in the presence of God from the angel’s hand."
Revelation,8,5,"The angel took the incense burner, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it to the earth; there were rumblings of thunder, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake."
Revelation,8,6,And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.
Revelation,8,7,"The first angel blew his trumpet, and hail and fire, mixed with blood, were hurled to the earth. So a third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up."
Revelation,8,8,"The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain ablaze with fire was hurled into the sea. So a third of the sea became blood,"
Revelation,8,9,"a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed."
Revelation,8,10,"The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from heaven. It fell on a third of the rivers and springs of water."
Revelation,8,11,"The name of the star is Wormwood, and a third of the waters became wormwood. So, many of the people died from the waters, because they had been made bitter."
Revelation,8,12,"The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day was without light, and the night as well."
Revelation,8,13,"I looked again and heard an eagle flying high overhead, crying out in a loud voice, “Woe! Woe! Woe to those who live on the earth, because of the remaining trumpet blasts that the three angels are about to sound!”"
Revelation,9,1,"The fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth. The key to the shaft of the abyss was given to him."
Revelation,9,2,"He opened the shaft of the abyss, and smoke came up out of the shaft like smoke from a great furnace so that the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the shaft."
Revelation,9,3,"Then locusts came out of the smoke on to the earth, and power was given to them like the power that scorpions have on the earth."
Revelation,9,4,"They were told not to harm the grass of the earth, or any green plant, or any tree, but only people who do not have God’s seal on their foreheads."
Revelation,9,5,They were not permitted to kill them but were to torment them for five months; their torment is like the torment caused by a scorpion when it strikes a man.
Revelation,9,6,"In those days people will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, but death will flee from them."
Revelation,9,7,The appearance of the locusts was like horses equipped for battle. Something like gold crowns was on their heads; their faces were like men’s faces;
Revelation,9,8,they had hair like women’s hair; their teeth were like lions’ teeth;
Revelation,9,9,they had chests like iron breastplates; the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots with many horses rushing into battle;
Revelation,9,10,"and they had tails with stingers like scorpions, so that with their tails they had the power to harm people for five months."
Revelation,9,11,"They had as their king the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon."
Revelation,9,12,The first woe has passed. There are still two more woes to come after this.
Revelation,9,13,"The sixth angel blew his trumpet. From the four horns of the gold altar that is before God, I heard a voice"
Revelation,9,14,"say to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels bound at the great river Euphrates.”"
Revelation,9,15,"So the four angels who were prepared for the hour, day, month, and year were released to kill a third of the human race."
Revelation,9,16,The number of mounted troops was 200 million; I heard their number.
Revelation,9,17,"This is how I saw the horses in my vision: The horsemen had breastplates that were fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow. The heads of the horses were like lions’ heads, and from their mouths came fire, smoke, and sulfur."
Revelation,9,18,"A third of the human race was killed by these three plagues—by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came from their mouths."
Revelation,9,19,"For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails, which resemble snakes, have heads, and they inflict injury with them."
Revelation,9,20,"The rest of the people, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands to stop worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which are not able to see, hear, or walk."
Revelation,9,21,"And they did not repent of their murders, their sorceries, their sexual immorality, or their thefts."
Revelation,10,1,"Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, surrounded by a cloud, with a rainbow over his head. His face was like the sun, his legs were like fiery pillars,"
Revelation,10,2,"and he had a little scroll opened in his hand. He put his right foot on the sea, his left on the land,"
Revelation,10,3,"and he cried out with a loud voice like a roaring lion. When he cried out, the seven thunders spoke with their voices."
Revelation,10,4,"And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write. Then I heard a voice from heaven, saying, “Seal up what the seven thunders said, and do not write it down!”"
Revelation,10,5,Then the angel that I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.
Revelation,10,6,"He swore an oath by the One who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it: “There will no longer be an interval of time,"
Revelation,10,7,"but in the days of the sound of the seventh angel, when he will blow his trumpet, then God’s hidden plan will be completed, as He announced to His servants the prophets.”"
Revelation,10,8,"Now the voice that I heard from heaven spoke to me again and said, “Go, take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”"
Revelation,10,9,"So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, “Take and eat it; it will be bitter in your stomach, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth.”"
Revelation,10,10,"Then I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I ate it, my stomach became bitter."
Revelation,10,11,"And I was told, “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.”"
Revelation,11,1,"Then I was given a measuring reed like a rod, with these words: “Go and measure God’s sanctuary and the altar, and count those who worship there."
Revelation,11,2,"But exclude the courtyard outside the sanctuary. Don’t measure it, because it is given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for 42 months."
Revelation,11,3,"I will empower my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth.”"
Revelation,11,4,These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
Revelation,11,5,"If anyone wants to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies; if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way."
Revelation,11,6,These men have the power to close up the sky so that it does not rain during the days of their prophecy. They also have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every plague whenever they want.
Revelation,11,7,"When they finish their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, conquer them, and kill them."
Revelation,11,8,"Their dead bodies will lie in the public square of the great city, which prophetically is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified."
Revelation,11,9,"And representatives from the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will view their bodies for three and a half days and not permit their bodies to be put into a tomb."
Revelation,11,10,Those who live on the earth will gloat over them and celebrate and send gifts to one another because these two prophets brought judgment to those who live on the earth.
Revelation,11,11,"But after 3½ days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet. So great fear fell on those who saw them."
Revelation,11,12,"Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” They went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies watched them."
Revelation,11,13,"At that moment a violent earthquake took place, a tenth of the city fell, and 7,000 people were killed in the earthquake. The survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven."
Revelation,11,14,The second woe has passed. Take note: The third woe is coming quickly!
Revelation,11,15,"The seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven saying: The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Messiah, and He will reign forever and ever!"
Revelation,11,16,"The 24 elders, who were seated before God on their thrones, fell facedown and worshiped God,"
Revelation,11,17,"saying: We thank You, Lord God, the Almighty, who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign."
Revelation,11,18,"The nations were angry, but Your wrath has come. The time has come for the dead to be judged and to give the reward to Your servants the prophets, to the saints, and to those who fear Your name, both small and great, and the time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth."
Revelation,11,19,"God’s sanctuary in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant appeared in His sanctuary. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings of thunder, an earthquake, and severe hail."
Revelation,12,1,"A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of 12 stars on her head."
Revelation,12,2,She was pregnant and cried out in labor and agony as she was about to give birth.
Revelation,12,3,"Then another sign appeared in heaven: There was a great fiery red dragon having seven heads and 10 horns, and on his heads were seven diadems."
Revelation,12,4,"His tail swept away a third of the stars in heaven and hurled them to the earth. And the dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she did give birth he might devour her child."
Revelation,12,5,But she gave birth to a Son—a male who is going to shepherd all nations with an iron scepter—and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.
Revelation,12,6,"The woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God, to be fed there for 1,260 days."
Revelation,12,7,"Then war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels also fought,"
Revelation,12,8,"but he could not prevail, and there was no place for them in heaven any longer."
Revelation,12,9,"So the great dragon was thrown out—the ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the one who deceives the whole world. He was thrown to earth, and his angels with him."
Revelation,12,10,"Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: The salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Messiah have now come, because the accuser of our brothers has been thrown out: the one who accuses them before our God day and night."
Revelation,12,11,"They conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they did not love their lives in the face of death."
Revelation,12,12,"Therefore rejoice, you heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the earth and the sea, for the Devil has come down to you with great fury, because he knows he has a short time."
Revelation,12,13,"When the dragon saw that he had been thrown to earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child."
Revelation,12,14,"The woman was given two wings of a great eagle, so that she could fly from the serpent’s presence to her place in the wilderness, where she was fed for a time, times, and half a time."
Revelation,12,15,"From his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river flowing after the woman, to sweep her away in a torrent."
Revelation,12,16,But the earth helped the woman. The earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon had spewed from his mouth.
Revelation,12,17,So the dragon was furious with the woman and left to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and have the testimony about Jesus.
Revelation,13,1,"And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea. He had 10 horns and seven heads. On his horns were 10 diadems, and on his heads were blasphemous names."
Revelation,13,2,"The beast I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like a bear’s, and his mouth was like a lion’s mouth. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority."
Revelation,13,3,"One of his heads appeared to be fatally wounded, but his fatal wound was healed. The whole earth was amazed and followed the beast."
Revelation,13,4,"They worshiped the dragon because he gave authority to the beast. And they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast? Who is able to wage war against him?”"
Revelation,13,5,A mouth was given to him to speak boasts and blasphemies. He was also given authority to act for 42 months.
Revelation,13,6,He began to speak blasphemies against God: to blaspheme His name and His dwelling—those who dwell in heaven.
Revelation,13,7,"And he was permitted to wage war against the saints and to conquer them. He was also given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation."
Revelation,13,8,"All those who live on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name was not written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slaughtered."
Revelation,13,9,"If anyone has an ear, he should listen:"
Revelation,13,10,"If anyone is destined for captivity, into captivity he goes. If anyone is to be killed with a sword, with a sword he will be killed. This demands the perseverance and faith of the saints."
Revelation,13,11,"Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; he had two horns like a lamb, but he sounded like a dragon."
Revelation,13,12,"He exercises all the authority of the first beast on his behalf and compels the earth and those who live on it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed."
Revelation,13,13,"He also performs great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in front of people."
Revelation,13,14,"He deceives those who live on the earth because of the signs that he is permitted to perform on behalf of the beast, telling those who live on the earth to make an image of the beast who had the sword wound and yet lived."
Revelation,13,15,"He was permitted to give a spirit to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast could both speak and cause whoever would not worship the image of the beast to be killed."
Revelation,13,16,"And he requires everyone—small and great, rich and poor, free and slave—to be given a mark on his right hand or on his forehead,"
Revelation,13,17,so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark: the beast’s name or the number of his name.
Revelation,13,18,"Here is wisdom: The one who has understanding must calculate the number of the beast, because it is the number of a man. His number is 666."
Revelation,14,1,"Then I looked, and there on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with Him were 144,000 who had His name and His Father’s name written on their foreheads."
Revelation,14,2,I heard a sound from heaven like the sound of cascading waters and like the rumbling of loud thunder. The sound I heard was also like harpists playing on their harps.
Revelation,14,3,"They sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders, but no one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth."
Revelation,14,4,"These are the ones not defiled with women, for they have kept their virginity. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. They were redeemed from the human race as the firstfruits for God and the Lamb."
Revelation,14,5,No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.
Revelation,14,6,"Then I saw another angel flying high overhead, having the eternal gospel to announce to the inhabitants of the earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people."
Revelation,14,7,"He spoke with a loud voice: “Fear God and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come. Worship the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.”"
Revelation,14,8,"A second angel followed, saying: “It has fallen, Babylon the Great has fallen, who made all nations drink the wine of her sexual immorality, which brings wrath.”"
Revelation,14,9,"And a third angel followed them and spoke with a loud voice: “If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,"
Revelation,14,10,"he will also drink the wine of God’s wrath, which is mixed full strength in the cup of His anger. He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb,"
Revelation,14,11,"and the smoke of their torment will go up forever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or anyone who receives the mark of his name."
Revelation,14,12,"This demands the perseverance of the saints, who keep God’s commands and their faith in Jesus.”"
Revelation,14,13,"Then I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write: The dead who die in the Lord from now on are blessed.” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “let them rest from their labors, for their works follow them!”"
Revelation,14,14,"Then I looked, and there was a white cloud, and One like the Son of Man was seated on the cloud, with a gold crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand."
Revelation,14,15,"Another angel came out of the sanctuary, crying out in a loud voice to the One who was seated on the cloud, “Use your sickle and reap, for the time to reap has come, since the harvest of the earth is ripe.”"
Revelation,14,16,"So the One seated on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested."
Revelation,14,17,Then another angel who also had a sharp sickle came out of the sanctuary in heaven.
Revelation,14,18,"Yet another angel, who had authority over fire, came from the altar, and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, “Use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from earth’s vineyard, because its grapes have ripened.”"
Revelation,14,19,"So the angel swung his sickle toward earth and gathered the grapes from earth’s vineyard, and he threw them into the great winepress of God’s wrath."
Revelation,14,20,"Then the press was trampled outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press up to the horses’ bridles for about 180 miles."
Revelation,15,1,"Then I saw another great and awe-inspiring sign in heaven: seven angels with the seven last plagues, for with them, God’s wrath will be completed."
Revelation,15,2,"I also saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had won the victory over the beast, his image, and the number of his name, were standing on the sea of glass with harps from God."
Revelation,15,3,"They sang the song of God’s servant Moses and the song of the Lamb: Great and awe-inspiring are Your works, Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are Your ways, King of the Nations."
Revelation,15,4,"Lord, who will not fear and glorify Your name? Because You alone are holy, for all the nations will come and worship before You because Your righteous acts have been revealed."
Revelation,15,5,"After this I looked, and the heavenly sanctuary—the tabernacle of testimony—was opened."
Revelation,15,6,"Out of the sanctuary came the seven angels with the seven plagues, dressed in clean, bright linen, with gold sashes wrapped around their chests."
Revelation,15,7,One of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven gold bowls filled with the wrath of God who lives forever and ever.
Revelation,15,8,"Then the sanctuary was filled with smoke from God’s glory and from His power, and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed."
Revelation,16,1,"Then I heard a loud voice from the sanctuary saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath on the earth.”"
Revelation,16,2,"The first went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and severely painful sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image."
Revelation,16,3,"The second poured out his bowl into the sea. It turned to blood like a dead man’s, and all life in the sea died."
Revelation,16,4,"The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood."
Revelation,16,5,"I heard the angel of the waters say: You are righteous, who is and who was, the Holy One, for You have decided these things."
Revelation,16,6,"Because they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets, You also gave them blood to drink; they deserve it!"
Revelation,16,7,"Then I heard someone from the altar say: Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments."
Revelation,16,8,"The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun. He was given the power to burn people with fire,"
Revelation,16,9,"and people were burned by the intense heat. So they blasphemed the name of God, who had the power over these plagues, and they did not repent and give Him glory."
Revelation,16,10,"The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues because of their pain"
Revelation,16,11,"and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, yet they did not repent of their actions."
Revelation,16,12,"The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east."
Revelation,16,13,"Then I saw three unclean spirits like frogs coming from the dragon’s mouth, from the beast’s mouth, and from the mouth of the false prophet."
Revelation,16,14,"For they are spirits of demons performing signs, who travel to the kings of the whole world to assemble them for the battle of the great day of God, the Almighty."
Revelation,16,15,"“Look, I am coming like a thief. The one who is alert and remains clothed so that he may not go around naked and people see his shame is blessed.”"
Revelation,16,16,"So they assembled them at the place called in Hebrew, Armagedon."
Revelation,16,17,"Then the seventh poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the sanctuary from the throne, saying, “It is done!”"
Revelation,16,18,There were flashes of lightning and rumblings of thunder. And a severe earthquake occurred like no other since man has been on the earth—so great was the quake.
Revelation,16,19,"The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the Great was remembered in God’s presence; He gave her the cup filled with the wine of His fierce anger."
Revelation,16,20,"Every island fled, and the mountains disappeared."
Revelation,16,21,"Enormous hailstones, each weighing about 100 pounds, fell from the sky on people, and they blasphemed God for the plague of hail because that plague was extremely severe."
Revelation,17,1,"Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me: “Come, I will show you the judgment of the notorious prostitute who sits on many waters."
Revelation,17,2,"The kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and those who live on the earth became drunk on the wine of her sexual immorality.”"
Revelation,17,3,So he carried me away in the Spirit to a desert. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and 10 horns.
Revelation,17,4,"The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She had a gold cup in her hand filled with everything vile and with the impurities of her prostitution."
Revelation,17,5,On her forehead a cryptic name was written: BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE VILE THINGS OF THE EARTH.
Revelation,17,6,"Then I saw that the woman was drunk on the blood of the saints and on the blood of the witnesses to Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished."
Revelation,17,7,"Then the angel said to me, “Why are you astonished? I will tell you the secret meaning of the woman and of the beast, with the seven heads and the 10 horns, that carries her."
Revelation,17,8,"The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up from the abyss and go to destruction. Those who live on the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast that was, and is not, and will be present again."
Revelation,17,9,“Here is the mind with wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated.
Revelation,17,10,"They are also seven kings: Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he comes, he must remain for a little while."
Revelation,17,11,"The beast that was and is not, is himself an eighth king, yet he belongs to the seven and is going to destruction."
Revelation,17,12,"The 10 horns you saw are 10 kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they will receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour."
Revelation,17,13,"These have one purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast."
Revelation,17,14,"These will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them because He is Lord of lords and King of kings. Those with Him are called, chosen, and faithful.”"
Revelation,17,15,"He also said to me, “The waters you saw, where the prostitute was seated, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages."
Revelation,17,16,"The 10 horns you saw, and the beast, will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, devour her flesh, and burn her up with fire."
Revelation,17,17,For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His plan by having one purpose and to give their kingdom to the beast until God’s words are accomplished.
Revelation,17,18,And the woman you saw is the great city that has an empire over the kings of the earth.”
Revelation,18,1,"After this I saw another angel with great authority coming down from heaven, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor."
Revelation,18,2,"He cried in a mighty voice: It has fallen, Babylon the Great has fallen! She has become a dwelling for demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird, and a haunt for every unclean and despicable beast."
Revelation,18,3,"For all the nations have drunk the wine of her sexual immorality, which brings wrath. The kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown wealthy from her excessive luxury."
Revelation,18,4,"Then I heard another voice from heaven: Come out of her, My people, so that you will not share in her sins or receive any of her plagues."
Revelation,18,5,"For her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes."
Revelation,18,6,"Pay her back the way she also paid, and double it according to her works. In the cup in which she mixed, mix a double portion for her."
Revelation,18,7,"As much as she glorified herself and lived luxuriously, give her that much torment and grief, for she says in her heart, “I sit as a queen; I am not a widow, and I will never see grief.”"
Revelation,18,8,"For this reason her plagues will come in one day— death and grief and famine. She will be burned up with fire, because the Lord God who judges her is mighty."
Revelation,18,9,The kings of the earth who have committed sexual immorality and lived luxuriously with her will weep and mourn over her when they see the smoke of her burning.
Revelation,18,10,"They will stand far off in fear of her torment, saying: Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the mighty city! For in a single hour your judgment has come."
Revelation,18,11,"The merchants of the earth will also weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their merchandise any longer—"
Revelation,18,12,"merchandise of gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls; fine fabrics of linen, purple, silk, and scarlet; all kinds of fragrant wood products; objects of ivory; objects of expensive wood, brass, iron, and marble;"
Revelation,18,13,"cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, and frankincense; wine, olive oil, fine wheat flour, and grain; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and slaves and human lives."
Revelation,18,14,The fruit you craved has left you. All your splendid and glamorous things are gone; they will never find them again.
Revelation,18,15,"The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand far off in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,"
Revelation,18,16,"saying: Woe, woe, the great city, dressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls,"
Revelation,18,17,"for in a single hour such fabulous wealth was destroyed! And every shipmaster, seafarer, the sailors, and all who do business by sea, stood far off"
Revelation,18,18,as they watched the smoke from her burning and kept crying out: “Who is like the great city?”
Revelation,18,19,"They threw dust on their heads and kept crying out, weeping, and mourning: Woe, woe, the great city, where all those who have ships on the sea became rich from her wealth, for in a single hour she was destroyed."
Revelation,18,20,"Rejoice over her, heaven, and you saints, apostles, and prophets, because God has executed your judgment on her!"
Revelation,18,21,"Then a mighty angel picked up a stone like a large millstone and threw it into the sea, saying: In this way, Babylon the great city will be thrown down violently and never be found again."
Revelation,18,22,"The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters will never be heard in you again; no craftsman of any trade will ever be found in you again; the sound of a mill will never be heard in you again;"
Revelation,18,23,"the light of a lamp will never shine in you again; and the voice of a groom and bride will never be heard in you again. All this will happen because your merchants were the nobility of the earth, because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery,"
Revelation,18,24,"and the blood of prophets and saints, and of all those slaughtered on earth, was found in you."
Revelation,19,1,"After this I heard something like the loud voice of a vast multitude in heaven, saying: Hallelujah! Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God,"
Revelation,19,2,"because His judgments are true and righteous, because He has judged the notorious prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality; and He has avenged the blood of His slaves that was on her hands."
Revelation,19,3,A second time they said: Hallelujah! Her smoke ascends forever and ever!
Revelation,19,4,"Then the 24 elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who is seated on the throne, saying: Amen! Hallelujah!"
Revelation,19,5,"A voice came from the throne, saying: Praise our God, all His slaves, who fear Him, both small and great!"
Revelation,19,6,"Then I heard something like the voice of a vast multitude, like the sound of cascading waters, and like the rumbling of loud thunder, saying: Hallelujah, because our Lord God, the Almighty, has begun to reign!"
Revelation,19,7,"Let us be glad, rejoice, and give Him glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has prepared herself."
Revelation,19,8,"She was given fine linen to wear, bright and pure. For the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints."
Revelation,19,9,"Then he said to me, “Write: Those invited to the marriage feast of the Lamb are fortunate!” He also said to me, “These words of God are true.”"
Revelation,19,10,"Then I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, “Don’t do that! I am a fellow slave with you and your brothers who have the testimony about Jesus. Worship God, because the testimony about Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”"
Revelation,19,11,"Then I saw heaven opened, and there was a white horse. Its rider is called Faithful and True, and He judges and makes war in righteousness."
Revelation,19,12,"His eyes were like a fiery flame, and many crowns were on His head. He had a name written that no one knows except Himself."
Revelation,19,13,"He wore a robe stained with blood, and His name is the Word of God."
Revelation,19,14,"The armies that were in heaven followed Him on white horses, wearing pure white linen."
Revelation,19,15,"A sharp sword came from His mouth, so that He might strike the nations with it. He will shepherd them with an iron scepter. He will also trample the winepress of the fierce anger of God, the Almighty."
Revelation,19,16,And He has a name written on His robe and on His thigh: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.
Revelation,19,17,"Then I saw an angel standing on the sun, and he cried out in a loud voice, saying to all the birds flying high overhead, “Come, gather together for the great supper of God,"
Revelation,19,18,"so that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of their riders, and the flesh of everyone, both free and slave, small and great.”"
Revelation,19,19,"Then I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to wage war against the rider on the horse and against His army."
Revelation,19,20,"But the beast was taken prisoner, and along with him the false prophet, who had performed the signs in his presence. He deceived those who accepted the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image with these signs. Both of them were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur."
Revelation,19,21,"The rest were killed with the sword that came from the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh."
Revelation,20,1,Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven with the key to the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
Revelation,20,2,"He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for 1,000 years."
Revelation,20,3,"He threw him into the abyss, closed it, and put a seal on it so that he would no longer deceive the nations until the 1,000 years were completed. After that, he must be released for a short time."
Revelation,20,4,"Then I saw thrones, and people seated on them who were given authority to judge. I also saw the people who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of God’s word, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and who had not accepted the mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with the Messiah for 1,000 years."
Revelation,20,5,"The rest of the dead did not come to life until the 1,000 years were completed. This is the first resurrection."
Revelation,20,6,"Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of the Messiah, and they will reign with Him for 1,000 years."
Revelation,20,7,"When the 1,000 years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison"
Revelation,20,8,"and will go out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle. Their number is like the sand of the sea."
Revelation,20,9,"They came up over the surface of the earth and surrounded the encampment of the saints, the beloved city. Then fire came down from heaven and consumed them."
Revelation,20,10,"The Devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet are, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever."
Revelation,20,11,"Then I saw a great white throne and One seated on it. Earth and heaven fled from His presence, and no place was found for them."
Revelation,20,12,"I also saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged according to their works by what was written in the books."
Revelation,20,13,"Then the sea gave up its dead, and Death and Hades gave up their dead; all were judged according to their works."
Revelation,20,14,"Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire."
Revelation,20,15,And anyone not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.
Revelation,21,1,"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea no longer existed."
Revelation,21,2,"I also saw the Holy City, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband."
Revelation,21,3,"Then I heard a loud voice from the throne: Look! God’s dwelling is with humanity, and He will live with them. They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God."
Revelation,21,4,"He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will no longer exist; grief, crying, and pain will exist no longer, because the previous things have passed away."
Revelation,21,5,"Then the One seated on the throne said, “Look! I am making everything new.” He also said, “Write, because these words are faithful and true.”"
Revelation,21,6,"And He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give water as a gift to the thirsty from the spring of life."
Revelation,21,7,"The victor will inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he will be My son."
Revelation,21,8,"But the cowards, unbelievers, vile, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars—their share will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”"
Revelation,21,9,"Then one of the seven angels, who had held the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues, came and spoke with me: “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”"
Revelation,21,10,"He then carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,"
Revelation,21,11,"arrayed with God’s glory. Her radiance was like a very precious stone, like a jasper stone, bright as crystal."
Revelation,21,12,"The city had a massive high wall, with 12 gates. Twelve angels were at the gates; the names of the 12 tribes of Israel’s sons were inscribed on the gates."
Revelation,21,13,"There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west."
Revelation,21,14,"The city wall had 12 foundations, and the 12 names of the Lamb’s 12 apostles were on the foundations."
Revelation,21,15,"The one who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, its gates, and its wall."
Revelation,21,16,"The city is laid out in a square; its length and width are the same. He measured the city with the rod at 12,000 stadia. Its length, width, and height are equal."
Revelation,21,17,"Then he measured its wall, 144 cubits according to human measurement, which the angel used."
Revelation,21,18,"The building material of its wall was jasper, and the city was pure gold like clear glass."
Revelation,21,19,"The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone: the first foundation jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,"
Revelation,21,20,"the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst."
Revelation,21,21,"The 12 gates are 12 pearls; each individual gate was made of a single pearl. The broad street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass."
Revelation,21,22,"I did not see a sanctuary in it, because the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its sanctuary."
Revelation,21,23,"The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, because God’s glory illuminates it, and its lamp is the Lamb."
Revelation,21,24,"The nations will walk in its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it."
Revelation,21,25,Each day its gates will never close because it will never be night there.
Revelation,21,26,They will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.
Revelation,21,27,"Nothing profane will ever enter it: no one who does what is vile or false, but only those written in the Lamb’s book of life."
Revelation,22,1,"Then he showed me the river of living water, sparkling like crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb"
Revelation,22,2,"down the middle of the broad street of the city. The tree of life was on both sides of the river, bearing 12 kinds of fruit, producing its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree are for healing the nations,"
Revelation,22,3,"and there will no longer be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and His slaves will serve Him."
Revelation,22,4,"They will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads."
Revelation,22,5,"Night will no longer exist, and people will not need lamplight or sunlight, because the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign forever and ever."
Revelation,22,6,"Then he said to me, “These words are faithful and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show His slaves what must quickly take place.”"
Revelation,22,7,"“Look, I am coming quickly! The one who keeps the prophetic words of this book is blessed.”"
Revelation,22,8,"I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. When I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had shown them to me."
Revelation,22,9,"But he said to me, “Don’t do that! I am a fellow slave with you, your brothers the prophets, and those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.”"
Revelation,22,10,"He also said to me, “Don’t seal the prophetic words of this book, because the time is near."
Revelation,22,11,Let the unrighteous go on in unrighteousness; let the filthy go on being made filthy; let the righteous go on in righteousness; and let the holy go on being made holy.”
Revelation,22,12,"“Look! I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me to repay each person according to what he has done."
Revelation,22,13,"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End."
Revelation,22,14,"“Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates."
Revelation,22,15,"Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying."
Revelation,22,16,"“I, Jesus, have sent My angel to attest these things to you for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright Morning Star.”"
Revelation,22,17,"Both the Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” Anyone who hears should say, “Come!” And the one who is thirsty should come. Whoever desires should take the living water as a gift."
Revelation,22,18,"I testify to everyone who hears the prophetic words of this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book."
Revelation,22,19,"And if anyone takes away from the words of this prophetic book, God will take away his share of the tree of life and the holy city, written in this book."
Revelation,22,20,"He who testifies about these things says, “Yes, I am coming quickly.” Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!"
Revelation,22,21,The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.
Job,1,1,"There was a man in the country of Uz named Job. He was a man of perfect integrity, who feared God and turned away from evil."
Job,1,2,He had seven sons and three daughters.
Job,1,3,"His estate included 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and a very large number of servants. Job was the greatest man among all the people of the east."
Job,1,4,His sons used to take turns having banquets at their homes. They would send an invitation to their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
Job,1,5,"Whenever a round of banqueting was over, Job would send for his children and purify them, rising early in the morning to offer burnt offerings for all of them. For Job thought: Perhaps my children have sinned, having cursed God in their hearts. This was Job’s regular practice."
Job,1,6,"One day the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them."
Job,1,7,"The LORD asked Satan, “Where have you come from?” “From roaming through the earth,” Satan answered Him, “and walking around on it.”"
Job,1,8,"Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? No one else on earth is like him, a man of perfect integrity, who fears God and turns away from evil.”"
Job,1,9,"Satan answered the LORD, “Does Job fear God for nothing?"
Job,1,10,"Haven’t You placed a hedge around him, his household, and everything he owns? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land."
Job,1,11,"But stretch out Your hand and strike everything he owns, and he will surely curse You to Your face.”"
Job,1,12,"“Very well,” the LORD told Satan, “everything he owns is in your power. However, you must not lay a hand on Job himself.” So Satan left the LORD’s presence."
Job,1,13,"One day when Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,"
Job,1,14,"a messenger came to Job and reported: “While the oxen were plowing and the donkeys grazing nearby,"
Job,1,15,"the Sabeans swooped down and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”"
Job,1,16,"He was still speaking when another messenger came and reported: “A lightning storm struck from heaven. It burned up the sheep and the servants and devoured them, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”"
Job,1,17,"That messenger was still speaking when yet another came and reported: “The Chaldeans formed three bands, made a raid on the camels, and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”"
Job,1,18,He was still speaking when another messenger came and reported: “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house.
Job,1,19,"Suddenly a powerful wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on the young people so that they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”"
Job,1,20,"Then Job stood up, tore his robe, and shaved his head. He fell to the ground and worshiped,"
Job,1,21,"saying: Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will leave this life. The LORD gives, and the LORD takes away. Praise the name of Yahweh."
Job,1,22,Throughout all this Job did not sin or blame God for anything.
Job,2,1,"One day the sons of God came again to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before the LORD."
Job,2,2,"The LORD asked Satan, “Where have you come from?” “From roaming through the earth,” Satan answered Him, “and walking around on it.”"
Job,2,3,"Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? No one else on earth is like him, a man of perfect integrity, who fears God and turns away from evil. He still retains his integrity, even though you incited Me against him, to destroy him without just cause.”"
Job,2,4,“Skin for skin!” Satan answered the LORD. “A man will give up everything he owns in exchange for his life.
Job,2,5,"But stretch out Your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse You to Your face.”"
Job,2,6,"“Very well,” the LORD told Satan, “he is in your power; only spare his life.”"
Job,2,7,So Satan left the LORD’s presence and infected Job with terrible boils from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.
Job,2,8,Then Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself while he sat among the ashes.
Job,2,9,"His wife said to him, “Do you still retain your integrity? Curse God and die!”"
Job,2,10,"“You speak as a foolish woman speaks,” he told her. “Should we accept only good from God and not adversity?” Throughout all this Job did not sin in what he said."
Job,2,11,"Now when Job’s three friends—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite—heard about all this adversity that had happened to him, each of them came from his home. They met together to go and sympathize with him and comfort him."
Job,2,12,"When they looked from a distance, they could barely recognize him. They wept aloud, and each man tore his robe and threw dust into the air and on his head."
Job,2,13,"Then they sat on the ground with him seven days and nights, but no one spoke a word to him because they saw that his suffering was very intense."
Job,3,1,"After this, Job began to speak and cursed the day he was born."
Job,3,2,He said:
Job,3,3,"May the day I was born perish, and the night when they said, “A boy is conceived.”"
Job,3,4,"If only that day had turned to darkness! May God above not care about it, or light shine on it."
Job,3,5,"May darkness and gloom reclaim it, and a cloud settle over it. May an eclipse of the sun terrify it."
Job,3,6,If only darkness had taken that night away! May it not appear among the days of the year or be listed in the calendar.
Job,3,7,"Yes, may that night be barren; may no joyful shout be heard in it."
Job,3,8,"Let those who curse certain days cast a spell on it, those who are skilled in rousing Leviathan."
Job,3,9,May its morning stars grow dark. May it wait for daylight but have none; may it not see the breaking of dawn.
Job,3,10,"For that night did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb, and hide sorrow from my eyes."
Job,3,11,Why was I not stillborn; why didn’t I die as I came from the womb?
Job,3,12,"Why did the knees receive me, and why were there breasts for me to nurse?"
Job,3,13,Now I would certainly be lying down in peace; I would be asleep. Then I would be at rest
Job,3,14,"with the kings and counselors of the earth, who rebuilt ruined cities for themselves,"
Job,3,15,"or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver."
Job,3,16,"Or why was I not hidden like a miscarried child, like infants who never see daylight?"
Job,3,17,"There the wicked cease to make trouble, and there the weary find rest."
Job,3,18,The captives are completely at ease; they do not hear the voice of their oppressor.
Job,3,19,"Both small and great are there, and the slave is set free from his master."
Job,3,20,"Why is light given to one burdened with grief, and life to those whose existence is bitter,"
Job,3,21,"who wait for death, but it does not come, and search for it more than for hidden treasure,"
Job,3,22,who are filled with much joy and are glad when they reach the grave?
Job,3,23,"Why is life given to a man whose path is hidden, whom God has hedged in?"
Job,3,24,"I sigh when food is put before me, and my groans pour out like water."
Job,3,25,"For the thing I feared has overtaken me, and what I dreaded has happened to me."
Job,3,26,"I cannot relax or be still; I have no rest, for trouble comes."
Job,4,1,Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
Job,4,2,Should anyone try to speak with you when you are exhausted? Yet who can keep from speaking?
Job,4,3,"Indeed, you have instructed many and have strengthened weak hands."
Job,4,4,Your words have steadied the one who was stumbling and braced the knees that were buckling.
Job,4,5,"But now that this has happened to you, you have become exhausted. It strikes you, and you are dismayed."
Job,4,6,"Isn’t your piety your confidence, and the integrity of your life your hope?"
Job,4,7,Consider: who has perished when he was innocent? Where have the honest been destroyed?
Job,4,8,"In my experience, those who plow injustice and those who sow trouble reap the same."
Job,4,9,They perish at a single blast from God and come to an end by the breath of His nostrils.
Job,4,10,"The lion may roar and the fierce lion growl, but the fangs of young lions are broken."
Job,4,11,"The strong lion dies if it catches no prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered."
Job,4,12,A word was brought to me in secret; my ears caught a whisper of it.
Job,4,13,"Among unsettling thoughts from visions in the night, when deep sleep descends on men,"
Job,4,14,fear and trembling came over me and made all my bones shake.
Job,4,15,"A wind passed by me, and I shuddered with fear."
Job,4,16,"A figure stood there, but I could not recognize its appearance; a form loomed before my eyes. I heard a quiet voice:"
Job,4,17,"“Can a person be more righteous than God, or a man more pure than his Maker?”"
Job,4,18,"If God puts no trust in His servants and He charges His angels with foolishness,"
Job,4,19,"how much more those who dwell in clay houses, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like a moth!"
Job,4,20,They are smashed to pieces from dawn to dusk; they perish forever while no one notices.
Job,4,21,Are their tent cords not pulled up? They die without wisdom.
Job,5,1,Call out if you please. Will anyone answer you? Which of the holy ones will you turn to?
Job,5,2,"For anger kills a fool, and jealousy slays the gullible."
Job,5,3,"I have seen a fool taking root, but I immediately pronounced a curse on his home."
Job,5,4,"His children are far from safety. They are crushed at the city gate, with no one to rescue them."
Job,5,5,"The hungry consume his harvest, even taking it out of the thorns. The thirsty pant for his children’s wealth."
Job,5,6,"For distress does not grow out of the soil, and trouble does not sprout from the ground."
Job,5,7,But mankind is born for trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.
Job,5,8,"However, if I were you, I would appeal to God and would present my case to Him."
Job,5,9,"He does great and unsearchable things, wonders without number."
Job,5,10,He gives rain to the earth and sends water to the fields.
Job,5,11,"He sets the lowly on high, and mourners are lifted to safety."
Job,5,12,He frustrates the schemes of the crafty so that they achieve no success.
Job,5,13,He traps the wise in their craftiness so that the plans of the deceptive are quickly brought to an end.
Job,5,14,"They encounter darkness by day, and they grope at noon as if it were night."
Job,5,15,He saves the needy from their sharp words and from the clutches of the powerful.
Job,5,16,"So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth."
Job,5,17,See how happy the man is God corrects; so do not reject the discipline of the Almighty.
Job,5,18,"For He crushes but also binds up; He strikes, but His hands also heal."
Job,5,19,He will rescue you from six calamities; no harm will touch you in seven.
Job,5,20,"In famine He will redeem you from death, and in battle, from the power of the sword."
Job,5,21,You will be safe from slander and not fear destruction when it comes.
Job,5,22,You will laugh at destruction and hunger and not fear the animals of the earth.
Job,5,23,"For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you."
Job,5,24,"You will know that your tent is secure, and nothing will be missing when you inspect your home."
Job,5,25,You will also know that your offspring will be many and your descendants like the grass of the earth.
Job,5,26,"You will approach the grave in full vigor, as a stack of sheaves is gathered in its season."
Job,5,27,"We have investigated this, and it is true! Hear it and understand it for yourself."
Job,6,1,Then Job answered:
Job,6,2,If only my grief could be weighed and my devastation placed with it in the scales.
Job,6,3,For then it would outweigh the sand of the seas! That is why my words are rash.
Job,6,4,Surely the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me; my spirit drinks their poison. God’s terrors are arrayed against me.
Job,6,5,Does a wild donkey bray over fresh grass or an ox low over its fodder?
Job,6,6,Is bland food eaten without salt? Is there flavor in an egg white?
Job,6,7,I refuse to touch them; they are like contaminated food.
Job,6,8,If only my request would be granted and God would provide what I hope for:
Job,6,9,"that He would decide to crush me, to unleash His power and cut me off!"
Job,6,10,"It would still bring me comfort, and I would leap for joy in unrelenting pain that I have not denied the words of the Holy One."
Job,6,11,"What strength do I have that I should continue to hope? What is my future, that I should be patient?"
Job,6,12,"Is my strength that of stone, or my flesh made of bronze?"
Job,6,13,"Since I cannot help myself, the hope for success has been banished from me."
Job,6,14,"A despairing man should receive loyalty from his friends, even if he abandons the fear of the Almighty."
Job,6,15,"My brothers are as treacherous as a wadi, as seasonal streams that overflow"
Job,6,16,"and become darkened because of ice, and the snow melts into them."
Job,6,17,The wadis evaporate in warm weather; they disappear from their channels in hot weather.
Job,6,18,"Caravans turn away from their routes, go up into the desert, and perish."
Job,6,19,The caravans of Tema look for these streams. The traveling merchants of Sheba hope for them.
Job,6,20,"They are ashamed because they had been confident of finding water. When they arrive there, they are frustrated."
Job,6,21,"So this is what you have now become to me. When you see something dreadful, you are afraid."
Job,6,22,Have I ever said: “Give me something” or “Pay a bribe for me from your wealth”
Job,6,23,or “Deliver me from the enemy’s power” or “Redeem me from the grasp of the ruthless”?
Job,6,24,"Teach me, and I will be silent. Help me understand what I did wrong."
Job,6,25,How painful honest words can be! But what does your rebuke prove?
Job,6,26,Do you think that you can disprove my words or that a despairing man’s words are mere wind?
Job,6,27,No doubt you would cast lots for a fatherless child and negotiate a price to sell your friend.
Job,6,28,"But now, please look at me; would I lie to your face?"
Job,6,29,Reconsider; don’t be unjust. Reconsider; my righteousness is still the issue.
Job,6,30,Is there injustice on my tongue or can my palate not taste disaster?
Job,7,1,Isn’t mankind consigned to forced labor on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired hand?
Job,7,2,Like a slave he longs for shade; like a hired man he waits for his pay.
Job,7,3,"So I have been made to inherit months of futility, and troubled nights have been assigned to me."
Job,7,4,"When I lie down I think: When will I get up? But the evening drags on endlessly, and I toss and turn until dawn."
Job,7,5,My flesh is clothed with maggots and encrusted with dirt. My skin forms scabs and then oozes.
Job,7,6,My days pass more swiftly than a weaver’s shuttle; they come to an end without hope.
Job,7,7,Remember that my life is but a breath. My eye will never again see anything good.
Job,7,8,"The eye of anyone who looks on me will no longer see me. Your eyes will look for me, but I will be gone."
Job,7,9,"As a cloud fades away and vanishes, so the one who goes down to Sheol will never rise again."
Job,7,10,He will never return to his house; his hometown will no longer remember him.
Job,7,11,Therefore I will not restrain my mouth. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,7,12,"Am I the sea or a sea monster, that You keep me under guard?"
Job,7,13,"When I say: My bed will comfort me, and my couch will ease my complaint,"
Job,7,14,"then You frighten me with dreams, and terrify me with visions,"
Job,7,15,so that I prefer strangling— death rather than life in this body.
Job,7,16,"I give up! I will not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a breath."
Job,7,17,"What is man, that You think so highly of him and pay so much attention to him?"
Job,7,18,"You inspect him every morning, and put him to the test every moment."
Job,7,19,"Will You ever look away from me, or leave me alone long enough to swallow?"
Job,7,20,"If I have sinned, what have I done to You, Watcher of mankind? Why have You made me Your target, so that I have become a burden to You?"
Job,7,21,"Why not forgive my sin and pardon my transgression? For soon I will lie down in the grave. You will eagerly seek me, but I will be gone."
Job,8,1,Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
Job,8,2,How long will you go on saying these things? Your words are a blast of wind.
Job,8,3,Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
Job,8,4,"Since your children sinned against Him, He gave them over to their rebellion."
Job,8,5,"But if you earnestly seek God and ask the Almighty for mercy,"
Job,8,6,"if you are pure and upright, then He will move even now on your behalf and restore the home where your righteousness dwells."
Job,8,7,"Then, even if your beginnings were modest, your final days will be full of prosperity."
Job,8,8,"For ask the previous generation, and pay attention to what their fathers discovered,"
Job,8,9,since we were born only yesterday and know nothing. Our days on earth are but a shadow.
Job,8,10,Will they not teach you and tell you and speak from their understanding?
Job,8,11,Does papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Do reeds flourish without water?
Job,8,12,"While still uncut shoots, they would dry up quicker than any other plant."
Job,8,13,Such is the destiny of all who forget God; the hope of the godless will perish.
Job,8,14,His source of confidence is fragile; what he trusts in is a spider’s web.
Job,8,15,"He leans on his web, but it doesn’t stand firm. He grabs it, but it does not hold up."
Job,8,16,He is a well-watered plant in the sunshine; his shoots spread out over his garden.
Job,8,17,His roots are intertwined around a pile of rocks. He looks for a home among the stones.
Job,8,18,"If he is uprooted from his place, it will deny knowing him, saying, “I never saw you.”"
Job,8,19,Surely this is the joy of his way of life; yet others will sprout from the dust.
Job,8,20,"Look, God does not reject a person of integrity, and He will not support evildoers."
Job,8,21,He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with a shout of joy.
Job,8,22,Your enemies will be clothed with shame; the tent of the wicked will exist no longer.
Job,9,1,Then Job answered:
Job,9,2,"Yes, I know what you’ve said is true, but how can a person be justified before God?"
Job,9,3,"If one wanted to take Him to court, he could not answer God once in a thousand times."
Job,9,4,God is wise and all-powerful. Who has opposed Him and come out unharmed?
Job,9,5,"He removes mountains without their knowledge, overturning them in His anger."
Job,9,6,He shakes the earth from its place so that its pillars tremble.
Job,9,7,He commands the sun not to shine and seals off the stars.
Job,9,8,He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.
Job,9,9,"He makes the stars: the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades, and the constellations of the southern sky."
Job,9,10,"He does great and unsearchable things, wonders without number."
Job,9,11,"If He passes by me, I wouldn’t see Him; if He goes right by, I wouldn’t recognize Him."
Job,9,12,"If He snatches something, who can stop Him? Who can ask Him, “What are You doing?”"
Job,9,13,God does not hold back His anger; Rahab’s assistants cringe in fear beneath Him!
Job,9,14,How then can I answer Him or choose my arguments against Him?
Job,9,15,"Even if I were in the right, I could not answer. I could only beg my Judge for mercy."
Job,9,16,"If I summoned Him and He answered me, I do not believe He would pay attention to what I said."
Job,9,17,He batters me with a whirlwind and multiplies my wounds without cause.
Job,9,18,He doesn’t let me catch my breath but soaks me with bitter experiences.
Job,9,19,"If it is a matter of strength, look, He is the Mighty One! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him?"
Job,9,20,"Even if I were in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, my mouth would declare me guilty."
Job,9,21,"Though I am blameless, I no longer care about myself; I renounce my life."
Job,9,22,"It is all the same. Therefore I say, “He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.”"
Job,9,23,"When disaster brings sudden death, He mocks the despair of the innocent."
Job,9,24,"The earth is handed over to the wicked; He blindfolds its judges. If it isn’t He, then who is it?"
Job,9,25,My days fly by faster than a runner; they flee without seeing any good.
Job,9,26,"They sweep by like boats made of papyrus, like an eagle swooping down on its prey."
Job,9,27,"If I said, “I will forget my complaint, change my expression, and smile,”"
Job,9,28,I would still live in terror of all my pains. I know You will not acquit me.
Job,9,29,"Since I will be found guilty, why should I labor in vain?"
Job,9,30,"If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with lye,"
Job,9,31,"then You dip me in a pit of mud, and my own clothes despise me!"
Job,9,32,"For He is not a man like me, that I can answer Him, that we can take each other to court."
Job,9,33,"There is no one to judge between us, to lay his hand on both of us."
Job,9,34,Let Him take His rod away from me so His terror will no longer frighten me.
Job,9,35,Then I would speak and not fear Him. But that is not the case; I am on my own.
Job,10,1,I am disgusted with my life. I will express my complaint and speak in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,10,2,I will say to God: “Do not declare me guilty! Let me know why You prosecute me.
Job,10,3,"Is it good for You to oppress, to reject the work of Your hands, and favor the plans of the wicked?"
Job,10,4,"Do You have eyes of flesh, or do You see as a human sees?"
Job,10,5,"Are Your days like those of a human, or Your years like those of a man,"
Job,10,6,"that You look for my wrongdoing and search for my sin,"
Job,10,7,even though You know that I am not wicked and that there is no one who can deliver from Your hand?
Job,10,8,“Your hands shaped me and formed me. Will You now turn and destroy me?
Job,10,9,Please remember that You formed me like clay. Will You now return me to dust?
Job,10,10,Did You not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese?
Job,10,11,"You clothed me with skin and flesh, and wove me together with bones and tendons."
Job,10,12,"You gave me life and faithful love, and Your care has guarded my life."
Job,10,13,“Yet You concealed these thoughts in Your heart; I know that this was Your hidden plan:
Job,10,14,"if I sin, You would notice, and would not acquit me of my wrongdoing."
Job,10,15,"If I am wicked, woe to me! And even if I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head. I am filled with shame and aware of my affliction."
Job,10,16,"If I am proud, You hunt me like a lion and again display Your miraculous power against me."
Job,10,17,"You produce new witnesses against me and multiply Your anger toward me. Hardships assault me, wave after wave."
Job,10,18,“Why did You bring me out of the womb? I should have died and never been seen.
Job,10,19,I wish I had never existed but had been carried from the womb to the grave.
Job,10,20,"Are my days not few? Stop it! Leave me alone, so that I can smile a little"
Job,10,21,"before I go to a land of darkness and gloom, never to return."
Job,10,22,"It is a land of blackness like the deepest darkness, gloomy and chaotic, where even the light is like the darkness.”"
Job,11,1,Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
Job,11,2,Should this stream of words go unanswered and such a talker be acquitted?
Job,11,3,"Should your babbling put others to silence, so that you can keep on ridiculing with no one to humiliate you?"
Job,11,4,"You have said, “My teaching is sound, and I am pure in Your sight.”"
Job,11,5,"But if only God would speak and declare His case against you,"
Job,11,6,"He would show you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know then that God has chosen to overlook some of your sin."
Job,11,7,Can you fathom the depths of God or discover the limits of the Almighty?
Job,11,8,They are higher than the heavens—what can you do? They are deeper than Sheol—what can you know?
Job,11,9,Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.
Job,11,10,"If He passes by and throws someone in prison or convenes a court, who can stop Him?"
Job,11,11,"Surely He knows which people are worthless. If He sees iniquity, will He not take note of it?"
Job,11,12,But a stupid man will gain understanding as soon as a wild donkey is born a man!
Job,11,13,"As for you, if you redirect your heart and lift up your hands to Him in prayer—"
Job,11,14,"if there is iniquity in your hand, remove it, and don’t allow injustice to dwell in your tents—"
Job,11,15,"then you will hold your head high, free from fault. You will be firmly established and unafraid."
Job,11,16,"For you will forget your suffering, recalling it only as waters that have flowed by."
Job,11,17,Your life will be brighter than noonday; its darkness will be like the morning.
Job,11,18,"You will be confident, because there is hope. You will look carefully about and lie down in safety."
Job,11,19,"You will lie down without fear, and many will seek your favor."
Job,11,20,"But the sight of the wicked will fail. Their way of escape will be cut off, and their only hope is their last breath."
Job,12,1,Then Job answered:
Job,12,2,"No doubt you are the people, and wisdom will die with you!"
Job,12,3,But I also have a mind; I am not inferior to you. Who doesn’t know the things you are talking about?
Job,12,4,"I am a laughingstock to my friends, by calling on God, who answers me. The righteous and upright man is a laughingstock."
Job,12,5,The one who is at ease holds calamity in contempt and thinks it is prepared for those whose feet are slipping.
Job,12,6,"The tents of robbers are safe, and those who provoke God are secure; God’s power provides this."
Job,12,7,"But ask the animals, and they will instruct you; ask the birds of the sky, and they will tell you."
Job,12,8,"Or speak to the earth, and it will instruct you; let the fish of the sea inform you."
Job,12,9,Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?
Job,12,10,"The life of every living thing is in His hand, as well as the breath of all mankind."
Job,12,11,Doesn’t the ear test words as the palate tastes food?
Job,12,12,"Wisdom is found with the elderly, and understanding comes with long life."
Job,12,13,Wisdom and strength belong to God; counsel and understanding are His.
Job,12,14,Whatever He tears down cannot be rebuilt; whoever He imprisons cannot be released.
Job,12,15,"When He withholds the waters, everything dries up, and when He releases them, they destroy the land."
Job,12,16,True wisdom and power belong to Him. The deceived and the deceiver are His.
Job,12,17,He leads counselors away barefoot and makes judges go mad.
Job,12,18,He releases the bonds put on by kings and fastens a belt around their waists.
Job,12,19,He leads priests away barefoot and overthrows established leaders.
Job,12,20,He deprives trusted advisers of speech and takes away the elders’ good judgment.
Job,12,21,He pours out contempt on nobles and disarms the strong.
Job,12,22,He reveals mysteries from the darkness and brings the deepest darkness into the light.
Job,12,23,"He makes nations great, then destroys them; He enlarges nations, then leads them away."
Job,12,24,"He deprives the world’s leaders of reason, and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland."
Job,12,25,They grope around in darkness without light; He makes them stagger like drunken men.
Job,13,1,"Look, my eyes have seen all this; my ears have heard and understood it."
Job,13,2,"Everything you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you."
Job,13,3,Yet I prefer to speak to the Almighty and argue my case before God.
Job,13,4,But you coat the truth with lies; you are all worthless doctors.
Job,13,5,If only you would shut up and let that be your wisdom!
Job,13,6,"Hear now my argument, and listen to my defense."
Job,13,7,Would you testify unjustly on God’s behalf or speak deceitfully for Him?
Job,13,8,Would you show partiality to Him or argue the case in His defense?
Job,13,9,Would it go well if He examined you? Could you deceive Him as you would deceive a man?
Job,13,10,Surely He would rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.
Job,13,11,Would God’s majesty not terrify you? Would His dread not fall on you?
Job,13,12,Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ash; your defenses are made of clay.
Job,13,13,"Be quiet, and I will speak. Let whatever comes happen to me."
Job,13,14,Why do I put myself at risk and take my life in my own hands?
Job,13,15,"Even if He kills me, I will hope in Him. I will still defend my ways before Him."
Job,13,16,"Yes, this will result in my deliverance, for no godless person can appear before Him."
Job,13,17,Pay close attention to my words; let my declaration ring in your ears.
Job,13,18,"Now then, I have prepared my case; I know that I am right."
Job,13,19,"Can anyone indict me? If so, I will be silent and die."
Job,13,20,"Only grant these two things to me, God, so that I will not have to hide from Your presence:"
Job,13,21,"remove Your hand from me, and do not let Your terror frighten me."
Job,13,22,"Then call, and I will answer, or I will speak, and You can respond to me."
Job,13,23,How many iniquities and sins have I committed? Reveal to me my transgression and sin.
Job,13,24,Why do You hide Your face and consider me Your enemy?
Job,13,25,Will You frighten a wind-driven leaf? Will You chase after dry straw?
Job,13,26,For You record bitter accusations against me and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth.
Job,13,27,"You put my feet in the stocks and stand watch over all my paths, setting a limit for the soles of my feet."
Job,13,28,"Man wears out like something rotten, like a moth-eaten garment."
Job,14,1,Man born of woman is short of days and full of trouble.
Job,14,2,"He blossoms like a flower, then withers; he flees like a shadow and does not last."
Job,14,3,Do You really take notice of one like this? Will You bring me into judgment against You?
Job,14,4,Who can produce something pure from what is impure? No one!
Job,14,5,"Since man’s days are determined and the number of his months depends on You, and since You have set limits he cannot pass,"
Job,14,6,look away from him and let him rest so that he can enjoy his day like a hired hand.
Job,14,7,"There is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its shoots will not die."
Job,14,8,"If its roots grow old in the ground and its stump starts to die in the soil,"
Job,14,9,the smell of water makes it thrive and produce twigs like a sapling.
Job,14,10,But a man dies and fades away; he breathes his last—where is he?
Job,14,11,"As water disappears from the sea and a river becomes parched and dry,"
Job,14,12,so man lies down never to rise again. They will not wake up until the heavens are no more; they will not stir from their sleep.
Job,14,13,If only You would hide me in Sheol and conceal me until Your anger passes. If only You would appoint a time for me and then remember me.
Job,14,14,"When a man dies, will he come back to life? If so, I would wait all the days of my struggle until my relief comes."
Job,14,15,"You would call, and I would answer You. You would long for the work of Your hands."
Job,14,16,For then You would count my steps but would not take note of my sin.
Job,14,17,"My rebellion would be sealed up in a bag, and You would cover over my iniquity."
Job,14,18,"But as a mountain collapses and crumbles and a rock is dislodged from its place,"
Job,14,19,"as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil from the land, so You destroy a man’s hope."
Job,14,20,"You completely overpower him, and he passes on; You change his appearance and send him away."
Job,14,21,"If his sons receive honor, he does not know it; if they become insignificant, he is unaware of it."
Job,14,22,He feels only the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself.
Job,15,1,Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
Job,15,2,Does a wise man answer with empty counsel or fill himself with the hot east wind?
Job,15,3,Should he argue with useless talk or with words that serve no good purpose?
Job,15,4,But you even undermine the fear of God and hinder meditation before Him.
Job,15,5,"Your iniquity teaches you what to say, and you choose the language of the crafty."
Job,15,6,"Your own mouth condemns you, not I; your own lips testify against you."
Job,15,7,"Were you the first person ever born, or were you brought forth before the hills?"
Job,15,8,"Do you listen in on the council of God, or have a monopoly on wisdom?"
Job,15,9,What do you know that we don’t? What do you understand that is not clear to us?
Job,15,10,"Both the gray-haired and the elderly are with us, men older than your father."
Job,15,11,"Are God’s consolations not enough for you, even the words that deal gently with you?"
Job,15,12,"Why has your heart misled you, and why do your eyes flash"
Job,15,13,as you turn your anger against God and allow such words to leave your mouth?
Job,15,14,"What is man, that he should be pure, or one born of woman, that he should be righteous?"
Job,15,15,"If God puts no trust in His holy ones and the heavens are not pure in His sight,"
Job,15,16,"how much less one who is revolting and corrupt, who drinks injustice like water?"
Job,15,17,"Listen to me and I will inform you. I will describe what I have seen,"
Job,15,18,"what was declared by wise men and was not suppressed by their ancestors,"
Job,15,19,the land was given to them alone when no foreigner passed among them.
Job,15,20,A wicked man writhes in pain all his days; only a few years are reserved for the ruthless.
Job,15,21,"Dreadful sounds fill his ears; when he is at peace, a robber attacks him."
Job,15,22,He doesn’t believe he will return from darkness; he is destined for the sword.
Job,15,23,"He wanders about for food, saying, “Where is it?” He knows the day of darkness is at hand."
Job,15,24,"Trouble and distress terrify him, overwhelming him like a king prepared for battle."
Job,15,25,For he has stretched out his hand against God and has arrogantly opposed the Almighty.
Job,15,26,"He rushes headlong at Him with his thick, studded shields."
Job,15,27,"Though his face is covered with fat and his waistline bulges with it,"
Job,15,28,"he will dwell in ruined cities, in abandoned houses destined to become piles of rubble."
Job,15,29,He will no longer be rich; his wealth will not endure. His possessions will not increase in the land.
Job,15,30,"He will not escape from the darkness; flames will wither his shoots, and by the breath of God’s mouth, he will depart."
Job,15,31,"Let him not put trust in worthless things, being led astray, for what he gets in exchange will prove worthless."
Job,15,32,"It will be accomplished before his time, and his branch will not flourish."
Job,15,33,He will be like a vine that drops its unripe grapes and like an olive tree that sheds its blossoms.
Job,15,34,"For the company of the godless will have no children, and fire will consume the tents of those who offer bribes."
Job,15,35,They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb prepares deception.
Job,16,1,Then Job answered:
Job,16,2,I have heard many things like these. You are all miserable comforters.
Job,16,3,Is there no end to your empty words? What provokes you that you continue testifying?
Job,16,4,If you were in my place I could also talk like you. I could string words together against you and shake my head at you.
Job,16,5,"Instead, I would encourage you with my mouth, and the consolation from my lips would bring relief."
Job,16,6,"Even if I speak, my suffering is not relieved, and if I hold back, what have I lost?"
Job,16,7,Surely He has now exhausted me. You have devastated my entire family.
Job,16,8,You have shriveled me up—it has become a witness; My frailty rises up against me and testifies to my face.
Job,16,9,"His anger tears at me, and He harasses me. He gnashes His teeth at me. My enemy pierces me with His eyes."
Job,16,10,They open their mouths against me and strike my cheeks with contempt; they join themselves together against me.
Job,16,11,God hands me over to unjust men; He throws me into the hands of the wicked.
Job,16,12,"I was at ease, but He shattered me; He seized me by the scruff of the neck and smashed me to pieces. He set me up as His target;"
Job,16,13,His archers surround me. He pierces my kidneys without mercy and pours my bile on the ground.
Job,16,14,He breaks through my defenses again and again; He charges at me like a warrior.
Job,16,15,I have sewn sackcloth over my skin; I have buried my strength in the dust.
Job,16,16,"My face has grown red with weeping, and darkness covers my eyes,"
Job,16,17,although my hands are free from violence and my prayer is pure.
Job,16,18,"Earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry for help find no resting place."
Job,16,19,"Even now my witness is in heaven, and my advocate is in the heights!"
Job,16,20,My friends scoff at me as I weep before God.
Job,16,21,I wish that someone might arbitrate between a man and God just as a man pleads for his friend.
Job,16,22,For only a few years will pass before I go the way of no return.
Job,17,1,My spirit is broken. My days are extinguished. A graveyard awaits me.
Job,17,2,Surely mockers surround me and my eyes must gaze at their rebellion.
Job,17,3,Make arrangements! Put up security for me. Who else will be my sponsor?
Job,17,4,"You have closed their minds to understanding, therefore You will not honor them."
Job,17,5,"If a man informs on his friends for a price, the eyes of his children will fail."
Job,17,6,He has made me an object of scorn to the people; I have become a man people spit at.
Job,17,7,"My eyes have grown dim from grief, and my whole body has become but a shadow."
Job,17,8,"The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent are roused against the godless."
Job,17,9,"Yet the righteous person will hold to his way, and the one whose hands are clean will grow stronger."
Job,17,10,"But come back and try again, all of you. I will not find a wise man among you."
Job,17,11,"My days have slipped by; my plans have been ruined, even the things dear to my heart."
Job,17,12,They turned night into day and made light seem near in the face of darkness.
Job,17,13,"If I await Sheol as my home, spread out my bed in darkness,"
Job,17,14,"and say to corruption: You are my father, and to the maggot: My mother or my sister,"
Job,17,15,where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me?
Job,17,16,"Will it go down to the gates of Sheol, or will we descend together to the dust?"
Job,18,1,Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
Job,18,2,"How long until you stop talking? Show some sense, and then we can talk."
Job,18,3,"Why are we regarded as cattle, as stupid in your sight?"
Job,18,4,"You who tear yourself in anger— should the earth be abandoned on your account, or a rock be removed from its place?"
Job,18,5,"Yes, the light of the wicked is extinguished; the flame of his fire does not glow."
Job,18,6,"The light in his tent grows dark, and the lamp beside him is put out."
Job,18,7,"His powerful stride is shortened, and his own schemes trip him up."
Job,18,8,"For his own feet lead him into a net, and he strays into its mesh."
Job,18,9,A trap catches him by the heel; a noose seizes him.
Job,18,10,"A rope lies hidden for him on the ground, and a snare waits for him along the path."
Job,18,11,Terrors frighten him on every side and harass him at every step.
Job,18,12,His strength is depleted; disaster lies ready for him to stumble.
Job,18,13,Parts of his skin are eaten away; death’s firstborn consumes his limbs.
Job,18,14,He is ripped from the security of his tent and marched away to the king of terrors.
Job,18,15,Nothing he owned remains in his tent. Burning sulfur is scattered over his home.
Job,18,16,"His roots below dry up, and his branches above wither away."
Job,18,17,All memory of him perishes from the earth; he has no name anywhere.
Job,18,18,He is driven from light to darkness and chased from the inhabited world.
Job,18,19,"He has no children or descendants among his people, no survivor where he used to live."
Job,18,20,"Those in the west are appalled at his fate, while those in the east tremble in horror."
Job,18,21,"Indeed, such is the dwelling of the unjust man, and this is the place of the one who does not know God."
Job,19,1,Then Job answered:
Job,19,2,How long will you torment me and crush me with words?
Job,19,3,"You have humiliated me ten times now, and you mistreat me without shame."
Job,19,4,"Even if it is true that I have sinned, my mistake concerns only me."
Job,19,5,"If you really want to appear superior to me and would use my disgrace as evidence against me,"
Job,19,6,then understand that it is God who has wronged me and caught me in His net.
Job,19,7,"I cry out: “Violence!” but get no response; I call for help, but there is no justice."
Job,19,8,He has blocked my way so that I cannot pass through; He has veiled my paths with darkness.
Job,19,9,He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.
Job,19,10,He tears me down on every side so that I am ruined. He uproots my hope like a tree.
Job,19,11,"His anger burns against me, and He regards me as one of His enemies."
Job,19,12,His troops advance together; they construct a ramp against me and camp around my tent.
Job,19,13,He has removed my brothers from me; my acquaintances have abandoned me.
Job,19,14,"My relatives stop coming by, and my close friends have forgotten me."
Job,19,15,My house guests and female servants regard me as a stranger; I am a foreigner in their sight.
Job,19,16,"I call for my servant, but he does not answer, even if I beg him with my own mouth."
Job,19,17,"My breath is offensive to my wife, and my own family finds me repulsive."
Job,19,18,"Even young boys scorn me. When I stand up, they mock me."
Job,19,19,"All of my best friends despise me, and those I love have turned against me."
Job,19,20,My skin and my flesh cling to my bones; I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
Job,19,21,"Have mercy on me, my friends, have mercy, for God’s hand has struck me."
Job,19,22,Why do you persecute me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?
Job,19,23,"I wish that my words were written down, that they were recorded on a scroll"
Job,19,24,or were inscribed in stone forever by an iron stylus and lead!
Job,19,25,"But I know my living Redeemer, and He will stand on the dust at last."
Job,19,26,"Even after my skin has been destroyed, yet I will see God in my flesh."
Job,19,27,"I will see Him myself; my eyes will look at Him, and not as a stranger. My heart longs within me."
Job,19,28,"If you say, “How will we pursue him, since the root of the problem lies with him?”"
Job,19,29,"then be afraid of the sword, because wrath brings punishment by the sword, so that you may know there is a judgment."
Job,20,1,Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
Job,20,2,"This is why my unsettling thoughts compel me to answer, because I am upset!"
Job,20,3,"I have heard a rebuke that insults me, and my understanding makes me reply."
Job,20,4,"Don’t you know that ever since antiquity, from the time man was placed on earth,"
Job,20,5,the joy of the wicked has been brief and the happiness of the godless has lasted only a moment?
Job,20,6,"Though his arrogance reaches heaven, and his head touches the clouds,"
Job,20,7,"he will vanish forever like his own dung. Those who know him will ask, “Where is he?”"
Job,20,8,He will fly away like a dream and never be found; he will be chased away like a vision in the night.
Job,20,9,"The eye that saw him will see him no more, and his household will no longer see him."
Job,20,10,"His children will beg from the poor, for his own hands must give back his wealth."
Job,20,11,"His bones may be full of youthful vigor, but will lie down with him in the grave."
Job,20,12,"Though evil tastes sweet in his mouth and he conceals it under his tongue,"
Job,20,13,"though he cherishes it and will not let it go but keeps it in his mouth,"
Job,20,14,yet the food in his stomach turns into cobras’ venom inside him.
Job,20,15,He swallows wealth but must vomit it up; God will force it from his stomach.
Job,20,16,He will suck the poison of cobras; a viper’s fangs will kill him.
Job,20,17,"He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream."
Job,20,18,He must return the fruit of his labor without consuming it; he doesn’t enjoy the profits from his trading.
Job,20,19,For he oppressed and abandoned the poor; he seized a house he did not build.
Job,20,20,"Because his appetite is never satisfied, he does not let anything he desires escape."
Job,20,21,"Nothing is left for him to consume; therefore, his prosperity will not last."
Job,20,22,At the height of his success distress will come to him; the full weight of misery will crush him.
Job,20,23,"When he fills his stomach, God will send His burning anger against him, raining it down on him while he is eating."
Job,20,24,"If he flees from an iron weapon, an arrow from a bronze bow will pierce him."
Job,20,25,"He pulls it out of his back, the flashing tip out of his liver. Terrors come over him."
Job,20,26,Total darkness is reserved for his treasures. A fire unfanned by human hands will consume him; it will feed on what is left in his tent.
Job,20,27,"The heavens will expose his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him."
Job,20,28,"The possessions in his house will be removed, flowing away on the day of God’s anger."
Job,20,29,"This is the wicked man’s lot from God, the inheritance God ordained for him."
Job,21,1,Then Job answered:
Job,21,2,Pay close attention to my words; let this be the consolation you offer.
Job,21,3,"Bear with me while I speak; then after I have spoken, you may continue mocking."
Job,21,4,"As for me, is my complaint against a man? Then why shouldn’t I be impatient?"
Job,21,5,Look at me and shudder; put your hand over your mouth.
Job,21,6,"When I think about it, I am terrified and my body trembles in horror."
Job,21,7,"Why do the wicked continue to live, growing old and becoming powerful?"
Job,21,8,"Their children are established while they are still alive, and their descendants, before their eyes."
Job,21,9,Their homes are secure and free of fear; no rod from God strikes them.
Job,21,10,Their bulls breed without fail; their cows calve and do not miscarry.
Job,21,11,"They let their little ones run around like lambs; their children skip about,"
Job,21,12,singing to the tambourine and lyre and rejoicing at the sound of the flute.
Job,21,13,They spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol in peace.
Job,21,14,Yet they say to God: “Leave us alone! We don’t want to know Your ways.
Job,21,15,"Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, and what will we gain by pleading with Him?”"
Job,21,16,But their prosperity is not of their own doing. The counsel of the wicked is far from me!
Job,21,17,How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? Does disaster come on them? Does He apportion destruction in His anger?
Job,21,18,"Are they like straw before the wind, like chaff a storm sweeps away?"
Job,21,19,"God reserves a person’s punishment for his children. Let God repay the person himself, so that he may know it."
Job,21,20,Let his own eyes see his demise; let him drink from the Almighty’s wrath!
Job,21,21,"For what does he care about his family once he is dead, when the number of his months has run out?"
Job,21,22,"Can anyone teach God knowledge, since He judges the exalted ones?"
Job,21,23,"One person dies in excellent health, completely secure and at ease."
Job,21,24,"His body is well fed, and his bones are full of marrow."
Job,21,25,"Yet another person dies with a bitter soul, having never tasted prosperity."
Job,21,26,"But they both lie in the dust, and worms cover them."
Job,21,27,"I know your thoughts very well, the schemes you would wrong me with."
Job,21,28,"For you say, “Where now is the nobleman’s house?” and “Where are the tents the wicked lived in?”"
Job,21,29,Have you never consulted those who travel the roads? Don’t you accept their reports?
Job,21,30,"Indeed, the evil man is spared from the day of disaster, rescued from the day of wrath."
Job,21,31,Who would denounce his behavior to his face? Who would repay him for what he has done?
Job,21,32,"He is carried to the grave, and someone keeps watch over his tomb."
Job,21,33,"The dirt on his grave is sweet to him. Everyone follows behind him, and those who go before him are without number."
Job,21,34,So how can you offer me such futile comfort? Your answers are deceptive.
Job,22,1,Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
Job,22,2,Can a man be of any use to God? Can even a wise man be of use to Him?
Job,22,3,Does it delight the Almighty if you are righteous? Does He profit if you perfect your behavior?
Job,22,4,Does He correct you and take you to court because of your piety?
Job,22,5,Isn’t your wickedness abundant and aren’t your iniquities endless?
Job,22,6,"For you took collateral from your brothers without cause, stripping off their clothes and leaving them naked."
Job,22,7,"You gave no water to the thirsty and withheld food from the famished,"
Job,22,8,while the land belonged to a powerful man and an influential man lived on it.
Job,22,9,"You sent widows away empty-handed, and the strength of the fatherless was crushed."
Job,22,10,"Therefore snares surround you, and sudden dread terrifies you,"
Job,22,11,"or darkness, so you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you."
Job,22,12,Isn’t God as high as the heavens? And look at the highest stars—how lofty they are!
Job,22,13,Yet you say: “What does God know? Can He judge through thick darkness?
Job,22,14,"Clouds veil Him so that He cannot see, as He walks on the circle of the sky.”"
Job,22,15,Will you continue on the ancient path that wicked men have walked?
Job,22,16,"They were snatched away before their time, and their foundations were washed away by a river."
Job,22,17,"They were the ones who said to God, “Leave us alone!” and “What can the Almighty do to us?”"
Job,22,18,But it was He who filled their houses with good things. The counsel of the wicked is far from me!
Job,22,19,"The righteous see this and rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying,"
Job,22,20,"“Surely our opponents are destroyed, and fire has consumed what they left behind.”"
Job,22,21,Come to terms with God and be at peace; in this way good will come to you.
Job,22,22,"Receive instruction from His mouth, and place His sayings in your heart."
Job,22,23,"If you return to the Almighty, you will be renewed. If you banish injustice from your tent"
Job,22,24,"and consign your gold to the dust, the gold of Ophir to the stones in the wadis,"
Job,22,25,the Almighty will be your gold and your finest silver.
Job,22,26,Then you will delight in the Almighty and lift up your face to God.
Job,22,27,"You will pray to Him, and He will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows."
Job,22,28,"When you make a decision, it will be carried out, and light will shine on your ways."
Job,22,29,"When others are humiliated and you say, “Lift them up,” God will save the humble."
Job,22,30,"He will even rescue the guilty one, who will be rescued by the purity of your hands."
Job,23,1,Then Job answered:
Job,23,2,Today also my complaint is bitter. His hand is heavy despite my groaning.
Job,23,3,"If only I knew how to find Him, so that I could go to His throne."
Job,23,4,I would plead my case before Him and fill my mouth with arguments.
Job,23,5,I would learn how He would answer me; and understand what He would say to me.
Job,23,6,"Would He prosecute me forcefully? No, He will certainly pay attention to me."
Job,23,7,"Then an upright man could reason with Him, and I would escape from my Judge forever."
Job,23,8,"If I go east, He is not there, and if I go west, I cannot perceive Him."
Job,23,9,"When He is at work to the north, I cannot see Him; when He turns south, I cannot find Him."
Job,23,10,"Yet He knows the way I have taken; when He has tested me, I will emerge as pure gold."
Job,23,11,My feet have followed in His tracks; I have kept to His way and not turned aside.
Job,23,12,I have not departed from the commands of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily food.
Job,23,13,But He is unchangeable; who can oppose Him? He does what He desires.
Job,23,14,"He will certainly accomplish what He has decreed for me, and He has many more things like these in mind."
Job,23,15,"Therefore I am terrified in His presence; when I consider this, I am afraid of Him."
Job,23,16,God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.
Job,23,17,"Yet I am not destroyed by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face."
Job,24,1,Why does the Almighty not reserve times for judgment? Why do those who know Him never see His days?
Job,24,2,The wicked displace boundary markers. They steal a flock and provide pasture for it.
Job,24,3,They drive away the donkeys owned by the fatherless and take the widow’s ox as collateral.
Job,24,4,They push the needy off the road; the poor of the land are forced into hiding.
Job,24,5,"Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go out to their task of foraging for food; the wilderness provides nourishment for their children."
Job,24,6,They gather their fodder in the field and glean the vineyards of the wicked.
Job,24,7,"Without clothing, they spend the night naked, having no covering against the cold."
Job,24,8,"Drenched by mountain rains, they huddle against the rocks, shelterless."
Job,24,9,The fatherless infant is snatched from the breast; the nursing child of the poor is seized as collateral.
Job,24,10,"Without clothing, they wander about naked. They carry sheaves but go hungry."
Job,24,11,"They crush olives in their presses; they tread the winepresses, but go thirsty."
Job,24,12,"From the city, men groan; the mortally wounded cry for help, yet God pays no attention to this crime."
Job,24,13,The wicked are those who rebel against the light. They do not recognize its ways or stay on its paths.
Job,24,14,"The murderer rises at dawn to kill the poor and needy, and by night he becomes a thief."
Job,24,15,"The adulterer’s eye watches for twilight, thinking: No eye will see me; he covers his face."
Job,24,16,"In the dark they break into houses; by day they lock themselves in, never experiencing the light."
Job,24,17,For the morning is like darkness to them. Surely they are familiar with the terrors of darkness!
Job,24,18,"They float on the surface of the water. Their section of the land is cursed, so that they never go to their vineyards."
Job,24,19,"As dry ground and heat snatch away the melted snow, so Sheol steals those who have sinned."
Job,24,20,The womb forgets them; worms feed on them; they are remembered no more. So injustice is broken like a tree.
Job,24,21,"They prey on the childless woman who is unable to conceive, and do not deal kindly with the widow."
Job,24,22,"Yet God drags away the mighty by His power; when He rises up, they have no assurance of life."
Job,24,23,"He gives them a sense of security, so they can rely on it, but His eyes watch over their ways."
Job,24,24,"They are exalted for a moment, then they are gone; they are brought low and shrivel up like everything else. They wither like heads of grain."
Job,24,25,"If this is not true, then who can prove me a liar and show that my speech is worthless?"
Job,25,1,Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
Job,25,2,"Dominion and dread belong to Him, the One who establishes harmony in the heavens."
Job,25,3,Can His troops be numbered? Does His light not shine on everyone?
Job,25,4,How can a person be justified before God? How can one born of woman be pure?
Job,25,5,"If even the moon does not shine and the stars are not pure in His sight,"
Job,25,6,"how much less man, who is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a worm!"
Job,26,1,Then Job answered:
Job,26,2,How you have helped the powerless and delivered the arm that is weak!
Job,26,3,How you have counseled the unwise and thoroughly explained the path to success!
Job,26,4,Who did you speak these words to? Whose breath came out of your mouth?
Job,26,5,The departed spirits tremble beneath the waters and all that inhabit them.
Job,26,6,"Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering."
Job,26,7,He stretches the northern skies over empty space; He hangs the earth on nothing.
Job,26,8,"He wraps up the waters in His clouds, yet the clouds do not burst beneath their weight."
Job,26,9,"He obscures the view of His throne, spreading His cloud over it."
Job,26,10,He laid out the horizon on the surface of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.
Job,26,11,"The pillars that hold up the sky tremble, astounded at His rebuke."
Job,26,12,"By His power He stirred the sea, and by His understanding He crushed Rahab."
Job,26,13,By His breath the heavens gained their beauty; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
Job,26,14,These are but the fringes of His ways; how faint is the word we hear of Him! Who can understand His mighty thunder?
Job,27,1,"Job continued his discourse, saying:"
Job,27,2,"As God lives, who has deprived me of justice, and the Almighty who has made me bitter,"
Job,27,3,"as long as my breath is still in me and the breath from God remains in my nostrils,"
Job,27,4,"my lips will not speak unjustly, and my tongue will not utter deceit."
Job,27,5,I will never affirm that you are right. I will maintain my integrity until I die.
Job,27,6,I will cling to my righteousness and never let it go. My conscience will not accuse me as long as I live!
Job,27,7,May my enemy be like the wicked and my opponent like the unjust.
Job,27,8,"For what hope does the godless man have when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?"
Job,27,9,Will God hear his cry when distress comes on him?
Job,27,10,Will he delight in the Almighty? Will he call on God at all times?
Job,27,11,I will teach you about God’s power. I will not conceal what the Almighty has planned.
Job,27,12,"All of you have seen this for yourselves, why do you keep up this empty talk?"
Job,27,13,"This is a wicked man’s lot from God, the inheritance the ruthless receive from the Almighty."
Job,27,14,"Even if his children increase, they are destined for the sword; his descendants will never have enough food."
Job,27,15,"Those who survive him will be buried by the plague, yet their widows will not weep for them."
Job,27,16,Though he piles up silver like dust and heaps up a wardrobe like clay—
Job,27,17,"he may heap it up, but the righteous will wear it, and the innocent will divide up his silver."
Job,27,18,The house he built is like a moth’s cocoon or a booth set up by a watchman.
Job,27,19,"He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, it is gone."
Job,27,20,Terrors overtake him like a flood; a storm wind sweeps him away at night.
Job,27,21,"An east wind picks him up, and he is gone; it carries him away from his place."
Job,27,22,"It blasts at him without mercy, while he flees desperately from its grasp."
Job,27,23,It claps its hands at him and scorns him from its place.
Job,28,1,Surely there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.
Job,28,2,"Iron is taken from the ground, and copper is smelted from ore."
Job,28,3,A miner puts an end to the darkness; he probes the deepest recesses for ore in the gloomy darkness.
Job,28,4,"He cuts a shaft far from human habitation, in places unknown to those who walk above ground. Suspended far away from people, the miners swing back and forth."
Job,28,5,"Food may come from the earth, but below the surface the earth is transformed as by fire."
Job,28,6,"Its rocks are a source of sapphire, containing flecks of gold."
Job,28,7,No bird of prey knows that path; no falcon’s eye has seen it.
Job,28,8,Proud beasts have never walked on it; no lion has ever prowled over it.
Job,28,9,The miner strikes the flint and transforms the mountains at their foundations.
Job,28,10,"He cuts out channels in the rocks, and his eyes spot every treasure."
Job,28,11,He dams up the streams from flowing so that he may bring to light what is hidden.
Job,28,12,"But where can wisdom be found, and where is understanding located?"
Job,28,13,"No man can know its value, since it cannot be found in the land of the living."
Job,28,14,"The ocean depths say, “It’s not in me,” while the sea declares, “I don’t have it.”"
Job,28,15,"Gold cannot be exchanged for it, and silver cannot be weighed out for its price."
Job,28,16,"Wisdom cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire."
Job,28,17,"Gold and glass do not compare with it, and articles of fine gold cannot be exchanged for it."
Job,28,18,Coral and quartz are not worth mentioning. The price of wisdom is beyond pearls.
Job,28,19,"Topaz from Cush cannot compare with it, and it cannot be valued in pure gold."
Job,28,20,"Where then does wisdom come from, and where is understanding located?"
Job,28,21,It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing and concealed from the birds of the sky.
Job,28,22,"Abaddon and Death say, “We have heard news of it with our ears.”"
Job,28,23,"But God understands the way to wisdom, and He knows its location."
Job,28,24,For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.
Job,28,25,"When God fixed the weight of the wind and limited the water by measure,"
Job,28,26,"when He established a limit for the rain and a path for the lightning,"
Job,28,27,He considered wisdom and evaluated it; He established it and examined it.
Job,28,28,"He said to mankind, “The fear of the Lord is this: wisdom. And to turn from evil is understanding.”"
Job,29,1,"Job continued his discourse, saying:"
Job,29,2,"If only I could be as in months gone by, in the days when God watched over me,"
Job,29,3,"when His lamp shone above my head, and I walked through darkness by His light!"
Job,29,4,"I would be as I was in the days of my youth when God’s friendship rested on my tent,"
Job,29,5,"when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,"
Job,29,6,when my feet were bathed in cream and the rock poured out streams of oil for me!
Job,29,7,"When I went out to the city gate and took my seat in the town square,"
Job,29,8,"the young men saw me and withdrew, while older men stood to their feet."
Job,29,9,City officials stopped talking and covered their mouths with their hands.
Job,29,10,"The noblemen’s voices were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths."
Job,29,11,"When they heard me, they blessed me, and when they saw me, they spoke well of me."
Job,29,12,"For I rescued the poor man who cried out for help, and the fatherless child who had no one to support him."
Job,29,13,"The dying man blessed me, and I made the widow’s heart rejoice."
Job,29,14,"I clothed myself in righteousness, and it enveloped me; my just decisions were like a robe and a turban."
Job,29,15,I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
Job,29,16,"I was a father to the needy, and I examined the case of the stranger."
Job,29,17,I shattered the fangs of the unjust and snatched the prey from his teeth.
Job,29,18,So I thought: I will die in my own nest and multiply my days as the sand.
Job,29,19,"My roots will have access to water, and the dew will rest on my branches all night."
Job,29,20,"My strength will be refreshed within me, and my bow will be renewed in my hand."
Job,29,21,"Men listened to me with expectation, waiting silently for my advice."
Job,29,22,After a word from me they did not speak again; my speech settled on them like dew.
Job,29,23,They waited for me as for the rain and opened their mouths as for spring showers.
Job,29,24,"If I smiled at them, they couldn’t believe it; they were thrilled at the light of my countenance."
Job,29,25,"I directed their course and presided as chief. I lived as a king among his troops, like one who comforts those who mourn."
Job,30,1,"But now they mock me, men younger than I am, whose fathers I would have refused to put with my sheep dogs."
Job,30,2,What use to me was the strength of their hands? Their vigor had left them.
Job,30,3,"Emaciated from poverty and hunger, they gnawed the dry land, the desolate wasteland by night."
Job,30,4,"They plucked mallow among the shrubs, and the roots of the broom tree were their food."
Job,30,5,They were expelled from human society; people shouted at them as if they were thieves.
Job,30,6,"They are living on the slopes of the wadis, among the rocks and in holes in the ground."
Job,30,7,They bray among the shrubs; they huddle beneath the thistles.
Job,30,8,"Foolish men, without even a name. They were forced to leave the land."
Job,30,9,Now I am mocked by their songs; I have become an object of scorn to them.
Job,30,10,They despise me and keep their distance from me; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
Job,30,11,"Because God has loosened my bowstring and oppressed me, they have cast off restraint in my presence."
Job,30,12,The rabble rise up at my right; they trap my feet and construct their siege ramp against me.
Job,30,13,"They tear up my path; they contribute to my destruction, without anyone to help them."
Job,30,14,They advance as through a gaping breach; they keep rolling in through the ruins.
Job,30,15,"Terrors are turned loose against me; they chase my dignity away like the wind, and my prosperity has passed by like a cloud."
Job,30,16,"Now my life is poured out before my eyes, and days of suffering have seized me."
Job,30,17,"Night pierces my bones, but my gnawing pains never rest."
Job,30,18,My clothing is distorted with great force; He chokes me by the neck of my garment.
Job,30,19,"He throws me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes."
Job,30,20,"I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer me; when I stand up, You merely look at me."
Job,30,21,You have turned against me with cruelty; You harass me with Your strong hand.
Job,30,22,You lift me up on the wind and make me ride it; You scatter me in the storm.
Job,30,23,"Yes, I know that You will lead me to death— the place appointed for all who live."
Job,30,24,Yet no one would stretch out his hand against a ruined man when he cries out to him for help because of his distress.
Job,30,25,Have I not wept for those who have fallen on hard times? Has my soul not grieved for the needy?
Job,30,26,"But when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, darkness came."
Job,30,27,I am churning within and cannot rest; days of suffering confront me.
Job,30,28,"I walk about blackened, but not by the sun. I stood in the assembly and cried out for help."
Job,30,29,I have become a brother to jackals and a companion of ostriches.
Job,30,30,"My skin blackens and flakes off, and my bones burn with fever."
Job,30,31,My lyre is used for mourning and my flute for the sound of weeping.
Job,31,1,I have made a covenant with my eyes. How then could I look at a young woman?
Job,31,2,"For what portion would I have from God above, or what inheritance from the Almighty on high?"
Job,31,3,Doesn’t disaster come to the unjust and misfortune to evildoers?
Job,31,4,Does He not see my ways and number all my steps?
Job,31,5,"If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has rushed to deceit,"
Job,31,6,"let God weigh me in accurate scales, and He will recognize my integrity."
Job,31,7,"If my step has turned from the way, my heart has followed my eyes, or impurity has stained my hands,"
Job,31,8,"let someone else eat what I have sown, and let my crops be uprooted."
Job,31,9,"If my heart has been seduced by my neighbor’s wife or I have lurked at his door,"
Job,31,10,"let my own wife grind grain for another man, and let other men sleep with her."
Job,31,11,For that would be a disgrace; it would be a crime deserving punishment.
Job,31,12,For it is a fire that consumes down to Abaddon; it would destroy my entire harvest.
Job,31,13,"If I have dismissed the case of my male or female servants when they made a complaint against me,"
Job,31,14,what could I do when God stands up to judge? How should I answer Him when He calls me to account?
Job,31,15,Did not the One who made me in the womb also make them? Did not the same God form us both in the womb?
Job,31,16,"If I have refused the wishes of the poor or let the widow’s eyes go blind,"
Job,31,17,if I have eaten my few crumbs alone without letting the fatherless eat any of it—
Job,31,18,"for from my youth, I raised him as his father, and since the day I was born I guided the widow—"
Job,31,19,"if I have seen anyone dying for lack of clothing or a needy person without a cloak,"
Job,31,20,"if he did not bless me while warming himself with the fleece from my sheep,"
Job,31,21,"if I ever cast my vote against a fatherless child when I saw that I had support in the city gate,"
Job,31,22,"then let my shoulder blade fall from my back, and my arm be pulled from its socket."
Job,31,23,"For disaster from God terrifies me, and because of His majesty I could not do these things."
Job,31,24,"If I placed my confidence in gold or called fine gold my trust,"
Job,31,25,"if I have rejoiced because my wealth is great or because my own hand has acquired so much,"
Job,31,26,"if I have gazed at the sun when it was shining or at the moon moving in splendor,"
Job,31,27,"so that my heart was secretly enticed and I threw them a kiss,"
Job,31,28,"this would also be a crime deserving punishment, for I would have denied God above."
Job,31,29,"Have I rejoiced over my enemy’s distress, or become excited when trouble came his way?"
Job,31,30,I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking for his life with a curse.
Job,31,31,"Haven’t the members of my household said, “Who is there who has not had enough to eat at Job’s table?”"
Job,31,32,"No stranger had to spend the night on the street, for I opened my door to the traveler."
Job,31,33,"Have I covered my transgressions as others do by hiding my guilt in my heart,"
Job,31,34,"because I greatly feared the crowds, and the contempt of the clans terrified me, so I grew silent and would not go outside?"
Job,31,35,If only I had someone to hear my case! Here is my signature; let the Almighty answer me. Let my Opponent compose His indictment.
Job,31,36,I would surely carry it on my shoulder and wear it like a crown.
Job,31,37,I would give Him an account of all my steps; I would approach Him like a prince.
Job,31,38,"If my land cries out against me and its furrows join in weeping,"
Job,31,39,"if I have consumed its produce without payment or shown contempt for its tenants,"
Job,31,40,then let thorns grow instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley. The words of Job are concluded.
Job,32,1,"So these three men quit answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
Job,32,2,Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite from the family of Ram became angry. He was angry at Job because he had justified himself rather than God.
Job,32,3,He was also angry at Job’s three friends because they had failed to refute him and yet had condemned him.
Job,32,4,Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were all older than he.
Job,32,5,"But when he saw that the three men could not answer Job, he became angry."
Job,32,6,"So Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite replied: I am young in years, while you are old; therefore I was timid and afraid to tell you what I know."
Job,32,7,I thought that age should speak and maturity should teach wisdom.
Job,32,8,But it is a spirit in man and the breath of the Almighty that give him understanding.
Job,32,9,It is not only the old who are wise or the elderly who understand how to judge.
Job,32,10,"Therefore I say, “Listen to me. I too will declare what I know.”"
Job,32,11,"Look, I waited for your conclusions; I listened to your insights as you sought for words."
Job,32,12,I paid close attention to you. Yet no one proved Job wrong; not one of you refuted his arguments.
Job,32,13,"So do not claim, “We have found wisdom; let God deal with him, not man.”"
Job,32,14,"But Job has not directed his argument to me, and I will not respond to him with your arguments."
Job,32,15,Job’s friends are dismayed and can no longer answer; words have left them.
Job,32,16,"Should I continue to wait now that they are silent, now that they stand there and no longer answer?"
Job,32,17,"I too will answer; yes, I will tell what I know."
Job,32,18,"For I am full of words, and my spirit compels me to speak."
Job,32,19,My heart is like unvented wine; it is about to burst like new wineskins.
Job,32,20,I must speak so that I can find relief; I must open my lips and respond.
Job,32,21,"I will be partial to no one, and I will not give anyone an undeserved title."
Job,32,22,"For I do not know how to give such titles; otherwise, my Maker would remove me in an instant."
Job,33,1,"But now, Job, pay attention to my speech, and listen to all my words."
Job,33,2,I am going to open my mouth; my tongue will form words on my palate.
Job,33,3,"My words come from my upright heart, and my lips speak with sincerity what they know."
Job,33,4,"The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life."
Job,33,5,Refute me if you can. Prepare your case against me; take your stand.
Job,33,6,I am just like you before God; I was also pinched off from a piece of clay.
Job,33,7,Fear of me should not terrify you; the pressure I exert against you will be light.
Job,33,8,"Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard these very words:"
Job,33,9,"“I am pure, without transgression; I am clean and have no guilt."
Job,33,10,But He finds reasons to oppose me; He regards me as His enemy.
Job,33,11,He puts my feet in the stocks; He stands watch over all my paths.”
Job,33,12,"But I tell you that you are wrong in this matter, since God is greater than man."
Job,33,13,Why do you take Him to court for not answering anything a person asks?
Job,33,14,"For God speaks time and again, but a person may not notice it."
Job,33,15,"In a dream, a vision in the night, when deep sleep falls on people as they slumber on their beds,"
Job,33,16,"He uncovers their ears at that time and terrifies them with warnings,"
Job,33,17,in order to turn a person from his actions and suppress his pride.
Job,33,18,"God spares his soul from the Pit, his life from crossing the river of death."
Job,33,19,"A person may be disciplined on his bed with pain and constant distress in his bones,"
Job,33,20,"so that he detests bread, and his soul despises his favorite food."
Job,33,21,"His flesh wastes away to nothing, and his unseen bones stick out."
Job,33,22,"He draws near to the Pit, and his life to the executioners."
Job,33,23,"If there is an angel on his side, one mediator out of a thousand, to tell a person what is right for him"
Job,33,24,"and to be gracious to him and say, “Spare him from going down to the Pit; I have found a ransom,”"
Job,33,25,"then his flesh will be healthier than in his youth, and he will return to the days of his youthful vigor."
Job,33,26,"He will pray to God, and God will delight in him. That man will see His face with a shout of joy, and God will restore his righteousness to him."
Job,33,27,"He will look at men and say, “I have sinned and perverted what was right; yet I did not get what I deserved."
Job,33,28,"He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and I will continue to see the light.”"
Job,33,29,God certainly does all these things two or three times to a man
Job,33,30,"in order to turn him back from the Pit, so he may shine with the light of life."
Job,33,31,"Pay attention, Job, and listen to me. Be quiet, and I will speak."
Job,33,32,"But if you have something to say, answer me; speak, for I would like to justify you."
Job,33,33,"If not, then listen to me; be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom."
Job,34,1,"Then Elihu continued, saying:"
Job,34,2,"Hear my words, you wise men, and listen to me, you knowledgeable ones."
Job,34,3,Doesn’t the ear test words as the palate tastes food?
Job,34,4,Let us judge for ourselves what is right; let us decide together what is good.
Job,34,5,"For Job has declared, “I am righteous, yet God has deprived me of justice."
Job,34,6,"Would I lie about my case? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.”"
Job,34,7,What man is like Job? He drinks derision like water.
Job,34,8,He keeps company with evildoers and walks with wicked men.
Job,34,9,"For he has said, “A man gains nothing when he becomes God’s friend.”"
Job,34,10,"Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding. It is impossible for God to do wrong, and for the Almighty to act unjustly."
Job,34,11,"For He repays a person according to his deeds, and He brings his ways on him."
Job,34,12,"Indeed, it is true that God does not act wickedly and the Almighty does not pervert justice."
Job,34,13,Who gave Him authority over the earth? Who put Him in charge of the entire world?
Job,34,14,"If He put His mind to it and withdrew the spirit and breath He gave,"
Job,34,15,every living thing would perish together and mankind would return to the dust.
Job,34,16,"If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I have to say."
Job,34,17,"Could one who hates justice govern the world? Will you condemn the mighty Righteous One,"
Job,34,18,"who says to a king, “Worthless man!” and to nobles, “Wicked men!”?"
Job,34,19,"God is not partial to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of His hands."
Job,34,20,"They die suddenly in the middle of the night; people shudder, then pass away. Even the mighty are removed without effort."
Job,34,21,"For His eyes watch over a man’s ways, and He observes all his steps."
Job,34,22,"There is no darkness, no deep darkness, where evildoers can hide themselves."
Job,34,23,"God does not need to examine a person further, that one should approach Him in court."
Job,34,24,He shatters the mighty without an investigation and sets others in their place.
Job,34,25,"Therefore, He recognizes their deeds and overthrows them by night, and they are crushed."
Job,34,26,"In full view of the public, He strikes them for their wickedness,"
Job,34,27,because they turned aside from following Him and did not understand any of His ways
Job,34,28,"but caused the poor to cry out to Him, and He heard the outcry of the afflicted."
Job,34,29,"But when God is silent, who can declare Him guilty? When He hides His face, who can see Him? Yet He watches over both individuals and nations,"
Job,34,30,so that godless men should not rule or ensnare the people.
Job,34,31,"Suppose someone says to God, “I have endured my punishment; I will no longer act wickedly."
Job,34,32,"Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I won’t do it again.”"
Job,34,33,"Should God repay you on your terms when you have rejected His? You must choose, not I! So declare what you know."
Job,34,34,"Reasonable men will say to me, along with the wise men who hear me,"
Job,34,35,“Job speaks without knowledge; his words are without insight.”
Job,34,36,"If only Job were tested to the limit, because his answers are like those of wicked men."
Job,34,37,"For he adds rebellion to his sin; he scornfully claps in our presence, while multiplying his words against God."
Job,35,1,"Then Elihu continued, saying:"
Job,35,2,"Do you think it is just when you say, “I am righteous before God”?"
Job,35,3,"For you ask, “What does it profit You, and what benefit comes to me, if I do not sin?”"
Job,35,4,I will answer you and your friends with you.
Job,35,5,Look at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds high above you.
Job,35,6,"If you sin, how does it affect God? If you multiply your transgressions, what does it do to Him?"
Job,35,7,"If you are righteous, what do you give Him, or what does He receive from your hand?"
Job,35,8,"Your wickedness affects a person like yourself, and your righteousness another human being."
Job,35,9,People cry out because of severe oppression; they shout for help because of the arm of the mighty.
Job,35,10,"But no one asks, “Where is God my Maker, who provides us with songs in the night,"
Job,35,11,who gives us more understanding than the animals of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?”
Job,35,12,"There they cry out, but He does not answer, because of the pride of evil men."
Job,35,13,"Indeed, God does not listen to empty cries, and the Almighty does not take note of it—"
Job,35,14,"how much less when you complain that you do not see Him, that your case is before Him and you are waiting for Him."
Job,35,15,"But now, because God’s anger does not punish and He does not pay attention to transgression,"
Job,35,16,Job opens his mouth in vain and multiplies words without knowledge.
Job,36,1,"Then Elihu continued, saying:"
Job,36,2,"Be patient with me a little longer, and I will inform you, for there is still more to be said on God’s behalf."
Job,36,3,I will get my knowledge from a distant place and ascribe justice to my Maker.
Job,36,4,For my arguments are without flaw; one who has perfect knowledge is with you.
Job,36,5,"Yes, God is mighty, but He despises no one; He understands all things."
Job,36,6,"He does not keep the wicked alive, but He gives justice to the afflicted."
Job,36,7,"He does not remove His gaze from the righteous, but He seats them forever with enthroned kings, and they are exalted."
Job,36,8,"If people are bound with chains and trapped by the cords of affliction,"
Job,36,9,God tells them what they have done and how arrogantly they have transgressed.
Job,36,10,He opens their ears to correction and insists they repent from iniquity.
Job,36,11,"If they serve Him obediently, they will end their days in prosperity and their years in happiness."
Job,36,12,"But if they do not obey, they will cross the river of death and die without knowledge."
Job,36,13,"Those who have a godless heart harbor anger; even when God binds them, they do not cry for help."
Job,36,14,They die in their youth; their life ends among male cult prostitutes.
Job,36,15,God rescues the afflicted by their affliction; He instructs them by their torment.
Job,36,16,"Indeed, He lured you from the jaws of distress to a spacious and unconfined place. Your table was spread with choice food."
Job,36,17,Yet now you are obsessed with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have seized you.
Job,36,18,Be careful that no one lures you with riches; do not let a large ransom lead you astray.
Job,36,19,Can your wealth or all your physical exertion keep you from distress?
Job,36,20,Do not long for the night when nations will disappear from their places.
Job,36,21,"Be careful that you do not turn to iniquity, for that is why you have been tested by affliction."
Job,36,22,"Look, God shows Himself exalted by His power. Who is a teacher like Him?"
Job,36,23,"Who has appointed His way for Him, and who has declared, “You have done wrong”?"
Job,36,24,"Remember that you should praise His work, which people have sung about."
Job,36,25,All mankind has seen it; people have looked at it from a distance.
Job,36,26,"Yes, God is exalted beyond our knowledge; the number of His years cannot be counted."
Job,36,27,"For He makes waterdrops evaporate; they distill the rain into its mist,"
Job,36,28,which the clouds pour out and shower abundantly on mankind.
Job,36,29,Can anyone understand how the clouds spread out or how the thunder roars from God’s pavilion?
Job,36,30,See how He spreads His lightning around Him and covers the depths of the sea.
Job,36,31,For He judges the nations with these; He gives food in abundance.
Job,36,32,He covers His hands with lightning and commands it to hit its mark.
Job,36,33,"The thunder declares His presence; the cattle also, the approaching storm."
Job,37,1,My heart pounds at this and leaps from my chest.
Job,37,2,Just listen to His thunderous voice and the rumbling that comes from His mouth.
Job,37,3,He lets it loose beneath the entire sky; His lightning to the ends of the earth.
Job,37,4,Then there comes a roaring sound; God thunders with His majestic voice. He does not restrain the lightning when His rumbling voice is heard.
Job,37,5,God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things that we cannot comprehend.
Job,37,6,"For He says to the snow, “Fall to the earth,” and the torrential rains, His mighty torrential rains,"
Job,37,7,"serve as His sign to all mankind, so that all men may know His work."
Job,37,8,The wild animals enter their lairs and stay in their dens.
Job,37,9,"The windstorm comes from its chamber, and the cold from the driving north winds."
Job,37,10,"Ice is formed by the breath of God, and watery expanses are frozen."
Job,37,11,He saturates clouds with moisture; He scatters His lightning through them.
Job,37,12,"They swirl about, turning round and round at His direction, accomplishing everything He commands them over the surface of the inhabited world."
Job,37,13,"He causes this to happen for punishment, for His land, or for His faithful love."
Job,37,14,"Listen to this, Job. Stop and consider God’s wonders."
Job,37,15,Do you know how God directs His clouds or makes their lightning flash?
Job,37,16,"Do you understand how the clouds float, those wonderful works of Him who has perfect knowledge?"
Job,37,17,"You whose clothes get hot when the south wind brings calm to the land,"
Job,37,18,can you help God spread out the skies as hard as a cast metal mirror?
Job,37,19,Teach us what we should say to Him; we cannot prepare our case because of our darkness.
Job,37,20,Should He be told that I want to speak? Can a man speak when he is confused?
Job,37,21,"Now men cannot even look at the sun when it is in the skies, after a wind has swept through and cleared them away."
Job,37,22,"Yet out of the north He comes, shrouded in a golden glow; awesome majesty surrounds Him."
Job,37,23,"The Almighty—we cannot reach Him— He is exalted in power! He will not oppress justice and abundant righteousness,"
Job,37,24,"Therefore, men fear Him. He does not look favorably on any who are wise in heart."
Job,38,1,Then the LORD answered Job from the whirlwind. He said:
Job,38,2,Who is this who obscures My counsel with ignorant words?
Job,38,3,"Get ready to answer Me like a man; when I question you, you will inform Me."
Job,38,4,"Where were you when I established the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding."
Job,38,5,Who fixed its dimensions? Certainly you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it?
Job,38,6,What supports its foundations? Or who laid its cornerstone
Job,38,7,while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
Job,38,8,"Who enclosed the sea behind doors when it burst from the womb,"
Job,38,9,"when I made the clouds its garment and thick darkness its blanket,"
Job,38,10,"when I determined its boundaries and put its bars and doors in place,"
Job,38,11,"when I declared: “You may come this far, but no farther; your proud waves stop here”?"
Job,38,12,"Have you ever in your life commanded the morning or assigned the dawn its place,"
Job,38,13,so it may seize the edges of the earth and shake the wicked out of it?
Job,38,14,The earth is changed as clay is by a seal; its hills stand out like the folds of a garment.
Job,38,15,"Light is withheld from the wicked, and the arm raised in violence is broken."
Job,38,16,Have you traveled to the sources of the sea or walked in the depths of the oceans?
Job,38,17,Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Have you seen the gates of deep darkness?
Job,38,18,"Have you comprehended the extent of the earth? Tell Me, if you know all this."
Job,38,19,"Where is the road to the home of light? Do you know where darkness lives,"
Job,38,20,so you can lead it back to its border? Are you familiar with the paths to its home?
Job,38,21,Don’t you know? You were already born; you have lived so long!
Job,38,22,"Have you entered the place where the snow is stored? Or have you seen the storehouses of hail,"
Job,38,23,"which I hold in reserve for times of trouble, for the day of warfare and battle?"
Job,38,24,What road leads to the place where light is dispersed? Where is the source of the east wind that spreads across the earth?
Job,38,25,"Who cuts a channel for the flooding rain or clears the way for lightning,"
Job,38,26,"to bring rain on an uninhabited land, on a desert with no human life,"
Job,38,27,to satisfy the parched wasteland and cause the grass to sprout?
Job,38,28,Does the rain have a father? Who fathered the drops of dew?
Job,38,29,Whose womb did the ice come from? Who gave birth to the frost of heaven
Job,38,30,"when water becomes as hard as stone, and the surface of the watery depths is frozen?"
Job,38,31,Can you fasten the chains of the Pleiades or loosen the belt of Orion?
Job,38,32,Can you bring out the constellations in their season and lead the Bear and her cubs?
Job,38,33,Do you know the laws of heaven? Can you impose its authority on earth?
Job,38,34,Can you command the clouds so that a flood of water covers you?
Job,38,35,"Can you send out lightning bolts, and they go? Do they report to you: “Here we are”?"
Job,38,36,Who put wisdom in the heart or gave the mind understanding?
Job,38,37,Who has the wisdom to number the clouds? Or who can tilt the water jars of heaven
Job,38,38,when the dust hardens like cast metal and the clods of dirt stick together?
Job,38,39,Can you hunt prey for a lioness or satisfy the appetite of young lions
Job,38,40,when they crouch in their dens and lie in wait within their lairs?
Job,38,41,Who provides the raven’s food when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food?
Job,39,1,Do you know when mountain goats give birth? Have you watched the deer in labor?
Job,39,2,Can you count the months they are pregnant so you can know the time they give birth?
Job,39,3,They crouch down to give birth to their young; they deliver their newborn.
Job,39,4,Their offspring are healthy and grow up in the open field. They leave and do not return.
Job,39,5,Who set the wild donkey free? Who released the swift donkey from its harness?
Job,39,6,"I made the wilderness its home, and the salty wasteland its dwelling."
Job,39,7,It scoffs at the noise of the village and never hears the shouts of a driver.
Job,39,8,"It roams the mountains for its pastureland, searching for anything green."
Job,39,9,Would the wild ox be willing to serve you? Would it spend the night by your feeding trough?
Job,39,10,Can you hold the wild ox to a furrow by its harness? Will it plow the valleys behind you?
Job,39,11,Can you depend on it because its strength is great? Would you leave it to do your hard work?
Job,39,12,Can you trust the wild ox to harvest your grain and bring it to your threshing floor?
Job,39,13,"The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but are her feathers and plumage like the stork’s?"
Job,39,14,She abandons her eggs on the ground and lets them be warmed in the sand.
Job,39,15,She forgets that a foot may crush them or that some wild animal may trample them.
Job,39,16,"She treats her young harshly, as if they were not her own, with no fear that her labor may have been in vain."
Job,39,17,For God has deprived her of wisdom; He has not endowed her with understanding.
Job,39,18,"When she proudly spreads her wings, she laughs at the horse and its rider."
Job,39,19,Do you give strength to the horse? Do you adorn his neck with a mane?
Job,39,20,Do you make him leap like a locust? His proud snorting fills one with terror.
Job,39,21,He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength; He charges into battle.
Job,39,22,"He laughs at fear, since he is afraid of nothing; he does not run from the sword."
Job,39,23,"A quiver rattles at his side, along with a flashing spear and a lance."
Job,39,24,He charges ahead with trembling rage; he cannot stand still at the trumpet’s sound.
Job,39,25,"When the trumpet blasts, he snorts defiantly. He smells the battle from a distance; he hears the officers’ shouts and the battle cry."
Job,39,26,Does the hawk take flight by your understanding and spread its wings to the south?
Job,39,27,Does the eagle soar at your command and make its nest on high?
Job,39,28,It lives on a cliff where it spends the night; its stronghold is on a rocky crag.
Job,39,29,From there it searches for prey; its eyes penetrate the distance.
Job,39,30,"Its brood gulps down blood, and where the slain are, it is there."
Job,40,1,The LORD answered Job:
Job,40,2,Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct Him? Let him who argues with God give an answer.
Job,40,3,Then Job answered the LORD:
Job,40,4,I am so insignificant. How can I answer You? I place my hand over my mouth.
Job,40,5,"I have spoken once, and I will not reply; twice, but now I can add nothing."
Job,40,6,Then the LORD answered Job from the whirlwind:
Job,40,7,"Get ready to answer Me like a man; When I question you, you will inform Me."
Job,40,8,Would you really challenge My justice? Would you declare Me guilty to justify yourself?
Job,40,9,Do you have an arm like God’s? Can you thunder with a voice like His?
Job,40,10,"Adorn yourself with majesty and splendor, and clothe yourself with honor and glory."
Job,40,11,Unleash your raging anger; look on every proud person and humiliate him.
Job,40,12,Look on every proud person and humble him; trample the wicked where they stand.
Job,40,13,Hide them together in the dust; imprison them in the grave.
Job,40,14,Then I will confess to you that your own right hand can deliver you.
Job,40,15,"Look at Behemoth, which I made along with you. He eats grass like an ox."
Job,40,16,Look at the strength of his loins and the power in the muscles of his belly.
Job,40,17,He stiffens his tail like a cedar tree; the tendons of his thighs are woven firmly together.
Job,40,18,His bones are bronze tubes; his limbs are like iron rods.
Job,40,19,He is the foremost of God’s works; only his Maker can draw the sword against him.
Job,40,20,"The hills yield food for him, while all sorts of wild animals play there."
Job,40,21,"He lies under the lotus plants, hiding in the protection of marshy reeds."
Job,40,22,Lotus plants cover him with their shade; the willows by the brook surround him.
Job,40,23,"Though the river rages, Behemoth is unafraid; he remains confident, even if the Jordan surges up to his mouth."
Job,40,24,"Can anyone capture him while he looks on, or pierce his nose with snares?"
Job,41,1,Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook or tie his tongue down with a rope?
Job,41,2,Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?
Job,41,3,Will he beg you for mercy or speak softly to you?
Job,41,4,Will he make a covenant with you so that you can take him as a slave forever?
Job,41,5,Can you play with him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?
Job,41,6,Will traders bargain for him or divide him among the merchants?
Job,41,7,Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?
Job,41,8,Lay a hand on him. You will remember the battle and never repeat it!
Job,41,9,Any hope of capturing him proves false. Does a person not collapse at the very sight of him?
Job,41,10,No one is ferocious enough to rouse Leviathan; who then can stand against Me?
Job,41,11,"Who confronted Me, that I should repay him? Everything under heaven belongs to Me."
Job,41,12,"I cannot be silent about his limbs, his power, and his graceful proportions."
Job,41,13,Who can strip off his outer covering? Who can penetrate his double layer of armor?
Job,41,14,"Who can open his jaws, surrounded by those terrifying teeth?"
Job,41,15,"His pride is in his rows of scales, closely sealed together."
Job,41,16,One scale is so close to another that no air can pass between them.
Job,41,17,"They are joined to one another, so closely connected they cannot be separated."
Job,41,18,"His snorting flashes with light, while his eyes are like the rays of dawn."
Job,41,19,Flaming torches shoot from his mouth; fiery sparks fly out!
Job,41,20,Smoke billows from his nostrils as from a boiling pot or burning reeds.
Job,41,21,"His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames pour out of his mouth."
Job,41,22,"Strength resides in his neck, and dismay dances before him."
Job,41,23,"The folds of his flesh are joined together, solid as metal and immovable."
Job,41,24,"His heart is as hard as a rock, as hard as a lower millstone!"
Job,41,25,"When Leviathan rises, the mighty are terrified; they withdraw because of his thrashing."
Job,41,26,"The sword that reaches him will have no effect, nor will a spear, dart, or arrow."
Job,41,27,"He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood."
Job,41,28,No arrow can make him flee; slingstones become like stubble to him.
Job,41,29,"A club is regarded as stubble, and he laughs at the sound of a javelin."
Job,41,30,"His undersides are jagged potsherds, spreading the mud like a threshing sledge."
Job,41,31,He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron; he makes the sea like an ointment jar.
Job,41,32,He leaves a shining wake behind him; one would think the deep had gray hair!
Job,41,33,He has no equal on earth— a creature devoid of fear!
Job,41,34,He surveys everything that is haughty; he is king over all the proud beasts.
Job,42,1,Then Job replied to the LORD:
Job,42,2,I know that You can do anything and no plan of Yours can be thwarted.
Job,42,3,"You asked, “Who is this who conceals My counsel with ignorance?” Surely I spoke about things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know."
Job,42,4,"You said, “Listen now, and I will speak. When I question you, you will inform Me.”"
Job,42,5,"I had heard rumors about You, but now my eyes have seen You."
Job,42,6,Therefore I take back my words and repent in dust and ashes.
Job,42,7,"After the LORD had finished speaking to Job, He said to Eliphaz the Temanite: “I am angry with you and your two friends, for you have not spoken the truth about Me, as My servant Job has."
Job,42,8,"Now take seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. Then My servant Job will pray for you. I will surely accept his prayer and not deal with you as your folly deserves. For you have not spoken the truth about Me, as My servant Job has.”"
Job,42,9,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD had told them, and the LORD accepted Job’s prayer."
Job,42,10,"After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD restored his prosperity and doubled his previous possessions."
Job,42,11,"All his brothers, sisters, and former acquaintances came to his house and dined with him in his house. They sympathized with him and comforted him concerning all the adversity the LORD had brought on him. Each one gave him a qesitah and a gold earring."
Job,42,12,"So the LORD blessed the last part of Job’s life more than the first. He owned 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys."
