Deuteronomy,29,16,"(for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed;"
Deuteronomy,29,17,"moreover, you have seen their abominations and their idols of wood, stone, silver, and gold, which they had with them);"
Deuteronomy,29,18,"so that there will not be among you a man or woman, or family or tribe, whose heart turns away today from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of those nations; that there will not be among you a root bearing poisonous fruit and wormwood."
Deuteronomy,29,19,"It shall be when he hears the words of this curse, that he will boast, saying, ‘I have peace though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart in order to destroy the watered land with the dry.’"
Deuteronomy,29,20,"The LORD shall never be willing to forgive him, but rather the anger of the LORD and His jealousy will burn against that man, and every curse which is written in this book will rest on him, and the LORD will blot out his name from under heaven."
Deuteronomy,29,21,"Then the LORD will single him out for adversity from all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant which are written in this book of the law."
Deuteronomy,29,22,"“Now the generation to come, your sons who rise up after you and the foreigner who comes from a distant land, when they see the plagues of the land and the diseases with which the LORD has afflicted it, will say,"
Deuteronomy,29,23,"‘All its land is brimstone and salt, a burning waste, unsown and unproductive, and no grass grows in it, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in His anger and in His wrath.’"
Deuteronomy,29,24,"All the nations will say, ‘Why has the LORD done thus to this land? Why this great outburst of anger?’"
Deuteronomy,29,25,"Then men will say, ‘Because they forsook the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,29,26,"They went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods whom they have not known and whom He had not allotted to them."
Deuteronomy,29,27,"Therefore, the anger of the LORD burned against that land, to bring upon it every curse which is written in this book;"
Deuteronomy,29,28,"and the LORD uprooted them from their land in anger and in fury and in great wrath, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.’"
Deuteronomy,29,29,"“The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our sons forever, that we may observe all the words of this law."
Deuteronomy,30,1,"“So it shall be when all of these things have come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have set before you, and you call them to mind in all nations where the LORD your God has banished you,"
Deuteronomy,30,2,"and you return to the LORD your God and obey Him with all your heart and soul according to all that I command you today, you and your sons,"
Deuteronomy,30,3,"then the LORD your God will restore you from captivity, and have compassion on you, and will gather you again from all the peoples where the LORD your God has scattered you."
Deuteronomy,30,4,"If your outcasts are at the ends of the earth, from there the LORD your God will gather you, and from there He will bring you back."
Deuteronomy,30,5,"The LORD your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers."
Deuteronomy,30,6,"“Moreover the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, to love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, so that you may live."
Deuteronomy,30,7,"The LORD your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, who persecuted you."
Deuteronomy,30,8,"And you shall again obey the LORD, and observe all His commandments which I command you today."
Deuteronomy,30,9,"Then the LORD your God will prosper you abundantly in all the work of your hand, in the offspring of your body and in the offspring of your cattle and in the produce of your ground, for the LORD will again rejoice over you for good, just as He rejoiced over your fathers;"
Deuteronomy,30,10,"if you obey the LORD your God to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this book of the law, if you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and soul."
Deuteronomy,30,11,"“For this commandment which I command you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it out of reach."
Deuteronomy,30,12,"It is not in heaven, that you should say, ‘Who will go up to heaven for us to get it for us and make us hear it, that we may observe it?’"
Deuteronomy,30,13,"Nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, ‘Who will cross the sea for us to get it for us and make us hear it, that we may observe it?’"
Deuteronomy,30,14,"But the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may observe it."
Deuteronomy,30,15,"“See, I have set before you today life and prosperity, and death and adversity;"
Deuteronomy,30,16,"in that I command you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments, that you may live and multiply, and that the LORD your God may bless you in the land where you are entering to possess it."
Deuteronomy,30,17,"But if your heart turns away and you will not obey, but are drawn away and worship other gods and serve them,"
Deuteronomy,30,18,I declare to you today that you shall surely perish. You will not prolong your days in the land where you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess it.
Deuteronomy,30,19,"I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. So choose life in order that you may live, you and your descendants,"
Deuteronomy,30,20,"by loving the LORD your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding fast to Him; for this is your life and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them.”"
Deuteronomy,31,1,So Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
Deuteronomy,31,2,"And he said to them, “I am a hundred and twenty years old today; I am no longer able to come and go, and the LORD has said to me, ‘You shall not cross this Jordan.’"
Deuteronomy,31,3,"It is the LORD your God who will cross ahead of you; He will destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua is the one who will cross ahead of you, just as the LORD has spoken."
Deuteronomy,31,4,"The LORD will do to them just as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when He destroyed them."
Deuteronomy,31,5,"The LORD will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandments which I have commanded you."
Deuteronomy,31,6,"Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you. He will not fail you or forsake you.”"
Deuteronomy,31,7,"Then Moses called to Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall give it to them as an inheritance."
Deuteronomy,31,8,The LORD is the one who goes ahead of you; He will be with you. He will not fail you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed.”
Deuteronomy,31,9,"So Moses wrote this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel."
Deuteronomy,31,10,"Then Moses commanded them, saying, “At the end of every seven years, at the time of the year of remission of debts, at the Feast of Booths,"
Deuteronomy,31,11,"when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God at the place which He will choose, you shall read this law in front of all Israel in their hearing."
Deuteronomy,31,12,"Assemble the people, the men and the women and children and the alien who is in your town, so that they may hear and learn and fear the LORD your God, and be careful to observe all the words of this law."
Deuteronomy,31,13,"Their children, who have not known, will hear and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as you live on the land which you are about to cross the Jordan to possess.”"
Deuteronomy,31,14,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, the time for you to die is near; call Joshua, and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, that I may commission him.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting."
Deuteronomy,31,15,"The LORD appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood at the doorway of the tent."
Deuteronomy,31,16,"The LORD said to Moses, “Behold, you are about to lie down with your fathers; and this people will arise and play the harlot with the strange gods of the land, into the midst of which they are going, and will forsake Me and break My covenant which I have made with them."
Deuteronomy,31,17,"Then My anger will be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them and hide My face from them, and they will be consumed, and many evils and troubles will come upon them; so that they will say in that day, ‘Is it not because our God is not among us that these evils have come upon us?’"
Deuteronomy,31,18,"But I will surely hide My face in that day because of all the evil which they will do, for they will turn to other gods."
Deuteronomy,31,19,"“Now therefore, write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the sons of Israel; put it on their lips, so that this song may be a witness for Me against the sons of Israel."
Deuteronomy,31,20,"For when I bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I swore to their fathers, and they have eaten and are satisfied and become prosperous, then they will turn to other gods and serve them, and spurn Me and break My covenant."
Deuteronomy,31,21,"Then it shall come about, when many evils and troubles have come upon them, that this song will testify before them as a witness (for it shall not be forgotten from the lips of their descendants); for I know their intent which they are developing today, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.”"
Deuteronomy,31,22,"So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the sons of Israel."
Deuteronomy,31,23,"Then He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring the sons of Israel into the land which I swore to them, and I will be with you.”"
Deuteronomy,31,24,"It came about, when Moses finished writing the words of this law in a book until they were complete,"
Deuteronomy,31,25,"that Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,"
Deuteronomy,31,26,"“Take this book of the law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may remain there as a witness against you."
Deuteronomy,31,27,"For I know your rebellion and your stubbornness; behold, while I am still alive with you today, you have been rebellious against the LORD; how much more, then, after my death?"
Deuteronomy,31,28,"Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I may speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the earth to witness against them."
Deuteronomy,31,29,"For I know that after my death you will act corruptly and turn from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days, for you will do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger with the work of your hands.”"
Deuteronomy,31,30,"Then Moses spoke in the hearing of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were complete:"
Deuteronomy,32,1,"“Give ear, O heavens, and let me speak; And let the earth hear the words of my mouth."
Deuteronomy,32,2,"“Let my teaching drop as the rain, My speech distill as the dew, As the droplets on the fresh grass And as the showers on the herb."
Deuteronomy,32,3,“For I proclaim the name of the LORD; Ascribe greatness to our God!
Deuteronomy,32,4,"“The Rock! His work is perfect, For all His ways are just; A God of faithfulness and without injustice, Righteous and upright is He."
Deuteronomy,32,5,"“They have acted corruptly toward Him, They are not His children, because of their defect; But are a perverse and crooked generation."
Deuteronomy,32,6,"“Do you thus repay the LORD, O foolish and unwise people? Is not He your Father who has bought you? He has made you and established you."
Deuteronomy,32,7,"“Remember the days of old, Consider the years of all generations. Ask your father, and he will inform you, Your elders, and they will tell you."
Deuteronomy,32,8,"“When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, When He separated the sons of man, He set the boundaries of the peoples According to the number of the sons of Israel."
Deuteronomy,32,9,“For the LORD’S portion is His people; Jacob is the allotment of His inheritance.
Deuteronomy,32,10,"“He found him in a desert land, And in the howling waste of a wilderness; He encircled him, He cared for him, He guarded him as the pupil of His eye."
Deuteronomy,32,11,"“Like an eagle that stirs up its nest, That hovers over its young, He spread His wings and caught them, He carried them on His pinions."
Deuteronomy,32,12,"“The LORD alone guided him, And there was no foreign god with him."
Deuteronomy,32,13,"“He made him ride on the high places of the earth, And he ate the produce of the field; And He made him suck honey from the rock, And oil from the flinty rock,"
Deuteronomy,32,14,"Curds of cows, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs, And rams, the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the finest of the wheat— And of the blood of grapes you drank wine."
Deuteronomy,32,15,"“But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked— You are grown fat, thick, and sleek— Then he forsook God who made him, And scorned the Rock of his salvation."
Deuteronomy,32,16,“They made Him jealous with strange gods; With abominations they provoked Him to anger.
Deuteronomy,32,17,"“They sacrificed to demons who were not God, To gods whom they have not known, New gods who came lately, Whom your fathers did not dread."

Deuteronomy,32,19,"“The LORD saw this, and spurned them Because of the provocation of His sons and daughters."
Deuteronomy,32,20,"“Then He said, ‘I will hide My face from them, I will see what their end shall be; For they are a perverse generation, Sons in whom is no faithfulness."
Deuteronomy,32,21,"‘They have made Me jealous with what is not God; They have provoked Me to anger with their idols. So I will make them jealous with those who are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation,"
Deuteronomy,32,22,"For a fire is kindled in My anger, And burns to the lowest part of Sheol, And consumes the earth with its yield, And sets on fire the foundations of the mountains."
Deuteronomy,32,23,‘I will heap misfortunes on them; I will use My arrows on them.
Deuteronomy,32,24,"‘They will be wasted by famine, and consumed by plague And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts I will send upon them, With the venom of crawling things of the dust."
Deuteronomy,32,25,"‘Outside the sword will bereave, And inside terror— Both young man and virgin, The nursling with the man of gray hair."
Deuteronomy,32,26,"‘I would have said, “I will cut them to pieces, I will remove the memory of them from men,”"
Deuteronomy,32,27,"Had I not feared the provocation by the enemy, That their adversaries would misjudge, That they would say, “Our hand is triumphant, And the LORD has not done all this.”’"
Deuteronomy,32,28,"“For they are a nation lacking in counsel, And there is no understanding in them."
Deuteronomy,32,29,"“Would that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would discern their future!"
Deuteronomy,32,30,"“How could one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Unless their Rock had sold them, And the LORD had given them up?"
Deuteronomy,32,31,"“Indeed their rock is not like our Rock, Even our enemies themselves judge this."
Deuteronomy,32,32,"“For their vine is from the vine of Sodom, And from the fields of Gomorrah; Their grapes are grapes of poison, Their clusters, bitter."
Deuteronomy,32,33,"“Their wine is the venom of serpents, And the deadly poison of cobras."
Deuteronomy,32,34,"‘Is it not laid up in store with Me, Sealed up in My treasuries?"
Deuteronomy,32,35,"‘Vengeance is Mine, and retribution, In due time their foot will slip; For the day of their calamity is near, And the impending things are hastening upon them.’"
Deuteronomy,32,36,"“For the LORD will vindicate His people, And will have compassion on His servants, When He sees that their strength is gone, And there is none remaining, bond or free."
Deuteronomy,32,37,"“And He will say, ‘Where are their gods, The rock in which they sought refuge?"
Deuteronomy,32,38,"‘Who ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you, Let them be your hiding place!"

Deuteronomy,32,40,"‘Indeed, I lift up My hand to heaven, And say, as I live forever,"
Deuteronomy,32,41,"If I sharpen My flashing sword, And My hand takes hold on justice, I will render vengeance on My adversaries, And I will repay those who hate Me."

Deuteronomy,32,43,"“Rejoice, O nations, with His people; For He will avenge the blood of His servants, And will render vengeance on His adversaries, And will atone for His land and His people.”"
Deuteronomy,32,44,"Then Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he, with Joshua the son of Nun."
Deuteronomy,32,45,"When Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel,"
Deuteronomy,32,46,"he said to them, “Take to your heart all the words with which I am warning you today, which you shall command your sons to observe carefully, even all the words of this law."
Deuteronomy,32,47,"For it is not an idle word for you; indeed it is your life. And by this word you will prolong your days in the land, which you are about to cross the Jordan to possess.”"
Deuteronomy,32,48,"The LORD spoke to Moses that very same day, saying,"
Deuteronomy,32,49,"“Go up to this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab opposite Jericho, and look at the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the sons of Israel for a possession."
Deuteronomy,32,50,"Then die on the mountain where you ascend, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people,"
Deuteronomy,32,51,"because you broke faith with Me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, because you did not treat Me as holy in the midst of the sons of Israel."
Deuteronomy,32,52,"For you shall see the land at a distance, but you shall not go there, into the land which I am giving the sons of Israel.”"
Deuteronomy,33,1,Now this is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death.
Deuteronomy,33,2,"He said, “The LORD came from Sinai, And dawned on them from Seir; He shone forth from Mount Paran, And He came from the midst of ten thousand holy ones; At His right hand there was flashing lightning for them."

Deuteronomy,33,8,"Of Levi he said, “Let Your Thummim and Your Urim belong to Your godly man, Whom You proved at Massah, With whom You contended at the waters of Meribah;"

Deuteronomy,33,10,"“They shall teach Your ordinances to Jacob, And Your law to Israel. They shall put incense before You, And whole burnt offerings on Your altar."

Deuteronomy,33,15,"“And with the best things of the ancient mountains, And with the choice things of the everlasting hills,"

Deuteronomy,33,17,"“As the firstborn of his ox, majesty is his, And his horns are the horns of the wild ox; With them he will push the peoples, All at once, to the ends of the earth. And those are the ten thousands of Ephraim, And those are the thousands of Manasseh.”"
Deuteronomy,33,18,"Of Zebulun he said, “Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going forth, And, Issachar, in your tents."

Deuteronomy,33,26,"“There is none like the God of Jeshurun, Who rides the heavens to your help, And through the skies in His majesty."
Deuteronomy,33,27,"“The eternal God is a dwelling place, And underneath are the everlasting arms; And He drove out the enemy from before you, And said, ‘Destroy!’"
Deuteronomy,33,28,"“So Israel dwells in security, The fountain of Jacob secluded, In a land of grain and new wine; His heavens also drop down dew."
Deuteronomy,33,29,"“Blessed are you, O Israel; Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD, Who is the shield of your help And the sword of your majesty! So your enemies will cringe before you, And you will tread upon their high places.”"
Deuteronomy,34,1,"Now Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land, Gilead as far as Dan,"
Deuteronomy,34,2,"and all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the western sea,"
Deuteronomy,34,3,"and the Negev and the plain in the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar."
Deuteronomy,34,4,"Then the LORD said to him, “This is the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants’; I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there.”"
Deuteronomy,34,5,"So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD."
Deuteronomy,34,6,"And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor; but no man knows his burial place to this day."
Deuteronomy,34,7,"Although Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died, his eye was not dim, nor his vigor abated."
Deuteronomy,34,8,So the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end.
Deuteronomy,34,9,"Now Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him; and the sons of Israel listened to him and did as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Deuteronomy,34,10,"Since that time no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,"
Deuteronomy,34,11,"for all the signs and wonders which the LORD sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh, all his servants, and all his land,"
Deuteronomy,34,12,and for all the mighty power and for all the great terror which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.
Joshua,1,1,"Now it came about after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ servant, saying,"
Joshua,1,2,"“Moses My servant is dead; now therefore arise, cross this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel."
Joshua,1,3,"Every place on which the sole of your foot treads, I have given it to you, just as I spoke to Moses."
Joshua,1,4,"From the wilderness and this Lebanon, even as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun will be your territory."
Joshua,1,5,"No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you; I will not fail you or forsake you."
Joshua,1,6,"Be strong and courageous, for you shall give this people possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give them."
Joshua,1,7,"Only be strong and very courageous; be careful to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may have success wherever you go."
Joshua,1,8,"This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success."
Joshua,1,9,"Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous! Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”"
Joshua,1,10,"Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,"
Joshua,1,11,"“Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are to cross this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you, to possess it.’”"
Joshua,1,12,"To the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,"
Joshua,1,13,"“Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, ‘The LORD your God gives you rest and will give you this land.’"
Joshua,1,14,"Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but you shall cross before your brothers in battle array, all your valiant warriors, and shall help them,"
Joshua,1,15,"until the LORD gives your brothers rest, as He gives you, and they also possess the land which the LORD your God is giving them. Then you shall return to your own land, and possess that which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.”"
Joshua,1,16,"They answered Joshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go."
Joshua,1,17,"Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you; only may the LORD your God be with you as He was with Moses."
Joshua,1,18,"Anyone who rebels against your command and does not obey your words in all that you command him, shall be put to death; only be strong and courageous.”"
Joshua,2,1,"Then Joshua the son of Nun sent two men as spies secretly from Shittim, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” So they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lodged there."
Joshua,2,2,"It was told the king of Jericho, saying, “Behold, men from the sons of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land.”"
Joshua,2,3,"And the king of Jericho sent word to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land.”"
Joshua,2,4,"But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them, and she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from."
Joshua,2,5,"It came about when it was time to shut the gate at dark, that the men went out; I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them.”"
Joshua,2,6,But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them in the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof.
Joshua,2,7,"So the men pursued them on the road to the Jordan to the fords; and as soon as those who were pursuing them had gone out, they shut the gate."
Joshua,2,8,"Now before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof,"
Joshua,2,9,"and said to the men, “I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that the terror of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted away before you."
Joshua,2,10,"For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed."
Joshua,2,11,"When we heard it, our hearts melted and no courage remained in any man any longer because of you; for the LORD your God, He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath."
Joshua,2,12,"Now therefore, please swear to me by the LORD, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my father’s household, and give me a pledge of truth,"
Joshua,2,13,"and spare my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters, with all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death.”"
Joshua,2,14,"So the men said to her, “Our life for yours if you do not tell this business of ours; and it shall come about when the LORD gives us the land that we will deal kindly and faithfully with you.”"
Joshua,2,15,"Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the city wall, so that she was living on the wall."
Joshua,2,16,"She said to them, “Go to the hill country, so that the pursuers will not happen upon you, and hide yourselves there for three days until the pursuers return. Then afterward you may go on your way.”"
Joshua,2,17,"The men said to her, “We shall be free from this oath to you which you have made us swear,"
Joshua,2,18,"unless, when we come into the land, you tie this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down, and gather to yourself into the house your father and your mother and your brothers and all your father’s household."
Joshua,2,19,"It shall come about that anyone who goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his own head, and we shall be free; but anyone who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head if a hand is laid on him."
Joshua,2,20,"But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be free from the oath which you have made us swear.”"
Joshua,2,21,"She said, “According to your words, so be it.” So she sent them away, and they departed; and she tied the scarlet cord in the window."
Joshua,2,22,"They departed and came to the hill country, and remained there for three days until the pursuers returned. Now the pursuers had sought them all along the road, but had not found them."
Joshua,2,23,"Then the two men returned and came down from the hill country and crossed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and they related to him all that had happened to them."
Joshua,2,24,"They said to Joshua, “Surely the LORD has given all the land into our hands; moreover, all the inhabitants of the land have melted away before us.”"
Joshua,3,1,"Then Joshua rose early in the morning; and he and all the sons of Israel set out from Shittim and came to the Jordan, and they lodged there before they crossed."
Joshua,3,2,At the end of three days the officers went through the midst of the camp;
Joshua,3,3,"and they commanded the people, saying, “When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God with the Levitical priests carrying it, then you shall set out from your place and go after it."
Joshua,3,4,"However, there shall be between you and it a distance of about 2,000 cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you shall go, for you have not passed this way before.”"
Joshua,3,5,"Then Joshua said to the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.”"
Joshua,3,6,"And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, “Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over ahead of the people.” So they took up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people."
Joshua,3,7,"Now the LORD said to Joshua, “This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you."
Joshua,3,8,"You shall, moreover, command the priests who are carrying the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’”"
Joshua,3,9,"Then Joshua said to the sons of Israel, “Come here, and hear the words of the LORD your God.”"
Joshua,3,10,"Joshua said, “By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that He will assuredly dispossess from before you the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivite, the Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Jebusite."
Joshua,3,11,"Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over ahead of you into the Jordan."
Joshua,3,12,"Now then, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe."
Joshua,3,13,"It shall come about when the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, and the waters which are flowing down from above will stand in one heap.”"
Joshua,3,14,"So when the people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan with the priests carrying the ark of the covenant before the people,"
Joshua,3,15,"and when those who carried the ark came into the Jordan, and the feet of the priests carrying the ark were dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the days of harvest),"
Joshua,3,16,"the waters which were flowing down from above stood and rose up in one heap, a great distance away at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those which were flowing down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. So the people crossed opposite Jericho."
Joshua,3,17,"And the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel crossed on dry ground, until all the nation had finished crossing the Jordan."
Joshua,4,1,"Now when all the nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,"
Joshua,4,2,"“Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe,"
Joshua,4,3,"and command them, saying, ‘Take up for yourselves twelve stones from here out of the middle of the Jordan, from the place where the priests’ feet are standing firm, and carry them over with you and lay them down in the lodging place where you will lodge tonight.’”"
Joshua,4,4,"So Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the sons of Israel, one man from each tribe;"
Joshua,4,5,"and Joshua said to them, “Cross again to the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel."
Joshua,4,6,"Let this be a sign among you, so that when your children ask later, saying, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’"
Joshua,4,7,"then you shall say to them, ‘Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.’ So these stones shall become a memorial to the sons of Israel forever.”"
Joshua,4,8,"Thus the sons of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, just as the LORD spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel; and they carried them over with them to the lodging place and put them down there."
Joshua,4,9,"Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan at the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant were standing, and they are there to this day."
Joshua,4,10,"For the priests who carried the ark were standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything was completed that the LORD had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hurried and crossed;"
Joshua,4,11,"and when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of the LORD and the priests crossed before the people."
Joshua,4,12,"The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over in battle array before the sons of Israel, just as Moses had spoken to them;"
Joshua,4,13,"about 40,000 equipped for war, crossed for battle before the LORD to the desert plains of Jericho."
Joshua,4,14,"On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; so that they revered him, just as they had revered Moses all the days of his life."
Joshua,4,15,"Now the LORD said to Joshua,"
Joshua,4,16,“Command the priests who carry the ark of the testimony that they come up from the Jordan.”
Joshua,4,17,"So Joshua commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Jordan.”"
Joshua,4,18,"It came about when the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come up from the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up to the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went over all its banks as before."
Joshua,4,19,Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth of the first month and camped at Gilgal on the eastern edge of Jericho.
Joshua,4,20,"Those twelve stones which they had taken from the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal."
Joshua,4,21,"He said to the sons of Israel, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What are these stones?’"
Joshua,4,22,"then you shall inform your children, saying, ‘Israel crossed this Jordan on dry ground.’"
Joshua,4,23,"For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed, just as the LORD your God had done to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed;"
Joshua,4,24,"that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is mighty, so that you may fear the LORD your God forever.”"
Joshua,5,1,"Now it came about when all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard how the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the sons of Israel until they had crossed, that their hearts melted, and there was no spirit in them any longer because of the sons of Israel."
Joshua,5,2,"At that time the LORD said to Joshua, “Make for yourself flint knives and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time.”"
Joshua,5,3,So Joshua made himself flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.
Joshua,5,4,"This is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness along the way after they came out of Egypt."
Joshua,5,5,"For all the people who came out were circumcised, but all the people who were born in the wilderness along the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised."
Joshua,5,6,"For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, that is, the men of war who came out of Egypt, perished because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD, to whom the LORD had sworn that He would not let them see the land which the LORD had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Joshua,5,7,"Their children whom He raised up in their place, Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them along the way."
Joshua,5,8,"Now when they had finished circumcising all the nation, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed."
Joshua,5,9,"Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” So the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day."
Joshua,5,10,While the sons of Israel camped at Gilgal they observed the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month on the desert plains of Jericho.
Joshua,5,11,"On the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain."
Joshua,5,12,"The manna ceased on the day after they had eaten some of the produce of the land, so that the sons of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate some of the yield of the land of Canaan during that year."
Joshua,5,13,"Now it came about when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand, and Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us or for our adversaries?”"
Joshua,5,14,"He said, “No; rather I indeed come now as captain of the host of the LORD.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed down, and said to him, “What has my lord to say to his servant?”"
Joshua,5,15,"The captain of the LORD’S host said to Joshua, “Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so."
Joshua,6,1,Now Jericho was tightly shut because of the sons of Israel; no one went out and no one came in.
Joshua,6,2,"The LORD said to Joshua, “See, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and the valiant warriors."
Joshua,6,3,"You shall march around the city, all the men of war circling the city once. You shall do so for six days."
Joshua,6,4,"Also seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark; then on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets."
Joshua,6,5,"It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people will go up every man straight ahead.”"
Joshua,6,6,"So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD.”"
Joshua,6,7,"Then he said to the people, “Go forward, and march around the city, and let the armed men go on before the ark of the LORD.”"
Joshua,6,8,"And it was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the LORD went forward and blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them."
Joshua,6,9,"The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while they continued to blow the trumpets."
Joshua,6,10,"But Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout nor let your voice be heard nor let a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you, ‘Shout!’ Then you shall shout!”"
Joshua,6,11,"So he had the ark of the LORD taken around the city, circling it once; then they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp."
Joshua,6,12,"Now Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD."
Joshua,6,13,"The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew the trumpets; and the armed men went before them and the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, while they continued to blow the trumpets."
Joshua,6,14,Thus the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp; they did so for six days.
Joshua,6,15,Then on the seventh day they rose early at the dawning of the day and marched around the city in the same manner seven times; only on that day they marched around the city seven times.
Joshua,6,16,"At the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout! For the LORD has given you the city."
Joshua,6,17,"The city shall be under the ban, it and all that is in it belongs to the LORD; only Rahab the harlot and all who are with her in the house shall live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent."
Joshua,6,18,"But as for you, only keep yourselves from the things under the ban, so that you do not covet them and take some of the things under the ban, and make the camp of Israel accursed and bring trouble on it."
Joshua,6,19,But all the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron are holy to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD.”
Joshua,6,20,"So the people shouted, and priests blew the trumpets; and when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted with a great shout and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight ahead, and they took the city."
Joshua,6,21,"They utterly destroyed everything in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword."
Joshua,6,22,"Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the harlot’s house and bring the woman and all she has out of there, as you have sworn to her.”"
Joshua,6,23,So the young men who were spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brothers and all she had; they also brought out all her relatives and placed them outside the camp of Israel.
Joshua,6,24,"They burned the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver and gold, and articles of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD."
Joshua,6,25,"However, Rahab the harlot and her father’s household and all she had, Joshua spared; and she has lived in the midst of Israel to this day, for she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho."
Joshua,6,26,"Then Joshua made them take an oath at that time, saying, “Cursed before the LORD is the man who rises up and builds this city Jericho; with the loss of his firstborn he shall lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son he shall set up its gates.”"
Joshua,6,27,"So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land."
Joshua,7,1,"But the sons of Israel acted unfaithfully in regard to the things under the ban, for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took some of the things under the ban, therefore the anger of the LORD burned against the sons of Israel."
Joshua,7,2,"Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, “Go up and spy out the land.” So the men went up and spied out Ai."
Joshua,7,3,"They returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not let all the people go up; only about two or three thousand men need go up to Ai; do not make all the people toil up there, for they are few.”"
Joshua,7,4,"So about three thousand men from the people went up there, but they fled from the men of Ai."
Joshua,7,5,"The men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of their men, and pursued them from the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them down on the descent, so the hearts of the people melted and became as water."
Joshua,7,6,"Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, both he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads."
Joshua,7,7,"Joshua said, “Alas, O Lord GOD, why did You ever bring this people over the Jordan, only to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? If only we had been willing to dwell beyond the Jordan!"
Joshua,7,8,"O Lord, what can I say since Israel has turned their back before their enemies?"
Joshua,7,9,"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will You do for Your great name?”"
Joshua,7,10,"So the LORD said to Joshua, “Rise up! Why is it that you have fallen on your face?"
Joshua,7,11,"Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. And they have even taken some of the things under the ban and have both stolen and deceived. Moreover, they have also put them among their own things."
Joshua,7,12,"Therefore the sons of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, for they have become accursed. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy the things under the ban from your midst."
Joshua,7,13,"Rise up! Consecrate the people and say, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for thus the LORD, the God of Israel, has said, “There are things under the ban in your midst, O Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you have removed the things under the ban from your midst.”"
Joshua,7,14,"In the morning then you shall come near by your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which the LORD takes by lot shall come near by families, and the family which the LORD takes shall come near by households, and the household which the LORD takes shall come near man by man."
Joshua,7,15,"It shall be that the one who is taken with the things under the ban shall be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has committed a disgraceful thing in Israel.’”"
Joshua,7,16,"So Joshua arose early in the morning and brought Israel near by tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken."
Joshua,7,17,"He brought the family of Judah near, and he took the family of the Zerahites; and he brought the family of the Zerahites near man by man, and Zabdi was taken."
Joshua,7,18,"He brought his household near man by man; and Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was taken."
Joshua,7,19,"Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, I implore you, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and give praise to Him; and tell me now what you have done. Do not hide it from me.”"
Joshua,7,20,"So Achan answered Joshua and said, “Truly, I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel, and this is what I did:"
Joshua,7,21,"when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar and two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold fifty shekels in weight, then I coveted them and took them; and behold, they are concealed in the earth inside my tent with the silver underneath it.”"
Joshua,7,22,"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was concealed in his tent with the silver underneath it."
Joshua,7,23,"They took them from inside the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the sons of Israel, and they poured them out before the LORD."
Joshua,7,24,"Then Joshua and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the mantle, the bar of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent and all that belonged to him; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor."
Joshua,7,25,"Joshua said, “Why have you troubled us? The LORD will trouble you this day.” And all Israel stoned them with stones; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones."
Joshua,7,26,"They raised over him a great heap of stones that stands to this day, and the LORD turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the valley of Achor to this day."
Joshua,8,1,"Now the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not fear or be dismayed. Take all the people of war with you and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land."
Joshua,8,2,You shall do to Ai and its king just as you did to Jericho and its king; you shall take only its spoil and its cattle as plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it.”
Joshua,8,3,"So Joshua rose with all the people of war to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose 30,000 men, valiant warriors, and sent them out at night."
Joshua,8,4,"He commanded them, saying, “See, you are going to ambush the city from behind it. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready."
Joshua,8,5,"Then I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they come out to meet us as at the first, we will flee before them."
Joshua,8,6,"They will come out after us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, ‘They are fleeing before us as at the first.’ So we will flee before them."
Joshua,8,7,"And you shall rise from your ambush and take possession of the city, for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand."
Joshua,8,8,"Then it will be when you have seized the city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do it according to the word of the LORD. See, I have commanded you.”"
Joshua,8,9,"So Joshua sent them away, and they went to the place of ambush and remained between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua spent that night among the people."
Joshua,8,10,"Now Joshua rose early in the morning and mustered the people, and he went up with the elders of Israel before the people to Ai."
Joshua,8,11,"Then all the people of war who were with him went up and drew near and arrived in front of the city, and camped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and Ai."
Joshua,8,12,"And he took about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city."
Joshua,8,13,"So they stationed the people, all the army that was on the north side of the city, and its rear guard on the west side of the city, and Joshua spent that night in the midst of the valley."
Joshua,8,14,"It came about when the king of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hurried and rose up early and went out to meet Israel in battle, he and all his people at the appointed place before the desert plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city."
Joshua,8,15,"Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness."
Joshua,8,16,"And all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city."
Joshua,8,17,"So not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel, and they left the city unguarded and pursued Israel."
Joshua,8,18,"Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.” So Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city."
Joshua,8,19,"The men in ambush rose quickly from their place, and when he had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and captured it, and they quickly set the city on fire."
Joshua,8,20,"When the men of Ai turned back and looked, behold, the smoke of the city ascended to the sky, and they had no place to flee this way or that, for the people who had been fleeing to the wilderness turned against the pursuers."
Joshua,8,21,"When Joshua and all Israel saw that the men in ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, they turned back and slew the men of Ai."
Joshua,8,22,"The others came out from the city to encounter them, so that they were trapped in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side; and they slew them until no one was left of those who survived or escaped."
Joshua,8,23,But they took alive the king of Ai and brought him to Joshua.
Joshua,8,24,"Now when Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them were fallen by the edge of the sword until they were destroyed, then all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword."
Joshua,8,25,"All who fell that day, both men and women, were 12,000—all the people of Ai."
Joshua,8,26,For Joshua did not withdraw his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
Joshua,8,27,"Israel took only the cattle and the spoil of that city as plunder for themselves, according to the word of the LORD which He had commanded Joshua."
Joshua,8,28,"So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap forever, a desolation until this day."
Joshua,8,29,"He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening; and at sunset Joshua gave command and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the city gate, and raised over it a great heap of stones that stands to this day."
Joshua,8,30,"Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,"
Joshua,8,31,"just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones on which no man had wielded an iron tool; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings."
Joshua,8,32,"He wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written, in the presence of the sons of Israel."
Joshua,8,33,"All Israel with their elders and officers and their judges were standing on both sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, the stranger as well as the native. Half of them stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had given command at first to bless the people of Israel."
Joshua,8,34,"Then afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law."
Joshua,8,35,There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel with the women and the little ones and the strangers who were living among them.
Joshua,9,1,"Now it came about when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country and in the lowland and on all the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, heard of it,"
Joshua,9,2,that they gathered themselves together with one accord to fight with Joshua and with Israel.
Joshua,9,3,"When the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,"
Joshua,9,4,"they also acted craftily and set out as envoys, and took worn-out sacks on their donkeys, and wineskins worn-out and torn and mended,"
Joshua,9,5,"and worn-out and patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry and had become crumbled."
Joshua,9,6,"They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country; now therefore, make a covenant with us.”"
Joshua,9,7,"The men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you are living within our land; how then shall we make a covenant with you?”"
Joshua,9,8,"But they said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” Then Joshua said to them, “Who are you and where do you come from?”"
Joshua,9,9,"They said to him, “Your servants have come from a very far country because of the fame of the LORD your God; for we have heard the report of Him and all that He did in Egypt,"
Joshua,9,10,"and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan who was at Ashtaroth."
Joshua,9,11,"So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, ‘Take provisions in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them and say to them, “We are your servants; now then, make a covenant with us.”’"
Joshua,9,12,"This our bread was warm when we took it for our provisions out of our houses on the day that we left to come to you; but now behold, it is dry and has become crumbled."
Joshua,9,13,"These wineskins which we filled were new, and behold, they are torn; and these our clothes and our sandals are worn out because of the very long journey.”"
Joshua,9,14,"So the men of Israel took some of their provisions, and did not ask for the counsel of the LORD."
Joshua,9,15,"Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them, to let them live; and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them."
Joshua,9,16,"It came about at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were neighbors and that they were living within their land."
Joshua,9,17,Then the sons of Israel set out and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon and Chephirah and Beeroth and Kiriath-jearim.
Joshua,9,18,The sons of Israel did not strike them because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD the God of Israel. And the whole congregation grumbled against the leaders.
Joshua,9,19,"But all the leaders said to the whole congregation, “We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we cannot touch them."
Joshua,9,20,"This we will do to them, even let them live, so that wrath will not be upon us for the oath which we swore to them.”"
Joshua,9,21,"The leaders said to them, “Let them live.” So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the whole congregation, just as the leaders had spoken to them."
Joshua,9,22,"Then Joshua called for them and spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ when you are living within our land?"
Joshua,9,23,"Now therefore, you are cursed, and you shall never cease being slaves, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.”"
Joshua,9,24,"So they answered Joshua and said, “Because it was certainly told your servants that the LORD your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you; therefore we feared greatly for our lives because of you, and have done this thing."
Joshua,9,25,"Now behold, we are in your hands; do as it seems good and right in your sight to do to us.”"
Joshua,9,26,"Thus he did to them, and delivered them from the hands of the sons of Israel, and they did not kill them."
Joshua,9,27,"But Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, to this day, in the place which He would choose."
Joshua,10,1,"Now it came about when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai, and had utterly destroyed it (just as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king), and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were within their land,"
Joshua,10,2,"that he feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty."
Joshua,10,3,"Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king of Hebron and to Piram king of Jarmuth and to Japhia king of Lachish and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,"
Joshua,10,4,"“Come up to me and help me, and let us attack Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel.”"
Joshua,10,5,"So the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they with all their armies, and camped by Gibeon and fought against it."
Joshua,10,6,"Then the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Do not abandon your servants; come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites that live in the hill country have assembled against us.”"
Joshua,10,7,"So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him and all the valiant warriors."
Joshua,10,8,"The LORD said to Joshua, “Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands; not one of them shall stand before you.”"
Joshua,10,9,So Joshua came upon them suddenly by marching all night from Gilgal.
Joshua,10,10,"And the LORD confounded them before Israel, and He slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and pursued them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah."
Joshua,10,11,"As they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, the LORD threw large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died; there were more who died from the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel killed with the sword."
Joshua,10,12,"Then Joshua spoke to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, “O sun, stand still at Gibeon, And O moon in the valley of Aijalon.”"
Joshua,10,13,"So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, Until the nation avenged themselves of their enemies. Is it not written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stopped in the middle of the sky and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day."
Joshua,10,14,"There was no day like that before it or after it, when the LORD listened to the voice of a man; for the LORD fought for Israel."
Joshua,10,15,Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp to Gilgal.
Joshua,10,16,Now these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua,10,17,"It was told Joshua, saying, “The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”"
Joshua,10,18,"Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and assign men by it to guard them,"
Joshua,10,19,"but do not stay there yourselves; pursue your enemies and attack them in the rear. Do not allow them to enter their cities, for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand.”"
Joshua,10,20,"It came about when Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished slaying them with a very great slaughter, until they were destroyed, and the survivors who remained of them had entered the fortified cities,"
Joshua,10,21,that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. No one uttered a word against any of the sons of Israel.
Joshua,10,22,"Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring these five kings out to me from the cave.”"
Joshua,10,23,"They did so, and brought these five kings out to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon."
Joshua,10,24,"When they brought these kings out to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came near and put their feet on their necks."
Joshua,10,25,"Joshua then said to them, “Do not fear or be dismayed! Be strong and courageous, for thus the LORD will do to all your enemies with whom you fight.”"
Joshua,10,26,"So afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death, and he hanged them on five trees; and they hung on the trees until evening."
Joshua,10,27,"It came about at sunset that Joshua gave a command, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and put large stones over the mouth of the cave, to this very day."
Joshua,10,28,"Now Joshua captured Makkedah on that day, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword; he utterly destroyed it and every person who was in it. He left no survivor. Thus he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho."
Joshua,10,29,"Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to Libnah, and fought against Libnah."
Joshua,10,30,"The LORD gave it also with its king into the hands of Israel, and he struck it and every person who was in it with the edge of the sword. He left no survivor in it. Thus he did to its king just as he had done to the king of Jericho."
Joshua,10,31,"And Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to Lachish, and they camped by it and fought against it."
Joshua,10,32,"The LORD gave Lachish into the hands of Israel; and he captured it on the second day, and struck it and every person who was in it with the edge of the sword, according to all that he had done to Libnah."
Joshua,10,33,"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish, and Joshua defeated him and his people until he had left him no survivor."
Joshua,10,34,"And Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon, and they camped by it and fought against it."
Joshua,10,35,"They captured it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; and he utterly destroyed that day every person who was in it, according to all that he had done to Lachish."
Joshua,10,36,"Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron, and they fought against it."
Joshua,10,37,"They captured it and struck it and its king and all its cities and all the persons who were in it with the edge of the sword. He left no survivor, according to all that he had done to Eglon. And he utterly destroyed it and every person who was in it."
Joshua,10,38,"Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to Debir, and they fought against it."
Joshua,10,39,"He captured it and its king and all its cities, and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed every person who was in it. He left no survivor. Just as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, as he had also done to Libnah and its king."
Joshua,10,40,"Thus Joshua struck all the land, the hill country and the Negev and the lowland and the slopes and all their kings. He left no survivor, but he utterly destroyed all who breathed, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded."
Joshua,10,41,"Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea even as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen even as far as Gibeon."
Joshua,10,42,"Joshua captured all these kings and their lands at one time, because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel."
Joshua,10,43,So Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.
Joshua,11,1,"Then it came about, when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon and to the king of Shimron and to the king of Achshaph,"
Joshua,11,2,"and to the kings who were of the north in the hill country, and in the Arabah—south of Chinneroth and in the lowland and on the heights of Dor on the west—"
Joshua,11,3,"to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpeh."
Joshua,11,4,"They came out, they and all their armies with them, as many people as the sand that is on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots."
Joshua,11,5,"So all of these kings having agreed to meet, came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel."
Joshua,11,6,"Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid because of them, for tomorrow at this time I will deliver all of them slain before Israel; you shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.”"
Joshua,11,7,"So Joshua and all the people of war with him came upon them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and attacked them."
Joshua,11,8,"The LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, so that they defeated them, and pursued them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and the valley of Mizpeh to the east; and they struck them until no survivor was left to them."
Joshua,11,9,Joshua did to them as the LORD had told him; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
Joshua,11,10,"Then Joshua turned back at that time, and captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor formerly was the head of all these kingdoms."
Joshua,11,11,"They struck every person who was in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was no one left who breathed. And he burned Hazor with fire."
Joshua,11,12,"Joshua captured all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded."
Joshua,11,13,"However, Israel did not burn any cities that stood on their mounds, except Hazor alone, which Joshua burned."
Joshua,11,14,"All the spoil of these cities and the cattle, the sons of Israel took as their plunder; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They left no one who breathed."
Joshua,11,15,"Just as the LORD had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses."
Joshua,11,16,"Thus Joshua took all that land: the hill country and all the Negev, all that land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel and its lowland"
Joshua,11,17,"from Mount Halak, that rises toward Seir, even as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. And he captured all their kings and struck them down and put them to death."
Joshua,11,18,Joshua waged war a long time with all these kings.
Joshua,11,19,There was not a city which made peace with the sons of Israel except the Hivites living in Gibeon; they took them all in battle.
Joshua,11,20,"For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, to meet Israel in battle in order that he might utterly destroy them, that they might receive no mercy, but that he might destroy them, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Joshua,11,21,"Then Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab and from all the hill country of Judah and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities."
Joshua,11,22,"There were no Anakim left in the land of the sons of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod some remained."
Joshua,11,23,"So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD had spoken to Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. Thus the land had rest from war."
Joshua,12,1,"Now these are the kings of the land whom the sons of Israel defeated, and whose land they possessed beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon as far as Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah to the east:"
Joshua,12,2,"Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, both the middle of the valley and half of Gilead, even as far as the brook Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon;"
Joshua,12,3,"and the Arabah as far as the Sea of Chinneroth toward the east, and as far as the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward toward Beth-jeshimoth, and on the south, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah;"
Joshua,12,4,"and the territory of Og king of Bashan, one of the remnant of Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,"
Joshua,12,5,"and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and all Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half of Gilead, as far as the border of Sihon king of Heshbon."
Joshua,12,6,Moses the servant of the LORD and the sons of Israel defeated them; and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh as a possession.
Joshua,12,7,"Now these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the sons of Israel defeated beyond the Jordan toward the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even as far as Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir; and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their divisions,"
Joshua,12,8,"in the hill country, in the lowland, in the Arabah, on the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the Negev; the Hittite, the Amorite and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite:"
Joshua,12,9,"the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;"
Joshua,12,10,"the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;"
Joshua,12,11,"the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;"
Joshua,12,12,"the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;"
Joshua,12,13,"the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;"
Joshua,12,14,"the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;"
Joshua,12,15,"the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;"
Joshua,12,16,"the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;"
Joshua,12,17,"the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;"
Joshua,12,18,"the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;"
Joshua,12,19,"the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;"
Joshua,12,20,"the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;"
Joshua,12,21,"the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;"
Joshua,12,22,"the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;"
Joshua,12,23,"the king of Dor in the heights of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;"
Joshua,12,24,"the king of Tirzah, one: in all, thirty-one kings."
Joshua,13,1,"Now Joshua was old and advanced in years when the LORD said to him, “You are old and advanced in years, and very much of the land remains to be possessed."
Joshua,13,2,This is the land that remains: all the regions of the Philistines and all those of the Geshurites;
Joshua,13,3,"from the Shihor which is east of Egypt, even as far as the border of Ekron to the north (it is counted as Canaanite); the five lords of the Philistines: the Gazite, the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, the Ekronite; and the Avvite"
Joshua,13,4,"to the south, all the land of the Canaanite, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorite;"
Joshua,13,5,"and the land of the Gebalite, and all of Lebanon, toward the east, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon as far as Lebo-hamath."
Joshua,13,6,"All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon as far as Misrephoth-maim, all the Sidonians, I will drive them out from before the sons of Israel; only allot it to Israel for an inheritance as I have commanded you."
Joshua,13,7,"Now therefore, apportion this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”"
Joshua,13,8,"With the other half-tribe, the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan to the east, just as Moses the servant of the LORD gave to them;"
Joshua,13,9,"from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba, as far as Dibon;"
Joshua,13,10,"and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the sons of Ammon;"
Joshua,13,11,"and Gilead, and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah;"
Joshua,13,12,"all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (he alone was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for Moses struck them and dispossessed them."
Joshua,13,13,But the sons of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites or the Maacathites; for Geshur and Maacath live among Israel until this day.
Joshua,13,14,"Only to the tribe of Levi he did not give an inheritance; the offerings by fire to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as He spoke to him."
Joshua,13,15,So Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families.
Joshua,13,16,"Their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley and all the plain by Medeba;"
Joshua,13,17,"Heshbon, and all its cities which are on the plain: Dibon and Bamoth-baal and Beth-baal-meon,"
Joshua,13,18,"and Jahaz and Kedemoth and Mephaath,"
Joshua,13,19,"and Kiriathaim and Sibmah and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley,"
Joshua,13,20,"and Beth-peor and the slopes of Pisgah and Beth-jeshimoth,"
Joshua,13,21,"even all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck with the chiefs of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land."
Joshua,13,22,"The sons of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor, the diviner, with the sword among the rest of their slain."
Joshua,13,23,"The border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, the cities and their villages."
Joshua,13,24,"Moses also gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad, according to their families."
Joshua,13,25,"Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, as far as Aroer which is before Rabbah;"
Joshua,13,26,"and from Heshbon as far as Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim as far as the border of Debir;"
Joshua,13,27,"and in the valley, Beth-haram and Beth-nimrah and Succoth and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as a border, as far as the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan to the east."
Joshua,13,28,"This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, the cities and their villages."
Joshua,13,29,Moses also gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh; and it was for the half-tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their families.
Joshua,13,30,"Their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities;"
Joshua,13,31,"also half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh, for half of the sons of Machir according to their families."
Joshua,13,32,"These are the territories which Moses apportioned for an inheritance in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho to the east."
Joshua,13,33,"But to the tribe of Levi, Moses did not give an inheritance; the LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as He had promised to them."
Joshua,14,1,"Now these are the territories which the sons of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel apportioned to them for an inheritance,"
Joshua,14,2,"by the lot of their inheritance, as the LORD commanded through Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe."
Joshua,14,3,For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but he did not give an inheritance to the Levites among them.
Joshua,14,4,"For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and they did not give a portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to live in, with their pasture lands for their livestock and for their property."
Joshua,14,5,"Thus the sons of Israel did just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they divided the land."
Joshua,14,6,"Then the sons of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know the word which the LORD spoke to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh-barnea."
Joshua,14,7,"I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought word back to him as it was in my heart."
Joshua,14,8,Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt with fear; but I followed the LORD my God fully.
Joshua,14,9,"So Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land on which your foot has trodden will be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have followed the LORD my God fully.’"
Joshua,14,10,"Now behold, the LORD has let me live, just as He spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses, when Israel walked in the wilderness; and now behold, I am eighty-five years old today."
Joshua,14,11,"I am still as strong today as I was in the day Moses sent me; as my strength was then, so my strength is now, for war and for going out and coming in."
Joshua,14,12,"Now then, give me this hill country about which the LORD spoke on that day, for you heard on that day that Anakim were there, with great fortified cities; perhaps the LORD will be with me, and I will drive them out as the LORD has spoken.”"
Joshua,14,13,So Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
Joshua,14,14,"Therefore, Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite until this day, because he followed the LORD God of Israel fully."
Joshua,14,15,Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba; for Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim. Then the land had rest from war.
Joshua,15,1,"Now the lot for the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families reached the border of Edom, southward to the wilderness of Zin at the extreme south."
Joshua,15,2,"Their south border was from the lower end of the Salt Sea, from the bay that turns to the south."
Joshua,15,3,"Then it proceeded southward to the ascent of Akrabbim and continued to Zin, then went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea and continued to Hezron, and went up to Addar and turned about to Karka."
Joshua,15,4,"It continued to Azmon and proceeded to the brook of Egypt, and the border ended at the sea. This shall be your south border."
Joshua,15,5,"The east border was the Salt Sea, as far as the mouth of the Jordan. And the border of the north side was from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan."
Joshua,15,6,"Then the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and continued on the north of Beth-arabah, and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben."
Joshua,15,7,"The border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and turned northward toward Gilgal which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south of the valley; and the border continued to the waters of En-shemesh and it ended at En-rogel."
Joshua,15,8,"Then the border went up the valley of Ben-hinnom to the slope of the Jebusite on the south (that is, Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain which is before the valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the end of the valley of Rephaim toward the north."
Joshua,15,9,"From the top of the mountain the border curved to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah and proceeded to the cities of Mount Ephron, then the border curved to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim)."
Joshua,15,10,"The border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir, and continued to the slope of Mount Jearim on the north (that is, Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh and continued through Timnah."
Joshua,15,11,"The border proceeded to the side of Ekron northward. Then the border curved to Shikkeron and continued to Mount Baalah and proceeded to Jabneel, and the border ended at the sea."
Joshua,15,12,"The west border was at the Great Sea, even its coastline. This is the border around the sons of Judah according to their families."
Joshua,15,13,"Now he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the sons of Judah, according to the command of the LORD to Joshua, namely, Kiriath-arba, Arba being the father of Anak (that is, Hebron)."
Joshua,15,14,"Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the children of Anak."
Joshua,15,15,Then he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir; now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher.
Joshua,15,16,"And Caleb said, “The one who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter as a wife.”"
Joshua,15,17,"Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it; so he gave him Achsah his daughter as a wife."
Joshua,15,18,"It came about that when she came to him, she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. So she alighted from the donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you want?”"
Joshua,15,19,"Then she said, “Give me a blessing; since you have given me the land of the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs."
Joshua,15,20,This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families.
Joshua,15,21,"Now the cities at the extremity of the tribe of the sons of Judah toward the border of Edom in the south were Kabzeel and Eder and Jagur,"
Joshua,15,22,"and Kinah and Dimonah and Adadah,"
Joshua,15,23,"and Kedesh and Hazor and Ithnan,"
Joshua,15,24,"Ziph and Telem and Bealoth,"
Joshua,15,25,"and Hazor-hadattah and Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor),"
Joshua,15,26,"Amam and Shema and Moladah,"
Joshua,15,27,"and Hazar-gaddah and Heshmon and Beth-pelet,"
Joshua,15,28,"and Hazar-shual and Beersheba and Biziothiah,"
Joshua,15,29,"Baalah and Iim and Ezem,"
Joshua,15,30,"and Eltolad and Chesil and Hormah,"
Joshua,15,31,"and Ziklag and Madmannah and Sansannah,"
Joshua,15,32,"and Lebaoth and Shilhim and Ain and Rimmon; in all, twenty-nine cities with their villages."
Joshua,15,33,"In the lowland: Eshtaol and Zorah and Ashnah,"
Joshua,15,34,"and Zanoah and En-gannim, Tappuah and Enam,"

Joshua,15,63,"Now as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the sons of Judah could not drive them out; so the Jebusites live with the sons of Judah at Jerusalem until this day."
Joshua,16,1,"Then the lot for the sons of Joseph went from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho on the east into the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill country to Bethel."
Joshua,16,2,"It went from Bethel to Luz, and continued to the border of the Archites at Ataroth."
Joshua,16,3,"It went down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the territory of lower Beth-horon even to Gezer, and it ended at the sea."
Joshua,16,4,"The sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance."
Joshua,16,5,"Now this was the territory of the sons of Ephraim according to their families: the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth-addar, as far as upper Beth-horon."
Joshua,16,6,"Then the border went westward at Michmethath on the north, and the border turned about eastward to Taanath-shiloh and continued beyond it to the east of Janoah."
Joshua,16,7,"It went down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, then reached Jericho and came out at the Jordan."
Joshua,16,8,"From Tappuah the border continued westward to the brook of Kanah, and it ended at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim according to their families,"
Joshua,16,9,"together with the cities which were set apart for the sons of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages."
Joshua,16,10,"But they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites live in the midst of Ephraim to this day, and they became forced laborers."
Joshua,17,1,"Now this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war."
Joshua,17,2,So the lot was made for the rest of the sons of Manasseh according to their families: for the sons of Abiezer and for the sons of Helek and for the sons of Asriel and for the sons of Shechem and for the sons of Hepher and for the sons of Shemida; these were the male descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.
Joshua,17,3,"However, Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah."
Joshua,17,4,"They came near before Eleazar the priest and before Joshua the son of Nun and before the leaders, saying, “The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” So according to the command of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among their father’s brothers."
Joshua,17,5,"Thus there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan,"
Joshua,17,6,because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
Joshua,17,7,The border of Manasseh ran from Asher to Michmethath which was east of Shechem; then the border went southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
Joshua,17,8,"The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the sons of Ephraim."
Joshua,17,9,"The border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook (these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh), and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook and it ended at the sea."
Joshua,17,10,"The south side belonged to Ephraim and the north side to Manasseh, and the sea was their border; and they reached to Asher on the north and to Issachar on the east."
Joshua,17,11,"In Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean and its towns and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, the third is Napheth."
Joshua,17,12,"But the sons of Manasseh could not take possession of these cities, because the Canaanites persisted in living in that land."
Joshua,17,13,"It came about when the sons of Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely."
Joshua,17,14,"Then the sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, “Why have you given me only one lot and one portion for an inheritance, since I am a numerous people whom the LORD has thus far blessed?”"
Joshua,17,15,"Joshua said to them, “If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest and clear a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.”"
Joshua,17,16,"The sons of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who live in the valley land have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth-shean and its towns and those who are in the valley of Jezreel.”"
Joshua,17,17,"Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, saying, “You are a numerous people and have great power; you shall not have one lot only,"
Joshua,17,18,"but the hill country shall be yours. For though it is a forest, you shall clear it, and to its farthest borders it shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, even though they have chariots of iron and though they are strong.”"
Joshua,18,1,"Then the whole congregation of the sons of Israel assembled themselves at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there; and the land was subdued before them."
Joshua,18,2,There remained among the sons of Israel seven tribes who had not divided their inheritance.
Joshua,18,3,"So Joshua said to the sons of Israel, “How long will you put off entering to take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you?"
Joshua,18,4,"Provide for yourselves three men from each tribe that I may send them, and that they may arise and walk through the land and write a description of it according to their inheritance; then they shall return to me."
Joshua,18,5,"They shall divide it into seven portions; Judah shall stay in its territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall stay in their territory on the north."
Joshua,18,6,"You shall describe the land in seven divisions, and bring the description here to me. I will cast lots for you here before the LORD our God."
Joshua,18,7,"For the Levites have no portion among you, because the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance. Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh also have received their inheritance eastward beyond the Jordan, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.”"
Joshua,18,8,"Then the men arose and went, and Joshua commanded those who went to describe the land, saying, “Go and walk through the land and describe it, and return to me; then I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh.”"
Joshua,18,9,"So the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities in seven divisions in a book; and they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh."
Joshua,18,10,"And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD, and there Joshua divided the land to the sons of Israel according to their divisions."
Joshua,18,11,"Now the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot lay between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph."
Joshua,18,12,"Their border on the north side was from the Jordan, then the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill country westward, and it ended at the wilderness of Beth-aven."
Joshua,18,13,"From there the border continued to Luz, to the side of Luz (that is, Bethel) southward; and the border went down to Ataroth-addar, near the hill which lies on the south of lower Beth-horon."
Joshua,18,14,"The border extended from there and turned round on the west side southward, from the hill which lies before Beth-horon southward; and it ended at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of the sons of Judah. This was the west side."
Joshua,18,15,"Then the south side was from the edge of Kiriath-jearim, and the border went westward and went to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah."
Joshua,18,16,"The border went down to the edge of the hill which is in the valley of Ben-hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the slope of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel."
Joshua,18,17,"It extended northward and went to En-shemesh and went to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben."
Joshua,18,18,It continued to the side in front of the Arabah northward and went down to the Arabah.
Joshua,18,19,"The border continued to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the south border."
Joshua,18,20,"Moreover, the Jordan was its border on the east side. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, according to their families and according to its borders all around."
Joshua,18,21,"Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho and Beth-hoglah and Emek-keziz,"
Joshua,18,22,"and Beth-arabah and Zemaraim and Bethel,"
Joshua,18,23,"and Avvim and Parah and Ophrah,"

Joshua,18,27,"and Rekem and Irpeel and Taralah,"
Joshua,18,28,"and Zelah, Haeleph and the Jebusite (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin according to their families."
Joshua,19,1,"Then the second lot fell to Simeon, to the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families, and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Judah."
Joshua,19,2,"So they had as their inheritance Beersheba or Sheba and Moladah,"
Joshua,19,3,"and Hazar-shual and Balah and Ezem,"
Joshua,19,4,"and Eltolad and Bethul and Hormah,"
Joshua,19,5,"and Ziklag and Beth-marcaboth and Hazar-susah,"
Joshua,19,6,and Beth-lebaoth and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages;
Joshua,19,7,"Ain, Rimmon and Ether and Ashan; four cities with their villages;"
Joshua,19,8,"and all the villages which were around these cities as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah of the Negev. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families."
Joshua,19,9,"The inheritance of the sons of Simeon was taken from the portion of the sons of Judah, for the share of the sons of Judah was too large for them; so the sons of Simeon received an inheritance in the midst of Judah’s inheritance."
Joshua,19,10,Now the third lot came up for the sons of Zebulun according to their families. And the territory of their inheritance was as far as Sarid.
Joshua,19,11,"Then their border went up to the west and to Maralah, it then touched Dabbesheth and reached to the brook that is before Jokneam."
Joshua,19,12,"Then it turned from Sarid to the east toward the sunrise as far as the border of Chisloth-tabor, and it proceeded to Daberath and up to Japhia."
Joshua,19,13,"From there it continued eastward toward the sunrise to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin, and it proceeded to Rimmon which stretches to Neah."
Joshua,19,14,"The border circled around it on the north to Hannathon, and it ended at the valley of Iphtahel."
Joshua,19,15,Included also were Kattah and Nahalal and Shimron and Idalah and Bethlehem; twelve cities with their villages.
Joshua,19,16,"This was the inheritance of the sons of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,17,"The fourth lot fell to Issachar, to the sons of Issachar according to their families."
Joshua,19,18,"Their territory was to Jezreel and included Chesulloth and Shunem,"
Joshua,19,19,"and Hapharaim and Shion and Anaharath,"
Joshua,19,20,"and Rabbith and Kishion and Ebez,"
Joshua,19,21,and Remeth and En-gannim and En-haddah and Beth-pazzez.
Joshua,19,22,"The border reached to Tabor and Shahazumah and Beth-shemesh, and their border ended at the Jordan; sixteen cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,23,"This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Issachar according to their families, the cities with their villages."

Joshua,19,25,"Their territory was Helkath and Hali and Beten and Achshaph,"
Joshua,19,26,and Allammelech and Amad and Mishal; and it reached to Carmel on the west and to Shihor-libnath.
Joshua,19,27,"It turned toward the east to Beth-dagon and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtahel northward to Beth-emek and Neiel; then it proceeded on north to Cabul,"
Joshua,19,28,"and Ebron and Rehob and Hammon and Kanah, as far as Great Sidon."
Joshua,19,29,"The border turned to Ramah and to the fortified city of Tyre; then the border turned to Hosah, and it ended at the sea by the region of Achzib."
Joshua,19,30,"Included also were Ummah, and Aphek and Rehob; twenty-two cities with their villages."

Joshua,19,33,"Their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim and Adami-nekeb and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and it ended at the Jordan."
Joshua,19,34,"Then the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor and proceeded from there to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south and touched Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the east."

Joshua,19,47,The territory of the sons of Dan proceeded beyond them; for the sons of Dan went up and fought with Leshem and captured it. Then they struck it with the edge of the sword and possessed it and settled in it; and they called Leshem Dan after the name of Dan their father.
Joshua,19,48,"This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,49,"When they finished apportioning the land for inheritance by its borders, the sons of Israel gave an inheritance in their midst to Joshua the son of Nun."
Joshua,19,50,"In accordance with the command of the LORD they gave him the city for which he asked, Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. So he built the city and settled in it."
Joshua,19,51,"These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel distributed by lot in Shiloh before the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting. So they finished dividing the land."
Joshua,20,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,"
Joshua,20,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘Designate the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses,"
Joshua,20,3,"that the manslayer who kills any person unintentionally, without premeditation, may flee there, and they shall become your refuge from the avenger of blood."
Joshua,20,4,"He shall flee to one of these cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and state his case in the hearing of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city to them and give him a place, so that he may dwell among them."
Joshua,20,5,"Now if the avenger of blood pursues him, then they shall not deliver the manslayer into his hand, because he struck his neighbor without premeditation and did not hate him beforehand."
Joshua,20,6,"He shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the one who is high priest in those days. Then the manslayer shall return to his own city and to his own house, to the city from which he fled.’”"
Joshua,20,7,"So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah."
Joshua,20,8,"Beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plain from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh."
Joshua,20,9,"These were the appointed cities for all the sons of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them, that whoever kills any person unintentionally may flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until he stands before the congregation."
Joshua,21,1,"Then the heads of households of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of households of the tribes of the sons of Israel."
Joshua,21,2,"They spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, “The LORD commanded through Moses to give us cities to live in, with their pasture lands for our cattle.”"
Joshua,21,3,"So the sons of Israel gave the Levites from their inheritance these cities with their pasture lands, according to the command of the LORD."
Joshua,21,4,"Then the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. And the sons of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, received thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Judah and from the tribe of the Simeonites and from the tribe of Benjamin."
Joshua,21,5,The rest of the sons of Kohath received ten cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim and from the tribe of Dan and from the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua,21,6,The sons of Gershon received thirteen cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Issachar and from the tribe of Asher and from the tribe of Naphtali and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
Joshua,21,7,The sons of Merari according to their families received twelve cities from the tribe of Reuben and from the tribe of Gad and from the tribe of Zebulun.
Joshua,21,8,"Now the sons of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their pasture lands, as the LORD had commanded through Moses."
Joshua,21,9,They gave these cities which are here mentioned by name from the tribe of the sons of Judah and from the tribe of the sons of Simeon;
Joshua,21,10,"and they were for the sons of Aaron, one of the families of the Kohathites, of the sons of Levi, for the lot was theirs first."
Joshua,21,11,"Thus they gave them Kiriath-arba, Arba being the father of Anak (that is, Hebron), in the hill country of Judah, with its surrounding pasture lands."
Joshua,21,12,But the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession.
Joshua,21,13,"So to the sons of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, and Libnah with its pasture lands,"

Joshua,21,15,"and Holon with its pasture lands and Debir with its pasture lands,"

Joshua,21,27,"To the sons of Gershon, one of the families of the Levites, from the half-tribe of Manasseh, they gave Golan in Bashan, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, and Be-eshterah with its pasture lands; two cities."

Joshua,21,40,"All these were the cities of the sons of Merari according to their families, the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities."
Joshua,21,41,All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the sons of Israel were forty-eight cities with their pasture lands.
Joshua,21,42,These cities each had its surrounding pasture lands; thus it was with all these cities.
Joshua,21,43,"So the LORD gave Israel all the land which He had sworn to give to their fathers, and they possessed it and lived in it."
Joshua,21,44,"And the LORD gave them rest on every side, according to all that He had sworn to their fathers, and no one of all their enemies stood before them; the LORD gave all their enemies into their hand."
Joshua,21,45,Not one of the good promises which the LORD had made to the house of Israel failed; all came to pass.
Joshua,22,1,"Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh,"
Joshua,22,2,"and said to them, “You have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have listened to my voice in all that I commanded you."
Joshua,22,3,"You have not forsaken your brothers these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God."
Joshua,22,4,"And now the LORD your God has given rest to your brothers, as He spoke to them; therefore turn now and go to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan."
Joshua,22,5,"Only be very careful to observe the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God and walk in all His ways and keep His commandments and hold fast to Him and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.”"
Joshua,22,6,"So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents."
Joshua,22,7,"Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua gave a possession among their brothers westward beyond the Jordan. So when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,"
Joshua,22,8,"and said to them, “Return to your tents with great riches and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, iron, and with very many clothes; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.”"
Joshua,22,9,"The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home and departed from the sons of Israel at Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession which they had possessed, according to the command of the LORD through Moses."
Joshua,22,10,"When they came to the region of the Jordan which is in the land of Canaan, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan, a large altar in appearance."
Joshua,22,11,"And the sons of Israel heard it said, “Behold, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the frontier of the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan, on the side belonging to the sons of Israel.”"
Joshua,22,12,"When the sons of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the sons of Israel gathered themselves at Shiloh to go up against them in war."
Joshua,22,13,"Then the sons of Israel sent to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,"
Joshua,22,14,"and with him ten chiefs, one chief for each father’s household from each of the tribes of Israel; and each one of them was the head of his father’s household among the thousands of Israel."
Joshua,22,15,"They came to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them saying,"
Joshua,22,16,"“Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD, ‘What is this unfaithful act which you have committed against the God of Israel, turning away from following the LORD this day, by building yourselves an altar, to rebel against the LORD this day?"
Joshua,22,17,"Is not the iniquity of Peor enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although a plague came on the congregation of the LORD,"
Joshua,22,18,"that you must turn away this day from following the LORD? If you rebel against the LORD today, He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel tomorrow."
Joshua,22,19,"If, however, the land of your possession is unclean, then cross into the land of the possession of the LORD, where the LORD’S tabernacle stands, and take possession among us. Only do not rebel against the LORD, or rebel against us by building an altar for yourselves, besides the altar of the LORD our God."
Joshua,22,20,"Did not Achan the son of Zerah act unfaithfully in the things under the ban, and wrath fall on all the congregation of Israel? And that man did not perish alone in his iniquity.’”"
Joshua,22,21,Then the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered and spoke to the heads of the families of Israel.
Joshua,22,22,"“The Mighty One, God, the LORD, the Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows, and may Israel itself know. If it was in rebellion, or if in an unfaithful act against the LORD do not save us this day!"
Joshua,22,23,"If we have built us an altar to turn away from following the LORD, or if to offer a burnt offering or grain offering on it, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings on it, may the LORD Himself require it."
Joshua,22,24,"But truly we have done this out of concern, for a reason, saying, ‘In time to come your sons may say to our sons, “What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?"
Joshua,22,25,"For the LORD has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you sons of Reuben and sons of Gad; you have no portion in the LORD.” So your sons may make our sons stop fearing the LORD.’"
Joshua,22,26,"“Therefore we said, ‘Let us build an altar, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice;"
Joshua,22,27,"rather it shall be a witness between us and you and between our generations after us, that we are to perform the service of the LORD before Him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings, so that your sons will not say to our sons in time to come, “You have no portion in the LORD.”’"
Joshua,22,28,"Therefore we said, ‘It shall also come about if they say this to us or to our generations in time to come, then we shall say, “See the copy of the altar of the LORD which our fathers made, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice; rather it is a witness between us and you.”’"
Joshua,22,29,"Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD and turn away from following the LORD this day, by building an altar for burnt offering, for grain offering or for sacrifice, besides the altar of the LORD our God which is before His tabernacle.”"
Joshua,22,30,"So when Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation, even the heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them."
Joshua,22,31,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Manasseh, “Today we know that the LORD is in our midst, because you have not committed this unfaithful act against the LORD; now you have delivered the sons of Israel from the hand of the LORD.”"
Joshua,22,32,"Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the leaders returned from the sons of Reuben and from the sons of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and brought back word to them."
Joshua,22,33,"The word pleased the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel blessed God; and they did not speak of going up against them in war to destroy the land in which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad were living."
Joshua,22,34,"The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar Witness; “For,” they said, “it is a witness between us that the LORD is God.”"
Joshua,23,1,"Now it came about after many days, when the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies on every side, and Joshua was old, advanced in years,"
Joshua,23,2,"that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and their heads and their judges and their officers, and said to them, “I am old, advanced in years."
Joshua,23,3,"And you have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these nations because of you, for the LORD your God is He who has been fighting for you."
Joshua,23,4,"See, I have apportioned to you these nations which remain as an inheritance for your tribes, with all the nations which I have cut off, from the Jordan even to the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun."
Joshua,23,5,"The LORD your God, He will thrust them out from before you and drive them from before you; and you will possess their land, just as the LORD your God promised you."
Joshua,23,6,"Be very firm, then, to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, so that you may not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left,"
Joshua,23,7,"so that you will not associate with these nations, these which remain among you, or mention the name of their gods, or make anyone swear by them, or serve them, or bow down to them."
Joshua,23,8,"But you are to cling to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day."
Joshua,23,9,"For the LORD has driven out great and strong nations from before you; and as for you, no man has stood before you to this day."
Joshua,23,10,"One of your men puts to flight a thousand, for the LORD your God is He who fights for you, just as He promised you."
Joshua,23,11,So take diligent heed to yourselves to love the LORD your God.
Joshua,23,12,"For if you ever go back and cling to the rest of these nations, these which remain among you, and intermarry with them, so that you associate with them and they with you,"
Joshua,23,13,"know with certainty that the LORD your God will not continue to drive these nations out from before you; but they will be a snare and a trap to you, and a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you."
Joshua,23,14,"“Now behold, today I am going the way of all the earth, and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one word of all the good words which the LORD your God spoke concerning you has failed; all have been fulfilled for you, not one of them has failed."
Joshua,23,15,"It shall come about that just as all the good words which the LORD your God spoke to you have come upon you, so the LORD will bring upon you all the threats, until He has destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you."
Joshua,23,16,"When you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then the anger of the LORD will burn against you, and you will perish quickly from off the good land which He has given you.”"
Joshua,24,1,"Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel and for their heads and their judges and their officers; and they presented themselves before God."
Joshua,24,2,"Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘From ancient times your fathers lived beyond the River, namely, Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, and they served other gods."
Joshua,24,3,"Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him through all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his descendants and gave him Isaac."
Joshua,24,4,"To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau, and to Esau I gave Mount Seir to possess it; but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt."
Joshua,24,5,"Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt by what I did in its midst; and afterward I brought you out."
Joshua,24,6,"I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and Egypt pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea."
Joshua,24,7,"But when they cried out to the LORD, He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them and covered them; and your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. And you lived in the wilderness for a long time."
Joshua,24,8,"Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan, and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land when I destroyed them before you."
Joshua,24,9,"Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel, and he sent and summoned Balaam the son of Beor to curse you."
Joshua,24,10,"But I was not willing to listen to Balaam. So he had to bless you, and I delivered you from his hand."
Joshua,24,11,"You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho; and the citizens of Jericho fought against you, and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Girgashite, the Hivite and the Jebusite. Thus I gave them into your hand."
Joshua,24,12,"Then I sent the hornet before you and it drove out the two kings of the Amorites from before you, but not by your sword or your bow."
Joshua,24,13,"I gave you a land on which you had not labored, and cities which you had not built, and you have lived in them; you are eating of vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.’"
Joshua,24,14,"“Now, therefore, fear the LORD and serve Him in sincerity and truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD."
Joshua,24,15,"If it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the LORD, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve: whether the gods which your fathers served which were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.”"
Joshua,24,16,"The people answered and said, “Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD to serve other gods;"
Joshua,24,17,"for the LORD our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did these great signs in our sight and preserved us through all the way in which we went and among all the peoples through whose midst we passed."
Joshua,24,18,"The LORD drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. We also will serve the LORD, for He is our God.”"
Joshua,24,19,"Then Joshua said to the people, “You will not be able to serve the LORD, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your transgression or your sins."
Joshua,24,20,"If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do you harm and consume you after He has done good to you.”"
Joshua,24,21,"The people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve the LORD.”"
Joshua,24,22,"Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves the LORD, to serve Him.” And they said, “We are witnesses.”"
Joshua,24,23,"“Now therefore, put away the foreign gods which are in your midst, and incline your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel.”"
Joshua,24,24,"The people said to Joshua, “We will serve the LORD our God and we will obey His voice.”"
Joshua,24,25,"So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem."
Joshua,24,26,And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.
Joshua,24,27,"Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, this stone shall be for a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the LORD which He spoke to us; thus it shall be for a witness against you, so that you do not deny your God.”"
Joshua,24,28,"Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to his inheritance."
Joshua,24,29,"It came about after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being one hundred and ten years old."
Joshua,24,30,"And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of Mount Gaash."
Joshua,24,31,"Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who survived Joshua, and had known all the deeds of the LORD which He had done for Israel."
Joshua,24,32,"Now they buried the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up from Egypt, at Shechem, in the piece of ground which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of money; and they became the inheritance of Joseph’s sons."
Joshua,24,33,"And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him at Gibeah of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim."
Judges,1,1,"Now it came about after the death of Joshua that the sons of Israel inquired of the LORD, saying, “Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?”"
Judges,1,2,"The LORD said, “Judah shall go up; behold, I have given the land into his hand.”"
Judges,1,3,"Then Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into the territory allotted me, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I in turn will go with you into the territory allotted you.” So Simeon went with him."
Judges,1,4,"Judah went up, and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands, and they defeated ten thousand men at Bezek."
Judges,1,5,"They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek and fought against him, and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites."
Judges,1,6,But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
Judges,1,7,"Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off used to gather up scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has repaid me.” So they brought him to Jerusalem and he died there."
Judges,1,8,Then the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.
Judges,1,9,Afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country and in the Negev and in the lowland.
Judges,1,10,So Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba); and they struck Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.
Judges,1,11,Then from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir (now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher).
Judges,1,12,"And Caleb said, “The one who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will even give him my daughter Achsah for a wife.”"
Judges,1,13,"Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah for a wife."
Judges,1,14,"Then it came about when she came to him, that she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. Then she alighted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you want?”"
Judges,1,15,"She said to him, “Give me a blessing, since you have given me the land of the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs."
Judges,1,16,"The descendants of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up from the city of palms with the sons of Judah, to the wilderness of Judah which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people."
Judges,1,17,"Then Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites living in Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah."
Judges,1,18,And Judah took Gaza with its territory and Ashkelon with its territory and Ekron with its territory.
Judges,1,19,"Now the LORD was with Judah, and they took possession of the hill country; but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had iron chariots."
Judges,1,20,"Then they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had promised; and he drove out from there the three sons of Anak."
Judges,1,21,But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have lived with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
Judges,1,22,"Likewise the house of Joseph went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them."
Judges,1,23,The house of Joseph spied out Bethel (now the name of the city was formerly Luz).
Judges,1,24,"The spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance to the city and we will treat you kindly.”"
Judges,1,25,"So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go free."
Judges,1,26,The man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and named it Luz which is its name to this day.
Judges,1,27,"But Manasseh did not take possession of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; so the Canaanites persisted in living in that land."
Judges,1,28,"It came about when Israel became strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely."
Judges,1,29,Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who were living in Gezer; so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.
Judges,1,30,"Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol; so the Canaanites lived among them and became subject to forced labor."
Judges,1,31,"Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob."
Judges,1,32,"So the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out."
Judges,1,33,"Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; and the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath became forced labor for them."
Judges,1,34,"Then the Amorites forced the sons of Dan into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the valley;"
Judges,1,35,"yet the Amorites persisted in living in Mount Heres, in Aijalon and in Shaalbim; but when the power of the house of Joseph grew strong, they became forced labor."
Judges,1,36,"The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward."
Judges,2,1,"Now the angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, “I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land which I have sworn to your fathers; and I said, ‘I will never break My covenant with you,"
Judges,2,2,"and as for you, you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed Me; what is this you have done?"
Judges,2,3,"Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out before you; but they will become as thorns in your sides and their gods will be a snare to you.’”"
Judges,2,4,"When the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept."
Judges,2,5,So they named that place Bochim; and there they sacrificed to the LORD.
Judges,2,6,"When Joshua had dismissed the people, the sons of Israel went each to his inheritance to possess the land."
Judges,2,7,"The people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who survived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the LORD which He had done for Israel."
Judges,2,8,"Then Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of one hundred and ten."
Judges,2,9,"And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash."
Judges,2,10,"All that generation also were gathered to their fathers; and there arose another generation after them who did not know the LORD, nor yet the work which He had done for Israel."
Judges,2,11,"Then the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals,"
Judges,2,12,"and they forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them; thus they provoked the LORD to anger."
Judges,2,13,So they forsook the LORD and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
Judges,2,14,"The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He gave them into the hands of plunderers who plundered them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies around them, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies."
Judges,2,15,"Wherever they went, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had spoken and as the LORD had sworn to them, so that they were severely distressed."
Judges,2,16,Then the LORD raised up judges who delivered them from the hands of those who plundered them.
Judges,2,17,"Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed themselves down to them. They turned aside quickly from the way in which their fathers had walked in obeying the commandments of the LORD; they did not do as their fathers."
Judges,2,18,"When the LORD raised up judges for them, the LORD was with the judge and delivered them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed and afflicted them."
Judges,2,19,"But it came about when the judge died, that they would turn back and act more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them and bow down to them; they did not abandon their practices or their stubborn ways."
Judges,2,20,"So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He said, “Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers and has not listened to My voice,"
Judges,2,21,"I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died,"
Judges,2,22,"in order to test Israel by them, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk in it as their fathers did, or not.”"
Judges,2,23,"So the LORD allowed those nations to remain, not driving them out quickly; and He did not give them into the hand of Joshua."
Judges,3,1,"Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to test Israel by them (that is, all who had not experienced any of the wars of Canaan;"
Judges,3,2,"only in order that the generations of the sons of Israel might be taught war, those who had not experienced it formerly)."
Judges,3,3,"These nations are: the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath."
Judges,3,4,"They were for testing Israel, to find out if they would obey the commandments of the LORD, which He had commanded their fathers through Moses."
Judges,3,5,"The sons of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites;"
Judges,3,6,"and they took their daughters for themselves as wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods."
Judges,3,7,"The sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth."
Judges,3,8,"Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, so that He sold them into the hands of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the sons of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years."
Judges,3,9,"When the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the sons of Israel to deliver them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother."
Judges,3,10,"The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel. When he went out to war, the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand, so that he prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim."
Judges,3,11,Then the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
Judges,3,12,"Now the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD. So the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD."
Judges,3,13,"And he gathered to himself the sons of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and defeated Israel, and they possessed the city of the palm trees."
Judges,3,14,The sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
Judges,3,15,"But when the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for them, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. And the sons of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab."
Judges,3,16,"Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length, and he bound it on his right thigh under his cloak."
Judges,3,17,He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.
Judges,3,18,"It came about when he had finished presenting the tribute, that he sent away the people who had carried the tribute."
Judges,3,19,"But he himself turned back from the idols which were at Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” And he said, “Keep silence.” And all who attended him left him."
Judges,3,20,"Ehud came to him while he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” And he arose from his seat."
Judges,3,21,"Ehud stretched out his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh and thrust it into his belly."
Judges,3,22,"The handle also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the refuse came out."
Judges,3,23,"Then Ehud went out into the vestibule and shut the doors of the roof chamber behind him, and locked them."
Judges,3,24,"When he had gone out, his servants came and looked, and behold, the doors of the roof chamber were locked; and they said, “He is only relieving himself in the cool room.”"
Judges,3,25,"They waited until they became anxious; but behold, he did not open the doors of the roof chamber. Therefore they took the key and opened them, and behold, their master had fallen to the floor dead."
Judges,3,26,"Now Ehud escaped while they were delaying, and he passed by the idols and escaped to Seirah."
Judges,3,27,"It came about when he had arrived, that he blew the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was in front of them."
Judges,3,28,"He said to them, “Pursue them, for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hands.” So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan opposite Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross."
Judges,3,29,"They struck down at that time about ten thousand Moabites, all robust and valiant men; and no one escaped."
Judges,3,30,So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land was undisturbed for eighty years.
Judges,3,31,"After him came Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad; and he also saved Israel."
Judges,4,1,"Then the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud died."
Judges,4,2,"And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; and the commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim."
Judges,4,3,"The sons of Israel cried to the LORD; for he had nine hundred iron chariots, and he oppressed the sons of Israel severely for twenty years."
Judges,4,4,"Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time."
Judges,4,5,She used to sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment.
Judges,4,6,"Now she sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, “Behold, the LORD, the God of Israel, has commanded, ‘Go and march to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men from the sons of Naphtali and from the sons of Zebulun."
Judges,4,7,"I will draw out to you Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his many troops to the river Kishon, and I will give him into your hand.’”"
Judges,4,8,"Then Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.”"
Judges,4,9,"She said, “I will surely go with you; nevertheless, the honor shall not be yours on the journey that you are about to take, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hands of a woman.” Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh."
Judges,4,10,"Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh, and ten thousand men went up with him; Deborah also went up with him."
Judges,4,11,"Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, from the sons of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh."
Judges,4,12,Then they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.
Judges,4,13,"Sisera called together all his chariots, nine hundred iron chariots, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon."
Judges,4,14,"Deborah said to Barak, “Arise! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sisera into your hands; behold, the LORD has gone out before you.” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him."
Judges,4,15,The LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot.
Judges,4,16,"But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not even one was left."
Judges,4,17,"Now Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite."
Judges,4,18,"Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn aside, my master, turn aside to me! Do not be afraid.” And he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug."
Judges,4,19,"He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a bottle of milk and gave him a drink; then she covered him."
Judges,4,20,"He said to her, “Stand in the doorway of the tent, and it shall be if anyone comes and inquires of you, and says, ‘Is there anyone here?’ that you shall say, ‘No.’”"
Judges,4,21,"But Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg and seized a hammer in her hand, and went secretly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went through into the ground; for he was sound asleep and exhausted. So he died."
Judges,4,22,"And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” And he entered with her, and behold Sisera was lying dead with the tent peg in his temple."
Judges,4,23,So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the sons of Israel.
Judges,4,24,"The hand of the sons of Israel pressed heavier and heavier upon Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin the king of Canaan."
Judges,5,1,"Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,"
Judges,5,2,"“That the leaders led in Israel, That the people volunteered, Bless the LORD!"
Judges,5,3,"“Hear, O kings; give ear, O rulers! I—to the LORD, I will sing, I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel."
Judges,5,4,"“LORD, when You went out from Seir, When You marched from the field of Edom, The earth quaked, the heavens also dripped, Even the clouds dripped water."
Judges,5,5,"“The mountains quaked at the presence of the LORD, This Sinai, at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel."
Judges,5,6,"“In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, In the days of Jael, the highways were deserted, And travelers went by roundabout ways."
Judges,5,7,"“The peasantry ceased, they ceased in Israel, Until I, Deborah, arose, Until I arose, a mother in Israel."
Judges,5,8,“New gods were chosen; Then war was in the gates. Not a shield or a spear was seen Among forty thousand in Israel.
Judges,5,9,"“My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel, The volunteers among the people; Bless the LORD!"
Judges,5,10,"“You who ride on white donkeys, You who sit on rich carpets, And you who travel on the road—sing!"
Judges,5,11,"“At the sound of those who divide flocks among the watering places, There they shall recount the righteous deeds of the LORD, The righteous deeds for His peasantry in Israel. Then the people of the LORD went down to the gates."
Judges,5,12,"“Awake, awake, Deborah; Awake, awake, sing a song! Arise, Barak, and take away your captives, O son of Abinoam."
Judges,5,13,“Then survivors came down to the nobles; The people of the LORD came down to me as warriors.
Judges,5,14,"“From Ephraim those whose root is in Amalek came down, Following you, Benjamin, with your peoples; From Machir commanders came down, And from Zebulun those who wield the staff of office."
Judges,5,15,"“And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; As was Issachar, so was Barak; Into the valley they rushed at his heels; Among the divisions of Reuben There were great resolves of heart."
Judges,5,16,"“Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, To hear the piping for the flocks? Among the divisions of Reuben There were great searchings of heart."
Judges,5,17,"“Gilead remained across the Jordan; And why did Dan stay in ships? Asher sat at the seashore, And remained by its landings."
Judges,5,18,"“Zebulun was a people who despised their lives even to death, And Naphtali also, on the high places of the field."
Judges,5,19,“The kings came and fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan At Taanach near the waters of Megiddo; They took no plunder in silver.
Judges,5,20,"“The stars fought from heaven, From their courses they fought against Sisera."
Judges,5,21,"“The torrent of Kishon swept them away, The ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon. O my soul, march on with strength."
Judges,5,22,"“Then the horses’ hoofs beat From the dashing, the dashing of his valiant steeds."
Judges,5,23,"‘Curse Meroz,’ said the angel of the LORD, ‘Utterly curse its inhabitants; Because they did not come to the help of the LORD, To the help of the LORD against the warriors.’"
Judges,5,24,"“Most blessed of women is Jael, The wife of Heber the Kenite; Most blessed is she of women in the tent."
Judges,5,25,“He asked for water and she gave him milk; In a magnificent bowl she brought him curds.
Judges,5,26,"“She reached out her hand for the tent peg, And her right hand for the workmen’s hammer. Then she struck Sisera, she smashed his head; And she shattered and pierced his temple."
Judges,5,27,"“Between her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay; Between her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell dead."
Judges,5,28,"“Out of the window she looked and lamented, The mother of Sisera through the lattice, ‘Why does his chariot delay in coming? Why do the hoofbeats of his chariots tarry?’"
Judges,5,29,"“Her wise princesses would answer her, Indeed she repeats her words to herself,"
Judges,5,30,"‘Are they not finding, are they not dividing the spoil? A maiden, two maidens for every warrior; To Sisera a spoil of dyed work, A spoil of dyed work embroidered, Dyed work of double embroidery on the neck of the spoiler?’"
Judges,5,31,"“Thus let all Your enemies perish, O LORD; But let those who love Him be like the rising of the sun in its might.” And the land was undisturbed for forty years."
Judges,6,1,Then the sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD gave them into the hands of Midian seven years.
Judges,6,2,The power of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of Midian the sons of Israel made for themselves the dens which were in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds.
Judges,6,3,"For it was when Israel had sown, that the Midianites would come up with the Amalekites and the sons of the east and go against them."
Judges,6,4,"So they would camp against them and destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel as well as no sheep, ox, or donkey."
Judges,6,5,"For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, they would come in like locusts for number, both they and their camels were innumerable; and they came into the land to devastate it."
Judges,6,6,"So Israel was brought very low because of Midian, and the sons of Israel cried to the LORD."
Judges,6,7,"Now it came about when the sons of Israel cried to the LORD on account of Midian,"
Judges,6,8,"that the LORD sent a prophet to the sons of Israel, and he said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘It was I who brought you up from Egypt and brought you out from the house of slavery."
Judges,6,9,"I delivered you from the hands of the Egyptians and from the hands of all your oppressors, and dispossessed them before you and gave you their land,"
Judges,6,10,"and I said to you, “I am the LORD your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you live. But you have not obeyed Me.”’”"
Judges,6,11,"Then the angel of the LORD came and sat under the oak that was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite as his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press in order to save it from the Midianites."
Judges,6,12,"The angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, “The LORD is with you, O valiant warrior.”"
Judges,6,13,"Then Gideon said to him, “O my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, ‘Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the LORD has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian.”"
Judges,6,14,"The LORD looked at him and said, “Go in this your strength and deliver Israel from the hand of Midian. Have I not sent you?”"
Judges,6,15,"He said to Him, “O Lord, how shall I deliver Israel? Behold, my family is the least in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father’s house.”"
Judges,6,16,"But the LORD said to him, “Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat Midian as one man.”"
Judges,6,17,"So Gideon said to Him, “If now I have found favor in Your sight, then show me a sign that it is You who speak with me."
Judges,6,18,"Please do not depart from here, until I come back to You, and bring out my offering and lay it before You.” And He said, “I will remain until you return.”"
Judges,6,19,"Then Gideon went in and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour; he put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and brought them out to him under the oak and presented them."
Judges,6,20,"The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And he did so."
Judges,6,21,Then the angel of the LORD put out the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread; and fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. Then the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight.
Judges,6,22,"When Gideon saw that he was the angel of the LORD, he said, “Alas, O Lord GOD! For now I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face.”"
Judges,6,23,"The LORD said to him, “Peace to you, do not fear; you shall not die.”"
Judges,6,24,Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and named it The LORD is Peace. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
Judges,6,25,"Now on the same night the LORD said to him, “Take your father’s bull and a second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal which belongs to your father, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it;"
Judges,6,26,"and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of this stronghold in an orderly manner, and take a second bull and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down.”"
Judges,6,27,"Then Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had spoken to him; and because he was too afraid of his father’s household and the men of the city to do it by day, he did it by night."
Judges,6,28,"When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was torn down, and the Asherah which was beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar which had been built."
Judges,6,29,"They said to one another, “Who did this thing?” And when they searched about and inquired, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash did this thing.”"
Judges,6,30,"Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has torn down the altar of Baal, and indeed, he has cut down the Asherah which was beside it.”"
Judges,6,31,"But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Will you contend for Baal, or will you deliver him? Whoever will plead for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because someone has torn down his altar.”"
Judges,6,32,"Therefore on that day he named him Jerubbaal, that is to say, “Let Baal contend against him,” because he had torn down his altar."
Judges,6,33,Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the sons of the east assembled themselves; and they crossed over and camped in the valley of Jezreel.
Judges,6,34,"So the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon; and he blew a trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called together to follow him."
Judges,6,35,"He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, and they also were called together to follow him; and he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came up to meet them."
Judges,6,36,"Then Gideon said to God, “If You will deliver Israel through me, as You have spoken,"
Judges,6,37,"behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I will know that You will deliver Israel through me, as You have spoken.”"
Judges,6,38,"And it was so. When he arose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece, he drained the dew from the fleece, a bowl full of water."
Judges,6,39,"Then Gideon said to God, “Do not let Your anger burn against me that I may speak once more; please let me make a test once more with the fleece, let it now be dry only on the fleece, and let there be dew on all the ground.”"
Judges,6,40,"God did so that night; for it was dry only on the fleece, and dew was on all the ground."
Judges,7,1,"Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him, rose early and camped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley."
Judges,7,2,"The LORD said to Gideon, “The people who are with you are too many for Me to give Midian into their hands, for Israel would become boastful, saying, ‘My own power has delivered me.’"
Judges,7,3,"Now therefore come, proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is afraid and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.’” So 22,000 people returned, but 10,000 remained."
Judges,7,4,"Then the LORD said to Gideon, “The people are still too many; bring them down to the water and I will test them for you there. Therefore it shall be that he of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go with you; but everyone of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.”"
Judges,7,5,"So he brought the people down to the water. And the LORD said to Gideon, “You shall separate everyone who laps the water with his tongue as a dog laps, as well as everyone who kneels to drink.”"
Judges,7,6,"Now the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was 300 men; but all the rest of the people kneeled to drink water."
Judges,7,7,"The LORD said to Gideon, “I will deliver you with the 300 men who lapped and will give the Midianites into your hands; so let all the other people go, each man to his home.”"
Judges,7,8,"So the 300 men took the people’s provisions and their trumpets into their hands. And Gideon sent all the other men of Israel, each to his tent, but retained the 300 men; and the camp of Midian was below him in the valley."
Judges,7,9,"Now the same night it came about that the LORD said to him, “Arise, go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hands."
Judges,7,10,"But if you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp,"
Judges,7,11,and you will hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened that you may go down against the camp.” So he went with Purah his servant down to the outposts of the army that was in the camp.
Judges,7,12,"Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the sons of the east were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as numerous as the sand on the seashore."
Judges,7,13,"When Gideon came, behold, a man was relating a dream to his friend. And he said, “Behold, I had a dream; a loaf of barley bread was tumbling into the camp of Midian, and it came to the tent and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down so that the tent lay flat.”"
Judges,7,14,"His friend replied, “This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; God has given Midian and all the camp into his hand.”"
Judges,7,15,"When Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. He returned to the camp of Israel and said, “Arise, for the LORD has given the camp of Midian into your hands.”"
Judges,7,16,"He divided the 300 men into three companies, and he put trumpets and empty pitchers into the hands of all of them, with torches inside the pitchers."
Judges,7,17,"He said to them, “Look at me and do likewise. And behold, when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do."
Judges,7,18,"When I and all who are with me blow the trumpet, then you also blow the trumpets all around the camp and say, ‘For the LORD and for Gideon.’”"
Judges,7,19,"So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just posted the watch; and they blew the trumpets and smashed the pitchers that were in their hands."
Judges,7,20,"When the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers, they held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands for blowing, and cried, “A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!”"
Judges,7,21,"Each stood in his place around the camp; and all the army ran, crying out as they fled."
Judges,7,22,"When they blew 300 trumpets, the LORD set the sword of one against another even throughout the whole army; and the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the edge of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath."
Judges,7,23,"The men of Israel were summoned from Naphtali and Asher and all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian."
Judges,7,24,"Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against Midian and take the waters before them, as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.” So all the men of Ephraim were summoned and they took the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan."
Judges,7,25,"They captured the two leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and they killed Zeeb at the wine press of Zeeb, while they pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from across the Jordan."
Judges,8,1,"Then the men of Ephraim said to him, “What is this thing you have done to us, not calling us when you went to fight against Midian?” And they contended with him vigorously."
Judges,8,2,"But he said to them, “What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?"
Judges,8,3,"God has given the leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb into your hands; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?” Then their anger toward him subsided when he said that."
Judges,8,4,"Then Gideon and the 300 men who were with him came to the Jordan and crossed over, weary yet pursuing."
Judges,8,5,"He said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who are following me, for they are weary, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”"
Judges,8,6,"The leaders of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hands, that we should give bread to your army?”"
Judges,8,7,"Gideon said, “All right, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will thrash your bodies with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.”"
Judges,8,8,He went up from there to Penuel and spoke similarly to them; and the men of Penuel answered him just as the men of Succoth had answered.
Judges,8,9,"So he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, “When I return safely, I will tear down this tower.”"
Judges,8,10,"Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about 15,000 men, all who were left of the entire army of the sons of the east; for the fallen were 120,000 swordsmen."
Judges,8,11,"Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and attacked the camp when the camp was unsuspecting."
Judges,8,12,"When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army."
Judges,8,13,Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres.
Judges,8,14,"And he captured a youth from Succoth and questioned him. Then the youth wrote down for him the princes of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men."
Judges,8,15,"He came to the men of Succoth and said, “Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?’”"
Judges,8,16,"He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and he disciplined the men of Succoth with them."
Judges,8,17,He tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.
Judges,8,18,"Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?” And they said, “They were like you, each one resembling the son of a king.”"
Judges,8,19,"He said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if only you had let them live, I would not kill you.”"
Judges,8,20,"So he said to Jether his firstborn, “Rise, kill them.” But the youth did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still a youth."
Judges,8,21,"Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise up yourself, and fall on us; for as the man, so is his strength.” So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments which were on their camels’ necks."
Judges,8,22,"Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, both you and your son, also your son’s son, for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.”"
Judges,8,23,"But Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, nor shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you.”"
Judges,8,24,"Yet Gideon said to them, “I would request of you, that each of you give me an earring from his spoil.” (For they had gold earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)"
Judges,8,25,"They said, “We will surely give them.” So they spread out a garment, and every one of them threw an earring there from his spoil."
Judges,8,26,"The weight of the gold earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments and the pendants and the purple robes which were on the kings of Midian, and besides the neck bands that were on their camels’ necks."
Judges,8,27,"Gideon made it into an ephod, and placed it in his city, Ophrah, and all Israel played the harlot with it there, so that it became a snare to Gideon and his household."
Judges,8,28,"So Midian was subdued before the sons of Israel, and they did not lift up their heads anymore. And the land was undisturbed for forty years in the days of Gideon."
Judges,8,29,Then Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.
Judges,8,30,"Now Gideon had seventy sons who were his direct descendants, for he had many wives."
Judges,8,31,"His concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech."
Judges,8,32,"And Gideon the son of Joash died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites."
Judges,8,33,"Then it came about, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the sons of Israel again played the harlot with the Baals, and made Baal-berith their god."
Judges,8,34,"Thus the sons of Israel did not remember the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side;"
Judges,8,35,"nor did they show kindness to the household of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) in accord with all the good that he had done to Israel."
Judges,9,1,"And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother’s relatives, and spoke to them and to the whole clan of the household of his mother’s father, saying,"
Judges,9,2,"“Speak, now, in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem, ‘Which is better for you, that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or that one man rule over you?’ Also, remember that I am your bone and your flesh.”"
Judges,9,3,"And his mother’s relatives spoke all these words on his behalf in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem; and they were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our relative.”"
Judges,9,4,"They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the house of Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless fellows, and they followed him."
Judges,9,5,"Then he went to his father’s house at Ophrah and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself."
Judges,9,6,"All the men of Shechem and all Beth-millo assembled together, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar which was in Shechem."
Judges,9,7,"Now when they told Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted his voice and called out. Thus he said to them, “Listen to me, O men of Shechem, that God may listen to you."
Judges,9,8,"Once the trees went forth to anoint a king over them, and they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us!’"
Judges,9,9,"But the olive tree said to them, ‘Shall I leave my fatness with which God and men are honored, and go to wave over the trees?’"
Judges,9,10,"Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come, reign over us!’"
Judges,9,11,"But the fig tree said to them, ‘Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to wave over the trees?’"
Judges,9,12,"Then the trees said to the vine, ‘You come, reign over us!’"
Judges,9,13,"But the vine said to them, ‘Shall I leave my new wine, which cheers God and men, and go to wave over the trees?’"
Judges,9,14,"Finally all the trees said to the bramble, ‘You come, reign over us!’"
Judges,9,15,"The bramble said to the trees, ‘If in truth you are anointing me as king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, may fire come out from the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon.’"
Judges,9,16,"“Now therefore, if you have dealt in truth and integrity in making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have dealt with him as he deserved—"
Judges,9,17,for my father fought for you and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of Midian;
Judges,9,18,"but you have risen against my father’s house today and have killed his sons, seventy men, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your relative—"
Judges,9,19,"if then you have dealt in truth and integrity with Jerubbaal and his house this day, rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you."
Judges,9,20,"But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the men of Shechem and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem and from Beth-millo, and consume Abimelech.”"
Judges,9,21,"Then Jotham escaped and fled, and went to Beer and remained there because of Abimelech his brother."
Judges,9,22,Now Abimelech ruled over Israel three years.
Judges,9,23,"Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,"
Judges,9,24,"so that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers."
Judges,9,25,"The men of Shechem set men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who might pass by them along the road; and it was told to Abimelech."
Judges,9,26,"Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his relatives, and crossed over into Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him."
Judges,9,27,"They went out into the field and gathered the grapes of their vineyards and trod them, and held a festival; and they went into the house of their god, and ate and drank and cursed Abimelech."
Judges,9,28,"Then Gaal the son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is Zebul not his lieutenant? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him?"
Judges,9,29,"Would, therefore, that this people were under my authority! Then I would remove Abimelech.” And he said to Abimelech, “Increase your army and come out.”"
Judges,9,30,"When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger burned."
Judges,9,31,"He sent messengers to Abimelech deceitfully, saying, “Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem; and behold, they are stirring up the city against you."
Judges,9,32,"Now therefore, arise by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field."
Judges,9,33,"In the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early and rush upon the city; and behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you shall do to them whatever you can.”"
Judges,9,34,So Abimelech and all the people who were with him arose by night and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.
Judges,9,35,Now Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the city gate; and Abimelech and the people who were with him arose from the ambush.
Judges,9,36,"When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains.” But Zebul said to him, “You are seeing the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.”"
Judges,9,37,"Gaal spoke again and said, “Behold, people are coming down from the highest part of the land, and one company comes by the way of the diviners’ oak.”"
Judges,9,38,"Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your boasting now with which you said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Is this not the people whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them!”"
Judges,9,39,So Gaal went out before the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech.
Judges,9,40,"Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him; and many fell wounded up to the entrance of the gate."
Judges,9,41,"Then Abimelech remained at Arumah, but Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives so that they could not remain in Shechem."
Judges,9,42,"Now it came about the next day, that the people went out to the field, and it was told to Abimelech."
Judges,9,43,"So he took his people and divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field; when he looked and saw the people coming out from the city, he arose against them and slew them."
Judges,9,44,Then Abimelech and the company who was with him dashed forward and stood in the entrance of the city gate; the other two companies then dashed against all who were in the field and slew them.
Judges,9,45,"Abimelech fought against the city all that day, and he captured the city and killed the people who were in it; then he razed the city and sowed it with salt."
Judges,9,46,"When all the leaders of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered the inner chamber of the temple of El-berith."
Judges,9,47,It was told Abimelech that all the leaders of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
Judges,9,48,"So Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a branch from the trees, and lifted it and laid it on his shoulder. Then he said to the people who were with him, “What you have seen me do, hurry and do likewise.”"
Judges,9,49,"All the people also cut down each one his branch and followed Abimelech, and put them on the inner chamber and set the inner chamber on fire over those inside, so that all the men of the tower of Shechem also died, about a thousand men and women."
Judges,9,50,"Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he camped against Thebez and captured it."
Judges,9,51,"But there was a strong tower in the center of the city, and all the men and women with all the leaders of the city fled there and shut themselves in; and they went up on the roof of the tower."
Judges,9,52,"So Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and approached the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire."
Judges,9,53,"But a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, crushing his skull."
Judges,9,54,"Then he called quickly to the young man, his armor bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that it will not be said of me, ‘A woman slew him.’” So the young man pierced him through, and he died."
Judges,9,55,"When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, each departed to his home."
Judges,9,56,"Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father in killing his seventy brothers."
Judges,9,57,"Also God returned all the wickedness of the men of Shechem on their heads, and the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came upon them."
Judges,10,1,"Now after Abimelech died, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to save Israel; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim."
Judges,10,2,He judged Israel twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried in Shamir.
Judges,10,3,"After him, Jair the Gileadite arose and judged Israel twenty-two years."
Judges,10,4,"He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty cities in the land of Gilead that are called Havvoth-jair to this day."
Judges,10,5,And Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
Judges,10,6,"Then the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, served the Baals and the Ashtaroth, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the sons of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; thus they forsook the LORD and did not serve Him."
Judges,10,7,"The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the sons of Ammon."
Judges,10,8,They afflicted and crushed the sons of Israel that year; for eighteen years they afflicted all the sons of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in Gilead in the land of the Amorites.
Judges,10,9,"The sons of Ammon crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was greatly distressed."
Judges,10,10,"Then the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD, saying, “We have sinned against You, for indeed, we have forsaken our God and served the Baals.”"
Judges,10,11,"The LORD said to the sons of Israel, “Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the sons of Ammon, and the Philistines?"
Judges,10,12,"Also when the Sidonians, the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you, you cried out to Me, and I delivered you from their hands."
Judges,10,13,Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods; therefore I will no longer deliver you.
Judges,10,14,Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your distress.”
Judges,10,15,"The sons of Israel said to the LORD, “We have sinned, do to us whatever seems good to You; only please deliver us this day.”"
Judges,10,16,So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD; and He could bear the misery of Israel no longer.
Judges,10,17,Then the sons of Ammon were summoned and they camped in Gilead. And the sons of Israel gathered together and camped in Mizpah.
Judges,10,18,"The people, the leaders of Gilead, said to one another, “Who is the man who will begin to fight against the sons of Ammon? He shall become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”"
Judges,11,1,"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a valiant warrior, but he was the son of a harlot. And Gilead was the father of Jephthah."
Judges,11,2,"Gilead’s wife bore him sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, “You shall not have an inheritance in our father’s house, for you are the son of another woman.”"
Judges,11,3,"So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob; and worthless fellows gathered themselves about Jephthah, and they went out with him."
Judges,11,4,It came about after a while that the sons of Ammon fought against Israel.
Judges,11,5,"When the sons of Ammon fought against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob;"
Judges,11,6,"and they said to Jephthah, “Come and be our chief that we may fight against the sons of Ammon.”"
Judges,11,7,"Then Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Did you not hate me and drive me from my father’s house? So why have you come to me now when you are in trouble?”"
Judges,11,8,"The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “For this reason we have now returned to you, that you may go with us and fight with the sons of Ammon and become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”"
Judges,11,9,"So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you take me back to fight against the sons of Ammon and the LORD gives them up to me, will I become your head?”"
Judges,11,10,"The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The LORD is witness between us; surely we will do as you have said.”"
Judges,11,11,"Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the LORD at Mizpah."
Judges,11,12,"Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the sons of Ammon, saying, “What is between you and me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?”"
Judges,11,13,"The king of the sons of Ammon said to the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel took away my land when they came up from Egypt, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok and the Jordan; therefore, return them peaceably now.”"
Judges,11,14,"But Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the sons of Ammon,"
Judges,11,15,"and they said to him, “Thus says Jephthah, ‘Israel did not take away the land of Moab nor the land of the sons of Ammon."
Judges,11,16,"For when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh,"
Judges,11,17,"then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, “Please let us pass through your land,” but the king of Edom would not listen. And they also sent to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained at Kadesh."
Judges,11,18,"Then they went through the wilderness and around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and came to the east side of the land of Moab, and they camped beyond the Arnon; but they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab."
Judges,11,19,"And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, “Please let us pass through your land to our place.”"
Judges,11,20,But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory; so Sihon gathered all his people and camped in Jahaz and fought with Israel.
Judges,11,21,"The LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them; so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country."
Judges,11,22,"So they possessed all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and from the wilderness as far as the Jordan."
Judges,11,23,"Since now the LORD, the God of Israel, drove out the Amorites from before His people Israel, are you then to possess it?"
Judges,11,24,"Do you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whatever the LORD our God has driven out before us, we will possess it."
Judges,11,25,"Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive with Israel, or did he ever fight against them?"
Judges,11,26,"While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon, three hundred years, why did you not recover them within that time?"
Judges,11,27,"I therefore have not sinned against you, but you are doing me wrong by making war against me; may the LORD, the Judge, judge today between the sons of Israel and the sons of Ammon.’”"
Judges,11,28,But the king of the sons of Ammon disregarded the message which Jephthah sent him.
Judges,11,29,"Now the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, so that he passed through Gilead and Manasseh; then he passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he went on to the sons of Ammon."
Judges,11,30,"Jephthah made a vow to the LORD and said, “If You will indeed give the sons of Ammon into my hand,"
Judges,11,31,"then it shall be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon, it shall be the LORD’S, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.”"
Judges,11,32,So Jephthah crossed over to the sons of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD gave them into his hand.
Judges,11,33,"He struck them with a very great slaughter from Aroer to the entrance of Minnith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim. So the sons of Ammon were subdued before the sons of Israel."
Judges,11,34,"When Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, behold, his daughter was coming out to meet him with tambourines and with dancing. Now she was his one and only child; besides her he had no son or daughter."
Judges,11,35,"When he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are among those who trouble me; for I have given my word to the LORD, and I cannot take it back.”"
Judges,11,36,"So she said to him, “My father, you have given your word to the LORD; do to me as you have said, since the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the sons of Ammon.”"
Judges,11,37,"She said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me; let me alone two months, that I may go to the mountains and weep because of my virginity, I and my companions.”"
Judges,11,38,"Then he said, “Go.” So he sent her away for two months; and she left with her companions, and wept on the mountains because of her virginity."
Judges,11,39,"At the end of two months she returned to her father, who did to her according to the vow which he had made; and she had no relations with a man. Thus it became a custom in Israel,"
Judges,11,40,that the daughters of Israel went yearly to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.
Judges,12,1,"Then the men of Ephraim were summoned, and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over to fight against the sons of Ammon without calling us to go with you? We will burn your house down on you.”"
Judges,12,2,"Jephthah said to them, “I and my people were at great strife with the sons of Ammon; when I called you, you did not deliver me from their hand."
Judges,12,3,"When I saw that you would not deliver me, I took my life in my hands and crossed over against the sons of Ammon, and the LORD gave them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?”"
Judges,12,4,"Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought Ephraim; and the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, “You are fugitives of Ephraim, O Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh.”"
Judges,12,5,"The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan opposite Ephraim. And it happened when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead would say to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,”"
Judges,12,6,"then they would say to him, “Say now, ‘Shibboleth.’” But he said, “Sibboleth,” for he could not pronounce it correctly. Then they seized him and slew him at the fords of the Jordan. Thus there fell at that time 42,000 of Ephraim."
Judges,12,7,Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
Judges,12,8,Now Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel after him.
Judges,12,9,"He had thirty sons, and thirty daughters whom he gave in marriage outside the family, and he brought in thirty daughters from outside for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years."
Judges,12,10,Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem.
Judges,12,11,Now Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel after him; and he judged Israel ten years.
Judges,12,12,Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
Judges,12,13,Now Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel after him.
Judges,12,14,He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkeys; and he judged Israel eight years.
Judges,12,15,"Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites."
Judges,13,1,"Now the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, so that the LORD gave them into the hands of the Philistines forty years."
Judges,13,2,"There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren and had borne no children."
Judges,13,3,"Then the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, “Behold now, you are barren and have borne no children, but you shall conceive and give birth to a son."
Judges,13,4,"Now therefore, be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing."
Judges,13,5,"For behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son, and no razor shall come upon his head, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines.”"
Judges,13,6,"Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, “A man of God came to me and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome. And I did not ask him where he came from, nor did he tell me his name."
Judges,13,7,"But he said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son, and now you shall not drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.’”"
Judges,13,8,"Then Manoah entreated the LORD and said, “O Lord, please let the man of God whom You have sent come to us again that he may teach us what to do for the boy who is to be born.”"
Judges,13,9,"God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she was sitting in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her."
Judges,13,10,"So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, “Behold, the man who came the other day has appeared to me.”"
Judges,13,11,"Then Manoah arose and followed his wife, and when he came to the man he said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to the woman?” And he said, “I am.”"
Judges,13,12,"Manoah said, “Now when your words come to pass, what shall be the boy’s mode of life and his vocation?”"
Judges,13,13,"So the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, “Let the woman pay attention to all that I said."
Judges,13,14,"She should not eat anything that comes from the vine nor drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; let her observe all that I commanded.”"
Judges,13,15,"Then Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, “Please let us detain you so that we may prepare a young goat for you.”"
Judges,13,16,"The angel of the LORD said to Manoah, “Though you detain me, I will not eat your food, but if you prepare a burnt offering, then offer it to the LORD.” For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the LORD."
Judges,13,17,"Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, “What is your name, so that when your words come to pass, we may honor you?”"
Judges,13,18,"But the angel of the LORD said to him, “Why do you ask my name, seeing it is wonderful?”"
Judges,13,19,"So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering and offered it on the rock to the LORD, and He performed wonders while Manoah and his wife looked on."
Judges,13,20,"For it came about when the flame went up from the altar toward heaven, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell on their faces to the ground."
Judges,13,21,Now the angel of the LORD did not appear to Manoah or his wife again. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the LORD.
Judges,13,22,"So Manoah said to his wife, “We will surely die, for we have seen God.”"
Judges,13,23,"But his wife said to him, “If the LORD had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things, nor would He have let us hear things like this at this time.”"
Judges,13,24,Then the woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson; and the child grew up and the LORD blessed him.
Judges,13,25,"And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol."
Judges,14,1,"Then Samson went down to Timnah and saw a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines."
Judges,14,2,"So he came back and told his father and mother, “I saw a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore, get her for me as a wife.”"
Judges,14,3,"Then his father and his mother said to him, “Is there no woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people, that you go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?” But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she looks good to me.”"
Judges,14,4,"However, his father and mother did not know that it was of the LORD, for He was seeking an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel."
Judges,14,5,"Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came as far as the vineyards of Timnah; and behold, a young lion came roaring toward him."
Judges,14,6,"The Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, so that he tore him as one tears a young goat though he had nothing in his hand; but he did not tell his father or mother what he had done."
Judges,14,7,So he went down and talked to the woman; and she looked good to Samson.
Judges,14,8,"When he returned later to take her, he turned aside to look at the carcass of the lion; and behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the body of the lion."
Judges,14,9,"So he scraped the honey into his hands and went on, eating as he went. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them and they ate it; but he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey out of the body of the lion."
Judges,14,10,"Then his father went down to the woman; and Samson made a feast there, for the young men customarily did this."
Judges,14,11,"When they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him."
Judges,14,12,"Then Samson said to them, “Let me now propound a riddle to you; if you will indeed tell it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen wraps and thirty changes of clothes."
Judges,14,13,"But if you are unable to tell me, then you shall give me thirty linen wraps and thirty changes of clothes.” And they said to him, “Propound your riddle, that we may hear it.”"
Judges,14,14,"So he said to them, “Out of the eater came something to eat, And out of the strong came something sweet.” But they could not tell the riddle in three days."
Judges,14,15,"Then it came about on the fourth day that they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband, so that he will tell us the riddle, or we will burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you invited us to impoverish us? Is this not so?”"
Judges,14,16,"Samson’s wife wept before him and said, “You only hate me, and you do not love me; you have propounded a riddle to the sons of my people, and have not told it to me.” And he said to her, “Behold, I have not told it to my father or mother; so should I tell you?”"
Judges,14,17,However she wept before him seven days while their feast lasted. And on the seventh day he told her because she pressed him so hard. She then told the riddle to the sons of her people.
Judges,14,18,"So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, “What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?” And he said to them, “If you had not plowed with my heifer, You would not have found out my riddle.”"
Judges,14,19,"Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of them and took their spoil and gave the changes of clothes to those who told the riddle. And his anger burned, and he went up to his father’s house."
Judges,14,20,But Samson’s wife was given to his companion who had been his friend.
Judges,15,1,"But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat, and said, “I will go in to my wife in her room.” But her father did not let him enter."
Judges,15,2,"Her father said, “I really thought that you hated her intensely; so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please let her be yours instead.”"
Judges,15,3,"Samson then said to them, “This time I shall be blameless in regard to the Philistines when I do them harm.”"
Judges,15,4,"Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned the foxes tail to tail and put one torch in the middle between two tails."
Judges,15,5,"When he had set fire to the torches, he released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines, thus burning up both the shocks and the standing grain, along with the vineyards and groves."
Judges,15,6,"Then the Philistines said, “Who did this?” And they said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his companion.” So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire."
Judges,15,7,"Samson said to them, “Since you act like this, I will surely take revenge on you, but after that I will quit.”"
Judges,15,8,He struck them ruthlessly with a great slaughter; and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
Judges,15,9,"Then the Philistines went up and camped in Judah, and spread out in Lehi."
Judges,15,10,"The men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” And they said, “We have come up to bind Samson in order to do to him as he did to us.”"
Judges,15,11,"Then 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam and said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?” And he said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.”"
Judges,15,12,"They said to him, “We have come down to bind you so that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines.” And Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not kill me.”"
Judges,15,13,"So they said to him, “No, but we will bind you fast and give you into their hands; yet surely we will not kill you.” Then they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock."
Judges,15,14,"When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him. And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily so that the ropes that were on his arms were as flax that is burned with fire, and his bonds dropped from his hands."
Judges,15,15,"He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, so he reached out and took it and killed a thousand men with it."
Judges,15,16,"Then Samson said, “With the jawbone of a donkey, Heaps upon heaps, With the jawbone of a donkey I have killed a thousand men.”"
Judges,15,17,"When he had finished speaking, he threw the jawbone from his hand; and he named that place Ramath-lehi."
Judges,15,18,"Then he became very thirsty, and he called to the LORD and said, “You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant, and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”"
Judges,15,19,"But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi so that water came out of it. When he drank, his strength returned and he revived. Therefore he named it En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day."
Judges,15,20,So he judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
Judges,16,1,"Now Samson went to Gaza and saw a harlot there, and went in to her."
Judges,16,2,"When it was told to the Gazites, saying, “Samson has come here,” they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city. And they kept silent all night, saying, “Let us wait until the morning light, then we will kill him.”"
Judges,16,3,"Now Samson lay until midnight, and at midnight he arose and took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two posts and pulled them up along with the bars; then he put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain which is opposite Hebron."
Judges,16,4,"After this it came about that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah."
Judges,16,5,"The lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, “Entice him, and see where his great strength lies and how we may overpower him that we may bind him to afflict him. Then we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”"
Judges,16,6,"So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength is and how you may be bound to afflict you.”"
Judges,16,7,"Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven fresh cords that have not been dried, then I will become weak and be like any other man.”"
Judges,16,8,"Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh cords that had not been dried, and she bound him with them."
Judges,16,9,"Now she had men lying in wait in an inner room. And she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he snapped the cords as a string of tow snaps when it touches fire. So his strength was not discovered."
Judges,16,10,"Then Delilah said to Samson, “Behold, you have deceived me and told me lies; now please tell me how you may be bound.”"
Judges,16,11,"He said to her, “If they bind me tightly with new ropes which have not been used, then I will become weak and be like any other man.”"
Judges,16,12,"So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” For the men were lying in wait in the inner room. But he snapped the ropes from his arms like a thread."
Judges,16,13,"Then Delilah said to Samson, “Up to now you have deceived me and told me lies; tell me how you may be bound.” And he said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my hair with the web [and fasten it with a pin, then I will become weak and be like any other man.”"
Judges,16,14,"So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his hair and wove them into the web]. And she fastened it with the pin and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he awoke from his sleep and pulled out the pin of the loom and the web."
Judges,16,15,"Then she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have deceived me these three times and have not told me where your great strength is.”"
Judges,16,16,"It came about when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him, that his soul was annoyed to death."
Judges,16,17,"So he told her all that was in his heart and said to her, “A razor has never come on my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will leave me and I will become weak and be like any other man.”"
Judges,16,18,"When Delilah saw that he had told her all that was in his heart, she sent and called the lords of the Philistines, saying, “Come up once more, for he has told me all that is in his heart.” Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hands."
Judges,16,19,"She made him sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his hair. Then she began to afflict him, and his strength left him."
Judges,16,20,"She said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And he awoke from his sleep and said, “I will go out as at other times and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him."
Judges,16,21,"Then the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze chains, and he was a grinder in the prison."
Judges,16,22,"However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it was shaved off."
Judges,16,23,"Now the lords of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice, for they said, “Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hands.”"
Judges,16,24,"When the people saw him, they praised their god, for they said, “Our god has given our enemy into our hands, Even the destroyer of our country, Who has slain many of us.”"
Judges,16,25,"It so happened when they were in high spirits, that they said, “Call for Samson, that he may amuse us.” So they called for Samson from the prison, and he entertained them. And they made him stand between the pillars."
Judges,16,26,"Then Samson said to the boy who was holding his hand, “Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean against them.”"
Judges,16,27,"Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there. And about 3,000 men and women were on the roof looking on while Samson was amusing them."
Judges,16,28,"Then Samson called to the LORD and said, “O Lord GOD, please remember me and please strengthen me just this time, O God, that I may at once be avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.”"
Judges,16,29,"Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and braced himself against them, the one with his right hand and the other with his left."
Judges,16,30,"And Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” And he bent with all his might so that the house fell on the lords and all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he killed in his life."
Judges,16,31,"Then his brothers and all his father’s household came down, took him, brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. Thus he had judged Israel twenty years."
Judges,17,1,Now there was a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah.
Judges,17,2,"He said to his mother, “The eleven hundred pieces of silver which were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse in my hearing, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.” And his mother said, “Blessed be my son by the LORD.”"
Judges,17,3,"He then returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said, “I wholly dedicate the silver from my hand to the LORD for my son to make a graven image and a molten image; now therefore, I will return them to you.”"
Judges,17,4,"So when he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith who made them into a graven image and a molten image, and they were in the house of Micah."
Judges,17,5,"And the man Micah had a shrine and he made an ephod and household idols and consecrated one of his sons, that he might become his priest."
Judges,17,6,In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
Judges,17,7,"Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he was staying there."
Judges,17,8,"Then the man departed from the city, from Bethlehem in Judah, to stay wherever he might find a place; and as he made his journey, he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah."
Judges,17,9,"Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he said to him, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to stay wherever I may find a place.”"
Judges,17,10,"Micah then said to him, “Dwell with me and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year, a suit of clothes, and your maintenance.” So the Levite went in."
Judges,17,11,"The Levite agreed to live with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons."
Judges,17,12,"So Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in the house of Micah."
Judges,17,13,"Then Micah said, “Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, seeing I have a Levite as priest.”"
Judges,18,1,"In those days there was no king of Israel; and in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking an inheritance for themselves to live in, for until that day an inheritance had not been allotted to them as a possession among the tribes of Israel."
Judges,18,2,"So the sons of Dan sent from their family five men out of their whole number, valiant men from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to search it; and they said to them, “Go, search the land.” And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there."
Judges,18,3,"When they were near the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young man, the Levite; and they turned aside there and said to him, “Who brought you here? And what are you doing in this place? And what do you have here?”"
Judges,18,4,"He said to them, “Thus and so has Micah done to me, and he has hired me and I have become his priest.”"
Judges,18,5,"They said to him, “Inquire of God, please, that we may know whether our way on which we are going will be prosperous.”"
Judges,18,6,"The priest said to them, “Go in peace; your way in which you are going has the LORD’S approval.”"
Judges,18,7,"Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were in it living in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was no ruler humiliating them for anything in the land, and they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone."
Judges,18,8,"When they came back to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them, “What do you report?”"
Judges,18,9,"They said, “Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. And will you sit still? Do not delay to go, to enter, to possess the land."
Judges,18,10,"When you enter, you will come to a secure people with a spacious land; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth.”"
Judges,18,11,"Then from the family of the Danites, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, six hundred men armed with weapons of war set out."
Judges,18,12,"They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. Therefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan to this day; behold, it is west of Kiriath-jearim."
Judges,18,13,They passed from there to the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah.
Judges,18,14,"Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish said to their kinsmen, “Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod and household idols and a graven image and a molten image? Now therefore, consider what you should do.”"
Judges,18,15,"They turned aside there and came to the house of the young man, the Levite, to the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare."
Judges,18,16,"The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the sons of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate."
Judges,18,17,"Now the five men who went to spy out the land went up and entered there, and took the graven image and the ephod and household idols and the molten image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war."
Judges,18,18,"When these went into Micah’s house and took the graven image, the ephod and household idols and the molten image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”"
Judges,18,19,"They said to him, “Be silent, put your hand over your mouth and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?”"
Judges,18,20,"The priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod and household idols and the graven image and went among the people."
Judges,18,21,"Then they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the livestock and the valuables in front of them."
Judges,18,22,"When they had gone some distance from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house assembled and overtook the sons of Dan."
Judges,18,23,"They cried to the sons of Dan, who turned around and said to Micah, “What is the matter with you, that you have assembled together?”"
Judges,18,24,"He said, “You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away, and what do I have besides? So how can you say to me, ‘What is the matter with you?’”"
Judges,18,25,"The sons of Dan said to him, “Do not let your voice be heard among us, or else fierce men will fall upon you and you will lose your life, with the lives of your household.”"
Judges,18,26,"So the sons of Dan went on their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house."
Judges,18,27,"Then they took what Micah had made and the priest who had belonged to him, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burned the city with fire."
Judges,18,28,"And there was no one to deliver them, because it was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone, and it was in the valley which is near Beth-rehob. And they rebuilt the city and lived in it."
Judges,18,29,"They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father who was born in Israel; however, the name of the city formerly was Laish."
Judges,18,30,"The sons of Dan set up for themselves the graven image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land."
Judges,18,31,"So they set up for themselves Micah’s graven image which he had made, all the time that the house of God was at Shiloh."
Judges,19,1,"Now it came about in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite staying in the remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, who took a concubine for himself from Bethlehem in Judah."
Judges,19,2,"But his concubine played the harlot against him, and she went away from him to her father’s house in Bethlehem in Judah, and was there for a period of four months."
Judges,19,3,"Then her husband arose and went after her to speak tenderly to her in order to bring her back, taking with him his servant and a pair of donkeys. So she brought him into her father’s house, and when the girl’s father saw him, he was glad to meet him."
Judges,19,4,"His father-in-law, the girl’s father, detained him; and he remained with him three days. So they ate and drank and lodged there."
Judges,19,5,"Now on the fourth day they got up early in the morning, and he prepared to go; and the girl’s father said to his son-in-law, “Sustain yourself with a piece of bread, and afterward you may go.”"
Judges,19,6,"So both of them sat down and ate and drank together; and the girl’s father said to the man, “Please be willing to spend the night, and let your heart be merry.”"
Judges,19,7,"Then the man arose to go, but his father-in-law urged him so that he spent the night there again."
Judges,19,8,"On the fifth day he arose to go early in the morning, and the girl’s father said, “Please sustain yourself, and wait until afternoon”; so both of them ate."
Judges,19,9,"When the man arose to go along with his concubine and servant, his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said to him, “Behold now, the day has drawn to a close; please spend the night. Lo, the day is coming to an end; spend the night here that your heart may be merry. Then tomorrow you may arise early for your journey so that you may go home.”"
Judges,19,10,"But the man was not willing to spend the night, so he arose and departed and came to a place opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). And there were with him a pair of saddled donkeys; his concubine also was with him."
Judges,19,11,"When they were near Jebus, the day was almost gone; and the servant said to his master, “Please come, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it.”"
Judges,19,12,"However, his master said to him, “We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners who are not of the sons of Israel; but we will go on as far as Gibeah.”"
Judges,19,13,"He said to his servant, “Come and let us approach one of these places; and we will spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah.”"
Judges,19,14,"So they passed along and went their way, and the sun set on them near Gibeah which belongs to Benjamin."
Judges,19,15,"They turned aside there in order to enter and lodge in Gibeah. When they entered, they sat down in the open square of the city, for no one took them into his house to spend the night."
Judges,19,16,"Then behold, an old man was coming out of the field from his work at evening. Now the man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was staying in Gibeah, but the men of the place were Benjamites."
Judges,19,17,"And he lifted up his eyes and saw the traveler in the open square of the city; and the old man said, “Where are you going, and where do you come from?”"
Judges,19,18,"He said to him, “We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, for I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem in Judah. But I am now going to my house, and no man will take me into his house."
Judges,19,19,"Yet there is both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and also bread and wine for me, your maidservant, and the young man who is with your servants; there is no lack of anything.”"
Judges,19,20,"The old man said, “Peace to you. Only let me take care of all your needs; however, do not spend the night in the open square.”"
Judges,19,21,"So he took him into his house and gave the donkeys fodder, and they washed their feet and ate and drank."
Judges,19,22,"While they were celebrating, behold, the men of the city, certain worthless fellows, surrounded the house, pounding the door; and they spoke to the owner of the house, the old man, saying, “Bring out the man who came into your house that we may have relations with him.”"
Judges,19,23,"Then the man, the owner of the house, went out to them and said to them, “No, my fellows, please do not act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, do not commit this act of folly."
Judges,19,24,Here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. Please let me bring them out that you may ravish them and do to them whatever you wish. But do not commit such an act of folly against this man.”
Judges,19,25,"But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and brought her out to them; and they raped her and abused her all night until morning, then let her go at the approach of dawn."
Judges,19,26,"As the day began to dawn, the woman came and fell down at the doorway of the man’s house where her master was, until full daylight."
Judges,19,27,"When her master arose in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way, then behold, his concubine was lying at the doorway of the house with her hands on the threshold."
Judges,19,28,"He said to her, “Get up and let us go,” but there was no answer. Then he placed her on the donkey; and the man arose and went to his home."
Judges,19,29,"When he entered his house, he took a knife and laid hold of his concubine and cut her in twelve pieces, limb by limb, and sent her throughout the territory of Israel."
Judges,19,30,"All who saw it said, “Nothing like this has ever happened or been seen from the day when the sons of Israel came up from the land of Egypt to this day. Consider it, take counsel and speak up!”"
Judges,20,1,"Then all the sons of Israel from Dan to Beersheba, including the land of Gilead, came out, and the congregation assembled as one man to the LORD at Mizpah."
Judges,20,2,"The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, took their stand in the assembly of the people of God, 400,000 foot soldiers who drew the sword."
Judges,20,3,"(Now the sons of Benjamin heard that the sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the sons of Israel said, “Tell us, how did this wickedness take place?”"
Judges,20,4,"So the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, “I came with my concubine to spend the night at Gibeah which belongs to Benjamin."
Judges,20,5,"But the men of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house at night because of me. They intended to kill me; instead, they ravished my concubine so that she died."
Judges,20,6,And I took hold of my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout the land of Israel’s inheritance; for they have committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel.
Judges,20,7,"Behold, all you sons of Israel, give your advice and counsel here.”"
Judges,20,8,"Then all the people arose as one man, saying, “Not one of us will go to his tent, nor will any of us return to his house."
Judges,20,9,But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up against it by lot.
Judges,20,10,"And we will take 10 men out of 100 throughout the tribes of Israel, and 100 out of 1,000, and 1,000 out of 10,000 to supply food for the people, that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, they may punish them for all the disgraceful acts that they have committed in Israel.”"
Judges,20,11,"Thus all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united as one man."
Judges,20,12,"Then the tribes of Israel sent men through the entire tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this wickedness that has taken place among you?"
Judges,20,13,"Now then, deliver up the men, the worthless fellows in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and remove this wickedness from Israel.” But the sons of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the sons of Israel."
Judges,20,14,"The sons of Benjamin gathered from the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the sons of Israel."
Judges,20,15,"From the cities on that day the sons of Benjamin were numbered, 26,000 men who draw the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah who were numbered, 700 choice men."
Judges,20,16,Out of all these people 700 choice men were left-handed; each one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
Judges,20,17,"Then the men of Israel besides Benjamin were numbered, 400,000 men who draw the sword; all these were men of war."
Judges,20,18,"Now the sons of Israel arose, went up to Bethel, and inquired of God and said, “Who shall go up first for us to battle against the sons of Benjamin?” Then the LORD said, “Judah shall go up first.”"
Judges,20,19,So the sons of Israel arose in the morning and camped against Gibeah.
Judges,20,20,"The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel arrayed for battle against them at Gibeah."
Judges,20,21,"Then the sons of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and felled to the ground on that day 22,000 men of Israel."
Judges,20,22,"But the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and arrayed for battle again in the place where they had arrayed themselves the first day."
Judges,20,23,"The sons of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall we again draw near for battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin?” And the LORD said, “Go up against him.”"
Judges,20,24,Then the sons of Israel came against the sons of Benjamin the second day.
Judges,20,25,"Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah the second day and felled to the ground again 18,000 men of the sons of Israel; all these drew the sword."
Judges,20,26,Then all the sons of Israel and all the people went up and came to Bethel and wept; thus they remained there before the LORD and fasted that day until evening. And they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
Judges,20,27,"The sons of Israel inquired of the LORD (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,"
Judges,20,28,"and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, Aaron’s son, stood before it to minister in those days), saying, “Shall I yet again go out to battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin, or shall I cease?” And the LORD said, “Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.”"
Judges,20,29,So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah.
Judges,20,30,The sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day and arrayed themselves against Gibeah as at other times.
Judges,20,31,"The sons of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city, and they began to strike and kill some of the people as at other times, on the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, and in the field, about thirty men of Israel."
Judges,20,32,"The sons of Benjamin said, “They are struck down before us, as at the first.” But the sons of Israel said, “Let us flee that we may draw them away from the city to the highways.”"
Judges,20,33,"Then all the men of Israel arose from their place and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar; and the men of Israel in ambush broke out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba."
Judges,20,34,"When ten thousand choice men from all Israel came against Gibeah, the battle became fierce; but Benjamin did not know that disaster was close to them."
Judges,20,35,"And the LORD struck Benjamin before Israel, so that the sons of Israel destroyed 25,100 men of Benjamin that day, all who draw the sword."
Judges,20,36,"So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. When the men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin because they relied on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah,"
Judges,20,37,the men in ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah; the men in ambush also deployed and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.
Judges,20,38,Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise from the city.
Judges,20,39,"Then the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel, for they said, “Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle.”"
Judges,20,40,"But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, Benjamin looked behind them; and behold, the whole city was going up in smoke to heaven."
Judges,20,41,"Then the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were terrified; for they saw that disaster was close to them."
Judges,20,42,"Therefore, they turned their backs before the men of Israel toward the direction of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them while those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of them."
Judges,20,43,"They surrounded Benjamin, pursued them without rest and trod them down opposite Gibeah toward the east."
Judges,20,44,"Thus 18,000 men of Benjamin fell; all these were valiant warriors."
Judges,20,45,"The rest turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, but they caught 5,000 of them on the highways and overtook them at Gidom and killed 2,000 of them."
Judges,20,46,"So all of Benjamin who fell that day were 25,000 men who draw the sword; all these were valiant warriors."
Judges,20,47,"But 600 men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they remained at the rock of Rimmon four months."
Judges,20,48,"The men of Israel then turned back against the sons of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city with the cattle and all that they found; they also set on fire all the cities which they found."
Judges,21,1,"Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, “None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin in marriage.”"
Judges,21,2,"So the people came to Bethel and sat there before God until evening, and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly."
Judges,21,3,"They said, “Why, O LORD, God of Israel, has this come about in Israel, so that one tribe should be missing today in Israel?”"
Judges,21,4,It came about the next day that the people arose early and built an altar there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
Judges,21,5,"Then the sons of Israel said, “Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up in the assembly to the LORD?” For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah, saying, “He shall surely be put to death.”"
Judges,21,6,"And the sons of Israel were sorry for their brother Benjamin and said, “One tribe is cut off from Israel today."
Judges,21,7,"What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the LORD not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?”"
Judges,21,8,"And they said, “What one is there of the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah?” And behold, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly."
Judges,21,9,"For when the people were numbered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there."
Judges,21,10,"And the congregation sent 12,000 of the valiant warriors there, and commanded them, saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones."
Judges,21,11,This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every man and every woman who has lain with a man.”
Judges,21,12,"And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan."
Judges,21,13,"Then the whole congregation sent word and spoke to the sons of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them."
Judges,21,14,"Benjamin returned at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jabesh-gilead; yet they were not enough for them."
Judges,21,15,And the people were sorry for Benjamin because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
Judges,21,16,"Then the elders of the congregation said, “What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?”"
Judges,21,17,"They said, “There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe will not be blotted out from Israel."
Judges,21,18,"But we cannot give them wives of our daughters.” For the sons of Israel had sworn, saying, “Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.”"
Judges,21,19,"So they said, “Behold, there is a feast of the LORD from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south side of Lebonah.”"
Judges,21,20,"And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, “Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,"
Judges,21,21,"and watch; and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to take part in the dances, then you shall come out of the vineyards and each of you shall catch his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin."
Judges,21,22,"It shall come about, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we shall say to them, ‘Give them to us voluntarily, because we did not take for each man of Benjamin a wife in battle, nor did you give them to them, else you would now be guilty.’”"
Judges,21,23,"The sons of Benjamin did so, and took wives according to their number from those who danced, whom they carried away. And they went and returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the cities and lived in them."
Judges,21,24,"The sons of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family, and each one of them went out from there to his inheritance."
Judges,21,25,In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
Ruth,1,1,"Now it came about in the days when the judges governed, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons."
Ruth,1,2,"The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi; and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem in Judah. Now they entered the land of Moab and remained there."
Ruth,1,3,"Then Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left with her two sons."
Ruth,1,4,They took for themselves Moabite women as wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. And they lived there about ten years.
Ruth,1,5,"Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and the woman was bereft of her two children and her husband."
Ruth,1,6,"Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the land of Moab, for she had heard in the land of Moab that the LORD had visited His people in giving them food."
Ruth,1,7,"So she departed from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah."
Ruth,1,8,"And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each of you to her mother’s house. May the LORD deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me."
Ruth,1,9,"May the LORD grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband.” Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept."
Ruth,1,10,"And they said to her, “No, but we will surely return with you to your people.”"
Ruth,1,11,"But Naomi said, “Return, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?"
Ruth,1,12,"Return, my daughters! Go, for I am too old to have a husband. If I said I have hope, if I should even have a husband tonight and also bear sons,"
Ruth,1,13,"would you therefore wait until they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters; for it is harder for me than for you, for the hand of the LORD has gone forth against me.”"
Ruth,1,14,"And they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her."
Ruth,1,15,"Then she said, “Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her gods; return after your sister-in-law.”"
Ruth,1,16,"But Ruth said, “Do not urge me to leave you or turn back from following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God."
Ruth,1,17,"Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. Thus may the LORD do to me, and worse, if anything but death parts you and me.”"
Ruth,1,18,"When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more to her."
Ruth,1,19,"So they both went until they came to Bethlehem. And when they had come to Bethlehem, all the city was stirred because of them, and the women said, “Is this Naomi?”"
Ruth,1,20,"She said to them, “Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me."
Ruth,1,21,"I went out full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the LORD has witnessed against me and the Almighty has afflicted me?”"
Ruth,1,22,"So Naomi returned, and with her Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, who returned from the land of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest."
Ruth,2,1,"Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz."
Ruth,2,2,"And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after one in whose sight I may find favor.” And she said to her, “Go, my daughter.”"
Ruth,2,3,"So she departed and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech."
Ruth,2,4,"Now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, “May the LORD be with you.” And they said to him, “May the LORD bless you.”"
Ruth,2,5,"Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, “Whose young woman is this?”"
Ruth,2,6,"The servant in charge of the reapers replied, “She is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab."
Ruth,2,7,"And she said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ Thus she came and has remained from the morning until now; she has been sitting in the house for a little while.”"
Ruth,2,8,"Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen carefully, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field; furthermore, do not go on from this one, but stay here with my maids."
Ruth,2,9,"Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them. Indeed, I have commanded the servants not to touch you. When you are thirsty, go to the water jars and drink from what the servants draw.”"
Ruth,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your sight that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?”"
Ruth,2,11,"Boaz replied to her, “All that you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband has been fully reported to me, and how you left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people that you did not previously know."
Ruth,2,12,"May the LORD reward your work, and your wages be full from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge.”"
Ruth,2,13,"Then she said, “I have found favor in your sight, my lord, for you have comforted me and indeed have spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not like one of your maidservants.”"
Ruth,2,14,"At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come here, that you may eat of the bread and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers; and he served her roasted grain, and she ate and was satisfied and had some left."
Ruth,2,15,"When she rose to glean, Boaz commanded his servants, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not insult her."
Ruth,2,16,"Also you shall purposely pull out for her some grain from the bundles and leave it that she may glean, and do not rebuke her.”"
Ruth,2,17,"So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley."
Ruth,2,18,"She took it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She also took it out and gave Naomi what she had left after she was satisfied."
Ruth,2,19,"Her mother-in-law then said to her, “Where did you glean today and where did you work? May he who took notice of you be blessed.” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, “The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.”"
Ruth,2,20,"Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed of the LORD who has not withdrawn his kindness to the living and to the dead.” Again Naomi said to her, “The man is our relative, he is one of our closest relatives.”"
Ruth,2,21,"Then Ruth the Moabitess said, “Furthermore, he said to me, ‘You should stay close to my servants until they have finished all my harvest.’”"
Ruth,2,22,"Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maids, so that others do not fall upon you in another field.”"
Ruth,2,23,So she stayed close by the maids of Boaz in order to glean until the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
Ruth,3,1,"Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, shall I not seek security for you, that it may be well with you?"
Ruth,3,2,"Now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maids you were? Behold, he winnows barley at the threshing floor tonight."
Ruth,3,3,"Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking."
Ruth,3,4,"It shall be when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies, and you shall go and uncover his feet and lie down; then he will tell you what you shall do.”"
Ruth,3,5,"She said to her, “All that you say I will do.”"
Ruth,3,6,So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her.
Ruth,3,7,"When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came secretly, and uncovered his feet and lay down."
Ruth,3,8,"It happened in the middle of the night that the man was startled and bent forward; and behold, a woman was lying at his feet."
Ruth,3,9,"He said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth your maid. So spread your covering over your maid, for you are a close relative.”"
Ruth,3,10,"Then he said, “May you be blessed of the LORD, my daughter. You have shown your last kindness to be better than the first by not going after young men, whether poor or rich."
Ruth,3,11,"Now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you whatever you ask, for all my people in the city know that you are a woman of excellence."
Ruth,3,12,"Now it is true I am a close relative; however, there is a relative closer than I."
Ruth,3,13,"Remain this night, and when morning comes, if he will redeem you, good; let him redeem you. But if he does not wish to redeem you, then I will redeem you, as the LORD lives. Lie down until morning.”"
Ruth,3,14,"So she lay at his feet until morning and rose before one could recognize another; and he said, “Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.”"
Ruth,3,15,"Again he said, “Give me the cloak that is on you and hold it.” So she held it, and he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her. Then she went into the city."
Ruth,3,16,"When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “How did it go, my daughter?” And she told her all that the man had done for her."
Ruth,3,17,"She said, “These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said, ‘Do not go to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’”"
Ruth,3,18,"Then she said, “Wait, my daughter, until you know how the matter turns out; for the man will not rest until he has settled it today.”"
Ruth,4,1,"Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there, and behold, the close relative of whom Boaz spoke was passing by, so he said, “Turn aside, friend, sit down here.” And he turned aside and sat down."
Ruth,4,2,"He took ten men of the elders of the city and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down."
Ruth,4,3,"Then he said to the closest relative, “Naomi, who has come back from the land of Moab, has to sell the piece of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech."
Ruth,4,4,"So I thought to inform you, saying, ‘Buy it before those who are sitting here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if not, tell me that I may know; for there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am after you.’” And he said, “I will redeem it.”"
Ruth,4,5,"Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the deceased, in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance.”"
Ruth,4,6,"The closest relative said, “I cannot redeem it for myself, because I would jeopardize my own inheritance. Redeem it for yourself; you may have my right of redemption, for I cannot redeem it.”"
Ruth,4,7,Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning the redemption and the exchange of land to confirm any matter: a man removed his sandal and gave it to another; and this was the manner of attestation in Israel.
Ruth,4,8,"So the closest relative said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself.” And he removed his sandal."
Ruth,4,9,"Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon."
Ruth,4,10,"Moreover, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, to be my wife in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance, so that the name of the deceased will not be cut off from his brothers or from the court of his birth place; you are witnesses today.”"
Ruth,4,11,"All the people who were in the court, and the elders, said, “We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel; and may you achieve wealth in Ephrathah and become famous in Bethlehem."
Ruth,4,12,"Moreover, may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah, through the offspring which the LORD will give you by this young woman.”"
Ruth,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he went in to her. And the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son."
Ruth,4,14,"Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed is the LORD who has not left you without a redeemer today, and may his name become famous in Israel."
Ruth,4,15,"May he also be to you a restorer of life and a sustainer of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.”"
Ruth,4,16,"Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her lap, and became his nurse."
Ruth,4,17,"The neighbor women gave him a name, saying, “A son has been born to Naomi!” So they named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David."
Ruth,4,18,"Now these are the generations of Perez: to Perez was born Hezron,"
Ruth,4,19,"and to Hezron was born Ram, and to Ram, Amminadab,"
Ruth,4,20,"and to Amminadab was born Nahshon, and to Nahshon, Salmon,"
Ruth,4,21,"and to Salmon was born Boaz, and to Boaz, Obed,"
Ruth,4,22,"and to Obed was born Jesse, and to Jesse, David."
1 Samuel,1,1,"Now there was a certain man from Ramathaim-zophim from the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite."
1 Samuel,1,2,"He had two wives: the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children."
1 Samuel,1,3,"Now this man would go up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the LORD there."
1 Samuel,1,4,"When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters;"
1 Samuel,1,5,"but to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah, but the LORD had closed her womb."
1 Samuel,1,6,"Her rival, however, would provoke her bitterly to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb."
1 Samuel,1,7,"It happened year after year, as often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she would provoke her; so she wept and would not eat."
1 Samuel,1,8,"Then Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep and why do you not eat and why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”"
1 Samuel,1,9,Then Hannah rose after eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.
1 Samuel,1,10,"She, greatly distressed, prayed to the LORD and wept bitterly."
1 Samuel,1,11,"She made a vow and said, “O LORD of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maidservant, but will give Your maidservant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and a razor shall never come on his head.”"
1 Samuel,1,12,"Now it came about, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli was watching her mouth."
1 Samuel,1,13,"As for Hannah, she was speaking in her heart, only her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought she was drunk."
1 Samuel,1,14,"Then Eli said to her, “How long will you make yourself drunk? Put away your wine from you.”"
1 Samuel,1,15,"But Hannah replied, “No, my lord, I am a woman oppressed in spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the LORD."
1 Samuel,1,16,"Do not consider your maidservant as a worthless woman, for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and provocation.”"
1 Samuel,1,17,"Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of Him.”"
1 Samuel,1,18,"She said, “Let your maidservant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad."
1 Samuel,1,19,"Then they arose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD, and returned again to their house in Ramah. And Elkanah had relations with Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her."
1 Samuel,1,20,"It came about in due time, after Hannah had conceived, that she gave birth to a son; and she named him Samuel, saying, “Because I have asked him of the LORD.”"
1 Samuel,1,21,Then the man Elkanah went up with all his household to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and pay his vow.
1 Samuel,1,22,"But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “I will not go up until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD and stay there forever.”"
1 Samuel,1,23,"Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you. Remain until you have weaned him; only may the LORD confirm His word.” So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him."
1 Samuel,1,24,"Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with a three-year-old bull and one ephah of flour and a jug of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh, although the child was young."
1 Samuel,1,25,"Then they slaughtered the bull, and brought the boy to Eli."
1 Samuel,1,26,"She said, “Oh, my lord! As your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you, praying to the LORD."
1 Samuel,1,27,"For this boy I prayed, and the LORD has given me my petition which I asked of Him."
1 Samuel,1,28,So I have also dedicated him to the LORD; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the LORD.” And he worshiped the LORD there.
1 Samuel,2,1,"Then Hannah prayed and said, “My heart exults in the LORD; My horn is exalted in the LORD, My mouth speaks boldly against my enemies, Because I rejoice in Your salvation."
1 Samuel,2,2,"“There is no one holy like the LORD, Indeed, there is no one besides You, Nor is there any rock like our God."
1 Samuel,2,3,"“Boast no more so very proudly, Do not let arrogance come out of your mouth; For the LORD is a God of knowledge, And with Him actions are weighed."
1 Samuel,2,4,"“The bows of the mighty are shattered, But the feeble gird on strength."
1 Samuel,2,5,"“Those who were full hire themselves out for bread, But those who were hungry cease to hunger. Even the barren gives birth to seven, But she who has many children languishes."
1 Samuel,2,6,“The LORD kills and makes alive; He brings down to Sheol and raises up.
1 Samuel,2,7,"“The LORD makes poor and rich; He brings low, He also exalts."
1 Samuel,2,8,"“He raises the poor from the dust, He lifts the needy from the ash heap To make them sit with nobles, And inherit a seat of honor; For the pillars of the earth are the LORD’S, And He set the world on them."
1 Samuel,2,9,"“He keeps the feet of His godly ones, But the wicked ones are silenced in darkness; For not by might shall a man prevail."
1 Samuel,2,10,"“Those who contend with the LORD will be shattered; Against them He will thunder in the heavens, The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; And He will give strength to His king, And will exalt the horn of His anointed.”"
1 Samuel,2,11,Then Elkanah went to his home at Ramah. But the boy ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest.
1 Samuel,2,12,Now the sons of Eli were worthless men; they did not know the LORD
1 Samuel,2,13,"and the custom of the priests with the people. When any man was offering a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand."
1 Samuel,2,14,"Then he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. Thus they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there."
1 Samuel,2,15,"Also, before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the priest meat for roasting, as he will not take boiled meat from you, only raw.”"
1 Samuel,2,16,"If the man said to him, “They must surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as you desire,” then he would say, “No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force.”"
1 Samuel,2,17,"Thus the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD, for the men despised the offering of the LORD."
1 Samuel,2,18,"Now Samuel was ministering before the LORD, as a boy wearing a linen ephod."
1 Samuel,2,19,And his mother would make him a little robe and bring it to him from year to year when she would come up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
1 Samuel,2,20,"Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, “May the LORD give you children from this woman in place of the one she dedicated to the LORD.” And they went to their own home."
1 Samuel,2,21,The LORD visited Hannah; and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew before the LORD.
1 Samuel,2,22,"Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting."
1 Samuel,2,23,"He said to them, “Why do you do such things, the evil things that I hear from all these people?"
1 Samuel,2,24,"No, my sons; for the report is not good which I hear the LORD’S people circulating."
1 Samuel,2,25,"If one man sins against another, God will mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?” But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for the LORD desired to put them to death."
1 Samuel,2,26,Now the boy Samuel was growing in stature and in favor both with the LORD and with men.
1 Samuel,2,27,"Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Did I not indeed reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house?"
1 Samuel,2,28,"Did I not choose them from all the tribes of Israel to be My priests, to go up to My altar, to burn incense, to carry an ephod before Me; and did I not give to the house of your father all the fire offerings of the sons of Israel?"
1 Samuel,2,29,"Why do you kick at My sacrifice and at My offering which I have commanded in My dwelling, and honor your sons above Me, by making yourselves fat with the choicest of every offering of My people Israel?’"
1 Samuel,2,30,"Therefore the LORD God of Israel declares, ‘I did indeed say that your house and the house of your father should walk before Me forever’; but now the LORD declares, ‘Far be it from Me—for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me will be lightly esteemed."
1 Samuel,2,31,"Behold, the days are coming when I will break your strength and the strength of your father’s house so that there will not be an old man in your house."
1 Samuel,2,32,"You will see the distress of My dwelling, in spite of all the good that I do for Israel; and an old man will not be in your house forever."
1 Samuel,2,33,"Yet I will not cut off every man of yours from My altar so that your eyes will fail from weeping and your soul grieve, and all the increase of your house will die in the prime of life."
1 Samuel,2,34,"This will be the sign to you which will come concerning your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: on the same day both of them will die."
1 Samuel,2,35,"But I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who will do according to what is in My heart and in My soul; and I will build him an enduring house, and he will walk before My anointed always."
1 Samuel,2,36,"Everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread and say, “Please assign me to one of the priest’s offices so that I may eat a piece of bread.”’”"
1 Samuel,3,1,"Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the LORD before Eli. And word from the LORD was rare in those days, visions were infrequent."
1 Samuel,3,2,"It happened at that time as Eli was lying down in his place (now his eyesight had begun to grow dim and he could not see well),"
1 Samuel,3,3,"and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD where the ark of God was,"
1 Samuel,3,4,"that the LORD called Samuel; and he said, “Here I am.”"
1 Samuel,3,5,"Then he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, lie down again.” So he went and lay down."
1 Samuel,3,6,"The LORD called yet again, “Samuel!” So Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he answered, “I did not call, my son, lie down again.”"
1 Samuel,3,7,"Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, nor had the word of the LORD yet been revealed to him."
1 Samuel,3,8,"So the LORD called Samuel again for the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli discerned that the LORD was calling the boy."
1 Samuel,3,9,"And Eli said to Samuel, “Go lie down, and it shall be if He calls you, that you shall say, ‘Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place."
1 Samuel,3,10,"Then the LORD came and stood and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, for Your servant is listening.”"
1 Samuel,3,11,"The LORD said to Samuel, “Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which both ears of everyone who hears it will tingle."
1 Samuel,3,12,"In that day I will carry out against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end."
1 Samuel,3,13,"For I have told him that I am about to judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves and he did not rebuke them."
1 Samuel,3,14,Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.”
1 Samuel,3,15,So Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. But Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.
1 Samuel,3,16,"Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” And he said, “Here I am.”"
1 Samuel,3,17,"He said, “What is the word that He spoke to you? Please do not hide it from me. May God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the words that He spoke to you.”"
1 Samuel,3,18,"So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, “It is the LORD; let Him do what seems good to Him.”"
1 Samuel,3,19,Thus Samuel grew and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fail.
1 Samuel,3,20,All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the LORD.
1 Samuel,3,21,"And the LORD appeared again at Shiloh, because the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the LORD."
1 Samuel,4,1,Thus the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped beside Ebenezer while the Philistines camped in Aphek.
1 Samuel,4,2,"The Philistines drew up in battle array to meet Israel. When the battle spread, Israel was defeated before the Philistines who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield."
1 Samuel,4,3,"When the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us take to ourselves from Shiloh the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that it may come among us and deliver us from the power of our enemies.”"
1 Samuel,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh, and from there they carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts who sits above the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God."
1 Samuel,4,5,"As the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth resounded."
1 Samuel,4,6,"When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” Then they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp."
1 Samuel,4,7,"The Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp.” And they said, “Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before."
1 Samuel,4,8,Woe to us! Who shall deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.
1 Samuel,4,9,"Take courage and be men, O Philistines, or you will become slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you; therefore, be men and fight.”"
1 Samuel,4,10,"So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent; and the slaughter was very great, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers."
1 Samuel,4,11,"And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died."
1 Samuel,4,12,Now a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn and dust on his head.
1 Samuel,4,13,"When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road eagerly watching, because his heart was trembling for the ark of God. So the man came to tell it in the city, and all the city cried out."
1 Samuel,4,14,"When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, “What does the noise of this commotion mean?” Then the man came hurriedly and told Eli."
1 Samuel,4,15,"Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were set so that he could not see."
1 Samuel,4,16,"The man said to Eli, “I am the one who came from the battle line. Indeed, I escaped from the battle line today.” And he said, “How did things go, my son?”"
1 Samuel,4,17,"Then the one who brought the news replied, “Israel has fled before the Philistines and there has also been a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been taken.”"
1 Samuel,4,18,"When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell off the seat backward beside the gate, and his neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. Thus he judged Israel forty years."
1 Samuel,4,19,"Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’s wife, was pregnant and about to give birth; and when she heard the news that the ark of God was taken and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she kneeled down and gave birth, for her pains came upon her."
1 Samuel,4,20,"And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, “Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.” But she did not answer or pay attention."
1 Samuel,4,21,"And she called the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel,” because the ark of God was taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband."
1 Samuel,4,22,"She said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God was taken.”"
1 Samuel,5,1,Now the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
1 Samuel,5,2,Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it to the house of Dagon and set it by Dagon.
1 Samuel,5,3,"When the Ashdodites arose early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and set him in his place again."
1 Samuel,5,4,"But when they arose early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. And the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off on the threshold; only the trunk of Dagon was left to him."
1 Samuel,5,5,Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor all who enter Dagon’s house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
1 Samuel,5,6,"Now the hand of the LORD was heavy on the Ashdodites, and He ravaged them and smote them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territories."
1 Samuel,5,7,"When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for His hand is severe on us and on Dagon our god.”"
1 Samuel,5,8,"So they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” And they said, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.” And they brought the ark of the God of Israel around."
1 Samuel,5,9,"After they had brought it around, the hand of the LORD was against the city with very great confusion; and He smote the men of the city, both young and old, so that tumors broke out on them."
1 Samuel,5,10,"So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And as the ark of God came to Ekron the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel around to us, to kill us and our people.”"
1 Samuel,5,11,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, so that it will not kill us and our people.” For there was a deadly confusion throughout the city; the hand of God was very heavy there."
1 Samuel,5,12,And the men who did not die were smitten with tumors and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1 Samuel,6,1,Now the ark of the LORD had been in the country of the Philistines seven months.
1 Samuel,6,2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, “What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how we shall send it to its place.”"
1 Samuel,6,3,"They said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty; but you shall surely return to Him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.”"
1 Samuel,6,4,"Then they said, “What shall be the guilt offering which we shall return to Him?” And they said, “Five golden tumors and five golden mice according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, for one plague was on all of you and on your lords."
1 Samuel,6,5,"So you shall make likenesses of your tumors and likenesses of your mice that ravage the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will ease His hand from you, your gods, and your land."
1 Samuel,6,6,"Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He had severely dealt with them, did they not allow the people to go, and they departed?"
1 Samuel,6,7,"Now therefore, take and prepare a new cart and two milch cows on which there has never been a yoke; and hitch the cows to the cart and take their calves home, away from them."
1 Samuel,6,8,Take the ark of the LORD and place it on the cart; and put the articles of gold which you return to Him as a guilt offering in a box by its side. Then send it away that it may go.
1 Samuel,6,9,"Watch, if it goes up by the way of its own territory to Beth-shemesh, then He has done us this great evil. But if not, then we will know that it was not His hand that struck us; it happened to us by chance.”"
1 Samuel,6,10,"Then the men did so, and took two milch cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home."
1 Samuel,6,11,"They put the ark of the LORD on the cart, and the box with the golden mice and the likenesses of their tumors."
1 Samuel,6,12,"And the cows took the straight way in the direction of Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn aside to the right or to the left. And the lords of the Philistines followed them to the border of Beth-shemesh."
1 Samuel,6,13,"Now the people of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley, and they raised their eyes and saw the ark and were glad to see it."
1 Samuel,6,14,The cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite and stood there where there was a large stone; and they split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.
1 Samuel,6,15,"The Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the box that was with it, in which were the articles of gold, and put them on the large stone; and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices that day to the LORD."
1 Samuel,6,16,"When the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned to Ekron that day."
1 Samuel,6,17,"These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron;"
1 Samuel,6,18,"and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages. The large stone on which they set the ark of the LORD is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite."
1 Samuel,6,19,"He struck down some of the men of Beth-shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the LORD. He struck down of all the people, 50,070 men, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck the people with a great slaughter."
1 Samuel,6,20,"The men of Beth-shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? And to whom shall He go up from us?”"
1 Samuel,6,21,"So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back the ark of the LORD; come down and take it up to you.”"
1 Samuel,7,1,"And the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took the ark of the LORD and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD."
1 Samuel,7,2,"From the day that the ark remained at Kiriath-jearim, the time was long, for it was twenty years; and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD."
1 Samuel,7,3,"Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If you return to the LORD with all your heart, remove the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you and direct your hearts to the LORD and serve Him alone; and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.”"
1 Samuel,7,4,So the sons of Israel removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth and served the LORD alone.
1 Samuel,7,5,"Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah and I will pray to the LORD for you.”"
1 Samuel,7,6,"They gathered to Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day and said there, “We have sinned against the LORD.” And Samuel judged the sons of Israel at Mizpah."
1 Samuel,7,7,"Now when the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel had gathered to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the sons of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines."
1 Samuel,7,8,"Then the sons of Israel said to Samuel, “Do not cease to cry to the LORD our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines.”"
1 Samuel,7,9,Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it for a whole burnt offering to the LORD; and Samuel cried to the LORD for Israel and the LORD answered him.
1 Samuel,7,10,"Now Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, and the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day against the Philistines and confused them, so that they were routed before Israel."
1 Samuel,7,11,"The men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them down as far as below Beth-car."
1 Samuel,7,12,"Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and named it Ebenezer, saying, “Thus far the LORD has helped us.”"
1 Samuel,7,13,So the Philistines were subdued and they did not come anymore within the border of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
1 Samuel,7,14,"The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel delivered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. So there was peace between Israel and the Amorites."
1 Samuel,7,15,Now Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
1 Samuel,7,16,"He used to go annually on circuit to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all these places."
1 Samuel,7,17,"Then his return was to Ramah, for his house was there, and there he judged Israel; and he built there an altar to the LORD."
1 Samuel,8,1,And it came about when Samuel was old that he appointed his sons judges over Israel.
1 Samuel,8,2,"Now the name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judging in Beersheba."
1 Samuel,8,3,"His sons, however, did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after dishonest gain and took bribes and perverted justice."
1 Samuel,8,4,Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah;
1 Samuel,8,5,"and they said to him, “Behold, you have grown old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint a king for us to judge us like all the nations.”"
1 Samuel,8,6,"But the thing was displeasing in the sight of Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” And Samuel prayed to the LORD."
1 Samuel,8,7,"The LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in regard to all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from being king over them."
1 Samuel,8,8,Like all the deeds which they have done since the day that I brought them up from Egypt even to this day—in that they have forsaken Me and served other gods—so they are doing to you also.
1 Samuel,8,9,"Now then, listen to their voice; however, you shall solemnly warn them and tell them of the procedure of the king who will reign over them.”"
1 Samuel,8,10,So Samuel spoke all the words of the LORD to the people who had asked of him a king.
1 Samuel,8,11,"He said, “This will be the procedure of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and place them for himself in his chariots and among his horsemen and they will run before his chariots."
1 Samuel,8,12,"He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and of fifties, and some to do his plowing and to reap his harvest and to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots."
1 Samuel,8,13,He will also take your daughters for perfumers and cooks and bakers.
1 Samuel,8,14,He will take the best of your fields and your vineyards and your olive groves and give them to his servants.
1 Samuel,8,15,He will take a tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants.
1 Samuel,8,16,He will also take your male servants and your female servants and your best young men and your donkeys and use them for his work.
1 Samuel,8,17,"He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his servants."
1 Samuel,8,18,"Then you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the LORD will not answer you in that day.”"
1 Samuel,8,19,"Nevertheless, the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and they said, “No, but there shall be a king over us,"
1 Samuel,8,20,"that we also may be like all the nations, that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.”"
1 Samuel,8,21,"Now after Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the LORD’S hearing."
1 Samuel,8,22,"The LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice and appoint them a king.” So Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Go every man to his city.”"
1 Samuel,9,1,"Now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor."
1 Samuel,9,2,"He had a son whose name was Saul, a choice and handsome man, and there was not a more handsome person than he among the sons of Israel; from his shoulders and up he was taller than any of the people."
1 Samuel,9,3,"Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. So Kish said to his son Saul, “Take now with you one of the servants, and arise, go search for the donkeys.”"
1 Samuel,9,4,"He passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them."
1 Samuel,9,5,"When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, and let us return, or else my father will cease to be concerned about the donkeys and will become anxious for us.”"
1 Samuel,9,6,"He said to him, “Behold now, there is a man of God in this city, and the man is held in honor; all that he says surely comes true. Now let us go there, perhaps he can tell us about our journey on which we have set out.”"
1 Samuel,9,7,"Then Saul said to his servant, “But behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is gone from our sack and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?”"
1 Samuel,9,8,"The servant answered Saul again and said, “Behold, I have in my hand a fourth of a shekel of silver; I will give it to the man of God and he will tell us our way.”"
1 Samuel,9,9,"(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he used to say, “Come, and let us go to the seer”; for he who is called a prophet now was formerly called a seer.)"
1 Samuel,9,10,"Then Saul said to his servant, “Well said; come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was."
1 Samuel,9,11,"As they went up the slope to the city, they found young women going out to draw water and said to them, “Is the seer here?”"
1 Samuel,9,12,"They answered them and said, “He is; see, he is ahead of you. Hurry now, for he has come into the city today, for the people have a sacrifice on the high place today."
1 Samuel,9,13,"As soon as you enter the city you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat, for the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now therefore, go up for you will find him at once.”"
1 Samuel,9,14,"So they went up to the city. As they came into the city, behold, Samuel was coming out toward them to go up to the high place."
1 Samuel,9,15,"Now a day before Saul’s coming, the LORD had revealed this to Samuel saying,"
1 Samuel,9,16,"“About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over My people Israel; and he will deliver My people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have regarded My people, because their cry has come to Me.”"
1 Samuel,9,17,"When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, “Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! This one shall rule over My people.”"
1 Samuel,9,18,"Then Saul approached Samuel in the gate and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.”"
1 Samuel,9,19,"Samuel answered Saul and said, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is on your mind."
1 Samuel,9,20,"As for your donkeys which were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them, for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father’s household?”"
1 Samuel,9,21,"Saul replied, “Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak to me in this way?”"
1 Samuel,9,22,"Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the head of those who were invited, who were about thirty men."
1 Samuel,9,23,"Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion that I gave you, concerning which I said to you, ‘Set it aside.’”"
1 Samuel,9,24,"Then the cook took up the leg with what was on it and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, “Here is what has been reserved! Set it before you and eat, because it has been kept for you until the appointed time, since I said I have invited the people.” So Saul ate with Samuel that day."
1 Samuel,9,25,"When they came down from the high place into the city, Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof."
1 Samuel,9,26,"And they arose early; and at daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, “Get up, that I may send you away.” So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went out into the street."
1 Samuel,9,27,"As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Say to the servant that he might go ahead of us and pass on, but you remain standing now, that I may proclaim the word of God to you.”"
1 Samuel,10,1,"Then Samuel took the flask of oil, poured it on his head, kissed him and said, “Has not the LORD anointed you a ruler over His inheritance?"
1 Samuel,10,2,"When you go from me today, then you will find two men close to Rachel’s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, ‘The donkeys which you went to look for have been found. Now behold, your father has ceased to be concerned about the donkeys and is anxious for you, saying, “What shall I do about my son?”’"
1 Samuel,10,3,"Then you will go on further from there, and you will come as far as the oak of Tabor, and there three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a jug of wine;"
1 Samuel,10,4,"and they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from their hand."
1 Samuel,10,5,"Afterward you will come to the hill of God where the Philistine garrison is; and it shall be as soon as you have come there to the city, that you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and a lyre before them, and they will be prophesying."
1 Samuel,10,6,"Then the Spirit of the LORD will come upon you mightily, and you shall prophesy with them and be changed into another man."
1 Samuel,10,7,"It shall be when these signs come to you, do for yourself what the occasion requires, for God is with you."
1 Samuel,10,8,"And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice peace offerings. You shall wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you should do.”"
1 Samuel,10,9,"Then it happened when he turned his back to leave Samuel, God changed his heart; and all those signs came about on that day."
1 Samuel,10,10,"When they came to the hill there, behold, a group of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him mightily, so that he prophesied among them."
1 Samuel,10,11,"It came about, when all who knew him previously saw that he prophesied now with the prophets, that the people said to one another, “What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”"
1 Samuel,10,12,"A man there said, “Now, who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb: “Is Saul also among the prophets?”"
1 Samuel,10,13,"When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place."
1 Samuel,10,14,"Now Saul’s uncle said to him and his servant, “Where did you go?” And he said, “To look for the donkeys. When we saw that they could not be found, we went to Samuel.”"
1 Samuel,10,15,"Saul’s uncle said, “Please tell me what Samuel said to you.”"
1 Samuel,10,16,"So Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingdom which Samuel had mentioned."
1 Samuel,10,17,Thereafter Samuel called the people together to the LORD at Mizpah;
1 Samuel,10,18,"and he said to the sons of Israel, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘I brought Israel up from Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the power of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.’"
1 Samuel,10,19,"But you have today rejected your God, who delivers you from all your calamities and your distresses; yet you have said, ‘No, but set a king over us!’ Now therefore, present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your clans.”"
1 Samuel,10,20,"Thus Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot."
1 Samuel,10,21,"Then he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its families, and the Matrite family was taken. And Saul the son of Kish was taken; but when they looked for him, he could not be found."
1 Samuel,10,22,"Therefore they inquired further of the LORD, “Has the man come here yet?” So the LORD said, “Behold, he is hiding himself by the baggage.”"
1 Samuel,10,23,"So they ran and took him from there, and when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward."
1 Samuel,10,24,"Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen? Surely there is no one like him among all the people.” So all the people shouted and said, “Long live the king!”"
1 Samuel,10,25,"Then Samuel told the people the ordinances of the kingdom, and wrote them in the book and placed it before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, each one to his house."
1 Samuel,10,26,Saul also went to his house at Gibeah; and the valiant men whose hearts God had touched went with him.
1 Samuel,10,27,"But certain worthless men said, “How can this one deliver us?” And they despised him and did not bring him any present. But he kept silent."
1 Samuel,11,1,"Now Nahash the Ammonite came up and besieged Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a covenant with us and we will serve you.”"
1 Samuel,11,2,"But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “I will make it with you on this condition, that I will gouge out the right eye of every one of you, thus I will make it a reproach on all Israel.”"
1 Samuel,11,3,"The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Let us alone for seven days, that we may send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to deliver us, we will come out to you.”"
1 Samuel,11,4,"Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and spoke these words in the hearing of the people, and all the people lifted up their voices and wept."
1 Samuel,11,5,"Now behold, Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen, and he said, “What is the matter with the people that they weep?” So they related to him the words of the men of Jabesh."
1 Samuel,11,6,"Then the Spirit of God came upon Saul mightily when he heard these words, and he became very angry."
1 Samuel,11,7,"He took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever does not come out after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.” Then the dread of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out as one man."
1 Samuel,11,8,"He numbered them in Bezek; and the sons of Israel were 300,000, and the men of Judah 30,000."
1 Samuel,11,9,"They said to the messengers who had come, “Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you will have deliverance.’” So the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad."
1 Samuel,11,10,"Then the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.”"
1 Samuel,11,11,"The next morning Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp at the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together."
1 Samuel,11,12,"Then the people said to Samuel, “Who is he that said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Bring the men, that we may put them to death.”"
1 Samuel,11,13,"But Saul said, “Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has accomplished deliverance in Israel.”"
1 Samuel,11,14,"Then Samuel said to the people, “Come and let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there.”"
1 Samuel,11,15,"So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. There they also offered sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly."
1 Samuel,12,1,"Then Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me and I have appointed a king over you."
1 Samuel,12,2,"Now, here is the king walking before you, but I am old and gray, and behold my sons are with you. And I have walked before you from my youth even to this day."
1 Samuel,12,3,"Here I am; bear witness against me before the LORD and His anointed. Whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken, or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed, or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? I will restore it to you.”"
1 Samuel,12,4,"They said, “You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from any man’s hand.”"
1 Samuel,12,5,"He said to them, “The LORD is witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day that you have found nothing in my hand.” And they said, “He is witness.”"
1 Samuel,12,6,"Then Samuel said to the people, “It is the LORD who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt."
1 Samuel,12,7,"So now, take your stand, that I may plead with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous acts of the LORD which He did for you and your fathers."
1 Samuel,12,8,"When Jacob went into Egypt and your fathers cried out to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron who brought your fathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place."
1 Samuel,12,9,"But they forgot the LORD their God, so He sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them."
1 Samuel,12,10,"They cried out to the LORD and said, ‘We have sinned because we have forsaken the LORD and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth; but now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve You.’"
1 Samuel,12,11,"Then the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and delivered you from the hands of your enemies all around, so that you lived in security."
1 Samuel,12,12,"When you saw that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us,’ although the LORD your God was your king."
1 Samuel,12,13,"Now therefore, here is the king whom you have chosen, whom you have asked for, and behold, the LORD has set a king over you."
1 Samuel,12,14,"If you will fear the LORD and serve Him, and listen to His voice and not rebel against the command of the LORD, then both you and also the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God."
1 Samuel,12,15,"If you will not listen to the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the command of the LORD, then the hand of the LORD will be against you, as it was against your fathers."
1 Samuel,12,16,"Even now, take your stand and see this great thing which the LORD will do before your eyes."
1 Samuel,12,17,"Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call to the LORD, that He may send thunder and rain. Then you will know and see that your wickedness is great which you have done in the sight of the LORD by asking for yourselves a king.”"
1 Samuel,12,18,"So Samuel called to the LORD, and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel."
1 Samuel,12,19,"Then all the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, so that we may not die, for we have added to all our sins this evil by asking for ourselves a king.”"
1 Samuel,12,20,"Samuel said to the people, “Do not fear. You have committed all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart."
1 Samuel,12,21,"You must not turn aside, for then you would go after futile things which can not profit or deliver, because they are futile."
1 Samuel,12,22,"For the LORD will not abandon His people on account of His great name, because the LORD has been pleased to make you a people for Himself."
1 Samuel,12,23,"Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and right way."
1 Samuel,12,24,Only fear the LORD and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things He has done for you.
1 Samuel,12,25,"But if you still do wickedly, both you and your king will be swept away.”"
1 Samuel,13,1,"Saul was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty two years over Israel."
1 Samuel,13,2,"Now Saul chose for himself 3,000 men of Israel, of which 2,000 were with Saul in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, while 1,000 were with Jonathan at Gibeah of Benjamin. But he sent away the rest of the people, each to his tent."
1 Samuel,13,3,"Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear.”"
1 Samuel,13,4,"All Israel heard the news that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become odious to the Philistines. The people were then summoned to Saul at Gilgal."
1 Samuel,13,5,"Now the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and people like the sand which is on the seashore in abundance; and they came up and camped in Michmash, east of Beth-aven."
1 Samuel,13,6,"When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were hard-pressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, in thickets, in cliffs, in cellars, and in pits."
1 Samuel,13,7,"Also some of the Hebrews crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. But as for Saul, he was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling."
1 Samuel,13,8,"Now he waited seven days, according to the appointed time set by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattering from him."
1 Samuel,13,9,"So Saul said, “Bring to me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.” And he offered the burnt offering."
1 Samuel,13,10,"As soon as he finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him and to greet him."
1 Samuel,13,11,"But Samuel said, “What have you done?” And Saul said, “Because I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the appointed days, and that the Philistines were assembling at Michmash,"
1 Samuel,13,12,"therefore I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not asked the favor of the LORD.’ So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering.”"
1 Samuel,13,13,"Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, for now the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever."
1 Samuel,13,14,"But now your kingdom shall not endure. The LORD has sought out for Himself a man after His own heart, and the LORD has appointed him as ruler over His people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you.”"
1 Samuel,13,15,"Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men."
1 Samuel,13,16,Now Saul and his son Jonathan and the people who were present with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin while the Philistines camped at Michmash.
1 Samuel,13,17,"And the raiders came from the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual,"
1 Samuel,13,18,"and another company turned toward Beth-horon, and another company turned toward the border which overlooks the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness."
1 Samuel,13,19,"Now no blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears.”"
1 Samuel,13,20,"So all Israel went down to the Philistines, each to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, and his hoe."
1 Samuel,13,21,"The charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to fix the hoes."
1 Samuel,13,22,"So it came about on the day of battle that neither sword nor spear was found in the hands of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan, but they were found with Saul and his son Jonathan."
1 Samuel,13,23,And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
1 Samuel,14,1,"Now the day came that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man who was carrying his armor, “Come and let us cross over to the Philistines’ garrison that is on the other side.” But he did not tell his father."
1 Samuel,14,2,"Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron. And the people who were with him were about six hundred men,"
1 Samuel,14,3,"and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the LORD at Shiloh, was wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone."
1 Samuel,14,4,"Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to cross over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a sharp crag on the one side and a sharp crag on the other side, and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh."
1 Samuel,14,5,"The one crag rose on the north opposite Michmash, and the other on the south opposite Geba."
1 Samuel,14,6,"Then Jonathan said to the young man who was carrying his armor, “Come and let us cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; perhaps the LORD will work for us, for the LORD is not restrained to save by many or by few.”"
1 Samuel,14,7,"His armor bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart; turn yourself, and here I am with you according to your desire.”"
1 Samuel,14,8,"Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will cross over to the men and reveal ourselves to them."
1 Samuel,14,9,"If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you’; then we will stand in our place and not go up to them."
1 Samuel,14,10,"But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for the LORD has given them into our hands; and this shall be the sign to us.”"
1 Samuel,14,11,"When both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines said, “Behold, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.”"
1 Samuel,14,12,"So the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor bearer and said, “Come up to us and we will tell you something.” And Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come up after me, for the LORD has given them into the hands of Israel.”"
1 Samuel,14,13,"Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, with his armor bearer behind him; and they fell before Jonathan, and his armor bearer put some to death after him."
1 Samuel,14,14,That first slaughter which Jonathan and his armor bearer made was about twenty men within about half a furrow in an acre of land.
1 Samuel,14,15,"And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. Even the garrison and the raiders trembled, and the earth quaked so that it became a great trembling."
1 Samuel,14,16,"Now Saul’s watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude melted away; and they went here and there."
1 Samuel,14,17,"Saul said to the people who were with him, “Number now and see who has gone from us.” And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there."
1 Samuel,14,18,"Then Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.” For the ark of God was at that time with the sons of Israel."
1 Samuel,14,19,"While Saul talked to the priest, the commotion in the camp of the Philistines continued and increased; so Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”"
1 Samuel,14,20,"Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and came to the battle; and behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion."
1 Samuel,14,21,"Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines previously, who went up with them all around in the camp, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan."
1 Samuel,14,22,"When all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, even they also pursued them closely in the battle."
1 Samuel,14,23,"So the LORD delivered Israel that day, and the battle spread beyond Beth-aven."
1 Samuel,14,24,"Now the men of Israel were hard-pressed on that day, for Saul had put the people under oath, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats food before evening, and until I have avenged myself on my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food."
1 Samuel,14,25,"All the people of the land entered the forest, and there was honey on the ground."
1 Samuel,14,26,"When the people entered the forest, behold, there was a flow of honey; but no man put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath."
1 Samuel,14,27,"But Jonathan had not heard when his father put the people under oath; therefore, he put out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened."
1 Samuel,14,28,"Then one of the people said, “Your father strictly put the people under oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food today.’” And the people were weary."
1 Samuel,14,29,"Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. See now, how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey."
1 Samuel,14,30,"How much more, if only the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found! For now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great.”"
1 Samuel,14,31,They struck among the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very weary.
1 Samuel,14,32,"The people rushed greedily upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood."
1 Samuel,14,33,"Then they told Saul, saying, “Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood.” And he said, “You have acted treacherously; roll a great stone to me today.”"
1 Samuel,14,34,"Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, ‘Each one of you bring me his ox or his sheep, and slaughter it here and eat; and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.’” So all the people that night brought each one his ox with him and slaughtered it there."
1 Samuel,14,35,And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.
1 Samuel,14,36,"Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” So the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.”"
1 Samuel,14,37,"Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You give them into the hand of Israel?” But He did not answer him on that day."
1 Samuel,14,38,"Saul said, “Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people, and investigate and see how this sin has happened today."
1 Samuel,14,39,"For as the LORD lives, who delivers Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But not one of all the people answered him."
1 Samuel,14,40,"Then he said to all Israel, “You shall be on one side and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”"
1 Samuel,14,41,"Therefore, Saul said to the LORD, the God of Israel, “Give a perfect lot.” And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped."
1 Samuel,14,42,"Saul said, “Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.” And Jonathan was taken."
1 Samuel,14,43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” So Jonathan told him and said, “I indeed tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am, I must die!”"
1 Samuel,14,44,"Saul said, “May God do this to me and more also, for you shall surely die, Jonathan.”"
1 Samuel,14,45,"But the people said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die, who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the people rescued Jonathan and he did not die."
1 Samuel,14,46,"Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place."
1 Samuel,14,47,"Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, the sons of Ammon, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines; and wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment."
1 Samuel,14,48,"He acted valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of those who plundered them."
1 Samuel,14,49,Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishvi and Malchi-shua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab and the name of the younger Michal.
1 Samuel,14,50,"The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle."
1 Samuel,14,51,"Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel."
1 Samuel,14,52,"Now the war against the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man or any valiant man, he attached him to his staff."
1 Samuel,15,1,"Then Samuel said to Saul, “The LORD sent me to anoint you as king over His people, over Israel; now therefore, listen to the words of the LORD."
1 Samuel,15,2,"Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel, how he set himself against him on the way while he was coming up from Egypt."
1 Samuel,15,3,"Now go and strike Amalek and utterly destroy all that he has, and do not spare him; but put to death both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’”"
1 Samuel,15,4,"Then Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim, 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah."
1 Samuel,15,5,Saul came to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the valley.
1 Samuel,15,6,"Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, so that I do not destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the sons of Israel when they came up from Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites."
1 Samuel,15,7,"So Saul defeated the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, which is east of Egypt."
1 Samuel,15,8,"He captured Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword."
1 Samuel,15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was good, and were not willing to destroy them utterly; but everything despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed."
1 Samuel,15,10,"Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel, saying,"
1 Samuel,15,11,"“I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following Me and has not carried out My commands.” And Samuel was distressed and cried out to the LORD all night."
1 Samuel,15,12,"Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul; and it was told Samuel, saying, “Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, then turned and proceeded on down to Gilgal.”"
1 Samuel,15,13,"Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, “Blessed are you of the LORD! I have carried out the command of the LORD.”"
1 Samuel,15,14,"But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?”"
1 Samuel,15,15,"Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD your God; but the rest we have utterly destroyed.”"
1 Samuel,15,16,"Then Samuel said to Saul, “Wait, and let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night.” And he said to him, “Speak!”"
1 Samuel,15,17,"Samuel said, “Is it not true, though you were little in your own eyes, you were made the head of the tribes of Israel? And the LORD anointed you king over Israel,"
1 Samuel,15,18,"and the LORD sent you on a mission, and said, ‘Go and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are exterminated.’"
1 Samuel,15,19,"Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD, but rushed upon the spoil and did what was evil in the sight of the LORD?”"
1 Samuel,15,20,"Then Saul said to Samuel, “I did obey the voice of the LORD, and went on the mission on which the LORD sent me, and have brought back Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites."
1 Samuel,15,21,"But the people took some of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the choicest of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the LORD your God at Gilgal.”"
1 Samuel,15,22,"Samuel said, “Has the LORD as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices As in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, And to heed than the fat of rams."
1 Samuel,15,23,"“For rebellion is as the sin of divination, And insubordination is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He has also rejected you from being king.”"
1 Samuel,15,24,"Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; I have indeed transgressed the command of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and listened to their voice."
1 Samuel,15,25,"Now therefore, please pardon my sin and return with me, that I may worship the LORD.”"
1 Samuel,15,26,"But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.”"
1 Samuel,15,27,"As Samuel turned to go, Saul seized the edge of his robe, and it tore."
1 Samuel,15,28,"So Samuel said to him, “The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to your neighbor, who is better than you."
1 Samuel,15,29,Also the Glory of Israel will not lie or change His mind; for He is not a man that He should change His mind.”
1 Samuel,15,30,"Then he said, “I have sinned; but please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and go back with me, that I may worship the LORD your God.”"
1 Samuel,15,31,"So Samuel went back following Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD."
1 Samuel,15,32,"Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag, the king of the Amalekites.” And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”"
1 Samuel,15,33,"But Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.” And Samuel hewed Agag to pieces before the LORD at Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,34,"Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul."
1 Samuel,15,35,Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death; for Samuel grieved over Saul. And the LORD regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel.
1 Samuel,16,1,"Now the LORD said to Samuel, “How long will you grieve over Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have selected a king for Myself among his sons.”"
1 Samuel,16,2,"But Samuel said, “How can I go? When Saul hears of it, he will kill me.” And the LORD said, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’"
1 Samuel,16,3,"You shall invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for Me the one whom I designate to you.”"
1 Samuel,16,4,"So Samuel did what the LORD said, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and said, “Do you come in peace?”"
1 Samuel,16,5,"He said, “In peace; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” He also consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice."
1 Samuel,16,6,"When they entered, he looked at Eliab and thought, “Surely the LORD’S anointed is before Him.”"
1 Samuel,16,7,"But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for God sees not as man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.”"
1 Samuel,16,8,"Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, “The LORD has not chosen this one either.”"
1 Samuel,16,9,"Next Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “The LORD has not chosen this one either.”"
1 Samuel,16,10,"Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, “The LORD has not chosen these.”"
1 Samuel,16,11,"And Samuel said to Jesse, “Are these all the children?” And he said, “There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is tending the sheep.” Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.”"
1 Samuel,16,12,"So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. And the LORD said, “Arise, anoint him; for this is he.”"
1 Samuel,16,13,Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Ramah.
1 Samuel,16,14,"Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD terrorized him."
1 Samuel,16,15,"Saul’s servants then said to him, “Behold now, an evil spirit from God is terrorizing you."
1 Samuel,16,16,"Let our lord now command your servants who are before you. Let them seek a man who is a skillful player on the harp; and it shall come about when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play the harp with his hand, and you will be well.”"
1 Samuel,16,17,"So Saul said to his servants, “Provide for me now a man who can play well and bring him to me.”"
1 Samuel,16,18,"Then one of the young men said, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is a skillful musician, a mighty man of valor, a warrior, one prudent in speech, and a handsome man; and the LORD is with him.”"
1 Samuel,16,19,"So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David who is with the flock.”"
1 Samuel,16,20,"Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread and a jug of wine and a young goat, and sent them to Saul by David his son."
1 Samuel,16,21,"Then David came to Saul and attended him; and Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor bearer."
1 Samuel,16,22,"Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Let David now stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight.”"
1 Samuel,16,23,"So it came about whenever the evil spirit from God came to Saul, David would take the harp and play it with his hand; and Saul would be refreshed and be well, and the evil spirit would depart from him."
1 Samuel,17,1,"Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle; and they were gathered at Socoh which belongs to Judah, and they camped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim."
1 Samuel,17,2,"Saul and the men of Israel were gathered and camped in the valley of Elah, and drew up in battle array to encounter the Philistines."
1 Samuel,17,3,"The Philistines stood on the mountain on one side while Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them."
1 Samuel,17,4,"Then a champion came out from the armies of the Philistines named Goliath, from Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span."
1 Samuel,17,5,"He had a bronze helmet on his head, and he was clothed with scale-armor which weighed five thousand shekels of bronze."
1 Samuel,17,6,He also had bronze greaves on his legs and a bronze javelin slung between his shoulders.
1 Samuel,17,7,"The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and the head of his spear weighed six hundred shekels of iron; his shield-carrier also walked before him."
1 Samuel,17,8,"He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel and said to them, “Why do you come out to draw up in battle array? Am I not the Philistine and you servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me."
1 Samuel,17,9,"If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will become your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall become our servants and serve us.”"
1 Samuel,17,10,"Again the Philistine said, “I defy the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man that we may fight together.”"
1 Samuel,17,11,"When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid."
1 Samuel,17,12,"Now David was the son of the Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse, and he had eight sons. And Jesse was old in the days of Saul, advanced in years among men."
1 Samuel,17,13,"The three older sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and the second to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah."
1 Samuel,17,14,"David was the youngest. Now the three oldest followed Saul,"
1 Samuel,17,15,but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s flock at Bethlehem.
1 Samuel,17,16,The Philistine came forward morning and evening for forty days and took his stand.
1 Samuel,17,17,"Then Jesse said to David his son, “Take now for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves and run to the camp to your brothers."
1 Samuel,17,18,"Bring also these ten cuts of cheese to the commander of their thousand, and look into the welfare of your brothers, and bring back news of them."
1 Samuel,17,19,"For Saul and they and all the men of Israel are in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.”"
1 Samuel,17,20,So David arose early in the morning and left the flock with a keeper and took the supplies and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the circle of the camp while the army was going out in battle array shouting the war cry.
1 Samuel,17,21,"Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle array, army against army."
1 Samuel,17,22,"Then David left his baggage in the care of the baggage keeper, and ran to the battle line and entered in order to greet his brothers."
1 Samuel,17,23,"As he was talking with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine from Gath named Goliath, was coming up from the army of the Philistines, and he spoke these same words; and David heard them."
1 Samuel,17,24,"When all the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from him and were greatly afraid."
1 Samuel,17,25,"The men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who is coming up? Surely he is coming up to defy Israel. And it will be that the king will enrich the man who kills him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father’s house free in Israel.”"
1 Samuel,17,26,"Then David spoke to the men who were standing by him, saying, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should taunt the armies of the living God?”"
1 Samuel,17,27,"The people answered him in accord with this word, saying, “Thus it will be done for the man who kills him.”"
1 Samuel,17,28,"Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger burned against David and he said, “Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your insolence and the wickedness of your heart; for you have come down in order to see the battle.”"
1 Samuel,17,29,"But David said, “What have I done now? Was it not just a question?”"
1 Samuel,17,30,Then he turned away from him to another and said the same thing; and the people answered the same thing as before.
1 Samuel,17,31,"When the words which David spoke were heard, they told them to Saul, and he sent for him."
1 Samuel,17,32,"David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail on account of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.”"
1 Samuel,17,33,"Then Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth while he has been a warrior from his youth.”"
1 Samuel,17,34,"But David said to Saul, “Your servant was tending his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock,"
1 Samuel,17,35,"I went out after him and attacked him, and rescued it from his mouth; and when he rose up against me, I seized him by his beard and struck him and killed him."
1 Samuel,17,36,"Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has taunted the armies of the living God.”"
1 Samuel,17,37,"And David said, “The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” And Saul said to David, “Go, and may the LORD be with you.”"
1 Samuel,17,38,"Then Saul clothed David with his garments and put a bronze helmet on his head, and he clothed him with armor."
1 Samuel,17,39,"David girded his sword over his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested them. So David said to Saul, “I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them.” And David took them off."
1 Samuel,17,40,"He took his stick in his hand and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in the shepherd’s bag which he had, even in his pouch, and his sling was in his hand; and he approached the Philistine."
1 Samuel,17,41,"Then the Philistine came on and approached David, with the shield-bearer in front of him."
1 Samuel,17,42,"When the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, with a handsome appearance."
1 Samuel,17,43,"The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods."
1 Samuel,17,44,"The Philistine also said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field.”"
1 Samuel,17,45,"Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have taunted."
1 Samuel,17,46,"This day the LORD will deliver you up into my hands, and I will strike you down and remove your head from you. And I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,"
1 Samuel,17,47,and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD’S and He will give you into our hands.”
1 Samuel,17,48,"Then it happened when the Philistine rose and came and drew near to meet David, that David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine."
1 Samuel,17,49,"And David put his hand into his bag and took from it a stone and slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead. And the stone sank into his forehead, so that he fell on his face to the ground."
1 Samuel,17,50,"Thus David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and he struck the Philistine and killed him; but there was no sword in David’s hand."
1 Samuel,17,51,"Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled."
1 Samuel,17,52,"The men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted and pursued the Philistines as far as the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the slain Philistines lay along the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath and Ekron."
1 Samuel,17,53,The sons of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines and plundered their camps.
1 Samuel,17,54,"Then David took the Philistine’s head and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent."
1 Samuel,17,55,"Now when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this young man?” And Abner said, “By your life, O king, I do not know.”"
1 Samuel,17,56,"The king said, “You inquire whose son the youth is.”"
1 Samuel,17,57,"So when David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the Philistine’s head in his hand."
1 Samuel,17,58,"Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” And David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”"
1 Samuel,18,1,"Now it came about when he had finished speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as himself."
1 Samuel,18,2,Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father’s house.
1 Samuel,18,3,Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.
1 Samuel,18,4,"Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his armor, including his sword and his bow and his belt."
1 Samuel,18,5,"So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and prospered; and Saul set him over the men of war. And it was pleasing in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul’s servants."
1 Samuel,18,6,"It happened as they were coming, when David returned from killing the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy and with musical instruments."
1 Samuel,18,7,"The women sang as they played, and said, “Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.”"
1 Samuel,18,8,"Then Saul became very angry, for this saying displeased him; and he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, but to me they have ascribed thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?”"
1 Samuel,18,9,Saul looked at David with suspicion from that day on.
1 Samuel,18,10,"Now it came about on the next day that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the house, while David was playing the harp with his hand, as usual; and a spear was in Saul’s hand."
1 Samuel,18,11,"Saul hurled the spear for he thought, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David escaped from his presence twice."
1 Samuel,18,12,"Now Saul was afraid of David, for the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul."
1 Samuel,18,13,Therefore Saul removed him from his presence and appointed him as his commander of a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
1 Samuel,18,14,David was prospering in all his ways for the LORD was with him.
1 Samuel,18,15,"When Saul saw that he was prospering greatly, he dreaded him."
1 Samuel,18,16,"But all Israel and Judah loved David, and he went out and came in before them."
1 Samuel,18,17,"Then Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife, only be a valiant man for me and fight the LORD’S battles.” For Saul thought, “My hand shall not be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.”"
1 Samuel,18,18,"But David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my life or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be the king’s son-in-law?”"
1 Samuel,18,19,"So it came about at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife."
1 Samuel,18,20,"Now Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David. When they told Saul, the thing was agreeable to him."
1 Samuel,18,21,"Saul thought, “I will give her to him that she may become a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” Therefore Saul said to David, “For a second time you may be my son-in-law today.”"
1 Samuel,18,22,"Then Saul commanded his servants, “Speak to David secretly, saying, ‘Behold, the king delights in you, and all his servants love you; now therefore, become the king’s son-in-law.’”"
1 Samuel,18,23,"So Saul’s servants spoke these words to David. But David said, “Is it trivial in your sight to become the king’s son-in-law, since I am a poor man and lightly esteemed?”"
1 Samuel,18,24,The servants of Saul reported to him according to these words which David spoke.
1 Samuel,18,25,"Saul then said, “Thus you shall say to David, ‘The king does not desire any dowry except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the king’s enemies.’” Now Saul planned to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines."
1 Samuel,18,26,"When his servants told David these words, it pleased David to become the king’s son-in-law. Before the days had expired"
1 Samuel,18,27,"David rose up and went, he and his men, and struck down two hundred men among the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might become the king’s son-in-law. So Saul gave him Michal his daughter for a wife."
1 Samuel,18,28,"When Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him,"
1 Samuel,18,29,then Saul was even more afraid of David. Thus Saul was David’s enemy continually.
1 Samuel,18,30,"Then the commanders of the Philistines went out to battle, and it happened as often as they went out, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul. So his name was highly esteemed."
1 Samuel,19,1,"Now Saul told Jonathan his son and all his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, greatly delighted in David."
1 Samuel,19,2,"So Jonathan told David saying, “Saul my father is seeking to put you to death. Now therefore, please be on guard in the morning, and stay in a secret place and hide yourself."
1 Samuel,19,3,"I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak with my father about you; if I find out anything, then I will tell you.”"
1 Samuel,19,4,"Then Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, “Do not let the king sin against his servant David, since he has not sinned against you, and since his deeds have been very beneficial to you."
1 Samuel,19,5,"For he took his life in his hand and struck the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great deliverance for all Israel; you saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood by putting David to death without a cause?”"
1 Samuel,19,6,"Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul vowed, “As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death.”"
1 Samuel,19,7,"Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these words. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as formerly."
1 Samuel,19,8,"When there was war again, David went out and fought with the Philistines and defeated them with great slaughter, so that they fled before him."
1 Samuel,19,9,"Now there was an evil spirit from the LORD on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing the harp with his hand."
1 Samuel,19,10,"Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, so that he stuck the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night."
1 Samuel,19,11,"Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him, in order to put him to death in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be put to death.”"
1 Samuel,19,12,"So Michal let David down through a window, and he went out and fled and escaped."
1 Samuel,19,13,"Michal took the household idol and laid it on the bed, and put a quilt of goats’ hair at its head, and covered it with clothes."
1 Samuel,19,14,"When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.”"
1 Samuel,19,15,"Then Saul sent messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me on his bed, that I may put him to death.”"
1 Samuel,19,16,"When the messengers entered, behold, the household idol was on the bed with the quilt of goats’ hair at its head."
1 Samuel,19,17,"So Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?” And Michal said to Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I put you to death?’”"
1 Samuel,19,18,"Now David fled and escaped and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth."
1 Samuel,19,19,"It was told Saul, saying, “Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.”"
1 Samuel,19,20,"Then Saul sent messengers to take David, but when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing and presiding over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul; and they also prophesied."
1 Samuel,19,21,"When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. So Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied."
1 Samuel,19,22,"Then he himself went to Ramah and came as far as the large well that is in Secu; and he asked and said, “Where are Samuel and David?” And someone said, “Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.”"
1 Samuel,19,23,"He proceeded there to Naioth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him also, so that he went along prophesying continually until he came to Naioth in Ramah."
1 Samuel,19,24,"He also stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”"
1 Samuel,20,1,"Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said to Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my iniquity? And what is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life?”"
1 Samuel,20,2,"He said to him, “Far from it, you shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me. So why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so!”"
1 Samuel,20,3,"Yet David vowed again, saying, “Your father knows well that I have found favor in your sight, and he has said, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, or he will be grieved.’ But truly as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, there is hardly a step between me and death.”"
1 Samuel,20,4,"Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.”"
1 Samuel,20,5,"So David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I ought to sit down to eat with the king. But let me go, that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening."
1 Samuel,20,6,"If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city, because it is the yearly sacrifice there for the whole family.’"
1 Samuel,20,7,"If he says, ‘It is good,’ your servant will be safe; but if he is very angry, know that he has decided on evil."
1 Samuel,20,8,"Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. But if there is iniquity in me, put me to death yourself; for why then should you bring me to your father?”"
1 Samuel,20,9,"Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! For if I should indeed learn that evil has been decided by my father to come upon you, then would I not tell you about it?”"
1 Samuel,20,10,"Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?”"
1 Samuel,20,11,"Jonathan said to David, “Come, and let us go out into the field.” So both of them went out to the field."
1 Samuel,20,12,"Then Jonathan said to David, “The LORD, the God of Israel, be witness! When I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if there is good feeling toward David, shall I not then send to you and make it known to you?"
1 Samuel,20,13,"If it please my father to do you harm, may the LORD do so to Jonathan and more also, if I do not make it known to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. And may the LORD be with you as He has been with my father."
1 Samuel,20,14,"If I am still alive, will you not show me the lovingkindness of the LORD, that I may not die?"
1 Samuel,20,15,"You shall not cut off your lovingkindness from my house forever, not even when the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.”"
1 Samuel,20,16,"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the LORD require it at the hands of David’s enemies.”"
1 Samuel,20,17,"Jonathan made David vow again because of his love for him, because he loved him as he loved his own life."
1 Samuel,20,18,"Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed because your seat will be empty."
1 Samuel,20,19,"When you have stayed for three days, you shall go down quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself on that eventful day, and you shall remain by the stone Ezel."
1 Samuel,20,20,"I will shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a target."
1 Samuel,20,21,"And behold, I will send the lad, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I specifically say to the lad, ‘Behold, the arrows are on this side of you, get them,’ then come; for there is safety for you and no harm, as the LORD lives."
1 Samuel,20,22,"But if I say to the youth, ‘Behold, the arrows are beyond you,’ go, for the LORD has sent you away."
1 Samuel,20,23,"As for the agreement of which you and I have spoken, behold, the LORD is between you and me forever.”"
1 Samuel,20,24,"So David hid in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food."
1 Samuel,20,25,"The king sat on his seat as usual, the seat by the wall; then Jonathan rose up and Abner sat down by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty."
1 Samuel,20,26,"Nevertheless Saul did not speak anything that day, for he thought, “It is an accident, he is not clean, surely he is not clean.”"
1 Samuel,20,27,"It came about the next day, the second day of the new moon, that David’s place was empty; so Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”"
1 Samuel,20,28,"Jonathan then answered Saul, “David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem,"
1 Samuel,20,29,"for he said, ‘Please let me go, since our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to attend. And now, if I have found favor in your sight, please let me get away that I may see my brothers.’ For this reason he has not come to the king’s table.”"
1 Samuel,20,30,"Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan and he said to him, “You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you are choosing the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?"
1 Samuel,20,31,"For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Therefore now, send and bring him to me, for he must surely die.”"
1 Samuel,20,32,"But Jonathan answered Saul his father and said to him, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”"
1 Samuel,20,33,Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him down; so Jonathan knew that his father had decided to put David to death.
1 Samuel,20,34,"Then Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did not eat food on the second day of the new moon, for he was grieved over David because his father had dishonored him."
1 Samuel,20,35,"Now it came about in the morning that Jonathan went out into the field for the appointment with David, and a little lad was with him."
1 Samuel,20,36,"He said to his lad, “Run, find now the arrows which I am about to shoot.” As the lad was running, he shot an arrow past him."
1 Samuel,20,37,"When the lad reached the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the lad and said, “Is not the arrow beyond you?”"
1 Samuel,20,38,"And Jonathan called after the lad, “Hurry, be quick, do not stay!” And Jonathan’s lad picked up the arrow and came to his master."
1 Samuel,20,39,But the lad was not aware of anything; only Jonathan and David knew about the matter.
1 Samuel,20,40,"Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad and said to him, “Go, bring them to the city.”"
1 Samuel,20,41,"When the lad was gone, David rose from the south side and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed three times. And they kissed each other and wept together, but David wept the more."
1 Samuel,20,42,"Jonathan said to David, “Go in safety, inasmuch as we have sworn to each other in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘The LORD will be between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants forever.’” Then he rose and departed, while Jonathan went into the city."
1 Samuel,21,1,"Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech came trembling to meet David and said to him, “Why are you alone and no one with you?”"
1 Samuel,21,2,"David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commissioned me with a matter and has said to me, ‘Let no one know anything about the matter on which I am sending you and with which I have commissioned you; and I have directed the young men to a certain place.’"
1 Samuel,21,3,"Now therefore, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.”"
1 Samuel,21,4,"The priest answered David and said, “There is no ordinary bread on hand, but there is consecrated bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.”"
1 Samuel,21,5,"David answered the priest and said to him, “Surely women have been kept from us as previously when I set out and the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was an ordinary journey; how much more then today will their vessels be holy?”"
1 Samuel,21,6,"So the priest gave him consecrated bread; for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence which was removed from before the LORD, in order to put hot bread in its place when it was taken away."
1 Samuel,21,7,"Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul’s shepherds."
1 Samuel,21,8,"David said to Ahimelech, “Now is there not a spear or a sword on hand? For I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s matter was urgent.”"
1 Samuel,21,9,"Then the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if you would take it for yourself, take it. For there is no other except it here.” And David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”"
1 Samuel,21,10,"Then David arose and fled that day from Saul, and went to Achish king of Gath."
1 Samuel,21,11,"But the servants of Achish said to him, “Is this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing of this one as they danced, saying, ‘Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands’?”"
1 Samuel,21,12,David took these words to heart and greatly feared Achish king of Gath.
1 Samuel,21,13,"So he disguised his sanity before them, and acted insanely in their hands, and scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his saliva run down into his beard."
1 Samuel,21,14,"Then Achish said to his servants, “Behold, you see the man behaving as a madman. Why do you bring him to me?"
1 Samuel,21,15,"Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this one to act the madman in my presence? Shall this one come into my house?”"
1 Samuel,22,1,"So David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam; and when his brothers and all his father’s household heard of it, they went down there to him."
1 Samuel,22,2,"Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him; and he became captain over them. Now there were about four hundred men with him."
1 Samuel,22,3,"And David went from there to Mizpah of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother come and stay with you until I know what God will do for me.”"
1 Samuel,22,4,Then he left them with the king of Moab; and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.
1 Samuel,22,5,"The prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah.” So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth."
1 Samuel,22,6,"Then Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been discovered. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree on the height with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him."
1 Samuel,22,7,"Saul said to his servants who stood around him, “Hear now, O Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse also give to all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?"
1 Samuel,22,8,"For all of you have conspired against me so that there is no one who discloses to me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in ambush, as it is this day.”"
1 Samuel,22,9,"Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing by the servants of Saul, said, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub."
1 Samuel,22,10,"He inquired of the LORD for him, gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”"
1 Samuel,22,11,"Then the king sent someone to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s household, the priests who were in Nob; and all of them came to the king."
1 Samuel,22,12,"Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.” And he answered, “Here I am, my lord.”"
1 Samuel,22,13,"Saul then said to him, “Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so that he would rise up against me by lying in ambush as it is this day?”"
1 Samuel,22,14,"Then Ahimelech answered the king and said, “And who among all your servants is as faithful as David, even the king’s son-in-law, who is captain over your guard, and is honored in your house?"
1 Samuel,22,15,"Did I just begin to inquire of God for him today? Far be it from me! Do not let the king impute anything to his servant or to any of the household of my father, for your servant knows nothing at all of this whole affair.”"
1 Samuel,22,16,"But the king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s household!”"
1 Samuel,22,17,"And the king said to the guards who were attending him, “Turn around and put the priests of the LORD to death, because their hand also is with David and because they knew that he was fleeing and did not reveal it to me.” But the servants of the king were not willing to put forth their hands to attack the priests of the LORD."
1 Samuel,22,18,"Then the king said to Doeg, “You turn around and attack the priests.” And Doeg the Edomite turned around and attacked the priests, and he killed that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod."
1 Samuel,22,19,"And he struck Nob the city of the priests with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and infants; also oxen, donkeys, and sheep he struck with the edge of the sword."
1 Samuel,22,20,"But one son of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David."
1 Samuel,22,21,Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.
1 Samuel,22,22,"Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have brought about the death of every person in your father’s household."
1 Samuel,22,23,"Stay with me; do not be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life, for you are safe with me.”"
1 Samuel,23,1,"Then they told David, saying, “Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are plundering the threshing floors.”"
1 Samuel,23,2,"So David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?” And the LORD said to David, “Go and attack the Philistines and deliver Keilah.”"
1 Samuel,23,3,"But David’s men said to him, “Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the ranks of the Philistines?”"
1 Samuel,23,4,"Then David inquired of the LORD once more. And the LORD answered him and said, “Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will give the Philistines into your hand.”"
1 Samuel,23,5,So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines; and he led away their livestock and struck them with a great slaughter. Thus David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah.
1 Samuel,23,6,"Now it came about, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand."
1 Samuel,23,7,"When it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, “God has delivered him into my hand, for he shut himself in by entering a city with double gates and bars.”"
1 Samuel,23,8,"So Saul summoned all the people for war, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men."
1 Samuel,23,9,"Now David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him; so he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.”"
1 Samuel,23,10,"Then David said, “O LORD God of Israel, Your servant has heard for certain that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah to destroy the city on my account."
1 Samuel,23,11,"Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down just as Your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I pray, tell Your servant.” And the LORD said, “He will come down.”"
1 Samuel,23,12,"Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?” And the LORD said, “They will surrender you.”"
1 Samuel,23,13,"Then David and his men, about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and they went wherever they could go. When it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the pursuit."
1 Samuel,23,14,"David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand."
1 Samuel,23,15,Now David became aware that Saul had come out to seek his life while David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.
1 Samuel,23,16,"And Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose and went to David at Horesh, and encouraged him in God."
1 Samuel,23,17,"Thus he said to him, “Do not be afraid, because the hand of Saul my father will not find you, and you will be king over Israel and I will be next to you; and Saul my father knows that also.”"
1 Samuel,23,18,So the two of them made a covenant before the LORD; and David stayed at Horesh while Jonathan went to his house.
1 Samuel,23,19,"Then Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is David not hiding with us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?"
1 Samuel,23,20,"Now then, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to do so; and our part shall be to surrender him into the king’s hand.”"
1 Samuel,23,21,"Saul said, “May you be blessed of the LORD, for you have had compassion on me."
1 Samuel,23,22,"Go now, make more sure, and investigate and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there; for I am told that he is very cunning."
1 Samuel,23,23,"So look, and learn about all the hiding places where he hides himself and return to me with certainty, and I will go with you; and if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.”"
1 Samuel,23,24,"Then they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon."
1 Samuel,23,25,"When Saul and his men went to seek him, they told David, and he came down to the rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard it, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon."
1 Samuel,23,26,"Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain; and David was hurrying to get away from Saul, for Saul and his men were surrounding David and his men to seize them."
1 Samuel,23,27,"But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come, for the Philistines have made a raid on the land.”"
1 Samuel,23,28,So Saul returned from pursuing David and went to meet the Philistines; therefore they called that place the Rock of Escape.
1 Samuel,23,29,David went up from there and stayed in the strongholds of Engedi.
1 Samuel,24,1,"Now when Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, saying, “Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.”"
1 Samuel,24,2,Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and went to seek David and his men in front of the Rocks of the Wild Goats.
1 Samuel,24,3,"He came to the sheepfolds on the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the inner recesses of the cave."
1 Samuel,24,4,"The men of David said to him, “Behold, this is the day of which the LORD said to you, ‘Behold; I am about to give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you.’” Then David arose and cut off the edge of Saul’s robe secretly."
1 Samuel,24,5,It came about afterward that David’s conscience bothered him because he had cut off the edge of Saul’s robe.
1 Samuel,24,6,"So he said to his men, “Far be it from me because of the LORD that I should do this thing to my lord, the LORD’S anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, since he is the LORD’S anointed.”"
1 Samuel,24,7,"David persuaded his men with these words and did not allow them to rise up against Saul. And Saul arose, left the cave, and went on his way."
1 Samuel,24,8,"Now afterward David arose and went out of the cave and called after Saul, saying, “My lord the king!” And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the ground and prostrated himself."
1 Samuel,24,9,"David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of men, saying, ‘Behold, David seeks to harm you’?"
1 Samuel,24,10,"Behold, this day your eyes have seen that the LORD had given you today into my hand in the cave, and some said to kill you, but my eye had pity on you; and I said, ‘I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD’S anointed.’"
1 Samuel,24,11,"Now, my father, see! Indeed, see the edge of your robe in my hand! For in that I cut off the edge of your robe and did not kill you, know and perceive that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands, and I have not sinned against you, though you are lying in wait for my life to take it."
1 Samuel,24,12,"May the LORD judge between you and me, and may the LORD avenge me on you; but my hand shall not be against you."
1 Samuel,24,13,"As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness’; but my hand shall not be against you."
1 Samuel,24,14,"After whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog, a single flea?"
1 Samuel,24,15,The LORD therefore be judge and decide between you and me; and may He see and plead my cause and deliver me from your hand.”
1 Samuel,24,16,"When David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” Then Saul lifted up his voice and wept."
1 Samuel,24,17,"He said to David, “You are more righteous than I; for you have dealt well with me, while I have dealt wickedly with you."
1 Samuel,24,18,"You have declared today that you have done good to me, that the LORD delivered me into your hand and yet you did not kill me."
1 Samuel,24,19,"For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safely? May the LORD therefore reward you with good in return for what you have done to me this day."
1 Samuel,24,20,"Now, behold, I know that you will surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand."
1 Samuel,24,21,So now swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants after me and that you will not destroy my name from my father’s household.”
1 Samuel,24,22,"David swore to Saul. And Saul went to his home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold."
1 Samuel,25,1,"Then Samuel died; and all Israel gathered together and mourned for him, and buried him at his house in Ramah. And David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran."
1 Samuel,25,2,"Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel; and the man was very rich, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. And it came about while he was shearing his sheep in Carmel"
1 Samuel,25,3,"(now the man’s name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. And the woman was intelligent and beautiful in appearance, but the man was harsh and evil in his dealings, and he was a Calebite),"
1 Samuel,25,4,that David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
1 Samuel,25,5,"So David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, visit Nabal and greet him in my name;"
1 Samuel,25,6,"and thus you shall say, ‘Have a long life, peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have."
1 Samuel,25,7,"Now I have heard that you have shearers; now your shepherds have been with us and we have not insulted them, nor have they missed anything all the days they were in Carmel."
1 Samuel,25,8,"Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes, for we have come on a festive day. Please give whatever you find at hand to your servants and to your son David.’”"
1 Samuel,25,9,"When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in David’s name; then they waited."
1 Samuel,25,10,"But Nabal answered David’s servants and said, “Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants today who are each breaking away from his master."
1 Samuel,25,11,"Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men whose origin I do not know?”"
1 Samuel,25,12,So David’s young men retraced their way and went back; and they came and told him according to all these words.
1 Samuel,25,13,"David said to his men, “Each of you gird on his sword.” So each man girded on his sword. And David also girded on his sword, and about four hundred men went up behind David while two hundred stayed with the baggage."
1 Samuel,25,14,"But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Behold, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, and he scorned them."
1 Samuel,25,15,"Yet the men were very good to us, and we were not insulted, nor did we miss anything as long as we went about with them, while we were in the fields."
1 Samuel,25,16,"They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the time we were with them tending the sheep."
1 Samuel,25,17,"Now therefore, know and consider what you should do, for evil is plotted against our master and against all his household; and he is such a worthless man that no one can speak to him.”"
1 Samuel,25,18,"Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread and two jugs of wine and five sheep already prepared and five measures of roasted grain and a hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs, and loaded them on donkeys."
1 Samuel,25,19,"She said to her young men, “Go on before me; behold, I am coming after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal."
1 Samuel,25,20,"It came about as she was riding on her donkey and coming down by the hidden part of the mountain, that behold, David and his men were coming down toward her; so she met them."
1 Samuel,25,21,"Now David had said, “Surely in vain I have guarded all that this man has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him; and he has returned me evil for good."
1 Samuel,25,22,"May God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if by morning I leave as much as one male of any who belong to him.”"
1 Samuel,25,23,"When Abigail saw David, she hurried and dismounted from her donkey, and fell on her face before David and bowed herself to the ground."
1 Samuel,25,24,"She fell at his feet and said, “On me alone, my lord, be the blame. And please let your maidservant speak to you, and listen to the words of your maidservant."
1 Samuel,25,25,"Please do not let my lord pay attention to this worthless man, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name and folly is with him; but I your maidservant did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent."
1 Samuel,25,26,"“Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, since the LORD has restrained you from shedding blood, and from avenging yourself by your own hand, now then let your enemies and those who seek evil against my lord, be as Nabal."
1 Samuel,25,27,Now let this gift which your maidservant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who accompany my lord.
1 Samuel,25,28,"Please forgive the transgression of your maidservant; for the LORD will certainly make for my lord an enduring house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the LORD, and evil will not be found in you all your days."
1 Samuel,25,29,"Should anyone rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, then the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God; but the lives of your enemies He will sling out as from the hollow of a sling."
1 Samuel,25,30,"And when the LORD does for my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you, and appoints you ruler over Israel,"
1 Samuel,25,31,"this will not cause grief or a troubled heart to my lord, both by having shed blood without cause and by my lord having avenged himself. When the LORD deals well with my lord, then remember your maidservant.”"
1 Samuel,25,32,"Then David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me,"
1 Samuel,25,33,"and blessed be your discernment, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodshed and from avenging myself by my own hand."
1 Samuel,25,34,"Nevertheless, as the LORD God of Israel lives, who has restrained me from harming you, unless you had come quickly to meet me, surely there would not have been left to Nabal until the morning light as much as one male.”"
1 Samuel,25,35,"So David received from her hand what she had brought him and said to her, “Go up to your house in peace. See, I have listened to you and granted your request.”"
1 Samuel,25,36,"Then Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk; so she did not tell him anything at all until the morning light."
1 Samuel,25,37,"But in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him so that he became as a stone."
1 Samuel,25,38,"About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal and he died."
1 Samuel,25,39,"When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the LORD, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal and has kept back His servant from evil. The LORD has also returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head.” Then David sent a proposal to Abigail, to take her as his wife."
1 Samuel,25,40,"When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us to you to take you as his wife.”"
1 Samuel,25,41,"She arose and bowed with her face to the ground and said, “Behold, your maidservant is a maid to wash the feet of my lord’s servants.”"
1 Samuel,25,42,"Then Abigail quickly arose, and rode on a donkey, with her five maidens who attended her; and she followed the messengers of David and became his wife."
1 Samuel,25,43,"David had also taken Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives."
1 Samuel,25,44,"Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim."
1 Samuel,26,1,"Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is not David hiding on the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?”"
1 Samuel,26,2,"So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having with him three thousand chosen men of Israel, to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph."
1 Samuel,26,3,"Saul camped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, beside the road, and David was staying in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness,"
1 Samuel,26,4,"David sent out spies, and he knew that Saul was definitely coming."
1 Samuel,26,5,"David then arose and came to the place where Saul had camped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army; and Saul was lying in the circle of the camp, and the people were camped around him."
1 Samuel,26,6,"Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”"
1 Samuel,26,7,"So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and behold, Saul lay sleeping inside the circle of the camp with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people were lying around him."
1 Samuel,26,8,"Then Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hand; now therefore, please let me strike him with the spear to the ground with one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time.”"
1 Samuel,26,9,"But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him, for who can stretch out his hand against the LORD’S anointed and be without guilt?”"
1 Samuel,26,10,"David also said, “As the LORD lives, surely the LORD will strike him, or his day will come that he dies, or he will go down into battle and perish."
1 Samuel,26,11,"The LORD forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the LORD’S anointed; but now please take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water, and let us go.”"
1 Samuel,26,12,"So David took the spear and the jug of water from beside Saul’s head, and they went away, but no one saw or knew it, nor did any awake, for they were all asleep, because a sound sleep from the LORD had fallen on them."
1 Samuel,26,13,Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the mountain at a distance with a large area between them.
1 Samuel,26,14,"David called to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Will you not answer, Abner?” Then Abner replied, “Who are you who calls to the king?”"
1 Samuel,26,15,"So David said to Abner, “Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy the king your lord."
1 Samuel,26,16,"This thing that you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, all of you must surely die, because you did not guard your lord, the LORD’S anointed. And now, see where the king’s spear is and the jug of water that was at his head.”"
1 Samuel,26,17,"Then Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And David said, “It is my voice, my lord the king.”"
1 Samuel,26,18,"He also said, “Why then is my lord pursuing his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?"
1 Samuel,26,19,"Now therefore, please let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant. If the LORD has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering; but if it is men, cursed are they before the LORD, for they have driven me out today so that I would have no attachment with the inheritance of the LORD, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods.’"
1 Samuel,26,20,"Now then, do not let my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of the LORD; for the king of Israel has come out to search for a single flea, just as one hunts a partridge in the mountains.”"
1 Samuel,26,21,"Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will not harm you again because my life was precious in your sight this day. Behold, I have played the fool and have committed a serious error.”"
1 Samuel,26,22,"David replied, “Behold the spear of the king! Now let one of the young men come over and take it."
1 Samuel,26,23,"The LORD will repay each man for his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered you into my hand today, but I refused to stretch out my hand against the LORD’S anointed."
1 Samuel,26,24,"Now behold, as your life was highly valued in my sight this day, so may my life be highly valued in the sight of the LORD, and may He deliver me from all distress.”"
1 Samuel,26,25,"Then Saul said to David, “Blessed are you, my son David; you will both accomplish much and surely prevail.” So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place."
1 Samuel,27,1,"Then David said to himself, “Now I will perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than to escape into the land of the Philistines. Saul then will despair of searching for me anymore in all the territory of Israel, and I will escape from his hand.”"
1 Samuel,27,2,"So David arose and crossed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath."
1 Samuel,27,3,"And David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s widow."
1 Samuel,27,4,"Now it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath, so he no longer searched for him."
1 Samuel,27,5,"Then David said to Achish, “If now I have found favor in your sight, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may live there; for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”"
1 Samuel,27,6,So Achish gave him Ziklag that day; therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day.
1 Samuel,27,7,The number of days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months.
1 Samuel,27,8,"Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites and the Girzites and the Amalekites; for they were the inhabitants of the land from ancient times, as you come to Shur even as far as the land of Egypt."
1 Samuel,27,9,"David attacked the land and did not leave a man or a woman alive, and he took away the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing. Then he returned and came to Achish."
1 Samuel,27,10,"Now Achish said, “Where have you made a raid today?” And David said, “Against the Negev of Judah and against the Negev of the Jerahmeelites and against the Negev of the Kenites.”"
1 Samuel,27,11,"David did not leave a man or a woman alive to bring to Gath, saying, “Otherwise they will tell about us, saying, ‘So has David done and so has been his practice all the time he has lived in the country of the Philistines.’”"
1 Samuel,27,12,"So Achish believed David, saying, “He has surely made himself odious among his people Israel; therefore he will become my servant forever.”"
1 Samuel,28,1,"Now it came about in those days that the Philistines gathered their armed camps for war, to fight against Israel. And Achish said to David, “Know assuredly that you will go out with me in the camp, you and your men.”"
1 Samuel,28,2,"David said to Achish, “Very well, you shall know what your servant can do.” So Achish said to David, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.”"
1 Samuel,28,3,"Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had removed from the land those who were mediums and spiritists."
1 Samuel,28,4,So the Philistines gathered together and came and camped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together and they camped in Gilboa.
1 Samuel,28,5,"When Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly."
1 Samuel,28,6,"When Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by prophets."
1 Samuel,28,7,"Then Saul said to his servants, “Seek for me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.” And his servants said to him, “Behold, there is a woman who is a medium at En-dor.”"
1 Samuel,28,8,"Then Saul disguised himself by putting on other clothes, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night; and he said, “Conjure up for me, please, and bring up for me whom I shall name to you.”"
1 Samuel,28,9,"But the woman said to him, “Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who are mediums and spiritists from the land. Why are you then laying a snare for my life to bring about my death?”"
1 Samuel,28,10,"Saul vowed to her by the LORD, saying, “As the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.”"
1 Samuel,28,11,"Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” And he said, “Bring up Samuel for me.”"
1 Samuel,28,12,"When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, “Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul.”"
1 Samuel,28,13,"The king said to her, “Do not be afraid; but what do you see?” And the woman said to Saul, “I see a divine being coming up out of the earth.”"
1 Samuel,28,14,"He said to her, “What is his form?” And she said, “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped with a robe.” And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and did homage."
1 Samuel,28,15,"Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” And Saul answered, “I am greatly distressed; for the Philistines are waging war against me, and God has departed from me and no longer answers me, either through prophets or by dreams; therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I should do.”"
1 Samuel,28,16,"Samuel said, “Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has departed from you and has become your adversary?"
1 Samuel,28,17,"The LORD has done accordingly as He spoke through me; for the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, to David."
1 Samuel,28,18,"As you did not obey the LORD and did not execute His fierce wrath on Amalek, so the LORD has done this thing to you this day."
1 Samuel,28,19,"Moreover the LORD will also give over Israel along with you into the hands of the Philistines, therefore tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. Indeed the LORD will give over the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines!”"
1 Samuel,28,20,"Then Saul immediately fell full length upon the ground and was very afraid because of the words of Samuel; also there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no food all day and all night."
1 Samuel,28,21,"The woman came to Saul and saw that he was terrified, and said to him, “Behold, your maidservant has obeyed you, and I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to your words which you spoke to me."
1 Samuel,28,22,"So now also, please listen to the voice of your maidservant, and let me set a piece of bread before you that you may eat and have strength when you go on your way.”"
1 Samuel,28,23,"But he refused and said, “I will not eat.” However, his servants together with the woman urged him, and he listened to them. So he arose from the ground and sat on the bed."
1 Samuel,28,24,"The woman had a fattened calf in the house, and she quickly slaughtered it; and she took flour, kneaded it and baked unleavened bread from it."
1 Samuel,28,25,"She brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they arose and went away that night."
1 Samuel,29,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek, while the Israelites were camping by the spring which is in Jezreel."
1 Samuel,29,2,"And the lords of the Philistines were proceeding on by hundreds and by thousands, and David and his men were proceeding on in the rear with Achish."
1 Samuel,29,3,"Then the commanders of the Philistines said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, “Is this not David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or rather these years, and I have found no fault in him from the day he deserted to me to this day?”"
1 Samuel,29,4,"But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him, and the commanders of the Philistines said to him, “Make the man go back, that he may return to his place where you have assigned him, and do not let him go down to battle with us, or in the battle he may become an adversary to us. For with what could this man make himself acceptable to his lord? Would it not be with the heads of these men?"
1 Samuel,29,5,"Is this not David, of whom they sing in the dances, saying, ‘Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands’?”"
1 Samuel,29,6,"Then Achish called David and said to him, “As the LORD lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army are pleasing in my sight; for I have not found evil in you from the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless, you are not pleasing in the sight of the lords."
1 Samuel,29,7,"Now therefore return and go in peace, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines.”"
1 Samuel,29,8,"David said to Achish, “But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant from the day when I came before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”"
1 Samuel,29,9,"But Achish replied to David, “I know that you are pleasing in my sight, like an angel of God; nevertheless the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He must not go up with us to the battle.’"
1 Samuel,29,10,"Now then arise early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you, and as soon as you have arisen early in the morning and have light, depart.”"
1 Samuel,29,11,"So David arose early, he and his men, to depart in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel."
1 Samuel,30,1,"Then it happened when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negev and on Ziklag, and had overthrown Ziklag and burned it with fire;"
1 Samuel,30,2,"and they took captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great, without killing anyone, and carried them off and went their way."
1 Samuel,30,3,"When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire, and their wives and their sons and their daughters had been taken captive."
1 Samuel,30,4,Then David and the people who were with him lifted their voices and wept until there was no strength in them to weep.
1 Samuel,30,5,"Now David’s two wives had been taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite."
1 Samuel,30,6,"Moreover David was greatly distressed because the people spoke of stoning him, for all the people were embittered, each one because of his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God."
1 Samuel,30,7,"Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Please bring me the ephod.” So Abiathar brought the ephod to David."
1 Samuel,30,8,"David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I pursue this band? Shall I overtake them?” And He said to him, “Pursue, for you will surely overtake them, and you will surely rescue all.”"
1 Samuel,30,9,"So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those left behind remained."
1 Samuel,30,10,"But David pursued, he and four hundred men, for two hundred who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor remained behind."
1 Samuel,30,11,"Now they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David, and gave him bread and he ate, and they provided him water to drink."
1 Samuel,30,12,"They gave him a piece of fig cake and two clusters of raisins, and he ate; then his spirit revived. For he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights."
1 Samuel,30,13,"David said to him, “To whom do you belong? And where are you from?” And he said, “I am a young man of Egypt, a servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me behind when I fell sick three days ago."
1 Samuel,30,14,"We made a raid on the Negev of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the Negev of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.”"
1 Samuel,30,15,"Then David said to him, “Will you bring me down to this band?” And he said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this band.”"
1 Samuel,30,16,"When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah."
1 Samuel,30,17,"David slaughtered them from the twilight until the evening of the next day; and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled."
1 Samuel,30,18,"So David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and rescued his two wives."
1 Samuel,30,19,"But nothing of theirs was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that they had taken for themselves; David brought it all back."
1 Samuel,30,20,"So David had captured all the sheep and the cattle which the people drove ahead of the other livestock, and they said, “This is David’s spoil.”"
1 Samuel,30,21,"When David came to the two hundred men who were too exhausted to follow David, who had also been left at the brook Besor, and they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him, then David approached the people and greeted them."
1 Samuel,30,22,"Then all the wicked and worthless men among those who went with David said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away and depart.”"
1 Samuel,30,23,"Then David said, “You must not do so, my brothers, with what the LORD has given us, who has kept us and delivered into our hand the band that came against us."
1 Samuel,30,24,"And who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage; they shall share alike.”"
1 Samuel,30,25,"So it has been from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day."
1 Samuel,30,26,"Now when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, “Behold, a gift for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD:"
1 Samuel,30,27,"to those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth of the Negev, and to those who were in Jattir,"
1 Samuel,30,28,"and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa,"
1 Samuel,30,29,"and to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,"
1 Samuel,30,30,"and to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Bor-ashan, and to those who were in Athach,"
1 Samuel,30,31,"and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were accustomed to go.”"
1 Samuel,31,1,"Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa."
1 Samuel,31,2,The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua the sons of Saul.
1 Samuel,31,3,"The battle went heavily against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was badly wounded by the archers."
1 Samuel,31,4,"Then Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and pierce me through with it, otherwise these uncircumcised will come and pierce me through and make sport of me.” But his armor bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. So Saul took his sword and fell on it."
1 Samuel,31,5,"When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died with him."
1 Samuel,31,6,"Thus Saul died with his three sons, his armor bearer, and all his men on that day together."
1 Samuel,31,7,"When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, with those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled; then the Philistines came and lived in them."
1 Samuel,31,8,"It came about on the next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa."
1 Samuel,31,9,"They cut off his head and stripped off his weapons, and sent them throughout the land of the Philistines, to carry the good news to the house of their idols and to the people."
1 Samuel,31,10,"They put his weapons in the temple of Ashtaroth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan."
1 Samuel,31,11,"Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,"
1 Samuel,31,12,"all the valiant men rose and walked all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and they came to Jabesh and burned them there."
1 Samuel,31,13,"They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days."
2 Samuel,1,1,"Now it came about after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, that David remained two days in Ziklag."
2 Samuel,1,2,"On the third day, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn and dust on his head. And it came about when he came to David that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself."
2 Samuel,1,3,"Then David said to him, “From where do you come?” And he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”"
2 Samuel,1,4,"David said to him, “How did things go? Please tell me.” And he said, “The people have fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.”"
2 Samuel,1,5,"So David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”"
2 Samuel,1,6,"The young man who told him said, “By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul was leaning on his spear. And behold, the chariots and the horsemen pursued him closely."
2 Samuel,1,7,"When he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I said, ‘Here I am.’"
2 Samuel,1,8,"He said to me, ‘Who are you?’ And I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’"
2 Samuel,1,9,"Then he said to me, ‘Please stand beside me and kill me, for agony has seized me because my life still lingers in me.’"
2 Samuel,1,10,"So I stood beside him and killed him, because I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown which was on his head and the bracelet which was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”"
2 Samuel,1,11,"Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so also did all the men who were with him."
2 Samuel,1,12,"They mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and his son Jonathan and for the people of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword."
2 Samuel,1,13,"David said to the young man who told him, “Where are you from?” And he answered, “I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite.”"
2 Samuel,1,14,"Then David said to him, “How is it you were not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy the LORD’S anointed?”"
2 Samuel,1,15,"And David called one of the young men and said, “Go, cut him down.” So he struck him and he died."
2 Samuel,1,16,"David said to him, “Your blood is on your head, for your mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed the LORD’S anointed.’”"
2 Samuel,1,17,"Then David chanted with this lament over Saul and Jonathan his son,"
2 Samuel,1,18,"and he told them to teach the sons of Judah the song of the bow; behold, it is written in the book of Jashar."
2 Samuel,1,19,"“Your beauty, O Israel, is slain on your high places! How have the mighty fallen!"
2 Samuel,1,20,"“Tell it not in Gath, Proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, Or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice, The daughters of the uncircumcised will exult."
2 Samuel,1,21,"“O mountains of Gilboa, Let not dew or rain be on you, nor fields of offerings; For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil."
2 Samuel,1,22,"“From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan did not turn back, And the sword of Saul did not return empty."
2 Samuel,1,23,"“Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in their life, And in their death they were not parted; They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions."
2 Samuel,1,24,"“O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you luxuriously in scarlet, Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel."
2 Samuel,1,25,“How have the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places.
2 Samuel,1,26,"“I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; You have been very pleasant to me. Your love to me was more wonderful Than the love of women."
2 Samuel,1,27,"“How have the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished!”"
2 Samuel,2,1,"Then it came about afterwards that David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go up to one of the cities of Judah?” And the LORD said to him, “Go up.” So David said, “Where shall I go up?” And He said, “To Hebron.”"
2 Samuel,2,2,"So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite."
2 Samuel,2,3,"And David brought up his men who were with him, each with his household; and they lived in the cities of Hebron."
2 Samuel,2,4,"Then the men of Judah came and there anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, “It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul.”"
2 Samuel,2,5,"David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, “May you be blessed of the LORD because you have shown this kindness to Saul your lord, and have buried him."
2 Samuel,2,6,"Now may the LORD show lovingkindness and truth to you; and I also will show this goodness to you, because you have done this thing."
2 Samuel,2,7,"Now therefore, let your hands be strong and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”"
2 Samuel,2,8,"But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim."
2 Samuel,2,9,"He made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, even over all Israel."
2 Samuel,2,10,"Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he was king for two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David."
2 Samuel,2,11,The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2 Samuel,2,12,"Now Abner the son of Ner, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon with the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul."
2 Samuel,2,13,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool."
2 Samuel,2,14,"Then Abner said to Joab, “Now let the young men arise and hold a contest before us.” And Joab said, “Let them arise.”"
2 Samuel,2,15,"So they arose and went over by count, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David."
2 Samuel,2,16,"Each one of them seized his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent’s side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon."
2 Samuel,2,17,"That day the battle was very severe, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David."
2 Samuel,2,18,"Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel; and Asahel was as swift-footed as one of the gazelles which is in the field."
2 Samuel,2,19,Asahel pursued Abner and did not turn to the right or to the left from following Abner.
2 Samuel,2,20,"Then Abner looked behind him and said, “Is that you, Asahel?” And he answered, “It is I.”"
2 Samuel,2,21,"So Abner said to him, “Turn to your right or to your left, and take hold of one of the young men for yourself, and take for yourself his spoil.” But Asahel was not willing to turn aside from following him."
2 Samuel,2,22,"Abner repeated again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?”"
2 Samuel,2,23,"However, he refused to turn aside; therefore Abner struck him in the belly with the butt end of the spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died on the spot. And it came about that all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still."
2 Samuel,2,24,"But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and when the sun was going down, they came to the hill of Ammah, which is in front of Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon."
2 Samuel,2,25,"The sons of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became one band, and they stood on the top of a certain hill."
2 Samuel,2,26,"Then Abner called to Joab and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the end? How long will you refrain from telling the people to turn back from following their brothers?”"
2 Samuel,2,27,"Joab said, “As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then the people would have gone away in the morning, each from following his brother.”"
2 Samuel,2,28,"So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people halted and pursued Israel no longer, nor did they continue to fight anymore."
2 Samuel,2,29,"Abner and his men then went through the Arabah all that night; so they crossed the Jordan, walked all morning, and came to Mahanaim."
2 Samuel,2,30,"Then Joab returned from following Abner; when he had gathered all the people together, nineteen of David’s servants besides Asahel were missing."
2 Samuel,2,31,"But the servants of David had struck down many of Benjamin and Abner’s men, so that three hundred and sixty men died."
2 Samuel,2,32,And they took up Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb which was in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men went all night until the day dawned at Hebron.
2 Samuel,3,1,"Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; and David grew steadily stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker continually."
2 Samuel,3,2,"Sons were born to David at Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;"
2 Samuel,3,3,"and his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;"
2 Samuel,3,4,"and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;"
2 Samuel,3,5,"and the sixth, Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. These were born to David at Hebron."
2 Samuel,3,6,It came about while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David that Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.
2 Samuel,3,7,"Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”"
2 Samuel,3,8,"Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said, “Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hands of David; and yet today you charge me with a guilt concerning the woman."
2 Samuel,3,9,"May God do so to Abner, and more also, if as the LORD has sworn to David, I do not accomplish this for him,"
2 Samuel,3,10,"to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.”"
2 Samuel,3,11,"And he could no longer answer Abner a word, because he was afraid of him."
2 Samuel,3,12,"Then Abner sent messengers to David in his place, saying, “Whose is the land? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel over to you.”"
2 Samuel,3,13,"He said, “Good! I will make a covenant with you, but I demand one thing of you, namely, you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see me.”"
2 Samuel,3,14,"So David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Give me my wife Michal, to whom I was betrothed for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”"
2 Samuel,3,15,"Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish."
2 Samuel,3,16,"But her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go, return.” So he returned."
2 Samuel,3,17,"Now Abner had consultation with the elders of Israel, saying, “In times past you were seeking for David to be king over you."
2 Samuel,3,18,"Now then, do it! For the LORD has spoken of David, saying, ‘By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.’”"
2 Samuel,3,19,Abner also spoke in the hearing of Benjamin; and in addition Abner went to speak in the hearing of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and to the whole house of Benjamin.
2 Samuel,3,20,Then Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.
2 Samuel,3,21,"Abner said to David, “Let me arise and go and gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may be king over all that your soul desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace."
2 Samuel,3,22,"And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoil with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace."
2 Samuel,3,23,"When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, they told Joab, saying, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.”"
2 Samuel,3,24,"Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why then have you sent him away and he is already gone?"
2 Samuel,3,25,"You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you and to learn of your going out and coming in and to find out all that you are doing.”"
2 Samuel,3,26,"When Joab came out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David did not know it."
2 Samuel,3,27,"So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the middle of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the belly so that he died on account of the blood of Asahel his brother."
2 Samuel,3,28,"Afterward when David heard it, he said, “I and my kingdom are innocent before the LORD forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner."
2 Samuel,3,29,"May it fall on the head of Joab and on all his father’s house; and may there not fail from the house of Joab one who has a discharge, or who is a leper, or who takes hold of a distaff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.”"
2 Samuel,3,30,So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.
2 Samuel,3,31,"Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes and gird on sackcloth and lament before Abner.” And King David walked behind the bier."
2 Samuel,3,32,"Thus they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept."
2 Samuel,3,33,"The king chanted a lament for Abner and said, “Should Abner die as a fool dies?"
2 Samuel,3,34,"“Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put in fetters; As one falls before the wicked, you have fallen.” And all the people wept again over him."
2 Samuel,3,35,"Then all the people came to persuade David to eat bread while it was still day; but David vowed, saying, “May God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down.”"
2 Samuel,3,36,"Now all the people took note of it, and it pleased them, just as everything the king did pleased all the people."
2 Samuel,3,37,So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the will of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death.
2 Samuel,3,38,"Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?"
2 Samuel,3,39,"I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too difficult for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil.”"
2 Samuel,4,1,"Now when Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel was disturbed."
2 Samuel,4,2,"Saul’s son had two men who were commanders of bands: the name of the one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin (for Beeroth is also considered part of Benjamin,"
2 Samuel,4,3,and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been aliens there until this day).
2 Samuel,4,4,"Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son crippled in his feet. He was five years old when the report of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled. And it happened that in her hurry to flee, he fell and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth."
2 Samuel,4,5,"So the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, departed and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day while he was taking his midday rest."
2 Samuel,4,6,"They came to the middle of the house as if to get wheat, and they struck him in the belly; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped."
2 Samuel,4,7,"Now when they came into the house, as he was lying on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and killed him and beheaded him. And they took his head and traveled by way of the Arabah all night."
2 Samuel,4,8,"Then they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, “Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; thus the LORD has given my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and his descendants.”"
2 Samuel,4,9,"David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress,"
2 Samuel,4,10,"when one told me, saying, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news."
2 Samuel,4,11,"How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood from your hand and destroy you from the earth?”"
2 Samuel,4,12,"Then David commanded the young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hung them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron."
2 Samuel,5,1,"Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh."
2 Samuel,5,2,"Previously, when Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and in. And the LORD said to you, ‘You will shepherd My people Israel, and you will be a ruler over Israel.’”"
2 Samuel,5,3,"So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them before the LORD at Hebron; then they anointed David king over Israel."
2 Samuel,5,4,"David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years."
2 Samuel,5,5,"At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah."
2 Samuel,5,6,"Now the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, and they said to David, “You shall not come in here, but the blind and lame will turn you away”; thinking, “David cannot enter here.”"
2 Samuel,5,7,"Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Zion, that is the city of David."
2 Samuel,5,8,"David said on that day, “Whoever would strike the Jebusites, let him reach the lame and the blind, who are hated by David’s soul, through the water tunnel.” Therefore they say, “The blind or the lame shall not come into the house.”"
2 Samuel,5,9,So David lived in the stronghold and called it the city of David. And David built all around from the Millo and inward.
2 Samuel,5,10,"David became greater and greater, for the LORD God of hosts was with him."
2 Samuel,5,11,Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees and carpenters and stonemasons; and they built a house for David.
2 Samuel,5,12,"And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel."
2 Samuel,5,13,"Meanwhile David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to David."
2 Samuel,5,14,"Now these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,"
2 Samuel,5,15,"Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,"
2 Samuel,5,16,"Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet."
2 Samuel,5,17,"When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek out David; and when David heard of it, he went down to the stronghold."
2 Samuel,5,18,Now the Philistines came and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel,5,19,"Then David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You give them into my hand?” And the LORD said to David, “Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand.”"
2 Samuel,5,20,"So David came to Baal-perazim and defeated them there; and he said, “The LORD has broken through my enemies before me like the breakthrough of waters.” Therefore he named that place Baal-perazim."
2 Samuel,5,21,"They abandoned their idols there, so David and his men carried them away."
2 Samuel,5,22,Now the Philistines came up once again and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel,5,23,"When David inquired of the LORD, He said, “You shall not go directly up; circle around behind them and come at them in front of the balsam trees."
2 Samuel,5,24,"It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall act promptly, for then the LORD will have gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.”"
2 Samuel,5,25,"Then David did so, just as the LORD had commanded him, and struck down the Philistines from Geba as far as Gezer."
2 Samuel,6,1,"Now David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand."
2 Samuel,6,2,"And David arose and went with all the people who were with him to Baale-judah, to bring up from there the ark of God which is called by the Name, the very name of the LORD of hosts who is enthroned above the cherubim."
2 Samuel,6,3,"They placed the ark of God on a new cart that they might bring it from the house of Abinadab which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the new cart."
2 Samuel,6,4,"So they brought it with the ark of God from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Ahio was walking ahead of the ark."
2 Samuel,6,5,"Meanwhile, David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD with all kinds of instruments made of fir wood, and with lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets and cymbals."
2 Samuel,6,6,"But when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out toward the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen nearly upset it."
2 Samuel,6,7,"And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and God struck him down there for his irreverence; and he died there by the ark of God."
2 Samuel,6,8,"David became angry because of the LORD’S outburst against Uzzah, and that place is called Perez-uzzah to this day."
2 Samuel,6,9,"So David was afraid of the LORD that day; and he said, “How can the ark of the LORD come to me?”"
2 Samuel,6,10,And David was unwilling to move the ark of the LORD into the city of David with him; but David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
2 Samuel,6,11,"Thus the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household."
2 Samuel,6,12,"Now it was told King David, saying, “The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, on account of the ark of God.” David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness."
2 Samuel,6,13,"And so it was, that when the bearers of the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling."
2 Samuel,6,14,"And David was dancing before the LORD with all his might, and David was wearing a linen ephod."
2 Samuel,6,15,So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of the LORD with shouting and the sound of the trumpet.
2 Samuel,6,16,Then it happened as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.
2 Samuel,6,17,So they brought in the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent which David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
2 Samuel,6,18,"When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offering, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts."
2 Samuel,6,19,"Further, he distributed to all the people, to all the multitude of Israel, both to men and women, a cake of bread and one of dates and one of raisins to each one. Then all the people departed each to his house."
2 Samuel,6,20,"But when David returned to bless his household, Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, “How the king of Israel distinguished himself today! He uncovered himself today in the eyes of his servants’ maids as one of the foolish ones shamelessly uncovers himself!”"
2 Samuel,6,21,"So David said to Michal, “It was before the LORD, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel; therefore I will celebrate before the LORD."
2 Samuel,6,22,"I will be more lightly esteemed than this and will be humble in my own eyes, but with the maids of whom you have spoken, with them I will be distinguished.”"
2 Samuel,6,23,Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
2 Samuel,7,1,"Now it came about when the king lived in his house, and the LORD had given him rest on every side from all his enemies,"
2 Samuel,7,2,"that the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within tent curtains.”"
2 Samuel,7,3,"Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your mind, for the LORD is with you.”"
2 Samuel,7,4,"But in the same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,"
2 Samuel,7,5,"“Go and say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Are you the one who should build Me a house to dwell in?"
2 Samuel,7,6,"For I have not dwelt in a house since the day I brought up the sons of Israel from Egypt, even to this day; but I have been moving about in a tent, even in a tabernacle."
2 Samuel,7,7,"Wherever I have gone with all the sons of Israel, did I speak a word with one of the tribes of Israel, which I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’”’"
2 Samuel,7,8,"“Now therefore, thus you shall say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, “I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people Israel."
2 Samuel,7,9,"I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great name, like the names of the great men who are on the earth."
2 Samuel,7,10,"I will also appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them, that they may live in their own place and not be disturbed again, nor will the wicked afflict them any more as formerly,"
2 Samuel,7,11,even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. The LORD also declares to you that the LORD will make a house for you.
2 Samuel,7,12,"When your days are complete and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, who will come forth from you, and I will establish his kingdom."
2 Samuel,7,13,"He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever."
2 Samuel,7,14,"I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men,"
2 Samuel,7,15,"but My lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you."
2 Samuel,7,16,Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.”’”
2 Samuel,7,17,"In accordance with all these words and all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David."
2 Samuel,7,18,"Then David the king went in and sat before the LORD, and he said, “Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that You have brought me this far?"
2 Samuel,7,19,"And yet this was insignificant in Your eyes, O Lord GOD, for You have spoken also of the house of Your servant concerning the distant future. And this is the custom of man, O Lord GOD."
2 Samuel,7,20,"Again what more can David say to You? For You know Your servant, O Lord GOD!"
2 Samuel,7,21,"For the sake of Your word, and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness to let Your servant know."
2 Samuel,7,22,"For this reason You are great, O Lord GOD; for there is none like You, and there is no God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears."
2 Samuel,7,23,"And what one nation on the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people and to make a name for Himself, and to do a great thing for You and awesome things for Your land, before Your people whom You have redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, from nations and their gods?"
2 Samuel,7,24,"For You have established for Yourself Your people Israel as Your own people forever, and You, O LORD, have become their God."
2 Samuel,7,25,"Now therefore, O LORD God, the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house, confirm it forever, and do as You have spoken,"
2 Samuel,7,26,"that Your name may be magnified forever, by saying, ‘The LORD of hosts is God over Israel’; and may the house of Your servant David be established before You."
2 Samuel,7,27,"For You, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have made a revelation to Your servant, saying, ‘I will build you a house’; therefore Your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to You."
2 Samuel,7,28,"Now, O Lord GOD, You are God, and Your words are truth, and You have promised this good thing to Your servant."
2 Samuel,7,29,"Now therefore, may it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You. For You, O Lord GOD, have spoken; and with Your blessing may the house of Your servant be blessed forever.”"
2 Samuel,8,1,Now after this it came about that David defeated the Philistines and subdued them; and David took control of the chief city from the hand of the Philistines.
2 Samuel,8,2,"He defeated Moab, and measured them with the line, making them lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, bringing tribute."
2 Samuel,8,3,"Then David defeated Hadadezer, the son of Rehob king of Zobah, as he went to restore his rule at the River."
2 Samuel,8,4,"David captured from him 1,700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers; and David hamstrung the chariot horses, but reserved enough of them for 100 chariots."
2 Samuel,8,5,"When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David killed 22,000 Arameans."
2 Samuel,8,6,"Then David put garrisons among the Arameans of Damascus, and the Arameans became servants to David, bringing tribute. And the LORD helped David wherever he went."
2 Samuel,8,7,David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel,8,8,"From Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a very large amount of bronze."
2 Samuel,8,9,"Now when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer,"
2 Samuel,8,10,"Toi sent Joram his son to King David to greet him and bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him; for Hadadezer had been at war with Toi. And Joram brought with him articles of silver, of gold and of bronze."
2 Samuel,8,11,"King David also dedicated these to the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated from all the nations which he had subdued:"
2 Samuel,8,12,"from Aram and Moab and the sons of Ammon and the Philistines and Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah."
2 Samuel,8,13,"So David made a name for himself when he returned from killing 18,000 Arameans in the Valley of Salt."
2 Samuel,8,14,"He put garrisons in Edom. In all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the LORD helped David wherever he went."
2 Samuel,8,15,So David reigned over all Israel; and David administered justice and righteousness for all his people.
2 Samuel,8,16,"Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder."
2 Samuel,8,17,"Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests, and Seraiah was secretary."
2 Samuel,8,18,Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief ministers.
2 Samuel,9,1,"Then David said, “Is there yet anyone left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?”"
2 Samuel,9,2,"Now there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” And he said, “I am your servant.”"
2 Samuel,9,3,"The king said, “Is there not yet anyone of the house of Saul to whom I may show the kindness of God?” And Ziba said to the king, “There is still a son of Jonathan who is crippled in both feet.”"
2 Samuel,9,4,"So the king said to him, “Where is he?” And Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel in Lo-debar.”"
2 Samuel,9,5,"Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar."
2 Samuel,9,6,"Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face and prostrated himself. And David said, “Mephibosheth.” And he said, “Here is your servant!”"
2 Samuel,9,7,"David said to him, “Do not fear, for I will surely show kindness to you for the sake of your father Jonathan, and will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul; and you shall eat at my table regularly.”"
2 Samuel,9,8,"Again he prostrated himself and said, “What is your servant, that you should regard a dead dog like me?”"
2 Samuel,9,9,"Then the king called Saul’s servant Ziba and said to him, “All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master’s grandson."
2 Samuel,9,10,"You and your sons and your servants shall cultivate the land for him, and you shall bring in the produce so that your master’s grandson may have food; nevertheless Mephibosheth your master’s grandson shall eat at my table regularly.” Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants."
2 Samuel,9,11,"Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king commands his servant so your servant will do.” So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table as one of the king’s sons."
2 Samuel,9,12,Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. And all who lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.
2 Samuel,9,13,"So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he ate at the king’s table regularly. Now he was lame in both feet."
2 Samuel,10,1,"Now it happened afterwards that the king of the Ammonites died, and Hanun his son became king in his place."
2 Samuel,10,2,"Then David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent some of his servants to console him concerning his father. But when David’s servants came to the land of the Ammonites,"
2 Samuel,10,3,"the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David is honoring your father because he has sent consolers to you? Has David not sent his servants to you in order to search the city, to spy it out and overthrow it?”"
2 Samuel,10,4,"So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved off half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle as far as their hips, and sent them away."
2 Samuel,10,5,"When they told it to David, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly humiliated. And the king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards grow, and then return.”"
2 Samuel,10,6,"Now when the sons of Ammon saw that they had become odious to David, the sons of Ammon sent and hired the Arameans of Beth-rehob and the Arameans of Zobah, 20,000 foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with 1,000 men, and the men of Tob with 12,000 men."
2 Samuel,10,7,"When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army, the mighty men."
2 Samuel,10,8,"The sons of Ammon came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, while the Arameans of Zobah and of Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the field."
2 Samuel,10,9,"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and in the rear, he selected from all the choice men of Israel, and arrayed them against the Arameans."
2 Samuel,10,10,"But the remainder of the people he placed in the hand of Abishai his brother, and he arrayed them against the sons of Ammon."
2 Samuel,10,11,"He said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come to help you."
2 Samuel,10,12,"Be strong, and let us show ourselves courageous for the sake of our people and for the cities of our God; and may the LORD do what is good in His sight.”"
2 Samuel,10,13,"So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Arameans, and they fled before him."
2 Samuel,10,14,"When the sons of Ammon saw that the Arameans fled, they also fled before Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab returned from fighting against the sons of Ammon and came to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,10,15,"When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together."
2 Samuel,10,16,"And Hadadezer sent and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the River, and they came to Helam; and Shobach the commander of the army of Hadadezer led them."
2 Samuel,10,17,"Now when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Arameans arrayed themselves to meet David and fought against him."
2 Samuel,10,18,"But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed 700 charioteers of the Arameans and 40,000 horsemen and struck down Shobach the commander of their army, and he died there."
2 Samuel,10,19,"When all the kings, servants of Hadadezer, saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them. So the Arameans feared to help the sons of Ammon anymore."
2 Samuel,11,1,"Then it happened in the spring, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab and his servants with him and all Israel, and they destroyed the sons of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,11,2,"Now when evening came David arose from his bed and walked around on the roof of the king’s house, and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful in appearance."
2 Samuel,11,3,"So David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, “Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?”"
2 Samuel,11,4,"David sent messengers and took her, and when she came to him, he lay with her; and when she had purified herself from her uncleanness, she returned to her house."
2 Samuel,11,5,"The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, “I am pregnant.”"
2 Samuel,11,6,"Then David sent to Joab, saying, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent Uriah to David."
2 Samuel,11,7,"When Uriah came to him, David asked concerning the welfare of Joab and the people and the state of the war."
2 Samuel,11,8,"Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house, and wash your feet.” And Uriah went out of the king’s house, and a present from the king was sent out after him."
2 Samuel,11,9,"But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house."
2 Samuel,11,10,"Now when they told David, saying, “Uriah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?”"
2 Samuel,11,11,"Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in temporary shelters, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Shall I then go to my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? By your life and the life of your soul, I will not do this thing.”"
2 Samuel,11,12,"Then David said to Uriah, “Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you go.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next."
2 Samuel,11,13,"Now David called him, and he ate and drank before him, and he made him drunk; and in the evening he went out to lie on his bed with his lord’s servants, but he did not go down to his house."
2 Samuel,11,14,Now in the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
2 Samuel,11,15,"He had written in the letter, saying, “Place Uriah in the front line of the fiercest battle and withdraw from him, so that he may be struck down and die.”"
2 Samuel,11,16,"So it was as Joab kept watch on the city, that he put Uriah at the place where he knew there were valiant men."
2 Samuel,11,17,"The men of the city went out and fought against Joab, and some of the people among David’s servants fell; and Uriah the Hittite also died."
2 Samuel,11,18,Then Joab sent and reported to David all the events of the war.
2 Samuel,11,19,"He charged the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling all the events of the war to the king,"
2 Samuel,11,20,"and if it happens that the king’s wrath rises and he says to you, ‘Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?"
2 Samuel,11,21,"Who struck down Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman throw an upper millstone on him from the wall so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’—then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.’”"
2 Samuel,11,22,So the messenger departed and came and reported to David all that Joab had sent him to tell.
2 Samuel,11,23,"The messenger said to David, “The men prevailed against us and came out against us in the field, but we pressed them as far as the entrance of the gate."
2 Samuel,11,24,"Moreover, the archers shot at your servants from the wall; so some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.”"
2 Samuel,11,25,"Then David said to the messenger, “Thus you shall say to Joab, ‘Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another; make your battle against the city stronger and overthrow it’; and so encourage him.”"
2 Samuel,11,26,"Now when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband."
2 Samuel,11,27,"When the time of mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house and she became his wife; then she bore him a son. But the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of the LORD."
2 Samuel,12,1,"Then the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him and said, “There were two men in one city, the one rich and the other poor."
2 Samuel,12,2,“The rich man had a great many flocks and herds.
2 Samuel,12,3,"“But the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb Which he bought and nourished; And it grew up together with him and his children. It would eat of his bread and drink of his cup and lie in his bosom, And was like a daughter to him."
2 Samuel,12,4,"“Now a traveler came to the rich man, And he was unwilling to take from his own flock or his own herd, To prepare for the wayfarer who had come to him; Rather he took the poor man’s ewe lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”"
2 Samuel,12,5,"Then David’s anger burned greatly against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As the LORD lives, surely the man who has done this deserves to die."
2 Samuel,12,6,"He must make restitution for the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing and had no compassion.”"
2 Samuel,12,7,"Nathan then said to David, “You are the man! Thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘It is I who anointed you king over Israel and it is I who delivered you from the hand of Saul."
2 Samuel,12,8,"I also gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives into your care, and I gave you the house of Israel and Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added to you many more things like these!"
2 Samuel,12,9,"Why have you despised the word of the LORD by doing evil in His sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword, have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon."
2 Samuel,12,10,"Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’"
2 Samuel,12,11,"Thus says the LORD, ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you from your own household; I will even take your wives before your eyes and give them to your companion, and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight."
2 Samuel,12,12,"Indeed you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and under the sun.’”"
2 Samuel,12,13,"Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.” And Nathan said to David, “The LORD also has taken away your sin; you shall not die."
2 Samuel,12,14,"However, because by this deed you have given occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born to you shall surely die.”"
2 Samuel,12,15,"Then the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s widow bore to David, so that he was very sick."
2 Samuel,12,16,David therefore inquired of God for the child; and David fasted and went and lay all night on the ground.
2 Samuel,12,17,"The elders of his household stood beside him in order to raise him up from the ground, but he was unwilling and would not eat food with them."
2 Samuel,12,18,"Then it happened on the seventh day that the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Behold, while the child was still alive, we spoke to him and he did not listen to our voice. How then can we tell him that the child is dead, since he might do himself harm!”"
2 Samuel,12,19,"But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; so David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” And they said, “He is dead.”"
2 Samuel,12,20,"So David arose from the ground, washed, anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he came into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he came to his own house, and when he requested, they set food before him and he ate."
2 Samuel,12,21,"Then his servants said to him, “What is this thing that you have done? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept; but when the child died, you arose and ate food.”"
2 Samuel,12,22,"He said, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who knows, the LORD may be gracious to me, that the child may live.’"
2 Samuel,12,23,"But now he has died; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”"
2 Samuel,12,24,"Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and went in to her and lay with her; and she gave birth to a son, and he named him Solomon. Now the LORD loved him"
2 Samuel,12,25,"and sent word through Nathan the prophet, and he named him Jedidiah for the LORD’S sake."
2 Samuel,12,26,Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon and captured the royal city.
2 Samuel,12,27,"Joab sent messengers to David and said, “I have fought against Rabbah, I have even captured the city of waters."
2 Samuel,12,28,"Now therefore, gather the rest of the people together and camp against the city and capture it, or I will capture the city myself and it will be named after me.”"
2 Samuel,12,29,"So David gathered all the people and went to Rabbah, fought against it and captured it."
2 Samuel,12,30,"Then he took the crown of their king from his head; and its weight was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone; and it was placed on David’s head. And he brought out the spoil of the city in great amounts."
2 Samuel,12,31,"He also brought out the people who were in it, and set them under saws, sharp iron instruments, and iron axes, and made them pass through the brickkiln. And thus he did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,13,1,"Now it was after this that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar, and Amnon the son of David loved her."
2 Samuel,13,2,"Amnon was so frustrated because of his sister Tamar that he made himself ill, for she was a virgin, and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her."
2 Samuel,13,3,"But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very shrewd man."
2 Samuel,13,4,"He said to him, “O son of the king, why are you so depressed morning after morning? Will you not tell me?” Then Amnon said to him, “I am in love with Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom.”"
2 Samuel,13,5,"Jonadab then said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill; when your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me some food to eat, and let her prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat from her hand.’”"
2 Samuel,13,6,"So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill; when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”"
2 Samuel,13,7,"Then David sent to the house for Tamar, saying, “Go now to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.”"
2 Samuel,13,8,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house, and he was lying down. And she took dough, kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes."
2 Samuel,13,9,"She took the pan and dished them out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, “Have everyone go out from me.” So everyone went out from him."
2 Samuel,13,10,"Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom, that I may eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the bedroom to her brother Amnon."
2 Samuel,13,11,"When she brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister.”"
2 Samuel,13,12,"But she answered him, “No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this disgraceful thing!"
2 Samuel,13,13,"As for me, where could I get rid of my reproach? And as for you, you will be like one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.”"
2 Samuel,13,14,"However, he would not listen to her; since he was stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her."
2 Samuel,13,15,"Then Amnon hated her with a very great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, “Get up, go away!”"
2 Samuel,13,16,"But she said to him, “No, because this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you have done to me!” Yet he would not listen to her."
2 Samuel,13,17,"Then he called his young man who attended him and said, “Now throw this woman out of my presence, and lock the door behind her.”"
2 Samuel,13,18,Now she had on a long-sleeved garment; for in this manner the virgin daughters of the king dressed themselves in robes. Then his attendant took her out and locked the door behind her.
2 Samuel,13,19,"Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her long-sleeved garment which was on her; and she put her hand on her head and went away, crying aloud as she went."
2 Samuel,13,20,"Then Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now keep silent, my sister, he is your brother; do not take this matter to heart.” So Tamar remained and was desolate in her brother Absalom’s house."
2 Samuel,13,21,"Now when King David heard of all these matters, he was very angry."
2 Samuel,13,22,But Absalom did not speak to Amnon either good or bad; for Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar.
2 Samuel,13,23,"Now it came about after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king’s sons."
2 Samuel,13,24,"Absalom came to the king and said, “Behold now, your servant has sheepshearers; please let the king and his servants go with your servant.”"
2 Samuel,13,25,"But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, we should not all go, for we will be burdensome to you.” Although he urged him, he would not go, but blessed him."
2 Samuel,13,26,"Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.” And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”"
2 Samuel,13,27,"But when Absalom urged him, he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him."
2 Samuel,13,28,"Absalom commanded his servants, saying, “See now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then put him to death. Do not fear; have not I myself commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant.”"
2 Samuel,13,29,The servants of Absalom did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose and each mounted his mule and fled.
2 Samuel,13,30,"Now it was while they were on the way that the report came to David, saying, “Absalom has struck down all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left.”"
2 Samuel,13,31,"Then the king arose, tore his clothes and lay on the ground; and all his servants were standing by with clothes torn."
2 Samuel,13,32,"Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, responded, “Do not let my lord suppose they have put to death all the young men, the king’s sons, for Amnon alone is dead; because by the intent of Absalom this has been determined since the day that he violated his sister Tamar."
2 Samuel,13,33,"Now therefore, do not let my lord the king take the report to heart, namely, ‘all the king’s sons are dead,’ for only Amnon is dead.”"
2 Samuel,13,34,"Now Absalom had fled. And the young man who was the watchman raised his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain."
2 Samuel,13,35,"Jonadab said to the king, “Behold, the king’s sons have come; according to your servant’s word, so it happened.”"
2 Samuel,13,36,"As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king’s sons came and lifted their voices and wept; and also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly."
2 Samuel,13,37,"Now Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day."
2 Samuel,13,38,"So Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur, and was there three years."
2 Samuel,13,39,"The heart of King David longed to go out to Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead."
2 Samuel,14,1,Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was inclined toward Absalom.
2 Samuel,14,2,"So Joab sent to Tekoa and brought a wise woman from there and said to her, “Please pretend to be a mourner, and put on mourning garments now, and do not anoint yourself with oil, but be like a woman who has been mourning for the dead many days;"
2 Samuel,14,3,then go to the king and speak to him in this manner.” So Joab put the words in her mouth.
2 Samuel,14,4,"Now when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself and said, “Help, O king.”"
2 Samuel,14,5,"The king said to her, “What is your trouble?” And she answered, “Truly I am a widow, for my husband is dead."
2 Samuel,14,6,"Your maidservant had two sons, but the two of them struggled together in the field, and there was no one to separate them, so one struck the other and killed him."
2 Samuel,14,7,"Now behold, the whole family has risen against your maidservant, and they say, ‘Hand over the one who struck his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed, and destroy the heir also.’ Thus they will extinguish my coal which is left, so as to leave my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth.”"
2 Samuel,14,8,"Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.”"
2 Samuel,14,9,"The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “O my lord, the king, the iniquity is on me and my father’s house, but the king and his throne are guiltless.”"
2 Samuel,14,10,"So the king said, “Whoever speaks to you, bring him to me, and he will not touch you anymore.”"
2 Samuel,14,11,"Then she said, “Please let the king remember the LORD your God, so that the avenger of blood will not continue to destroy, otherwise they will destroy my son.” And he said, “As the LORD lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.”"
2 Samuel,14,12,"Then the woman said, “Please let your maidservant speak a word to my lord the king.” And he said, “Speak.”"
2 Samuel,14,13,"The woman said, “Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring back his banished one."
2 Samuel,14,14,"For we will surely die and are like water spilled on the ground which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not take away life, but plans ways so that the banished one will not be cast out from him."
2 Samuel,14,15,"Now the reason I have come to speak this word to my lord the king is that the people have made me afraid; so your maidservant said, ‘Let me now speak to the king, perhaps the king will perform the request of his maidservant."
2 Samuel,14,16,For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man who would destroy both me and my son from the inheritance of God.’
2 Samuel,14,17,"Then your maidservant said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king be comforting, for as the angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and evil. And may the LORD your God be with you.’”"
2 Samuel,14,18,"Then the king answered and said to the woman, “Please do not hide anything from me that I am about to ask you.” And the woman said, “Let my lord the king please speak.”"
2 Samuel,14,19,"So the king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” And the woman replied, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. Indeed, it was your servant Joab who commanded me, and it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant;"
2 Samuel,14,20,"in order to change the appearance of things your servant Joab has done this thing. But my lord is wise, like the wisdom of the angel of God, to know all that is in the earth.”"
2 Samuel,14,21,"Then the king said to Joab, “Behold now, I will surely do this thing; go therefore, bring back the young man Absalom.”"
2 Samuel,14,22,"Joab fell on his face to the ground, prostrated himself and blessed the king; then Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, O my lord, the king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.”"
2 Samuel,14,23,So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel,14,24,"However the king said, “Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face.” So Absalom turned to his own house and did not see the king’s face."
2 Samuel,14,25,"Now in all Israel was no one as handsome as Absalom, so highly praised; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no defect in him."
2 Samuel,14,26,"When he cut the hair of his head (and it was at the end of every year that he cut it, for it was heavy on him so he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head at 200 shekels by the king’s weight."
2 Samuel,14,27,"To Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of beautiful appearance."
2 Samuel,14,28,"Now Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, and did not see the king’s face."
2 Samuel,14,29,"Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. So he sent again a second time, but he would not come."
2 Samuel,14,30,"Therefore he said to his servants, “See, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire."
2 Samuel,14,31,"Then Joab arose, came to Absalom at his house and said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?”"
2 Samuel,14,32,"Absalom answered Joab, “Behold, I sent for you, saying, ‘Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me still to be there.”’ Now therefore, let me see the king’s face, and if there is iniquity in me, let him put me to death.”"
2 Samuel,14,33,"So when Joab came to the king and told him, he called for Absalom. Thus he came to the king and prostrated himself on his face to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom."
2 Samuel,15,1,Now it came about after this that Absalom provided for himself a chariot and horses and fifty men as runners before him.
2 Samuel,15,2,"Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the way to the gate; and when any man had a suit to come to the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, “From what city are you?” And he would say, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.”"
2 Samuel,15,3,"Then Absalom would say to him, “See, your claims are good and right, but no man listens to you on the part of the king.”"
2 Samuel,15,4,"Moreover, Absalom would say, “Oh that one would appoint me judge in the land, then every man who has any suit or cause could come to me and I would give him justice.”"
2 Samuel,15,5,"And when a man came near to prostrate himself before him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him."
2 Samuel,15,6,In this manner Absalom dealt with all Israel who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole away the hearts of the men of Israel.
2 Samuel,15,7,"Now it came about at the end of forty years that Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron."
2 Samuel,15,8,"For your servant vowed a vow while I was living at Geshur in Aram, saying, ‘If the LORD shall indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.’”"
2 Samuel,15,9,"The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he arose and went to Hebron."
2 Samuel,15,10,"But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron.’”"
2 Samuel,15,11,"Then two hundred men went with Absalom from Jerusalem, who were invited and went innocently, and they did not know anything."
2 Samuel,15,12,"And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people increased continually with Absalom."
2 Samuel,15,13,"Then a messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.”"
2 Samuel,15,14,"David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise and let us flee, for otherwise none of us will escape from Absalom. Go in haste, or he will overtake us quickly and bring down calamity on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword.”"
2 Samuel,15,15,"Then the king’s servants said to the king, “Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses.”"
2 Samuel,15,16,So the king went out and all his household with him. But the king left ten concubines to keep the house.
2 Samuel,15,17,"The king went out and all the people with him, and they stopped at the last house."
2 Samuel,15,18,"Now all his servants passed on beside him, all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had come with him from Gath, passed on before the king."
2 Samuel,15,19,"Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why will you also go with us? Return and remain with the king, for you are a foreigner and also an exile; return to your own place."
2 Samuel,15,20,"You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander with us, while I go where I will? Return and take back your brothers; mercy and truth be with you.”"
2 Samuel,15,21,"But Ittai answered the king and said, “As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely wherever my lord the king may be, whether for death or for life, there also your servant will be.”"
2 Samuel,15,22,"Therefore David said to Ittai, “Go and pass over.” So Ittai the Gittite passed over with all his men and all the little ones who were with him."
2 Samuel,15,23,"While all the country was weeping with a loud voice, all the people passed over. The king also passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness."
2 Samuel,15,24,"Now behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him carrying the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar came up until all the people had finished passing from the city."
2 Samuel,15,25,"The king said to Zadok, “Return the ark of God to the city. If I find favor in the sight of the LORD, then He will bring me back again and show me both it and His habitation."
2 Samuel,15,26,"But if He should say thus, ‘I have no delight in you,’ behold, here I am, let Him do to me as seems good to Him.”"
2 Samuel,15,27,"The king said also to Zadok the priest, “Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace and your two sons with you, your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan the son of Abiathar."
2 Samuel,15,28,"See, I am going to wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.”"
2 Samuel,15,29,Therefore Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and remained there.
2 Samuel,15,30,"And David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went, and his head was covered and he walked barefoot. Then all the people who were with him each covered his head and went up weeping as they went."
2 Samuel,15,31,"Now someone told David, saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” And David said, “O LORD, I pray, make the counsel of Ahithophel foolishness.”"
2 Samuel,15,32,"It happened as David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, that behold, Hushai the Archite met him with his coat torn and dust on his head."
2 Samuel,15,33,"David said to him, “If you pass over with me, then you will be a burden to me."
2 Samuel,15,34,"But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father’s servant in time past, so I will now be your servant,’ then you can thwart the counsel of Ahithophel for me."
2 Samuel,15,35,"Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? So it shall be that whatever you hear from the king’s house, you shall report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests."
2 Samuel,15,36,"Behold their two sons are with them there, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by them you shall send me everything that you hear.”"
2 Samuel,15,37,"So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,16,1,"Now when David had passed a little beyond the summit, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and on them were two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a jug of wine."
2 Samuel,16,2,"The king said to Ziba, “Why do you have these?” And Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride, and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine, for whoever is faint in the wilderness to drink.”"
2 Samuel,16,3,"Then the king said, “And where is your master’s son?” And Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.’”"
2 Samuel,16,4,"So the king said to Ziba, “Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.” And Ziba said, “I prostrate myself; let me find favor in your sight, O my lord, the king!”"
2 Samuel,16,5,"When King David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out from there a man of the family of the house of Saul whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out cursing continually as he came."
2 Samuel,16,6,He threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David; and all the people and all the mighty men were at his right hand and at his left.
2 Samuel,16,7,"Thus Shimei said when he cursed, “Get out, get out, you man of bloodshed, and worthless fellow!"
2 Samuel,16,8,"The LORD has returned upon you all the bloodshed of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. And behold, you are taken in your own evil, for you are a man of bloodshed!”"
2 Samuel,16,9,"Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over now and cut off his head.”"
2 Samuel,16,10,"But the king said, “What have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah? If he curses, and if the LORD has told him, ‘Curse David,’ then who shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’”"
2 Samuel,16,11,"Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Behold, my son who came out from me seeks my life; how much more now this Benjamite? Let him alone and let him curse, for the LORD has told him."
2 Samuel,16,12,Perhaps the LORD will look on my affliction and return good to me instead of his cursing this day.”
2 Samuel,16,13,So David and his men went on the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside parallel with him and as he went he cursed and cast stones and threw dust at him.
2 Samuel,16,14,The king and all the people who were with him arrived weary and he refreshed himself there.
2 Samuel,16,15,"Then Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, entered Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him."
2 Samuel,16,16,"Now it came about when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”"
2 Samuel,16,17,"Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?”"
2 Samuel,16,18,"Then Hushai said to Absalom, “No! For whom the LORD, this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I will be, and with him I will remain."
2 Samuel,16,19,"Besides, whom should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father’s presence, so I will be in your presence.”"
2 Samuel,16,20,"Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your advice. What shall we do?”"
2 Samuel,16,21,"Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself odious to your father. The hands of all who are with you will also be strengthened.”"
2 Samuel,16,22,"So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel."
2 Samuel,16,23,"The advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if one inquired of the word of God; so was all the advice of Ahithophel regarded by both David and Absalom."
2 Samuel,17,1,"Furthermore, Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Please let me choose 12,000 men that I may arise and pursue David tonight."
2 Samuel,17,2,"I will come upon him while he is weary and exhausted and terrify him, so that all the people who are with him will flee. Then I will strike down the king alone,"
2 Samuel,17,3,and I will bring back all the people to you. The return of everyone depends on the man you seek; then all the people will be at peace.”
2 Samuel,17,4,So the plan pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
2 Samuel,17,5,"Then Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say.”"
2 Samuel,17,6,"When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom said to him, “Ahithophel has spoken thus. Shall we carry out his plan? If not, you speak.”"
2 Samuel,17,7,"So Hushai said to Absalom, “This time the advice that Ahithophel has given is not good.”"
2 Samuel,17,8,"Moreover, Hushai said, “You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men and they are fierce, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. And your father is an expert in warfare, and will not spend the night with the people."
2 Samuel,17,9,"Behold, he has now hidden himself in one of the caves or in another place; and it will be when he falls on them at the first attack, that whoever hears it will say, ‘There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.’"
2 Samuel,17,10,"And even the one who is valiant, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will completely lose heart; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and those who are with him are valiant men."
2 Samuel,17,11,"But I counsel that all Israel be surely gathered to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea in abundance, and that you personally go into battle."
2 Samuel,17,12,"So we shall come to him in one of the places where he can be found, and we will fall on him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him, not even one will be left."
2 Samuel,17,13,"If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it into the valley until not even a small stone is found there.”"
2 Samuel,17,14,"Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” For the LORD had ordained to thwart the good counsel of Ahithophel, so that the LORD might bring calamity on Absalom."
2 Samuel,17,15,"Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “This is what Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this is what I have counseled."
2 Samuel,17,16,"Now therefore, send quickly and tell David, saying, ‘Do not spend the night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means cross over, or else the king and all the people who are with him will be destroyed.’”"
2 Samuel,17,17,"Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel, and a maidservant would go and tell them, and they would go and tell King David, for they could not be seen entering the city."
2 Samuel,17,18,"But a lad did see them and told Absalom; so the two of them departed quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard, and they went down into it."
2 Samuel,17,19,"And the woman took a covering and spread it over the well’s mouth and scattered grain on it, so that nothing was known."
2 Samuel,17,20,"Then Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house and said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” And the woman said to them, “They have crossed the brook of water.” And when they searched and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,17,21,"It came about after they had departed that they came up out of the well and went and told King David; and they said to David, “Arise and cross over the water quickly for thus Ahithophel has counseled against you.”"
2 Samuel,17,22,Then David and all the people who were with him arose and crossed the Jordan; and by dawn not even one remained who had not crossed the Jordan.
2 Samuel,17,23,"Now when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey and arose and went to his home, to his city, and set his house in order, and strangled himself; thus he died and was buried in the grave of his father."
2 Samuel,17,24,"Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him."
2 Samuel,17,25,"Absalom set Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother."
2 Samuel,17,26,And Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.
2 Samuel,17,27,"Now when David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim,"
2 Samuel,17,28,"brought beds, basins, pottery, wheat, barley, flour, parched grain, beans, lentils, parched seeds,"
2 Samuel,17,29,"honey, curds, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David and for the people who were with him, to eat; for they said, “The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.”"
2 Samuel,18,1,Then David numbered the people who were with him and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
2 Samuel,18,2,"David sent the people out, one third under the command of Joab, one third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, “I myself will surely go out with you also.”"
2 Samuel,18,3,"But the people said, “You should not go out; for if we indeed flee, they will not care about us; even if half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that you be ready to help us from the city.”"
2 Samuel,18,4,"Then the king said to them, “Whatever seems best to you I will do.” So the king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and thousands."
2 Samuel,18,5,"The king charged Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom.” And all the people heard when the king charged all the commanders concerning Absalom."
2 Samuel,18,6,"Then the people went out into the field against Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim."
2 Samuel,18,7,"The people of Israel were defeated there before the servants of David, and the slaughter there that day was great, 20,000 men."
2 Samuel,18,8,"For the battle there was spread over the whole countryside, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured."
2 Samuel,18,9,"Now Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. For Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak. And his head caught fast in the oak, so he was left hanging between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him kept going."
2 Samuel,18,10,"When a certain man saw it, he told Joab and said, “Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.”"
2 Samuel,18,11,"Then Joab said to the man who had told him, “Now behold, you saw him! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? And I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a belt.”"
2 Samuel,18,12,"The man said to Joab, “Even if I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I would not put out my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Protect for me the young man Absalom!’"
2 Samuel,18,13,"Otherwise, if I had dealt treacherously against his life (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have stood aloof.”"
2 Samuel,18,14,"Then Joab said, “I will not waste time here with you.” So he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak."
2 Samuel,18,15,And ten young men who carried Joab’s armor gathered around and struck Absalom and killed him.
2 Samuel,18,16,"Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained the people."
2 Samuel,18,17,"They took Absalom and cast him into a deep pit in the forest and erected over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled, each to his tent."
2 Samuel,18,18,"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself a pillar which is in the King’s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to preserve my name.” So he named the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom’s Monument to this day."
2 Samuel,18,19,"Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Please let me run and bring the king news that the LORD has freed him from the hand of his enemies.”"
2 Samuel,18,20,"But Joab said to him, “You are not the man to carry news this day, but you shall carry news another day; however, you shall carry no news today because the king’s son is dead.”"
2 Samuel,18,21,"Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” So the Cushite bowed to Joab and ran."
2 Samuel,18,22,"Now Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said once more to Joab, “But whatever happens, please let me also run after the Cushite.” And Joab said, “Why would you run, my son, since you will have no reward for going?”"
2 Samuel,18,23,"“But whatever happens,” he said, “I will run.” So he said to him, “Run.” Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and passed up the Cushite."
2 Samuel,18,24,"Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall, and raised his eyes and looked, and behold, a man running by himself."
2 Samuel,18,25,"The watchman called and told the king. And the king said, “If he is by himself there is good news in his mouth.” And he came nearer and nearer."
2 Samuel,18,26,"Then the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said, “Behold, another man running by himself.” And the king said, “This one also is bringing good news.”"
2 Samuel,18,27,"The watchman said, “I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” And the king said, “This is a good man and comes with good news.”"
2 Samuel,18,28,"Ahimaaz called and said to the king, “All is well.” And he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground. And he said, “Blessed is the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted their hands against my lord the king.”"
2 Samuel,18,29,"The king said, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” And Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant, and your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I did not know what it was.”"
2 Samuel,18,30,"Then the king said, “Turn aside and stand here.” So he turned aside and stood still."
2 Samuel,18,31,"Behold, the Cushite arrived, and the Cushite said, “Let my lord the king receive good news, for the LORD has freed you this day from the hand of all those who rose up against you.”"
2 Samuel,18,32,"Then the king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” And the Cushite answered, “Let the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you for evil, be as that young man!”"
2 Samuel,18,33,"The king was deeply moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. And thus he said as he walked, “O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!”"
2 Samuel,19,1,"Then it was told Joab, “Behold, the king is weeping and mourns for Absalom.”"
2 Samuel,19,2,"The victory that day was turned to mourning for all the people, for the people heard it said that day, “The king is grieved for his son.”"
2 Samuel,19,3,"So the people went by stealth into the city that day, as people who are humiliated steal away when they flee in battle."
2 Samuel,19,4,"The king covered his face and cried out with a loud voice, “O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!”"
2 Samuel,19,5,"Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, “Today you have covered with shame the faces of all your servants, who today have saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters, the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines,"
2 Samuel,19,6,"by loving those who hate you, and by hating those who love you. For you have shown today that princes and servants are nothing to you; for I know this day that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased."
2 Samuel,19,7,"Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants, for I swear by the LORD, if you do not go out, surely not a man will pass the night with you, and this will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now.”"
2 Samuel,19,8,"So the king arose and sat in the gate. When they told all the people, saying, “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate,” then all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled, each to his tent."
2 Samuel,19,9,"All the people were quarreling throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies and saved us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled out of the land from Absalom."
2 Samuel,19,10,"However, Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. Now then, why are you silent about bringing the king back?”"
2 Samuel,19,11,"Then King David sent to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house, since the word of all Israel has come to the king, even to his house?"
2 Samuel,19,12,You are my brothers; you are my bone and my flesh. Why then should you be the last to bring back the king?’
2 Samuel,19,13,"Say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God do so to me, and more also, if you will not be commander of the army before me continually in place of Joab.’”"
2 Samuel,19,14,"Thus he turned the hearts of all the men of Judah as one man, so that they sent word to the king, saying, “Return, you and all your servants.”"
2 Samuel,19,15,"The king then returned and came as far as the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal in order to go to meet the king, to bring the king across the Jordan."
2 Samuel,19,16,"Then Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite who was from Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David."
2 Samuel,19,17,"There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, with Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they rushed to the Jordan before the king."
2 Samuel,19,18,"Then they kept crossing the ford to bring over the king’s household, and to do what was good in his sight. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was about to cross the Jordan."
2 Samuel,19,19,"So he said to the king, “Let not my lord consider me guilty, nor remember what your servant did wrong on the day when my lord the king came out from Jerusalem, so that the king would take it to heart."
2 Samuel,19,20,"For your servant knows that I have sinned; therefore behold, I have come today, the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.”"
2 Samuel,19,21,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah said, “Should not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’S anointed?”"
2 Samuel,19,22,"David then said, “What have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be an adversary to me? Should any man be put to death in Israel today? For do I not know that I am king over Israel today?”"
2 Samuel,19,23,"The king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” Thus the king swore to him."
2 Samuel,19,24,"Then Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither cared for his feet, nor trimmed his mustache, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace."
2 Samuel,19,25,"It was when he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, “Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?”"
2 Samuel,19,26,"So he answered, “O my lord, the king, my servant deceived me; for your servant said, ‘I will saddle a donkey for myself that I may ride on it and go with the king,’ because your servant is lame."
2 Samuel,19,27,"Moreover, he has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is like the angel of God, therefore do what is good in your sight."
2 Samuel,19,28,For all my father’s household was nothing but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right do I have yet that I should complain anymore to the king?”
2 Samuel,19,29,"So the king said to him, “Why do you still speak of your affairs? I have decided, ‘You and Ziba shall divide the land.’”"
2 Samuel,19,30,"Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him even take it all, since my lord the king has come safely to his own house.”"
2 Samuel,19,31,Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim; and he went on to the Jordan with the king to escort him over the Jordan.
2 Samuel,19,32,"Now Barzillai was very old, being eighty years old; and he had sustained the king while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man."
2 Samuel,19,33,"The king said to Barzillai, “You cross over with me and I will sustain you in Jerusalem with me.”"
2 Samuel,19,34,"But Barzillai said to the king, “How long have I yet to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?"
2 Samuel,19,35,I am now eighty years old. Can I distinguish between good and bad? Or can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Or can I hear anymore the voice of singing men and women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?
2 Samuel,19,36,Your servant would merely cross over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king compensate me with this reward?
2 Samuel,19,37,"Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. However, here is your servant Chimham, let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what is good in your sight.”"
2 Samuel,19,38,"The king answered, “Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him what is good in your sight; and whatever you require of me, I will do for you.”"
2 Samuel,19,39,"All the people crossed over the Jordan and the king crossed too. The king then kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his place."
2 Samuel,19,40,"Now the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him; and all the people of Judah and also half the people of Israel accompanied the king."
2 Samuel,19,41,"And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king, “Why had our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king and his household and all David’s men with him over the Jordan?”"
2 Samuel,19,42,"Then all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is a close relative to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king’s expense, or has anything been taken for us?”"
2 Samuel,19,43,"But the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, “We have ten parts in the king, therefore we also have more claim on David than you. Why then did you treat us with contempt? Was it not our advice first to bring back our king?” Yet the words of the men of Judah were harsher than the words of the men of Israel."
2 Samuel,20,1,"Now a worthless fellow happened to be there whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; and he blew the trumpet and said, “We have no portion in David, Nor do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse; Every man to his tents, O Israel!”"
2 Samuel,20,2,"So all the men of Israel withdrew from following David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah remained steadfast to their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,20,3,"Then David came to his house at Jerusalem, and the king took the ten women, the concubines whom he had left to keep the house, and placed them under guard and provided them with sustenance, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up until the day of their death, living as widows."
2 Samuel,20,4,"Then the king said to Amasa, “Call out the men of Judah for me within three days, and be present here yourself.”"
2 Samuel,20,5,"So Amasa went to call out the men of Judah, but he delayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him."
2 Samuel,20,6,"And David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom; take your lord’s servants and pursue him, so that he does not find for himself fortified cities and escape from our sight.”"
2 Samuel,20,7,"So Joab’s men went out after him, along with the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the mighty men; and they went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri."
2 Samuel,20,8,"When they were at the large stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was dressed in his military attire, and over it was a belt with a sword in its sheath fastened at his waist; and as he went forward, it fell out."
2 Samuel,20,9,"Joab said to Amasa, “Is it well with you, my brother?” And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him."
2 Samuel,20,10,"But Amasa was not on guard against the sword which was in Joab’s hand so he struck him in the belly with it and poured out his inward parts on the ground, and did not strike him again, and he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri."
2 Samuel,20,11,"Now there stood by him one of Joab’s young men, and said, “Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab.”"
2 Samuel,20,12,"But Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa from the highway into the field and threw a garment over him when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still."
2 Samuel,20,13,"As soon as he was removed from the highway, all the men passed on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri."
2 Samuel,20,14,"Now he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, even Beth-maacah, and all the Berites; and they were gathered together and also went after him."
2 Samuel,20,15,"They came and besieged him in Abel Beth-maacah, and they cast up a siege ramp against the city, and it stood by the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab were wreaking destruction in order to topple the wall."
2 Samuel,20,16,"Then a wise woman called from the city, “Hear, hear! Please tell Joab, ‘Come here that I may speak with you.’”"
2 Samuel,20,17,"So he approached her, and the woman said, “Are you Joab?” And he answered, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Listen to the words of your maidservant.” And he answered, “I am listening.”"
2 Samuel,20,18,"Then she spoke, saying, “Formerly they used to say, ‘They will surely ask advice at Abel,’ and thus they ended the dispute."
2 Samuel,20,19,"I am of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. You are seeking to destroy a city, even a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?”"
2 Samuel,20,20,"Joab replied, “Far be it, far be it from me that I should swallow up or destroy!"
2 Samuel,20,21,"Such is not the case. But a man from the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against King David. Only hand him over, and I will depart from the city.” And the woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.”"
2 Samuel,20,22,"Then the woman wisely came to all the people. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, each to his tent. Joab also returned to the king at Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,20,23,"Now Joab was over the whole army of Israel, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites;"
2 Samuel,20,24,"and Adoram was over the forced labor, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;"
2 Samuel,20,25,"and Sheva was scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;"
2 Samuel,20,26,and Ira the Jairite was also a priest to David.
2 Samuel,21,1,"Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David sought the presence of the LORD. And the LORD said, “It is for Saul and his bloody house, because he put the Gibeonites to death.”"
2 Samuel,21,2,"So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the sons of Israel but of the remnant of the Amorites, and the sons of Israel made a covenant with them, but Saul had sought to kill them in his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah)."
2 Samuel,21,3,"Thus David said to the Gibeonites, “What should I do for you? And how can I make atonement that you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?”"
2 Samuel,21,4,"Then the Gibeonites said to him, “We have no concern of silver or gold with Saul or his house, nor is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.” And he said, “I will do for you whatever you say.”"
2 Samuel,21,5,"So they said to the king, “The man who consumed us and who planned to exterminate us from remaining within any border of Israel,"
2 Samuel,21,6,"let seven men from his sons be given to us, and we will hang them before the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD.” And the king said, “I will give them.”"
2 Samuel,21,7,"But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the oath of the LORD which was between them, between David and Saul’s son Jonathan."
2 Samuel,21,8,"So the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, Armoni and Mephibosheth whom she had borne to Saul, and the five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul, whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite."
2 Samuel,21,9,"Then he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before the LORD, so that the seven of them fell together; and they were put to death in the first days of harvest at the beginning of barley harvest."
2 Samuel,21,10,"And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until it rained on them from the sky; and she allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night."
2 Samuel,21,11,"When it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done,"
2 Samuel,21,12,"then David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the open square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them on the day the Philistines struck down Saul in Gilboa."
2 Samuel,21,13,"He brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there, and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged."
2 Samuel,21,14,"They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the grave of Kish his father; thus they did all that the king commanded, and after that God was moved by prayer for the land."
2 Samuel,21,15,"Now when the Philistines were at war again with Israel, David went down and his servants with him; and as they fought against the Philistines, David became weary."
2 Samuel,21,16,"Then Ishbi-benob, who was among the descendants of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of bronze in weight, was girded with a new sword, and he intended to kill David."
2 Samuel,21,17,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “You shall not go out again with us to battle, so that you do not extinguish the lamp of Israel.”"
2 Samuel,21,18,"Now it came about after this that there was war again with the Philistines at Gob; then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Saph, who was among the descendants of the giant."
2 Samuel,21,19,"There was war with the Philistines again at Gob, and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam."
2 Samuel,21,20,"There was war at Gath again, where there was a man of great stature who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also had been born to the giant."
2 Samuel,21,21,"When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, struck him down."
2 Samuel,21,22,"These four were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants."
2 Samuel,22,1,And David spoke the words of this song to the LORD in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.
2 Samuel,22,2,"He said, “The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer;"
2 Samuel,22,3,"My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge; My savior, You save me from violence."
2 Samuel,22,4,"“I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, And I am saved from my enemies."
2 Samuel,22,5,“For the waves of death encompassed me; The torrents of destruction overwhelmed me;
2 Samuel,22,6,The cords of Sheol surrounded me; The snares of death confronted me.
2 Samuel,22,7,"“In my distress I called upon the LORD, Yes, I cried to my God; And from His temple He heard my voice, And my cry for help came into His ears."
2 Samuel,22,8,"“Then the earth shook and quaked, The foundations of heaven were trembling And were shaken, because He was angry."
2 Samuel,22,9,"“Smoke went up out of His nostrils, Fire from His mouth devoured; Coals were kindled by it."
2 Samuel,22,10,"“He bowed the heavens also, and came down With thick darkness under His feet."
2 Samuel,22,11,“And He rode on a cherub and flew; And He appeared on the wings of the wind.
2 Samuel,22,12,"“And He made darkness canopies around Him, A mass of waters, thick clouds of the sky."
2 Samuel,22,13,“From the brightness before Him Coals of fire were kindled.
2 Samuel,22,14,"“The LORD thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered His voice."
2 Samuel,22,15,"“And He sent out arrows, and scattered them, Lightning, and routed them."
2 Samuel,22,16,"“Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare By the rebuke of the LORD, At the blast of the breath of His nostrils."
2 Samuel,22,17,"“He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters."
2 Samuel,22,18,"“He delivered me from my strong enemy, From those who hated me, for they were too strong for me."
2 Samuel,22,19,"“They confronted me in the day of my calamity, But the LORD was my support."
2 Samuel,22,20,"“He also brought me forth into a broad place; He rescued me, because He delighted in me."
2 Samuel,22,21,“The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me.
2 Samuel,22,22,"“For I have kept the ways of the LORD, And have not acted wickedly against my God."
2 Samuel,22,23,"“For all His ordinances were before me, And as for His statutes, I did not depart from them."
2 Samuel,22,24,"“I was also blameless toward Him, And I kept myself from my iniquity."
2 Samuel,22,25,"“Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness before His eyes."
2 Samuel,22,26,"“With the kind You show Yourself kind, With the blameless You show Yourself blameless;"
2 Samuel,22,27,"With the pure You show Yourself pure, And with the perverted You show Yourself astute."
2 Samuel,22,28,“And You save an afflicted people; But Your eyes are on the haughty whom You abase.
2 Samuel,22,29,"“For You are my lamp, O LORD; And the LORD illumines my darkness."
2 Samuel,22,30,“For by You I can run upon a troop; By my God I can leap over a wall.
2 Samuel,22,31,"“As for God, His way is blameless; The word of the LORD is tested; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him."
2 Samuel,22,32,"“For who is God, besides the LORD? And who is a rock, besides our God?"
2 Samuel,22,33,“God is my strong fortress; And He sets the blameless in His way.
2 Samuel,22,34,"“He makes my feet like hinds’ feet, And sets me on my high places."

2 Samuel,22,37,"“You enlarge my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped."
2 Samuel,22,38,"“I pursued my enemies and destroyed them, And I did not turn back until they were consumed."
2 Samuel,22,39,"“And I have devoured them and shattered them, so that they did not rise; And they fell under my feet."
2 Samuel,22,40,“For You have girded me with strength for battle; You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
2 Samuel,22,41,"“You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, And I destroyed those who hated me."
2 Samuel,22,42,"“They looked, but there was none to save; Even to the LORD, but He did not answer them."
2 Samuel,22,43,“Then I pulverized them as the dust of the earth; I crushed and stamped them as the mire of the streets.
2 Samuel,22,44,“You have also delivered me from the contentions of my people; You have kept me as head of the nations; A people whom I have not known serve me.
2 Samuel,22,45,"“Foreigners pretend obedience to me; As soon as they hear, they obey me."
2 Samuel,22,46,"“Foreigners lose heart, And come trembling out of their fortresses."
2 Samuel,22,47,"“The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,"
2 Samuel,22,48,"The God who executes vengeance for me, And brings down peoples under me,"
2 Samuel,22,49,Who also brings me out from my enemies; You even lift me above those who rise up against me; You rescue me from the violent man.
2 Samuel,22,50,"“Therefore I will give thanks to You, O LORD, among the nations, And I will sing praises to Your name."
2 Samuel,22,51,"“He is a tower of deliverance to His king, And shows lovingkindness to His anointed, To David and his descendants forever.”"
2 Samuel,23,1,"Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse declares, The man who was raised on high declares, The anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet psalmist of Israel,"
2 Samuel,23,2,"“The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, And His word was on my tongue."
2 Samuel,23,3,"“The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me, ‘He who rules over men righteously, Who rules in the fear of God,"
2 Samuel,23,4,"Is as the light of the morning when the sun rises, A morning without clouds, When the tender grass springs out of the earth, Through sunshine after rain.’"
2 Samuel,23,5,"“Truly is not my house so with God? For He has made an everlasting covenant with me, Ordered in all things, and secured; For all my salvation and all my desire, Will He not indeed make it grow?"
2 Samuel,23,6,"“But the worthless, every one of them will be thrust away like thorns, Because they cannot be taken in hand;"
2 Samuel,23,7,"But the man who touches them Must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear, And they will be completely burned with fire in their place.”"
2 Samuel,23,8,"These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains, he was called Adino the Eznite, because of eight hundred slain by him at one time;"
2 Samuel,23,9,"and after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there to battle and the men of Israel had withdrawn."
2 Samuel,23,10,"He arose and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary and clung to the sword, and the LORD brought about a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to strip the slain."
2 Samuel,23,11,"Now after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered into a troop where there was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the people fled from the Philistines."
2 Samuel,23,12,"But he took his stand in the midst of the plot, defended it and struck the Philistines; and the LORD brought about a great victory."
2 Samuel,23,13,"Then three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam, while the troop of the Philistines was camping in the valley of Rephaim."
2 Samuel,23,14,"David was then in the stronghold, while the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem."
2 Samuel,23,15,"David had a craving and said, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate!”"
2 Samuel,23,16,"So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water from the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and took it and brought it to David. Nevertheless he would not drink it, but poured it out to the LORD;"
2 Samuel,23,17,"and he said, “Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this. Shall I drink the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives?” Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did."
2 Samuel,23,18,"Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty. And he swung his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name as well as the three."
2 Samuel,23,19,"He was most honored of the thirty, therefore he became their commander; however, he did not attain to the three."
2 Samuel,23,20,"Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day."
2 Samuel,23,21,"He killed an Egyptian, an impressive man. Now the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but he went down to him with a club and snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear."
2 Samuel,23,22,"These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and had a name as well as the three mighty men."
2 Samuel,23,23,"He was honored among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David appointed him over his guard."
2 Samuel,23,24,"Asahel the brother of Joab was among the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,"

2 Samuel,24,1,"Now again the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and it incited David against them to say, “Go, number Israel and Judah.”"
2 Samuel,24,2,"The king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him, “Go about now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and register the people, that I may know the number of the people.”"
2 Samuel,24,3,"But Joab said to the king, “Now may the LORD your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are, while the eyes of my lord the king still see; but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?”"
2 Samuel,24,4,"Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to register the people of Israel."
2 Samuel,24,5,"They crossed the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad and toward Jazer."
2 Samuel,24,6,"Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi, and they came to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon,"
2 Samuel,24,7,"and came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites, and they went out to the south of Judah, to Beersheba."
2 Samuel,24,8,"So when they had gone about through the whole land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days."
2 Samuel,24,9,"And Joab gave the number of the registration of the people to the king; and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men."
2 Samuel,24,10,"Now David’s heart troubled him after he had numbered the people. So David said to the LORD, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O LORD, please take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”"
2 Samuel,24,11,"When David arose in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,"
2 Samuel,24,12,"“Go and speak to David, ‘Thus the LORD says, “I am offering you three things; choose for yourself one of them, which I will do to you.”’”"
2 Samuel,24,13,"So Gad came to David and told him, and said to him, “Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days’ pestilence in your land? Now consider and see what answer I shall return to Him who sent me.”"
2 Samuel,24,14,"Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Let us now fall into the hand of the LORD for His mercies are great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”"
2 Samuel,24,15,"So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning until the appointed time, and seventy thousand men of the people from Dan to Beersheba died."
2 Samuel,24,16,"When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented from the calamity and said to the angel who destroyed the people, “It is enough! Now relax your hand!” And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
2 Samuel,24,17,"Then David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who was striking down the people, and said, “Behold, it is I who have sinned, and it is I who have done wrong; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let Your hand be against me and against my father’s house.”"
2 Samuel,24,18,"So Gad came to David that day and said to him, “Go up, erect an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”"
2 Samuel,24,19,"David went up according to the word of Gad, just as the LORD had commanded."
2 Samuel,24,20,Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants crossing over toward him; and Araunah went out and bowed his face to the ground before the king.
2 Samuel,24,21,"Then Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” And David said, “To buy the threshing floor from you, in order to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be held back from the people.”"
2 Samuel,24,22,"Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up what is good in his sight. Look, the oxen for the burnt offering, the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood."
2 Samuel,24,23,"Everything, O king, Araunah gives to the king.” And Araunah said to the king, “May the LORD your God accept you.”"
2 Samuel,24,24,"However, the king said to Araunah, “No, but I will surely buy it from you for a price, for I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God which cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver."
2 Samuel,24,25,"David built there an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Thus the LORD was moved by prayer for the land, and the plague was held back from Israel."
1 Kings,1,1,"Now King David was old, advanced in age; and they covered him with clothes, but he could not keep warm."
1 Kings,1,2,"So his servants said to him, “Let them seek a young virgin for my lord the king, and let her attend the king and become his nurse; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm.”"
1 Kings,1,3,"So they searched for a beautiful girl throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king."
1 Kings,1,4,"The girl was very beautiful; and she became the king’s nurse and served him, but the king did not cohabit with her."
1 Kings,1,5,"Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king.” So he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen with fifty men to run before him."
1 Kings,1,6,"His father had never crossed him at any time by asking, “Why have you done so?” And he was also a very handsome man, and he was born after Absalom."
1 Kings,1,7,He had conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest; and following Adonijah they helped him.
1 Kings,1,8,"But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah."
1 Kings,1,9,"Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants."
1 Kings,1,10,"But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, and Solomon his brother."
1 Kings,1,11,"Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, “Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know it?"
1 Kings,1,12,"So now come, please let me give you counsel and save your life and the life of your son Solomon."
1 Kings,1,13,"Go at once to King David and say to him, ‘Have you not, my lord, O king, sworn to your maidservant, saying, “Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne”? Why then has Adonijah become king?’"
1 Kings,1,14,"“Behold, while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.”"
1 Kings,1,15,"So Bathsheba went in to the king in the bedroom. Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king."
1 Kings,1,16,"Then Bathsheba bowed and prostrated herself before the king. And the king said, “What do you wish?”"
1 Kings,1,17,"She said to him, “My lord, you swore to your maidservant by the LORD your God, saying, ‘Surely your son Solomon shall be king after me and he shall sit on my throne.’"
1 Kings,1,18,"Now, behold, Adonijah is king; and now, my lord the king, you do not know it."
1 Kings,1,19,"He has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant."
1 Kings,1,20,"As for you now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him."
1 Kings,1,21,"Otherwise it will come about, as soon as my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be considered offenders.”"
1 Kings,1,22,"Behold, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in."
1 Kings,1,23,"They told the king, saying, “Here is Nathan the prophet.” And when he came in before the king, he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground."
1 Kings,1,24,"Then Nathan said, “My lord the king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne’?"
1 Kings,1,25,"For he has gone down today and has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons and the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest, and behold, they are eating and drinking before him; and they say, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’"
1 Kings,1,26,"But me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and your servant Solomon, he has not invited."
1 Kings,1,27,"Has this thing been done by my lord the king, and you have not shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”"
1 Kings,1,28,"Then King David said, “Call Bathsheba to me.” And she came into the king’s presence and stood before the king."
1 Kings,1,29,"The king vowed and said, “As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress,"
1 Kings,1,30,"surely as I vowed to you by the LORD the God of Israel, saying, ‘Your son Solomon shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place’; I will indeed do so this day.”"
1 Kings,1,31,"Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground, and prostrated herself before the king and said, “May my lord King David live forever.”"
1 Kings,1,32,"Then King David said, “Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” And they came into the king’s presence."
1 Kings,1,33,"The king said to them, “Take with you the servants of your lord, and have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon."
1 Kings,1,34,"Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel, and blow the trumpet and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’"
1 Kings,1,35,"Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne and be king in my place; for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.”"
1 Kings,1,36,"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, “Amen! Thus may the LORD, the God of my lord the king, say."
1 Kings,1,37,"As the LORD has been with my lord the king, so may He be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David!”"
1 Kings,1,38,"So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon."
1 Kings,1,39,"Zadok the priest then took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!”"
1 Kings,1,40,"All the people went up after him, and the people were playing on flutes and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth shook at their noise."
1 Kings,1,41,"Now Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, “Why is the city making such an uproar?”"
1 Kings,1,42,"While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. Then Adonijah said, “Come in, for you are a valiant man and bring good news.”"
1 Kings,1,43,"But Jonathan replied to Adonijah, “No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king."
1 Kings,1,44,"The king has also sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have made him ride on the king’s mule."
1 Kings,1,45,"Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon, and they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise which you have heard."
1 Kings,1,46,"Besides, Solomon has even taken his seat on the throne of the kingdom."
1 Kings,1,47,"Moreover, the king’s servants came to bless our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name and his throne greater than your throne!’ And the king bowed himself on the bed."
1 Kings,1,48,"The king has also said thus, ‘Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has granted one to sit on my throne today while my own eyes see it.’”"
1 Kings,1,49,Then all the guests of Adonijah were terrified; and they arose and each went on his way.
1 Kings,1,50,"And Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, and he arose, went and took hold of the horns of the altar."
1 Kings,1,51,"Now it was told Solomon, saying, “Behold, Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon, for behold, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’”"
1 Kings,1,52,"Solomon said, “If he is a worthy man, not one of his hairs will fall to the ground; but if wickedness is found in him, he will die.”"
1 Kings,1,53,"So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and prostrated himself before King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”"
1 Kings,2,1,"As David’s time to die drew near, he charged Solomon his son, saying,"
1 Kings,2,2,"“I am going the way of all the earth. Be strong, therefore, and show yourself a man."
1 Kings,2,3,"Keep the charge of the LORD your God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commandments, His ordinances, and His testimonies, according to what is written in the Law of Moses, that you may succeed in all that you do and wherever you turn,"
1 Kings,2,4,"so that the LORD may carry out His promise which He spoke concerning me, saying, ‘If your sons are careful of their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’"
1 Kings,2,5,"“Now you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed; he also shed the blood of war in peace. And he put the blood of war on his belt about his waist, and on his sandals on his feet."
1 Kings,2,6,"So act according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray hair go down to Sheol in peace."
1 Kings,2,7,"But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table; for they assisted me when I fled from Absalom your brother."
1 Kings,2,8,"Behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera the Benjamite, of Bahurim; now it was he who cursed me with a violent curse on the day I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD, saying, ‘I will not put you to death with the sword.’"
1 Kings,2,9,"Now therefore, do not let him go unpunished, for you are a wise man; and you will know what you ought to do to him, and you will bring his gray hair down to Sheol with blood.”"
1 Kings,2,10,Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David.
1 Kings,2,11,The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years he reigned in Hebron and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem.
1 Kings,2,12,"And Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established."
1 Kings,2,13,"Now Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, “Do you come peacefully?” And he said, “Peacefully.”"
1 Kings,2,14,"Then he said, “I have something to say to you.” And she said, “Speak.”"
1 Kings,2,15,"So he said, “You know that the kingdom was mine and that all Israel expected me to be king; however, the kingdom has turned about and become my brother’s, for it was his from the LORD."
1 Kings,2,16,"Now I am making one request of you; do not refuse me.” And she said to him, “Speak.”"
1 Kings,2,17,"Then he said, “Please speak to Solomon the king, for he will not refuse you, that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife.”"
1 Kings,2,18,"Bathsheba said, “Very well; I will speak to the king for you.”"
1 Kings,2,19,"So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king arose to meet her, bowed before her, and sat on his throne; then he had a throne set for the king’s mother, and she sat on his right."
1 Kings,2,20,"Then she said, “I am making one small request of you; do not refuse me.” And the king said to her, “Ask, my mother, for I will not refuse you.”"
1 Kings,2,21,"So she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as a wife.”"
1 Kings,2,22,"King Solomon answered and said to his mother, “And why are you asking Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him also the kingdom—for he is my older brother—even for him, for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah!”"
1 Kings,2,23,"Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, “May God do so to me and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life."
1 Kings,2,24,"Now therefore, as the LORD lives, who has established me and set me on the throne of David my father and who has made me a house as He promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death today.”"
1 Kings,2,25,So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him so that he died.
1 Kings,2,26,"Then to Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go to Anathoth to your own field, for you deserve to die; but I will not put you to death at this time, because you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before my father David, and because you were afflicted in everything with which my father was afflicted.”"
1 Kings,2,27,"So Solomon dismissed Abiathar from being priest to the LORD, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD, which He had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh."
1 Kings,2,28,"Now the news came to Joab, for Joab had followed Adonijah, although he had not followed Absalom. And Joab fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar."
1 Kings,2,29,"It was told King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of the LORD, and behold, he is beside the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, fall upon him.”"
1 Kings,2,30,"So Benaiah came to the tent of the LORD and said to him, “Thus the king has said, ‘Come out.’” But he said, “No, for I will die here.” And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, “Thus spoke Joab, and thus he answered me.”"
1 Kings,2,31,"The king said to him, “Do as he has spoken and fall upon him and bury him, that you may remove from me and from my father’s house the blood which Joab shed without cause."
1 Kings,2,32,"The LORD will return his blood on his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and killed them with the sword, while my father David did not know it: Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah."
1 Kings,2,33,"So shall their blood return on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever; but to David and his descendants and his house and his throne, may there be peace from the LORD forever.”"
1 Kings,2,34,"Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell upon him and put him to death, and he was buried at his own house in the wilderness."
1 Kings,2,35,"The king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in his place, and the king appointed Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar."
1 Kings,2,36,"Now the king sent and called for Shimei and said to him, “Build for yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, and do not go out from there to any place."
1 Kings,2,37,"For on the day you go out and cross over the brook Kidron, you will know for certain that you shall surely die; your blood shall be on your own head.”"
1 Kings,2,38,"Shimei then said to the king, “The word is good. As my lord the king has said, so your servant will do.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days."
1 Kings,2,39,"But it came about at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, “Behold, your servants are in Gath.”"
1 Kings,2,40,"Then Shimei arose and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to look for his servants. And Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath."
1 Kings,2,41,"It was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned."
1 Kings,2,42,"So the king sent and called for Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the LORD and solemnly warn you, saying, ‘You will know for certain that on the day you depart and go anywhere, you shall surely die’? And you said to me, ‘The word which I have heard is good.’"
1 Kings,2,43,"Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD, and the command which I have laid on you?”"
1 Kings,2,44,"The king also said to Shimei, “You know all the evil which you acknowledge in your heart, which you did to my father David; therefore the LORD shall return your evil on your own head."
1 Kings,2,45,"But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever.”"
1 Kings,2,46,"So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he went out and fell upon him so that he died. Thus the kingdom was established in the hands of Solomon."
1 Kings,3,1,"Then Solomon formed a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter and brought her to the city of David until he had finished building his own house and the house of the LORD and the wall around Jerusalem."
1 Kings,3,2,"The people were still sacrificing on the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the LORD until those days."
1 Kings,3,3,"Now Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of his father David, except he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places."
1 Kings,3,4,"The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place; Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar."
1 Kings,3,5,"In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream at night; and God said, “Ask what you wish Me to give you.”"
1 Kings,3,6,"Then Solomon said, “You have shown great lovingkindness to Your servant David my father, according as he walked before You in truth and righteousness and uprightness of heart toward You; and You have reserved for him this great lovingkindness, that You have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day."
1 Kings,3,7,"Now, O LORD my God, You have made Your servant king in place of my father David, yet I am but a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in."
1 Kings,3,8,"Your servant is in the midst of Your people which You have chosen, a great people who are too many to be numbered or counted."
1 Kings,3,9,So give Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people to discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?”
1 Kings,3,10,It was pleasing in the sight of the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing.
1 Kings,3,11,"God said to him, “Because you have asked this thing and have not asked for yourself long life, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have you asked for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself discernment to understand justice,"
1 Kings,3,12,"behold, I have done according to your words. Behold, I have given you a wise and discerning heart, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor shall one like you arise after you."
1 Kings,3,13,"I have also given you what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there will not be any among the kings like you all your days."
1 Kings,3,14,"If you walk in My ways, keeping My statutes and commandments, as your father David walked, then I will prolong your days.”"
1 Kings,3,15,"Then Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and made peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants."
1 Kings,3,16,Then two women who were harlots came to the king and stood before him.
1 Kings,3,17,"The one woman said, “Oh, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house; and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house."
1 Kings,3,18,"It happened on the third day after I gave birth, that this woman also gave birth to a child, and we were together. There was no stranger with us in the house, only the two of us in the house."
1 Kings,3,19,"This woman’s son died in the night, because she lay on it."
1 Kings,3,20,"So she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from beside me while your maidservant slept, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead son in my bosom."
1 Kings,3,21,"When I rose in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead; but when I looked at him carefully in the morning, behold, he was not my son, whom I had borne.”"
1 Kings,3,22,"Then the other woman said, “No! For the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son.” But the first woman said, “No! For the dead one is your son, and the living one is my son.” Thus they spoke before the king."
1 Kings,3,23,"Then the king said, “The one says, ‘This is my son who is living, and your son is the dead one’; and the other says, ‘No! For your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.’”"
1 Kings,3,24,"The king said, “Get me a sword.” So they brought a sword before the king."
1 Kings,3,25,"The king said, “Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other.”"
1 Kings,3,26,"Then the woman whose child was the living one spoke to the king, for she was deeply stirred over her son and said, “Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means kill him.” But the other said, “He shall be neither mine nor yours; divide him!”"
1 Kings,3,27,"Then the king said, “Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him. She is his mother.”"
1 Kings,3,28,"When all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had handed down, they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice."
1 Kings,4,1,Now King Solomon was king over all Israel.
1 Kings,4,2,These were his officials: Azariah the son of Zadok was the priest;
1 Kings,4,3,"Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha were secretaries; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;"
1 Kings,4,4,and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
1 Kings,4,5,"and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the deputies; and Zabud the son of Nathan, a priest, was the king’s friend;"
1 Kings,4,6,and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to forced labor.
1 Kings,4,7,"Solomon had twelve deputies over all Israel, who provided for the king and his household; each man had to provide for a month in the year."
1 Kings,4,8,"These are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;"
1 Kings,4,9,Ben-deker in Makaz and Shaalbim and Beth-shemesh and Elonbeth-hanan;
1 Kings,4,10,"Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (Socoh was his and all the land of Hepher);"
1 Kings,4,11,"Ben-abinadab, in all the height of Dor (Taphath the daughter of Solomon was his wife);"
1 Kings,4,12,"Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah as far as the other side of Jokmeam;"
1 Kings,4,13,"Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (the towns of Jair, the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead were his: the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars were his);"
1 Kings,4,14,"Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;"
1 Kings,4,15,"Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also married Basemath the daughter of Solomon);"
1 Kings,4,16,"Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;"
1 Kings,4,17,"Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;"
1 Kings,4,18,"Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;"
1 Kings,4,19,"Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only deputy who was in the land."
1 Kings,4,20,Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand that is on the seashore in abundance; they were eating and drinking and rejoicing.
1 Kings,4,21,Now Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt; they brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.
1 Kings,4,22,"Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty kors of fine flour and sixty kors of meal,"
1 Kings,4,23,"ten fat oxen, twenty pasture-fed oxen, a hundred sheep besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl."
1 Kings,4,24,"For he had dominion over everything west of the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings west of the River; and he had peace on all sides around about him."
1 Kings,4,25,"So Judah and Israel lived in safety, every man under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon."
1 Kings,4,26,"Solomon had 40,000 stalls of horses for his chariots, and 12,000 horsemen."
1 Kings,4,27,"Those deputies provided for King Solomon and all who came to King Solomon’s table, each in his month; they left nothing lacking."
1 Kings,4,28,"They also brought barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to the place where it should be, each according to his charge."
1 Kings,4,29,"Now God gave Solomon wisdom and very great discernment and breadth of mind, like the sand that is on the seashore."
1 Kings,4,30,Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt.
1 Kings,4,31,"For he was wiser than all men, than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was known in all the surrounding nations."
1 Kings,4,32,"He also spoke 3,000 proverbs, and his songs were 1,005."
1 Kings,4,33,"He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows on the wall; he spoke also of animals and birds and creeping things and fish."
1 Kings,4,34,"Men came from all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom."
1 Kings,5,1,"Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram had always been a friend of David."
1 Kings,5,2,"Then Solomon sent word to Hiram, saying,"
1 Kings,5,3,"“You know that David my father was unable to build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the wars which surrounded him, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet."
1 Kings,5,4,But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor misfortune.
1 Kings,5,5,"Behold, I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, ‘Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he will build the house for My name.’"
1 Kings,5,6,"Now therefore, command that they cut for me cedars from Lebanon, and my servants will be with your servants; and I will give you wages for your servants according to all that you say, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”"
1 Kings,5,7,"When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, “Blessed be the LORD today, who has given to David a wise son over this great people.”"
1 Kings,5,8,"So Hiram sent word to Solomon, saying, “I have heard the message which you have sent me; I will do what you desire concerning the cedar and cypress timber."
1 Kings,5,9,"My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place where you direct me, and I will have them broken up there, and you shall carry them away. Then you shall accomplish my desire by giving food to my household.”"
1 Kings,5,10,So Hiram gave Solomon as much as he desired of the cedar and cypress timber.
1 Kings,5,11,"Solomon then gave Hiram 20,000 kors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty kors of beaten oil; thus Solomon would give Hiram year by year."
1 Kings,5,12,"The LORD gave wisdom to Solomon, just as He promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a covenant."
1 Kings,5,13,"Now King Solomon levied forced laborers from all Israel; and the forced laborers numbered 30,000 men."
1 Kings,5,14,"He sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in relays; they were in Lebanon a month and two months at home. And Adoniram was over the forced laborers."
1 Kings,5,15,"Now Solomon had 70,000 transporters, and 80,000 hewers of stone in the mountains,"
1 Kings,5,16,"besides Solomon’s 3,300 chief deputies who were over the project and who ruled over the people who were doing the work."
1 Kings,5,17,"Then the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with cut stones."
1 Kings,5,18,"So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites cut them, and prepared the timbers and the stones to build the house."
1 Kings,6,1,"Now it came about in the four hundred and eightieth year after the sons of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD."
1 Kings,6,2,"As for the house which King Solomon built for the LORD, its length was sixty cubits and its width twenty cubits and its height thirty cubits."
1 Kings,6,3,"The porch in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits in length, corresponding to the width of the house, and its depth along the front of the house was ten cubits."
1 Kings,6,4,Also for the house he made windows with artistic frames.
1 Kings,6,5,Against the wall of the house he built stories encompassing the walls of the house around both the nave and the inner sanctuary; thus he made side chambers all around.
1 Kings,6,6,"The lowest story was five cubits wide, and the middle was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around in order that the beams would not be inserted in the walls of the house."
1 Kings,6,7,"The house, while it was being built, was built of stone prepared at the quarry, and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any iron tool heard in the house while it was being built."
1 Kings,6,8,"The doorway for the lowest side chamber was on the right side of the house; and they would go up by winding stairs to the middle story, and from the middle to the third."
1 Kings,6,9,So he built the house and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.
1 Kings,6,10,"He also built the stories against the whole house, each five cubits high; and they were fastened to the house with timbers of cedar."
1 Kings,6,11,"Now the word of the LORD came to Solomon saying,"
1 Kings,6,12,"“Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in My statutes and execute My ordinances and keep all My commandments by walking in them, then I will carry out My word with you which I spoke to David your father."
1 Kings,6,13,"I will dwell among the sons of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel.”"
1 Kings,6,14,So Solomon built the house and finished it.
1 Kings,6,15,"Then he built the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house to the ceiling he overlaid the walls on the inside with wood, and he overlaid the floor of the house with boards of cypress."
1 Kings,6,16,"He built twenty cubits on the rear part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling; he built them for it on the inside as an inner sanctuary, even as the most holy place."
1 Kings,6,17,"The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long."
1 Kings,6,18,"There was cedar on the house within, carved in the shape of gourds and open flowers; all was cedar, there was no stone seen."
1 Kings,6,19,Then he prepared an inner sanctuary within the house in order to place there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
1 Kings,6,20,"The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits in length, twenty cubits in width, and twenty cubits in height, and he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid the altar with cedar."
1 Kings,6,21,"So Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold. And he drew chains of gold across the front of the inner sanctuary, and he overlaid it with gold."
1 Kings,6,22,"He overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. Also the whole altar which was by the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold."
1 Kings,6,23,"Also in the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high."
1 Kings,6,24,Five cubits was the one wing of the cherub and five cubits the other wing of the cherub; from the end of one wing to the end of the other wing were ten cubits.
1 Kings,6,25,The other cherub was ten cubits; both the cherubim were of the same measure and the same form.
1 Kings,6,26,"The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was the other cherub."
1 Kings,6,27,"He placed the cherubim in the midst of the inner house, and the wings of the cherubim were spread out, so that the wing of the one was touching the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub was touching the other wall. So their wings were touching each other in the center of the house."
1 Kings,6,28,He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1 Kings,6,29,"Then he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, inner and outer sanctuaries."
1 Kings,6,30,"He overlaid the floor of the house with gold, inner and outer sanctuaries."
1 Kings,6,31,"For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood, the lintel and five-sided doorposts."
1 Kings,6,32,"So he made two doors of olive wood, and he carved on them carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees."
1 Kings,6,33,So also he made for the entrance of the nave four-sided doorposts of olive wood
1 Kings,6,34,"and two doors of cypress wood; the two leaves of the one door turned on pivots, and the two leaves of the other door turned on pivots."
1 Kings,6,35,"He carved on it cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the engraved work."
1 Kings,6,36,He built the inner court with three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams.
1 Kings,6,37,"In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid, in the month of Ziv."
1 Kings,6,38,"In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished throughout all its parts and according to all its plans. So he was seven years in building it."
1 Kings,7,1,"Now Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house."
1 Kings,7,2,"He built the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length was 100 cubits and its width 50 cubits and its height 30 cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams on the pillars."
1 Kings,7,3,"It was paneled with cedar above the side chambers which were on the 45 pillars, 15 in each row."
1 Kings,7,4,"There were artistic window frames in three rows, and window was opposite window in three ranks."
1 Kings,7,5,"All the doorways and doorposts had squared artistic frames, and window was opposite window in three ranks."
1 Kings,7,6,"Then he made the hall of pillars; its length was 50 cubits and its width 30 cubits, and a porch was in front of them and pillars and a threshold in front of them."
1 Kings,7,7,"He made the hall of the throne where he was to judge, the hall of judgment, and it was paneled with cedar from floor to floor."
1 Kings,7,8,"His house where he was to live, the other court inward from the hall, was of the same workmanship. He also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom Solomon had married."
1 Kings,7,9,"All these were of costly stones, of stone cut according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside; even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court."
1 Kings,7,10,"The foundation was of costly stones, even large stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits."
1 Kings,7,11,"And above were costly stones, stone cut according to measure, and cedar."
1 Kings,7,12,"So the great court all around had three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams even as the inner court of the house of the LORD, and the porch of the house."
1 Kings,7,13,Now King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre.
1 Kings,7,14,"He was a widow’s son from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill for doing any work in bronze. So he came to King Solomon and performed all his work."
1 Kings,7,15,"He fashioned the two pillars of bronze; eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of both."
1 Kings,7,16,He also made two capitals of molten bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits and the height of the other capital was five cubits.
1 Kings,7,17,There were nets of network and twisted threads of chainwork for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital.
1 Kings,7,18,"So he made the pillars, and two rows around on the one network to cover the capitals which were on the top of the pomegranates; and so he did for the other capital."
1 Kings,7,19,"The capitals which were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily design, four cubits."
1 Kings,7,20,"There were capitals on the two pillars, even above and close to the rounded projection which was beside the network; and the pomegranates numbered two hundred in rows around both capitals."
1 Kings,7,21,"Thus he set up the pillars at the porch of the nave; and he set up the right pillar and named it Jachin, and he set up the left pillar and named it Boaz."
1 Kings,7,22,On the top of the pillars was lily design. So the work of the pillars was finished.
1 Kings,7,23,"Now he made the sea of cast metal ten cubits from brim to brim, circular in form, and its height was five cubits, and thirty cubits in circumference."
1 Kings,7,24,"Under its brim gourds went around encircling it ten to a cubit, completely surrounding the sea; the gourds were in two rows, cast with the rest."
1 Kings,7,25,"It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; and the sea was set on top of them, and all their rear parts turned inward."
1 Kings,7,26,"It was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, as a lily blossom; it could hold two thousand baths."
1 Kings,7,27,Then he made the ten stands of bronze; the length of each stand was four cubits and its width four cubits and its height three cubits.
1 Kings,7,28,"This was the design of the stands: they had borders, even borders between the frames,"
1 Kings,7,29,"and on the borders which were between the frames were lions, oxen and cherubim; and on the frames there was a pedestal above, and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work."
1 Kings,7,30,"Now each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and its four feet had supports; beneath the basin were cast supports with wreaths at each side."
1 Kings,7,31,"Its opening inside the crown at the top was a cubit, and its opening was round like the design of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its opening there were engravings, and their borders were square, not round."
1 Kings,7,32,"The four wheels were underneath the borders, and the axles of the wheels were on the stand. And the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half."
1 Kings,7,33,"The workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel. Their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast."
1 Kings,7,34,Now there were four supports at the four corners of each stand; its supports were part of the stand itself.
1 Kings,7,35,"On the top of the stand there was a circular form half a cubit high, and on the top of the stand its stays and its borders were part of it."
1 Kings,7,36,"He engraved on the plates of its stays and on its borders, cherubim, lions and palm trees, according to the clear space on each, with wreaths all around."
1 Kings,7,37,"He made the ten stands like this: all of them had one casting, one measure and one form."
1 Kings,7,38,"He made ten basins of bronze, one basin held forty baths; each basin was four cubits, and on each of the ten stands was one basin."
1 Kings,7,39,"Then he set the stands, five on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea of cast metal on the right side of the house eastward toward the south."
1 Kings,7,40,Now Hiram made the basins and the shovels and the bowls. So Hiram finished doing all the work which he performed for King Solomon in the house of the LORD:
1 Kings,7,41,"the two pillars and the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;"
1 Kings,7,42,"and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the tops of the pillars;"
1 Kings,7,43,and the ten stands with the ten basins on the stands;
1 Kings,7,44,and the one sea and the twelve oxen under the sea;
1 Kings,7,45,and the pails and the shovels and the bowls; even all these utensils which Hiram made for King Solomon in the house of the LORD were of polished bronze.
1 Kings,7,46,"In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan."
1 Kings,7,47,"Solomon left all the utensils unweighed, because they were too many; the weight of the bronze could not be ascertained."
1 Kings,7,48,Solomon made all the furniture which was in the house of the LORD: the golden altar and the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence;
1 Kings,7,49,"and the lampstands, five on the right side and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs, of gold;"
1 Kings,7,50,"and the cups and the snuffers and the bowls and the spoons and the firepans, of pure gold; and the hinges both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, that is, of the nave, of gold."
1 Kings,7,51,"Thus all the work that King Solomon performed in the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things dedicated by his father David, the silver and the gold and the utensils, and he put them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD."
1 Kings,8,1,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers’ households of the sons of Israel, to King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the city of David, which is Zion."
1 Kings,8,2,"All the men of Israel assembled themselves to King Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month."
1 Kings,8,3,"Then all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark."
1 Kings,8,4,"They brought up the ark of the LORD and the tent of meeting and all the holy utensils, which were in the tent, and the priests and the Levites brought them up."
1 Kings,8,5,"And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen they could not be counted or numbered."
1 Kings,8,6,"Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim."
1 Kings,8,7,"For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim made a covering over the ark and its poles from above."
1 Kings,8,8,"But the poles were so long that the ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place before the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen outside; they are there to this day."
1 Kings,8,9,"There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the sons of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt."
1 Kings,8,10,"It happened that when the priests came from the holy place, the cloud filled the house of the LORD,"
1 Kings,8,11,"so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD."
1 Kings,8,12,"Then Solomon said, “The LORD has said that He would dwell in the thick cloud."
1 Kings,8,13,"“I have surely built You a lofty house, A place for Your dwelling forever.”"
1 Kings,8,14,"Then the king faced about and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing."
1 Kings,8,15,"He said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth to my father David and has fulfilled it with His hand, saying,"
1 Kings,8,16,"‘Since the day that I brought My people Israel from Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house that My name might be there, but I chose David to be over My people Israel.’"
1 Kings,8,17,"Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel."
1 Kings,8,18,"But the LORD said to my father David, ‘Because it was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well that it was in your heart."
1 Kings,8,19,"Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who will be born to you, he will build the house for My name.’"
1 Kings,8,20,"Now the LORD has fulfilled His word which He spoke; for I have risen in place of my father David and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel."
1 Kings,8,21,"There I have set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD, which He made with our fathers when He brought them from the land of Egypt.”"
1 Kings,8,22,Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven.
1 Kings,8,23,"He said, “O LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven above or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and showing lovingkindness to Your servants who walk before You with all their heart,"
1 Kings,8,24,"who have kept with Your servant, my father David, that which You have promised him; indeed, You have spoken with Your mouth and have fulfilled it with Your hand as it is this day."
1 Kings,8,25,"Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep with Your servant David my father that which You have promised him, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your sons take heed to their way to walk before Me as you have walked.’"
1 Kings,8,26,"Now therefore, O God of Israel, let Your word, I pray, be confirmed which You have spoken to Your servant, my father David."
1 Kings,8,27,"“But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You, how much less this house which I have built!"
1 Kings,8,28,"Yet have regard to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which Your servant prays before You today;"
1 Kings,8,29,"that Your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, toward the place of which You have said, ‘My name shall be there,’ to listen to the prayer which Your servant shall pray toward this place."
1 Kings,8,30,"Listen to the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place; hear in heaven Your dwelling place; hear and forgive."
1 Kings,8,31,"“If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath, and he comes and takes an oath before Your altar in this house,"
1 Kings,8,32,"then hear in heaven and act and judge Your servants, condemning the wicked by bringing his way on his own head and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness."
1 Kings,8,33,"“When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy, because they have sinned against You, if they turn to You again and confess Your name and pray and make supplication to You in this house,"
1 Kings,8,34,"then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You gave to their fathers."
1 Kings,8,35,"“When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain, because they have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess Your name and turn from their sin when You afflict them,"
1 Kings,8,36,"then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants and of Your people Israel, indeed, teach them the good way in which they should walk. And send rain on Your land, which You have given Your people for an inheritance."
1 Kings,8,37,"“If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, locust or grasshopper, if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities, whatever plague, whatever sickness there is,"
1 Kings,8,38,"whatever prayer or supplication is made by any man or by all Your people Israel, each knowing the affliction of his own heart, and spreading his hands toward this house;"
1 Kings,8,39,"then hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive and act and render to each according to all his ways, whose heart You know, for You alone know the hearts of all the sons of men,"
1 Kings,8,40,that they may fear You all the days that they live in the land which You have given to our fathers.
1 Kings,8,41,"“Also concerning the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel, when he comes from a far country for Your name’s sake"
1 Kings,8,42,"(for they will hear of Your great name and Your mighty hand, and of Your outstretched arm); when he comes and prays toward this house,"
1 Kings,8,43,"hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know Your name, to fear You, as do Your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Your name."
1 Kings,8,44,"“When Your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way You shall send them, and they pray to the LORD toward the city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your name,"
1 Kings,8,45,"then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause."
1 Kings,8,46,"“When they sin against You (for there is no man who does not sin) and You are angry with them and deliver them to an enemy, so that they take them away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near;"
1 Kings,8,47,"if they take thought in the land where they have been taken captive, and repent and make supplication to You in the land of those who have taken them captive, saying, ‘We have sinned and have committed iniquity, we have acted wickedly’;"
1 Kings,8,48,"if they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who have taken them captive, and pray to You toward their land which You have given to their fathers, the city which You have chosen, and the house which I have built for Your name;"
1 Kings,8,49,"then hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven Your dwelling place, and maintain their cause,"
1 Kings,8,50,"and forgive Your people who have sinned against You and all their transgressions which they have transgressed against You, and make them objects of compassion before those who have taken them captive, that they may have compassion on them"
1 Kings,8,51,"(for they are Your people and Your inheritance which You have brought forth from Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace),"
1 Kings,8,52,"that Your eyes may be open to the supplication of Your servant and to the supplication of Your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they call to You."
1 Kings,8,53,"For You have separated them from all the peoples of the earth as Your inheritance, as You spoke through Moses Your servant, when You brought our fathers forth from Egypt, O Lord GOD.”"
1 Kings,8,54,"When Solomon had finished praying this entire prayer and supplication to the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread toward heaven."
1 Kings,8,55,"And he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying:"
1 Kings,8,56,"“Blessed be the LORD, who has given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He promised; not one word has failed of all His good promise, which He promised through Moses His servant."
1 Kings,8,57,"May the LORD our God be with us, as He was with our fathers; may He not leave us or forsake us,"
1 Kings,8,58,"that He may incline our hearts to Himself, to walk in all His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His ordinances, which He commanded our fathers."
1 Kings,8,59,"And may these words of mine, with which I have made supplication before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, that He may maintain the cause of His servant and the cause of His people Israel, as each day requires,"
1 Kings,8,60,so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God; there is no one else.
1 Kings,8,61,"Let your heart therefore be wholly devoted to the LORD our God, to walk in His statutes and to keep His commandments, as at this day.”"
1 Kings,8,62,Now the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifice before the LORD.
1 Kings,8,63,"Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the sons of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD."
1 Kings,8,64,"On the same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD, because there he offered the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat of the peace offerings; for the bronze altar that was before the LORD was too small to hold the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat of the peace offerings."
1 Kings,8,65,"So Solomon observed the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before the LORD our God, for seven days and seven more days, even fourteen days."
1 Kings,8,66,On the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the king. Then they went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had shown to David His servant and to Israel His people.
1 Kings,9,1,"Now it came about when Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all that Solomon desired to do,"
1 Kings,9,2,"that the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time, as He had appeared to him at Gibeon."
1 Kings,9,3,"The LORD said to him, “I have heard your prayer and your supplication, which you have made before Me; I have consecrated this house which you have built by putting My name there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually."
1 Kings,9,4,"As for you, if you will walk before Me as your father David walked, in integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you and will keep My statutes and My ordinances,"
1 Kings,9,5,"then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I promised to your father David, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’"
1 Kings,9,6,"“But if you or your sons indeed turn away from following Me, and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them,"
1 Kings,9,7,"then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them, and the house which I have consecrated for My name, I will cast out of My sight. So Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples."
1 Kings,9,8,"And this house will become a heap of ruins; everyone who passes by will be astonished and hiss and say, ‘Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?’"
1 Kings,9,9,"And they will say, ‘Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and adopted other gods and worshiped them and served them, therefore the LORD has brought all this adversity on them.’”"
1 Kings,9,10,"It came about at the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king’s house"
1 Kings,9,11,"(Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold according to all his desire), then King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee."
1 Kings,9,12,"So Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, and they did not please him."
1 Kings,9,13,"He said, “What are these cities which you have given me, my brother?” So they were called the land of Cabul to this day."
1 Kings,9,14,And Hiram sent to the king 120 talents of gold.
1 Kings,9,15,"Now this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon levied to build the house of the LORD, his own house, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer."
1 Kings,9,16,"For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burned it with fire, and killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and had given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife."
1 Kings,9,17,So Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the lower Beth-horon
1 Kings,9,18,"and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land of Judah,"
1 Kings,9,19,"and all the storage cities which Solomon had, even the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen, and all that it pleased Solomon to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land under his rule."
1 Kings,9,20,"As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, who were not of the sons of Israel,"
1 Kings,9,21,"their descendants who were left after them in the land whom the sons of Israel were unable to destroy utterly, from them Solomon levied forced laborers, even to this day."
1 Kings,9,22,"But Solomon did not make slaves of the sons of Israel; for they were men of war, his servants, his princes, his captains, his chariot commanders, and his horsemen."
1 Kings,9,23,"These were the chief officers who were over Solomon’s work, five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people doing the work."
1 Kings,9,24,"As soon as Pharaoh’s daughter came up from the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her, then he built the Millo."
1 Kings,9,25,"Now three times in a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the LORD, burning incense with them on the altar which was before the LORD. So he finished the house."
1 Kings,9,26,"King Solomon also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom."
1 Kings,9,27,"And Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, sailors who knew the sea, along with the servants of Solomon."
1 Kings,9,28,"They went to Ophir and took four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon."
1 Kings,10,1,"Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to test him with difficult questions."
1 Kings,10,2,"So she came to Jerusalem with a very large retinue, with camels carrying spices and very much gold and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart."
1 Kings,10,3,Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was hidden from the king which he did not explain to her.
1 Kings,10,4,"When the queen of Sheba perceived all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,"
1 Kings,10,5,"the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his waiters and their attire, his cupbearers, and his stairway by which he went up to the house of the LORD, there was no more spirit in her."
1 Kings,10,6,"Then she said to the king, “It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom."
1 Kings,10,7,"Nevertheless I did not believe the reports, until I came and my eyes had seen it. And behold, the half was not told me. You exceed in wisdom and prosperity the report which I heard."
1 Kings,10,8,"How blessed are your men, how blessed are these your servants who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom."
1 Kings,10,9,"Blessed be the LORD your God who delighted in you to set you on the throne of Israel; because the LORD loved Israel forever, therefore He made you king, to do justice and righteousness.”"
1 Kings,10,10,"She gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very great amount of spices and precious stones. Never again did such abundance of spices come in as that which the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon."
1 Kings,10,11,"Also the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir a very great number of almug trees and precious stones."
1 Kings,10,12,"The king made of the almug trees supports for the house of the LORD and for the king’s house, also lyres and harps for the singers; such almug trees have not come in again nor have they been seen to this day."
1 Kings,10,13,"King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire which she requested, besides what he gave her according to his royal bounty. Then she turned and went to her own land together with her servants."
1 Kings,10,14,"Now the weight of gold which came in to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold,"
1 Kings,10,15,besides that from the traders and the wares of the merchants and all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the country.
1 Kings,10,16,"King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold, using 600 shekels of gold on each large shield."
1 Kings,10,17,"He made 300 shields of beaten gold, using three minas of gold on each shield, and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon."
1 Kings,10,18,"Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with refined gold."
1 Kings,10,19,"There were six steps to the throne and a round top to the throne at its rear, and arms on each side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms."
1 Kings,10,20,Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps on the one side and on the other; nothing like it was made for any other kingdom.
1 Kings,10,21,"All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None was of silver; it was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon."
1 Kings,10,22,"For the king had at sea the ships of Tarshish with the ships of Hiram; once every three years the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold and silver, ivory and apes and peacocks."
1 Kings,10,23,So King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
1 Kings,10,24,"All the earth was seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart."
1 Kings,10,25,"They brought every man his gift, articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year."
1 Kings,10,26,"Now Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem."
1 Kings,10,27,"The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamore trees that are in the lowland."
1 Kings,10,28,"Also Solomon’s import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king’s merchants procured them from Kue for a price."
1 Kings,10,29,"A chariot was imported from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver, and a horse for 150; and by the same means they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of the Arameans."
1 Kings,11,1,"Now King Solomon loved many foreign women along with the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women,"
1 Kings,11,2,"from the nations concerning which the LORD had said to the sons of Israel, “You shall not associate with them, nor shall they associate with you, for they will surely turn your heart away after their gods.” Solomon held fast to these in love."
1 Kings,11,3,"He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines, and his wives turned his heart away."
1 Kings,11,4,"For when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart away after other gods; and his heart was not wholly devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been."
1 Kings,11,5,For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and after Milcom the detestable idol of the Ammonites.
1 Kings,11,6,"Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did not follow the LORD fully, as David his father had done."
1 Kings,11,7,"Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable idol of Moab, on the mountain which is east of Jerusalem, and for Molech the detestable idol of the sons of Ammon."
1 Kings,11,8,"Thus also he did for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods."
1 Kings,11,9,"Now the LORD was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,"
1 Kings,11,10,"and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he did not observe what the LORD had commanded."
1 Kings,11,11,"So the LORD said to Solomon, “Because you have done this, and you have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant."
1 Kings,11,12,"Nevertheless I will not do it in your days for the sake of your father David, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son."
1 Kings,11,13,"However, I will not tear away all the kingdom, but I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.”"
1 Kings,11,14,"Then the LORD raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the royal line in Edom."
1 Kings,11,15,"For it came about, when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, and had struck down every male in Edom"
1 Kings,11,16,"(for Joab and all Israel stayed there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom),"
1 Kings,11,17,"that Hadad fled to Egypt, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, while Hadad was a young boy."
1 Kings,11,18,"They arose from Midian and came to Paran; and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and assigned him food and gave him land."
1 Kings,11,19,"Now Hadad found great favor before Pharaoh, so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen."
1 Kings,11,20,"The sister of Tahpenes bore his son Genubath, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh."
1 Kings,11,21,"But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Send me away, that I may go to my own country.”"
1 Kings,11,22,"Then Pharaoh said to him, “But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you are seeking to go to your own country?” And he answered, “Nothing; nevertheless you must surely let me go.”"
1 Kings,11,23,"God also raised up another adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah."
1 Kings,11,24,"He gathered men to himself and became leader of a marauding band, after David slew them of Zobah; and they went to Damascus and stayed there, and reigned in Damascus."
1 Kings,11,25,"So he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, along with the evil that Hadad did; and he abhorred Israel and reigned over Aram."
1 Kings,11,26,"Then Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, Solomon’s servant, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, also rebelled against the king."
1 Kings,11,27,"Now this was the reason why he rebelled against the king: Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of his father David."
1 Kings,11,28,"Now the man Jeroboam was a valiant warrior, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, he appointed him over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph."
1 Kings,11,29,"It came about at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had clothed himself with a new cloak; and both of them were alone in the field."
1 Kings,11,30,Then Ahijah took hold of the new cloak which was on him and tore it into twelve pieces.
1 Kings,11,31,"He said to Jeroboam, “Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and give you ten tribes"
1 Kings,11,32,"(but he will have one tribe, for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel),"
1 Kings,11,33,"because they have forsaken Me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the sons of Ammon; and they have not walked in My ways, doing what is right in My sight and observing My statutes and My ordinances, as his father David did."
1 Kings,11,34,"Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of My servant David whom I chose, who observed My commandments and My statutes;"
1 Kings,11,35,"but I will take the kingdom from his son’s hand and give it to you, even ten tribes."
1 Kings,11,36,"But to his son I will give one tribe, that My servant David may have a lamp always before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen for Myself to put My name."
1 Kings,11,37,"I will take you, and you shall reign over whatever you desire, and you shall be king over Israel."
1 Kings,11,38,"Then it will be, that if you listen to all that I command you and walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight by observing My statutes and My commandments, as My servant David did, then I will be with you and build you an enduring house as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you."
1 Kings,11,39,"Thus I will afflict the descendants of David for this, but not always.’”"
1 Kings,11,40,"Solomon sought therefore to put Jeroboam to death; but Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt to Shishak king of Egypt, and he was in Egypt until the death of Solomon."
1 Kings,11,41,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon and whatever he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?"
1 Kings,11,42,Thus the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
1 Kings,11,43,"And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David, and his son Rehoboam reigned in his place."
1 Kings,12,1,"Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king."
1 Kings,12,2,"Now when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, he was living in Egypt (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon)."
1 Kings,12,3,"Then they sent and called him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,"
1 Kings,12,4,"“Your father made our yoke hard; now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you.”"
1 Kings,12,5,"Then he said to them, “Depart for three days, then return to me.” So the people departed."
1 Kings,12,6,"King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, “How do you counsel me to answer this people?”"
1 Kings,12,7,"Then they spoke to him, saying, “If you will be a servant to this people today, and will serve them and grant them their petition, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.”"
1 Kings,12,8,"But he forsook the counsel of the elders which they had given him, and consulted with the young men who grew up with him and served him."
1 Kings,12,9,"So he said to them, “What counsel do you give that we may answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke which your father put on us’?”"
1 Kings,12,10,"The young men who grew up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall say to this people who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, now you make it lighter for us!’ But you shall speak to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins!"
1 Kings,12,11,"Whereas my father loaded you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.’”"
1 Kings,12,12,"Then Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had directed, saying, “Return to me on the third day.”"
1 Kings,12,13,"The king answered the people harshly, for he forsook the advice of the elders which they had given him,"
1 Kings,12,14,"and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.”"
1 Kings,12,15,"So the king did not listen to the people; for it was a turn of events from the LORD, that He might establish His word, which the LORD spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat."
1 Kings,12,16,"When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse; To your tents, O Israel! Now look after your own house, David!” So Israel departed to their tents."
1 Kings,12,17,"But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them."
1 Kings,12,18,"Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam made haste to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem."
1 Kings,12,19,So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
1 Kings,12,20,"It came about when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, that they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. None but the tribe of Judah followed the house of David."
1 Kings,12,21,"Now when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 chosen men who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon."
1 Kings,12,22,"But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,"
1 Kings,12,23,"“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin and to the rest of the people, saying,"
1 Kings,12,24,"‘Thus says the LORD, “You must not go up and fight against your relatives the sons of Israel; return every man to his house, for this thing has come from Me.”’” So they listened to the word of the LORD, and returned and went their way according to the word of the LORD."
1 Kings,12,25,"Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived there. And he went out from there and built Penuel."
1 Kings,12,26,"Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom will return to the house of David."
1 Kings,12,27,"If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will return to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.”"
1 Kings,12,28,"So the king consulted, and made two golden calves, and he said to them, “It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem; behold your gods, O Israel, that brought you up from the land of Egypt.”"
1 Kings,12,29,"He set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan."
1 Kings,12,30,"Now this thing became a sin, for the people went to worship before the one as far as Dan."
1 Kings,12,31,"And he made houses on high places, and made priests from among all the people who were not of the sons of Levi."
1 Kings,12,32,"Jeroboam instituted a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast which is in Judah, and he went up to the altar; thus he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves which he had made. And he stationed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made."
1 Kings,12,33,"Then he went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised in his own heart; and he instituted a feast for the sons of Israel and went up to the altar to burn incense."
1 Kings,13,1,"Now behold, there came a man of God from Judah to Bethel by the word of the LORD, while Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense."
1 Kings,13,2,"He cried against the altar by the word of the LORD, and said, “O altar, altar, thus says the LORD, ‘Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.’”"
1 Kings,13,3,"Then he gave a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign which the LORD has spoken, ‘Behold, the altar shall be split apart and the ashes which are on it shall be poured out.’”"
1 Kings,13,4,"Now when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him.” But his hand which he stretched out against him dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself."
1 Kings,13,5,"The altar also was split apart and the ashes were poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD."
1 Kings,13,6,"The king said to the man of God, “Please entreat the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me.” So the man of God entreated the LORD, and the king’s hand was restored to him, and it became as it was before."
1 Kings,13,7,"Then the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.”"
1 Kings,13,8,"But the man of God said to the king, “If you were to give me half your house I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water in this place."
1 Kings,13,9,"For so it was commanded me by the word of the LORD, saying, ‘You shall eat no bread, nor drink water, nor return by the way which you came.’”"
1 Kings,13,10,So he went another way and did not return by the way which he came to Bethel.
1 Kings,13,11,"Now an old prophet was living in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the deeds which the man of God had done that day in Bethel; the words which he had spoken to the king, these also they related to their father."
1 Kings,13,12,"Their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” Now his sons had seen the way which the man of God who came from Judah had gone."
1 Kings,13,13,"Then he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him and he rode away on it."
1 Kings,13,14,"So he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak; and he said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” And he said, “I am.”"
1 Kings,13,15,"Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat bread.”"
1 Kings,13,16,"He said, “I cannot return with you, nor go with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water with you in this place."
1 Kings,13,17,"For a command came to me by the word of the LORD, ‘You shall eat no bread, nor drink water there; do not return by going the way which you came.’”"
1 Kings,13,18,"He said to him, “I also am a prophet like you, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, ‘Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.’” But he lied to him."
1 Kings,13,19,"So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house and drank water."
1 Kings,13,20,"Now it came about, as they were sitting down at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back;"
1 Kings,13,21,"and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Because you have disobeyed the command of the LORD, and have not observed the commandment which the LORD your God commanded you,"
1 Kings,13,22,"but have returned and eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which He said to you, “Eat no bread and drink no water”; your body shall not come to the grave of your fathers.’”"
1 Kings,13,23,"It came about after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, for the prophet whom he had brought back."
1 Kings,13,24,"Now when he had gone, a lion met him on the way and killed him, and his body was thrown on the road, with the donkey standing beside it; the lion also was standing beside the body."
1 Kings,13,25,"And behold, men passed by and saw the body thrown on the road, and the lion standing beside the body; so they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived."
1 Kings,13,26,"Now when the prophet who brought him back from the way heard it, he said, “It is the man of God, who disobeyed the command of the LORD; therefore the LORD has given him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke to him.”"
1 Kings,13,27,"Then he spoke to his sons, saying, “Saddle the donkey for me.” And they saddled it."
1 Kings,13,28,He went and found his body thrown on the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside the body; the lion had not eaten the body nor torn the donkey.
1 Kings,13,29,"So the prophet took up the body of the man of God and laid it on the donkey and brought it back, and he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn and to bury him."
1 Kings,13,30,"He laid his body in his own grave, and they mourned over him, saying, “Alas, my brother!”"
1 Kings,13,31,"After he had buried him, he spoke to his sons, saying, “When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones."
1 Kings,13,32,For the thing shall surely come to pass which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria.”
1 Kings,13,33,"After this event Jeroboam did not return from his evil way, but again he made priests of the high places from among all the people; any who would, he ordained, to be priests of the high places."
1 Kings,13,34,"This event became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to blot it out and destroy it from off the face of the earth."
1 Kings,14,1,At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick.
1 Kings,14,2,"Jeroboam said to his wife, “Arise now, and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh; behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who spoke concerning me that I would be king over this people."
1 Kings,14,3,"Take ten loaves with you, some cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy.”"
1 Kings,14,4,"Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age."
1 Kings,14,5,"Now the LORD had said to Ahijah, “Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son, for he is sick. You shall say thus and thus to her, for it will be when she arrives that she will pretend to be another woman.”"
1 Kings,14,6,"When Ahijah heard the sound of her feet coming in the doorway, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam, why do you pretend to be another woman? For I am sent to you with a harsh message."
1 Kings,14,7,"Go, say to Jeroboam, ‘Thus says the LORD God of Israel, “Because I exalted you from among the people and made you leader over My people Israel,"
1 Kings,14,8,"and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you—yet you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart, to do only that which was right in My sight;"
1 Kings,14,9,"you also have done more evil than all who were before you, and have gone and made for yourself other gods and molten images to provoke Me to anger, and have cast Me behind your back—"
1 Kings,14,10,"therefore behold, I am bringing calamity on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every male person, both bond and free in Israel, and I will make a clean sweep of the house of Jeroboam, as one sweeps away dung until it is all gone."
1 Kings,14,11,Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs will eat. And he who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat; for the LORD has spoken it.”’
1 Kings,14,12,"Now you, arise, go to your house. When your feet enter the city the child will die."
1 Kings,14,13,"All Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he alone of Jeroboam’s family will come to the grave, because in him something good was found toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam."
1 Kings,14,14,"Moreover, the LORD will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam this day and from now on."
1 Kings,14,15,"“For the LORD will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and He will uproot Israel from this good land which He gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking the LORD to anger."
1 Kings,14,16,"He will give up Israel on account of the sins of Jeroboam, which he committed and with which he made Israel to sin.”"
1 Kings,14,17,"Then Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed and came to Tirzah. As she was entering the threshold of the house, the child died."
1 Kings,14,18,"All Israel buried him and mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke through His servant Ahijah the prophet."
1 Kings,14,19,"Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel."
1 Kings,14,20,"The time that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years; and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place."
1 Kings,14,21,"Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to put His name there. And his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess."
1 Kings,14,22,"Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked Him to jealousy more than all that their fathers had done, with the sins which they committed."
1 Kings,14,23,For they also built for themselves high places and sacred pillars and Asherim on every high hill and beneath every luxuriant tree.
1 Kings,14,24,There were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD dispossessed before the sons of Israel.
1 Kings,14,25,"Now it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, that Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem."
1 Kings,14,26,"He took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king’s house, and he took everything, even taking all the shields of gold which Solomon had made."
1 Kings,14,27,"So King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place, and committed them to the care of the commanders of the guard who guarded the doorway of the king’s house."
1 Kings,14,28,"Then it happened as often as the king entered the house of the LORD, that the guards would carry them and would bring them back into the guards’ room."
1 Kings,14,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?"
1 Kings,14,30,There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
1 Kings,14,31,And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijam his son became king in his place.
1 Kings,15,1,"Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah."
1 Kings,15,2,He reigned three years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
1 Kings,15,3,"He walked in all the sins of his father which he had committed before him; and his heart was not wholly devoted to the LORD his God, like the heart of his father David."
1 Kings,15,4,"But for David’s sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to raise up his son after him and to establish Jerusalem;"
1 Kings,15,5,"because David did what was right in the sight of the LORD, and had not turned aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, except in the case of Uriah the Hittite."
1 Kings,15,6,There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
1 Kings,15,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam."
1 Kings,15,8,And Abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son became king in his place.
1 Kings,15,9,"So in the twentieth year of Jeroboam the king of Israel, Asa began to reign as king of Judah."
1 Kings,15,10,He reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
1 Kings,15,11,"Asa did what was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father."
1 Kings,15,12,He also put away the male cult prostitutes from the land and removed all the idols which his fathers had made.
1 Kings,15,13,"He also removed Maacah his mother from being queen mother, because she had made a horrid image as an Asherah; and Asa cut down her horrid image and burned it at the brook Kidron."
1 Kings,15,14,But the high places were not taken away; nevertheless the heart of Asa was wholly devoted to the LORD all his days.
1 Kings,15,15,He brought into the house of the LORD the dedicated things of his father and his own dedicated things: silver and gold and utensils.
1 Kings,15,16,Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1 Kings,15,17,Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to Asa king of Judah.
1 Kings,15,18,"Then Asa took all the silver and the gold which were left in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the treasuries of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Aram, who lived in Damascus, saying,"
1 Kings,15,19,"“Let there be a treaty between you and me, as between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you a present of silver and gold; go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so that he will withdraw from me.”"
1 Kings,15,20,"So Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah and all Chinneroth, besides all the land of Naphtali."
1 Kings,15,21,"When Baasha heard of it, he ceased fortifying Ramah and remained in Tirzah."
1 Kings,15,22,Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah—none was exempt—and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had built. And King Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.
1 Kings,15,23,"Now the rest of all the acts of Asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet."
1 Kings,15,24,And Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.
1 Kings,15,25,"Now Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years."
1 Kings,15,26,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father and in his sin which he made Israel sin."
1 Kings,15,27,"Then Baasha the son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against him, and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon."
1 Kings,15,28,So Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah and reigned in his place.
1 Kings,15,29,"It came about as soon as he was king, he struck down all the household of Jeroboam. He did not leave to Jeroboam any persons alive, until he had destroyed them, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite,"
1 Kings,15,30,"and because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, because of his provocation with which he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger."
1 Kings,15,31,"Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?"
1 Kings,15,32,There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1 Kings,15,33,"In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel at Tirzah, and reigned twenty-four years."
1 Kings,15,34,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he made Israel sin."
1 Kings,16,1,"Now the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,"
1 Kings,16,2,"“Inasmuch as I exalted you from the dust and made you leader over My people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have made My people Israel sin, provoking Me to anger with their sins,"
1 Kings,16,3,"behold, I will consume Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat."
1 Kings,16,4,"Anyone of Baasha who dies in the city the dogs will eat, and anyone of his who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat.”"
1 Kings,16,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?"
1 Kings,16,6,"And Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah, and Elah his son became king in his place."
1 Kings,16,7,"Moreover, the word of the LORD through the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani also came against Baasha and his household, both because of all the evil which he did in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he struck it."
1 Kings,16,8,"In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel at Tirzah, and reigned two years."
1 Kings,16,9,"His servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was at Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household at Tirzah."
1 Kings,16,10,"Then Zimri went in and struck him and put him to death in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and became king in his place."
1 Kings,16,11,"It came about when he became king, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he killed all the household of Baasha; he did not leave a single male, neither of his relatives nor of his friends."
1 Kings,16,12,"Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke against Baasha through Jehu the prophet,"
1 Kings,16,13,"for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned and which they made Israel sin, provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols."
1 Kings,16,14,"Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?"
1 Kings,16,15,"In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days at Tirzah. Now the people were camped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines."
1 Kings,16,16,"The people who were camped heard it said, “Zimri has conspired and has also struck down the king.” Therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp."
1 Kings,16,17,Then Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah.
1 Kings,16,18,"When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king’s house and burned the king’s house over him with fire, and died,"
1 Kings,16,19,"because of his sins which he sinned, doing evil in the sight of the LORD, walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, making Israel sin."
1 Kings,16,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Zimri and his conspiracy which he carried out, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?"
1 Kings,16,21,"Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; the other half followed Omri."
1 Kings,16,22,But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. And Tibni died and Omri became king.
1 Kings,16,23,"In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel and reigned twelve years; he reigned six years at Tirzah."
1 Kings,16,24,"He bought the hill Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and named the city which he built Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill."
1 Kings,16,25,"Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, and acted more wickedly than all who were before him."
1 Kings,16,26,"For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and in his sins which he made Israel sin, provoking the LORD God of Israel with their idols."
1 Kings,16,27,"Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did and his might which he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?"
1 Kings,16,28,So Omri slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son became king in his place.
1 Kings,16,29,"Now Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years."
1 Kings,16,30,Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD more than all who were before him.
1 Kings,16,31,"It came about, as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he married Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went to serve Baal and worshiped him."
1 Kings,16,32,So he erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal which he built in Samaria.
1 Kings,16,33,Ahab also made the Asherah. Thus Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel than all the kings of Israel who were before him.
1 Kings,16,34,"In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho; he laid its foundations with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke by Joshua the son of Nun."
1 Kings,17,1,"Now Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the LORD, the God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, surely there shall be neither dew nor rain these years, except by my word.”"
1 Kings,17,2,"The word of the LORD came to him, saying,"
1 Kings,17,3,"“Go away from here and turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan."
1 Kings,17,4,"It shall be that you will drink of the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to provide for you there.”"
1 Kings,17,5,"So he went and did according to the word of the LORD, for he went and lived by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan."
1 Kings,17,6,"The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he would drink from the brook."
1 Kings,17,7,"It happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land."
1 Kings,17,8,"Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying,"
1 Kings,17,9,"“Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there; behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.”"
1 Kings,17,10,"So he arose and went to Zarephath, and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks; and he called to her and said, “Please get me a little water in a jar, that I may drink.”"
1 Kings,17,11,"As she was going to get it, he called to her and said, “Please bring me a piece of bread in your hand.”"
1 Kings,17,12,"But she said, “As the LORD your God lives, I have no bread, only a handful of flour in the bowl and a little oil in the jar; and behold, I am gathering a few sticks that I may go in and prepare for me and my son, that we may eat it and die.”"
1 Kings,17,13,"Then Elijah said to her, “Do not fear; go, do as you have said, but make me a little bread cake from it first and bring it out to me, and afterward you may make one for yourself and for your son."
1 Kings,17,14,"For thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘The bowl of flour shall not be exhausted, nor shall the jar of oil be empty, until the day that the LORD sends rain on the face of the earth.’”"
1 Kings,17,15,"So she went and did according to the word of Elijah, and she and he and her household ate for many days."
1 Kings,17,16,"The bowl of flour was not exhausted nor did the jar of oil become empty, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke through Elijah."
1 Kings,17,17,"Now it came about after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became sick; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him."
1 Kings,17,18,"So she said to Elijah, “What do I have to do with you, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my iniquity to remembrance and to put my son to death!”"
1 Kings,17,19,"He said to her, “Give me your son.” Then he took him from her bosom and carried him up to the upper room where he was living, and laid him on his own bed."
1 Kings,17,20,"He called to the LORD and said, “O LORD my God, have You also brought calamity to the widow with whom I am staying, by causing her son to die?”"
1 Kings,17,21,"Then he stretched himself upon the child three times, and called to the LORD and said, “O LORD my God, I pray You, let this child’s life return to him.”"
1 Kings,17,22,"The LORD heard the voice of Elijah, and the life of the child returned to him and he revived."
1 Kings,17,23,"Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house and gave him to his mother; and Elijah said, “See, your son is alive.”"
1 Kings,17,24,"Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth.”"
1 Kings,18,1,"Now it happened after many days that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, “Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the face of the earth.”"
1 Kings,18,2,So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria.
1 Kings,18,3,Ahab called Obadiah who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly;
1 Kings,18,4,"for when Jezebel destroyed the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave, and provided them with bread and water.)"
1 Kings,18,5,"Then Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys; perhaps we will find grass and keep the horses and mules alive, and not have to kill some of the cattle.”"
1 Kings,18,6,So they divided the land between them to survey it; Ahab went one way by himself and Obadiah went another way by himself.
1 Kings,18,7,"Now as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him, and he recognized him and fell on his face and said, “Is this you, Elijah my master?”"
1 Kings,18,8,"He said to him, “It is I. Go, say to your master, ‘Behold, Elijah is here.’”"
1 Kings,18,9,"He said, “What sin have I committed, that you are giving your servant into the hand of Ahab to put me to death?"
1 Kings,18,10,"As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent to search for you; and when they said, ‘He is not here,’ he made the kingdom or nation swear that they could not find you."
1 Kings,18,11,"And now you are saying, ‘Go, say to your master, “Behold, Elijah is here.”’"
1 Kings,18,12,"It will come about when I leave you that the Spirit of the LORD will carry you where I do not know; so when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have feared the LORD from my youth."
1 Kings,18,13,"Has it not been told to my master what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, that I hid a hundred prophets of the LORD by fifties in a cave, and provided them with bread and water?"
1 Kings,18,14,"And now you are saying, ‘Go, say to your master, “Behold, Elijah is here”’; he will then kill me.”"
1 Kings,18,15,"Elijah said, “As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.”"
1 Kings,18,16,So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
1 Kings,18,17,"When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is this you, you troubler of Israel?”"
1 Kings,18,18,"He said, “I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s house have, because you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD and you have followed the Baals."
1 Kings,18,19,"Now then send and gather to me all Israel at Mount Carmel, together with 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of the Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”"
1 Kings,18,20,So Ahab sent a message among all the sons of Israel and brought the prophets together at Mount Carmel.
1 Kings,18,21,"Elijah came near to all the people and said, “How long will you hesitate between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.” But the people did not answer him a word."
1 Kings,18,22,"Then Elijah said to the people, “I alone am left a prophet of the LORD, but Baal’s prophets are 450 men."
1 Kings,18,23,"Now let them give us two oxen; and let them choose one ox for themselves and cut it up, and place it on the wood, but put no fire under it; and I will prepare the other ox and lay it on the wood, and I will not put a fire under it."
1 Kings,18,24,"Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD, and the God who answers by fire, He is God.” And all the people said, “That is a good idea.”"
1 Kings,18,25,"So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one ox for yourselves and prepare it first for you are many, and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.”"
1 Kings,18,26,"Then they took the ox which was given them and they prepared it and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon saying, “O Baal, answer us.” But there was no voice and no one answered. And they leaped about the altar which they made."
1 Kings,18,27,"It came about at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, “Call out with a loud voice, for he is a god; either he is occupied or gone aside, or is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and needs to be awakened.”"
1 Kings,18,28,So they cried with a loud voice and cut themselves according to their custom with swords and lances until the blood gushed out on them.
1 Kings,18,29,"When midday was past, they raved until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice; but there was no voice, no one answered, and no one paid attention."
1 Kings,18,30,"Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD which had been torn down."
1 Kings,18,31,"Elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, “Israel shall be your name.”"
1 Kings,18,32,"So with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he made a trench around the altar, large enough to hold two measures of seed."
1 Kings,18,33,Then he arranged the wood and cut the ox in pieces and laid it on the wood.
1 Kings,18,34,"And he said, “Fill four pitchers with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.” And he said, “Do it a second time,” and they did it a second time. And he said, “Do it a third time,” and they did it a third time."
1 Kings,18,35,The water flowed around the altar and he also filled the trench with water.
1 Kings,18,36,"At the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet came near and said, “O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, today let it be known that You are God in Israel and that I am Your servant and I have done all these things at Your word."
1 Kings,18,37,"Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that You, O LORD, are God, and that You have turned their heart back again.”"
1 Kings,18,38,"Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench."
1 Kings,18,39,"When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, “The LORD, He is God; the LORD, He is God.”"
1 Kings,18,40,"Then Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; do not let one of them escape.” So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there."
1 Kings,18,41,"Now Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of the roar of a heavy shower.”"
1 Kings,18,42,So Ahab went up to eat and drink. But Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he crouched down on the earth and put his face between his knees.
1 Kings,18,43,"He said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” So he went up and looked and said, “There is nothing.” And he said, “Go back” seven times."
1 Kings,18,44,"It came about at the seventh time, that he said, “Behold, a cloud as small as a man’s hand is coming up from the sea.” And he said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Prepare your chariot and go down, so that the heavy shower does not stop you.’”"
1 Kings,18,45,"In a little while the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy shower. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel."
1 Kings,18,46,"Then the hand of the LORD was on Elijah, and he girded up his loins and outran Ahab to Jezreel."
1 Kings,19,1,"Now Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword."
1 Kings,19,2,"Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So may the gods do to me and even more, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.”"
1 Kings,19,3,"And he was afraid and arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there."
1 Kings,19,4,"But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree; and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, “It is enough; now, O LORD, take my life, for I am not better than my fathers.”"
1 Kings,19,5,"He lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold, there was an angel touching him, and he said to him, “Arise, eat.”"
1 Kings,19,6,"Then he looked and behold, there was at his head a bread cake baked on hot stones, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank and lay down again."
1 Kings,19,7,"The angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, “Arise, eat, because the journey is too great for you.”"
1 Kings,19,8,"So he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mountain of God."
1 Kings,19,9,"Then he came there to a cave and lodged there; and behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and He said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”"
1 Kings,19,10,"He said, “I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.”"
1 Kings,19,11,"So He said, “Go forth and stand on the mountain before the LORD.” And behold, the LORD was passing by! And a great and strong wind was rending the mountains and breaking in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake."
1 Kings,19,12,"After the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of a gentle blowing."
1 Kings,19,13,"When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice came to him and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”"
1 Kings,19,14,"Then he said, “I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.”"
1 Kings,19,15,"The LORD said to him, “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus, and when you have arrived, you shall anoint Hazael king over Aram;"
1 Kings,19,16,and Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place.
1 Kings,19,17,"It shall come about, the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall put to death."
1 Kings,19,18,"Yet I will leave 7,000 in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him.”"
1 Kings,19,19,"So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, while he was plowing with twelve pairs of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth. And Elijah passed over to him and threw his mantle on him."
1 Kings,19,20,"He left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, “Please let me kiss my father and my mother, then I will follow you.” And he said to him, “Go back again, for what have I done to you?”"
1 Kings,19,21,"So he returned from following him, and took the pair of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their flesh with the implements of the oxen, and gave it to the people and they ate. Then he arose and followed Elijah and ministered to him."
1 Kings,20,1,"Now Ben-hadad king of Aram gathered all his army, and there were thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Samaria and fought against it."
1 Kings,20,2,"Then he sent messengers to the city to Ahab king of Israel and said to him, “Thus says Ben-hadad,"
1 Kings,20,3,‘Your silver and your gold are mine; your most beautiful wives and children are also mine.’”
1 Kings,20,4,"The king of Israel replied, “It is according to your word, my lord, O king; I am yours, and all that I have.”"
1 Kings,20,5,"Then the messengers returned and said, “Thus says Ben-hadad, ‘Surely, I sent to you saying, “You shall give me your silver and your gold and your wives and your children,”"
1 Kings,20,6,"but about this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you, and they will search your house and the houses of your servants; and whatever is desirable in your eyes, they will take in their hand and carry away.’”"
1 Kings,20,7,"Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, “Please observe and see how this man is looking for trouble; for he sent to me for my wives and my children and my silver and my gold, and I did not refuse him.”"
1 Kings,20,8,"All the elders and all the people said to him, “Do not listen or consent.”"
1 Kings,20,9,"So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you sent for to your servant at the first I will do, but this thing I cannot do.’” And the messengers departed and brought him word again."
1 Kings,20,10,"Ben-hadad sent to him and said, “May the gods do so to me and more also, if the dust of Samaria will suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me.”"
1 Kings,20,11,"Then the king of Israel replied, “Tell him, ‘Let not him who girds on his armor boast like him who takes it off.’”"
1 Kings,20,12,"When Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking with the kings in the temporary shelters, he said to his servants, “Station yourselves.” So they stationed themselves against the city."
1 Kings,20,13,"Now behold, a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel and said, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver them into your hand today, and you shall know that I am the LORD.’”"
1 Kings,20,14,"Ahab said, “By whom?” So he said, “Thus says the LORD, ‘By the young men of the rulers of the provinces.’” Then he said, “Who shall begin the battle?” And he answered, “You.”"
1 Kings,20,15,"Then he mustered the young men of the rulers of the provinces, and there were 232; and after them he mustered all the people, even all the sons of Israel, 7,000."
1 Kings,20,16,"They went out at noon, while Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the temporary shelters with the thirty-two kings who helped him."
1 Kings,20,17,"The young men of the rulers of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out and they told him, saying, “Men have come out from Samaria.”"
1 Kings,20,18,"Then he said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive.”"
1 Kings,20,19,"So these went out from the city, the young men of the rulers of the provinces, and the army which followed them."
1 Kings,20,20,"They killed each his man; and the Arameans fled and Israel pursued them, and Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse with horsemen."
1 Kings,20,21,"The king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Arameans with a great slaughter."
1 Kings,20,22,"Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel and said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself and observe and see what you have to do; for at the turn of the year the king of Aram will come up against you.”"
1 Kings,20,23,"Now the servants of the king of Aram said to him, “Their gods are gods of the mountains, therefore they were stronger than we; but rather let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than they."
1 Kings,20,24,"Do this thing: remove the kings, each from his place, and put captains in their place,"
1 Kings,20,25,"and muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. Then we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than they.” And he listened to their voice and did so."
1 Kings,20,26,"At the turn of the year, Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel."
1 Kings,20,27,"The sons of Israel were mustered and were provisioned and went to meet them; and the sons of Israel camped before them like two little flocks of goats, but the Arameans filled the country."
1 Kings,20,28,"Then a man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel and said, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Because the Arameans have said, “The LORD is a god of the mountains, but He is not a god of the valleys,” therefore I will give all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.’”"
1 Kings,20,29,"So they camped one over against the other seven days. And on the seventh day the battle was joined, and the sons of Israel killed of the Arameans 100,000 foot soldiers in one day."
1 Kings,20,30,"But the rest fled to Aphek into the city, and the wall fell on 27,000 men who were left. And Ben-hadad fled and came into the city into an inner chamber."
1 Kings,20,31,"His servants said to him, “Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings, please let us put sackcloth on our loins and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will save your life.”"
1 Kings,20,32,"So they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’” And he said, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”"
1 Kings,20,33,"Now the men took this as an omen, and quickly catching his word said, “Your brother Ben-hadad.” Then he said, “Go, bring him.” Then Ben-hadad came out to him, and he took him up into the chariot."
1 Kings,20,34,"Ben-hadad said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I will restore, and you shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.” Ahab said, “And I will let you go with this covenant.” So he made a covenant with him and let him go."
1 Kings,20,35,"Now a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to another by the word of the LORD, “Please strike me.” But the man refused to strike him."
1 Kings,20,36,"Then he said to him, “Because you have not listened to the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as you have departed from me, a lion will kill you.” And as soon as he had departed from him a lion found him and killed him."
1 Kings,20,37,"Then he found another man and said, “Please strike me.” And the man struck him, wounding him."
1 Kings,20,38,"So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes."
1 Kings,20,39,"As the king passed by, he cried to the king and said, “Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside and brought a man to me and said, ‘Guard this man; if for any reason he is missing, then your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.’"
1 Kings,20,40,"While your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.” And the king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it.”"
1 Kings,20,41,"Then he hastily took the bandage away from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him that he was of the prophets."
1 Kings,20,42,"He said to him, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.’”"
1 Kings,20,43,"So the king of Israel went to his house sullen and vexed, and came to Samaria."
1 Kings,21,1,Now it came about after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
1 Kings,21,2,"Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden because it is close beside my house, and I will give you a better vineyard than it in its place; if you like, I will give you the price of it in money.”"
1 Kings,21,3,"But Naboth said to Ahab, “The LORD forbid me that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.”"
1 Kings,21,4,"So Ahab came into his house sullen and vexed because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and ate no food."
1 Kings,21,5,"But Jezebel his wife came to him and said to him, “How is it that your spirit is so sullen that you are not eating food?”"
1 Kings,21,6,"So he said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you a vineyard in its place.’ But he said, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’”"
1 Kings,21,7,"Jezebel his wife said to him, “Do you now reign over Israel? Arise, eat bread, and let your heart be joyful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”"
1 Kings,21,8,"So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name and sealed them with his seal, and sent letters to the elders and to the nobles who were living with Naboth in his city."
1 Kings,21,9,"Now she wrote in the letters, saying, “Proclaim a fast and seat Naboth at the head of the people;"
1 Kings,21,10,"and seat two worthless men before him, and let them testify against him, saying, ‘You cursed God and the king.’ Then take him out and stone him to death.”"
1 Kings,21,11,"So the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them, just as it was written in the letters which she had sent them."
1 Kings,21,12,They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the people.
1 Kings,21,13,"Then the two worthless men came in and sat before him; and the worthless men testified against him, even against Naboth, before the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king.” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones."
1 Kings,21,14,"Then they sent word to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned and is dead.”"
1 Kings,21,15,"When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.”"
1 Kings,21,16,"When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it."
1 Kings,21,17,"Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,"
1 Kings,21,18,"“Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth where he has gone down to take possession of it."
1 Kings,21,19,"You shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Have you murdered and also taken possession?”’ And you shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD, “In the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth the dogs will lick up your blood, even yours.”’”"
1 Kings,21,20,"Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, O my enemy?” And he answered, “I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the LORD."
1 Kings,21,21,"Behold, I will bring evil upon you, and will utterly sweep you away, and will cut off from Ahab every male, both bond and free in Israel;"
1 Kings,21,22,"and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, because of the provocation with which you have provoked Me to anger, and because you have made Israel sin."
1 Kings,21,23,"Of Jezebel also has the LORD spoken, saying, ‘The dogs will eat Jezebel in the district of Jezreel.’"
1 Kings,21,24,"The one belonging to Ahab, who dies in the city, the dogs will eat, and the one who dies in the field the birds of heaven will eat.”"
1 Kings,21,25,"Surely there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do evil in the sight of the LORD, because Jezebel his wife incited him."
1 Kings,21,26,"He acted very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites had done, whom the LORD cast out before the sons of Israel."
1 Kings,21,27,"It came about when Ahab heard these words, that he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and fasted, and he lay in sackcloth and went about despondently."
1 Kings,21,28,"Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,"
1 Kings,21,29,"“Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself before Me, I will not bring the evil in his days, but I will bring the evil upon his house in his son’s days.”"
1 Kings,22,1,Three years passed without war between Aram and Israel.
1 Kings,22,2,In the third year Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
1 Kings,22,3,"Now the king of Israel said to his servants, “Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we are still doing nothing to take it out of the hand of the king of Aram?”"
1 Kings,22,4,"And he said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?” And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”"
1 Kings,22,5,"Moreover, Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of the LORD.”"
1 Kings,22,6,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle or shall I refrain?” And they said, “Go up, for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.”"
1 Kings,22,7,"But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not yet a prophet of the LORD here that we may inquire of him?”"
1 Kings,22,8,"The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, but I hate him, because he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.” But Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say so.”"
1 Kings,22,9,"Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiah son of Imlah.”"
1 Kings,22,10,"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them."
1 Kings,22,11,"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made horns of iron for himself and said, “Thus says the LORD, ‘With these you will gore the Arameans until they are consumed.’”"
1 Kings,22,12,"All the prophets were prophesying thus, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper, for the LORD will give it into the hand of the king.”"
1 Kings,22,13,"Then the messenger who went to summon Micaiah spoke to him saying, “Behold now, the words of the prophets are uniformly favorable to the king. Please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.”"
1 Kings,22,14,"But Micaiah said, “As the LORD lives, what the LORD says to me, that I shall speak.”"
1 Kings,22,15,"When he came to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we refrain?” And he answered him, “Go up and succeed, and the LORD will give it into the hand of the king.”"
1 Kings,22,16,"Then the king said to him, “How many times must I adjure you to speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?”"
1 Kings,22,17,"So he said, “I saw all Israel Scattered on the mountains, Like sheep which have no shepherd. And the LORD said, ‘These have no master. Let each of them return to his house in peace.’”"
1 Kings,22,18,"Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”"
1 Kings,22,19,"Micaiah said, “Therefore, hear the word of the LORD. I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left."
1 Kings,22,20,"The LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ And one said this while another said that."
1 Kings,22,21,"Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD and said, ‘I will entice him.’"
1 Kings,22,22,"The LORD said to him, ‘How?’ And he said, ‘I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ Then He said, ‘You are to entice him and also prevail. Go and do so.’"
1 Kings,22,23,"Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and the LORD has proclaimed disaster against you.”"
1 Kings,22,24,"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, “How did the Spirit of the LORD pass from me to speak to you?”"
1 Kings,22,25,"Micaiah said, “Behold, you shall see on that day when you enter an inner room to hide yourself.”"
1 Kings,22,26,"Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son;"
1 Kings,22,27,"and say, ‘Thus says the king, “Put this man in prison and feed him sparingly with bread and water until I return safely.”’”"
1 Kings,22,28,"Micaiah said, “If you indeed return safely the LORD has not spoken by me.” And he said, “Listen, all you people.”"
1 Kings,22,29,So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up against Ramoth-gilead.
1 Kings,22,30,"The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into the battle, but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle."
1 Kings,22,31,"Now the king of Aram had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, “Do not fight with small or great, but with the king of Israel alone.”"
1 Kings,22,32,"So when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely it is the king of Israel,” and they turned aside to fight against him, and Jehoshaphat cried out."
1 Kings,22,33,"When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him."
1 Kings,22,34,"Now a certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel in a joint of the armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around and take me out of the fight; for I am severely wounded.”"
1 Kings,22,35,"The battle raged that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot in front of the Arameans, and died at evening, and the blood from the wound ran into the bottom of the chariot."
1 Kings,22,36,"Then a cry passed throughout the army close to sunset, saying, “Every man to his city and every man to his country.”"
1 Kings,22,37,"So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria."
1 Kings,22,38,"They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots bathed themselves there), according to the word of the LORD which He spoke."
1 Kings,22,39,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did and the ivory house which he built and all the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?"
1 Kings,22,40,"So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his son became king in his place."
1 Kings,22,41,Now Jehoshaphat the son of Asa became king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
1 Kings,22,42,"Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi."
1 Kings,22,43,"He walked in all the way of Asa his father; he did not turn aside from it, doing right in the sight of the LORD. However, the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places."
1 Kings,22,44,Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
1 Kings,22,45,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might which he showed and how he warred, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?"
1 Kings,22,46,"The remnant of the sodomites who remained in the days of his father Asa, he expelled from the land."
1 Kings,22,47,Now there was no king in Edom; a deputy was king.
1 Kings,22,48,"Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber."
1 Kings,22,49,"Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat was not willing."
1 Kings,22,50,"And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David, and Jehoram his son became king in his place."
1 Kings,22,51,"Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel."
1 Kings,22,52,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin."
1 Kings,22,53,"So he served Baal and worshiped him and provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger, according to all that his father had done."
2 Kings,1,1,Now Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
2 Kings,1,2,"And Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber which was in Samaria, and became ill. So he sent messengers and said to them, “Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover from this sickness.”"
2 Kings,1,3,"But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say to them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?’"
2 Kings,1,4,"Now therefore thus says the LORD, ‘You shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’” Then Elijah departed."
2 Kings,1,5,"When the messengers returned to him he said to them, “Why have you returned?”"
2 Kings,1,6,"They said to him, “A man came up to meet us and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you and say to him, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.’”’”"
2 Kings,1,7,"He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came up to meet you and spoke these words to you?”"
2 Kings,1,8,"They answered him, “He was a hairy man with a leather girdle bound about his loins.” And he said, “It is Elijah the Tishbite.”"
2 Kings,1,9,"Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him, and behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he said to him, “O man of God, the king says, ‘Come down.’”"
2 Kings,1,10,"Elijah replied to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.” Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty."
2 Kings,1,11,"So he again sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he said to him, “O man of God, thus says the king, ‘Come down quickly.’”"
2 Kings,1,12,"Elijah replied to them, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.” Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty."
2 Kings,1,13,"So he again sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. When the third captain of fifty went up, he came and bowed down on his knees before Elijah, and begged him and said to him, “O man of God, please let my life and the lives of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight."
2 Kings,1,14,Behold fire came down from heaven and consumed the first two captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in your sight.”
2 Kings,1,15,"The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, “Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.” So he arose and went down with him to the king."
2 Kings,1,16,"Then he said to him, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron—is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word?—therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.’”"
2 Kings,1,17,"So Ahaziah died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And because he had no son, Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah."
2 Kings,1,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,2,1,"And it came about when the LORD was about to take up Elijah by a whirlwind to heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal."
2 Kings,2,2,"Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here please, for the LORD has sent me as far as Bethel.” But Elisha said, “As the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel."
2 Kings,2,3,"Then the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from over you today?” And he said, “Yes, I know; be still.”"
2 Kings,2,4,"Elijah said to him, “Elisha, please stay here, for the LORD has sent me to Jericho.” But he said, “As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho."
2 Kings,2,5,"The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho approached Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from over you today?” And he answered, “Yes, I know; be still.”"
2 Kings,2,6,"Then Elijah said to him, “Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan.” And he said, “As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So the two of them went on."
2 Kings,2,7,"Now fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite them at a distance, while the two of them stood by the Jordan."
2 Kings,2,8,"Elijah took his mantle and folded it together and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground."
2 Kings,2,9,"When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken from you.” And Elisha said, “Please, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.”"
2 Kings,2,10,"He said, “You have asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so.”"
2 Kings,2,11,"As they were going along and talking, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire which separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind to heaven."
2 Kings,2,12,"Elisha saw it and cried out, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” And he saw Elijah no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces."
2 Kings,2,13,He also took up the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and returned and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
2 Kings,2,14,"He took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and struck the waters and said, “Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?” And when he also had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and Elisha crossed over."
2 Kings,2,15,"Now when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho opposite him saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him."
2 Kings,2,16,"They said to him, “Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men, please let them go and search for your master; perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up and cast him on some mountain or into some valley.” And he said, “You shall not send.”"
2 Kings,2,17,"But when they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send.” They sent therefore fifty men; and they searched three days but did not find him."
2 Kings,2,18,"They returned to him while he was staying at Jericho; and he said to them, “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not go’?”"
2 Kings,2,19,"Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold now, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad and the land is unfruitful.”"
2 Kings,2,20,"He said, “Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him."
2 Kings,2,21,"He went out to the spring of water and threw salt in it and said, “Thus says the LORD, ‘I have purified these waters; there shall not be from there death or unfruitfulness any longer.’”"
2 Kings,2,22,"So the waters have been purified to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke."
2 Kings,2,23,"Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up by the way, young lads came out from the city and mocked him and said to him, “Go up, you baldhead; go up, you baldhead!”"
2 Kings,2,24,"When he looked behind him and saw them, he cursed them in the name of the LORD. Then two female bears came out of the woods and tore up forty-two lads of their number."
2 Kings,2,25,"He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria."
2 Kings,3,1,"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years."
2 Kings,3,2,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, though not like his father and his mother; for he put away the sacred pillar of Baal which his father had made."
2 Kings,3,3,"Nevertheless, he clung to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin; he did not depart from them."
2 Kings,3,4,"Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and used to pay the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams."
2 Kings,3,5,"But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel."
2 Kings,3,6,And King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel.
2 Kings,3,7,"Then he went and sent word to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?” And he said, “I will go up; I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”"
2 Kings,3,8,"He said, “Which way shall we go up?” And he answered, “The way of the wilderness of Edom.”"
2 Kings,3,9,"So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days’ journey, and there was no water for the army or for the cattle that followed them."
2 Kings,3,10,"Then the king of Israel said, “Alas! For the LORD has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.”"
2 Kings,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not a prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of the LORD by him?” And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, “Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.”"
2 Kings,3,12,"Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the LORD is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him."
2 Kings,3,13,"Now Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What do I have to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother.” And the king of Israel said to him, “No, for the LORD has called these three kings together to give them into the hand of Moab.”"
2 Kings,3,14,"Elisha said, “As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look at you nor see you."
2 Kings,3,15,"But now bring me a minstrel.” And it came about, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him."
2 Kings,3,16,"He said, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Make this valley full of trenches.’"
2 Kings,3,17,"For thus says the LORD, ‘You shall not see wind nor shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, so that you shall drink, both you and your cattle and your beasts."
2 Kings,3,18,This is but a slight thing in the sight of the LORD; He will also give the Moabites into your hand.
2 Kings,3,19,"Then you shall strike every fortified city and every choice city, and fell every good tree and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.’”"
2 Kings,3,20,"It happened in the morning about the time of offering the sacrifice, that behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water."
2 Kings,3,21,Now all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them. And all who were able to put on armor and older were summoned and stood on the border.
2 Kings,3,22,"They rose early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood."
2 Kings,3,23,"Then they said, “This is blood; the kings have surely fought together, and they have slain one another. Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!”"
2 Kings,3,24,"But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites arose and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land, slaughtering the Moabites."
2 Kings,3,25,"Thus they destroyed the cities; and each one threw a stone on every piece of good land and filled it. So they stopped all the springs of water and felled all the good trees, until in Kir-hareseth only they left its stones; however, the slingers went about it and struck it."
2 Kings,3,26,"When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him 700 men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not."
2 Kings,3,27,"Then he took his oldest son who was to reign in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. And there came great wrath against Israel, and they departed from him and returned to their own land."
2 Kings,4,1,"Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, “Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared the LORD; and the creditor has come to take my two children to be his slaves.”"
2 Kings,4,2,"Elisha said to her, “What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?” And she said, “Your maidservant has nothing in the house except a jar of oil.”"
2 Kings,4,3,"Then he said, “Go, borrow vessels at large for yourself from all your neighbors, even empty vessels; do not get a few."
2 Kings,4,4,"And you shall go in and shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour out into all these vessels, and you shall set aside what is full.”"
2 Kings,4,5,So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons; they were bringing the vessels to her and she poured.
2 Kings,4,6,"When the vessels were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another vessel.” And he said to her, “There is not one vessel more.” And the oil stopped."
2 Kings,4,7,"Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debt, and you and your sons can live on the rest.”"
2 Kings,4,8,"Now there came a day when Elisha passed over to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman, and she persuaded him to eat food. And so it was, as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat food."
2 Kings,4,9,"She said to her husband, “Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God passing by us continually."
2 Kings,4,10,"Please, let us make a little walled upper chamber and let us set a bed for him there, and a table and a chair and a lampstand; and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he can turn in there.”"
2 Kings,4,11,One day he came there and turned in to the upper chamber and rested.
2 Kings,4,12,"Then he said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite.” And when he had called her, she stood before him."
2 Kings,4,13,"He said to him, “Say now to her, ‘Behold, you have been careful for us with all this care; what can I do for you? Would you be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the army?’” And she answered, “I live among my own people.”"
2 Kings,4,14,"So he said, “What then is to be done for her?” And Gehazi answered, “Truly she has no son and her husband is old.”"
2 Kings,4,15,"He said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the doorway."
2 Kings,4,16,"Then he said, “At this season next year you will embrace a son.” And she said, “No, my lord, O man of God, do not lie to your maidservant.”"
2 Kings,4,17,"The woman conceived and bore a son at that season the next year, as Elisha had said to her."
2 Kings,4,18,"When the child was grown, the day came that he went out to his father to the reapers."
2 Kings,4,19,"He said to his father, “My head, my head.” And he said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.”"
2 Kings,4,20,"When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her lap until noon, and then died."
2 Kings,4,21,"She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door behind him and went out."
2 Kings,4,22,"Then she called to her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and return.”"
2 Kings,4,23,"He said, “Why will you go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath.” And she said, “It will be well.”"
2 Kings,4,24,"Then she saddled a donkey and said to her servant, “Drive and go forward; do not slow down the pace for me unless I tell you.”"
2 Kings,4,25,"So she went and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her at a distance, he said to Gehazi his servant, “Behold, there is the Shunammite."
2 Kings,4,26,"Please run now to meet her and say to her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?’” And she answered, “It is well.”"
2 Kings,4,27,"When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to push her away; but the man of God said, “Let her alone, for her soul is troubled within her; and the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me.”"
2 Kings,4,28,"Then she said, “Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say, ‘Do not deceive me’?”"
2 Kings,4,29,"Then he said to Gehazi, “Gird up your loins and take my staff in your hand, and go your way; if you meet any man, do not salute him, and if anyone salutes you, do not answer him; and lay my staff on the lad’s face.”"
2 Kings,4,30,"The mother of the lad said, “As the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” And he arose and followed her."
2 Kings,4,31,"Then Gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff on the lad’s face, but there was no sound or response. So he returned to meet him and told him, “The lad has not awakened.”"
2 Kings,4,32,"When Elisha came into the house, behold the lad was dead and laid on his bed."
2 Kings,4,33,So he entered and shut the door behind them both and prayed to the LORD.
2 Kings,4,34,"And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth and his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands, and he stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child became warm."
2 Kings,4,35,"Then he returned and walked in the house once back and forth, and went up and stretched himself on him; and the lad sneezed seven times and the lad opened his eyes."
2 Kings,4,36,"He called Gehazi and said, “Call this Shunammite.” So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, “Take up your son.”"
2 Kings,4,37,"Then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground, and she took up her son and went out."
2 Kings,4,38,"When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. As the sons of the prophets were sitting before him, he said to his servant, “Put on the large pot and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.”"
2 Kings,4,39,"Then one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine and gathered from it his lap full of wild gourds, and came and sliced them into the pot of stew, for they did not know what they were."
2 Kings,4,40,"So they poured it out for the men to eat. And as they were eating of the stew, they cried out and said, “O man of God, there is death in the pot.” And they were unable to eat."
2 Kings,4,41,"But he said, “Now bring meal.” He threw it into the pot and said, “Pour it out for the people that they may eat.” Then there was no harm in the pot."
2 Kings,4,42,"Now a man came from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, “Give them to the people that they may eat.”"
2 Kings,4,43,"His attendant said, “What, will I set this before a hundred men?” But he said, “Give them to the people that they may eat, for thus says the LORD, ‘They shall eat and have some left over.’”"
2 Kings,4,44,"So he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the LORD."
2 Kings,5,1,"Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man with his master, and highly respected, because by him the LORD had given victory to Aram. The man was also a valiant warrior, but he was a leper."
2 Kings,5,2,Now the Arameans had gone out in bands and had taken captive a little girl from the land of Israel; and she waited on Naaman’s wife.
2 Kings,5,3,"She said to her mistress, “I wish that my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his leprosy.”"
2 Kings,5,4,"Naaman went in and told his master, saying, “Thus and thus spoke the girl who is from the land of Israel.”"
2 Kings,5,5,"Then the king of Aram said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” He departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand shekels of gold and ten changes of clothes."
2 Kings,5,6,"He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, “And now as this letter comes to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may cure him of his leprosy.”"
2 Kings,5,7,"When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, “Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man is sending word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? But consider now, and see how he is seeking a quarrel against me.”"
2 Kings,5,8,"It happened when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent word to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Now let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.”"
2 Kings,5,9,So Naaman came with his horses and his chariots and stood at the doorway of the house of Elisha.
2 Kings,5,10,"Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh will be restored to you and you will be clean.”"
2 Kings,5,11,"But Naaman was furious and went away and said, “Behold, I thought, ‘He will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place and cure the leper.’"
2 Kings,5,12,"Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage."
2 Kings,5,13,"Then his servants came near and spoke to him and said, “My father, had the prophet told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean’?”"
2 Kings,5,14,"So he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child and he was clean."
2 Kings,5,15,"When he returned to the man of God with all his company, and came and stood before him, he said, “Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel; so please take a present from your servant now.”"
2 Kings,5,16,"But he said, “As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will take nothing.” And he urged him to take it, but he refused."
2 Kings,5,17,"Naaman said, “If not, please let your servant at least be given two mules’ load of earth; for your servant will no longer offer burnt offering nor will he sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD."
2 Kings,5,18,"In this matter may the LORD pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this matter.”"
2 Kings,5,19,"He said to him, “Go in peace.” So he departed from him some distance."
2 Kings,5,20,"But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought, “Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Aramean, by not receiving from his hands what he brought. As the LORD lives, I will run after him and take something from him.”"
2 Kings,5,21,"So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him and said, “Is all well?”"
2 Kings,5,22,"He said, “All is well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Behold, just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothes.’”"
2 Kings,5,23,"Naaman said, “Be pleased to take two talents.” And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes and gave them to two of his servants; and they carried them before him."
2 Kings,5,24,"When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand and deposited them in the house, and he sent the men away, and they departed."
2 Kings,5,25,"But he went in and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” And he said, “Your servant went nowhere.”"
2 Kings,5,26,"Then he said to him, “Did not my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money and to receive clothes and olive groves and vineyards and sheep and oxen and male and female servants?"
2 Kings,5,27,"Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever.” So he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow."
2 Kings,6,1,"Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “Behold now, the place before you where we are living is too limited for us."
2 Kings,6,2,"Please let us go to the Jordan and each of us take from there a beam, and let us make a place there for ourselves where we may live.” So he said, “Go.”"
2 Kings,6,3,"Then one said, “Please be willing to go with your servants.” And he answered, “I shall go.”"
2 Kings,6,4,"So he went with them; and when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees."
2 Kings,6,5,"But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, “Alas, my master! For it was borrowed.”"
2 Kings,6,6,"Then the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” And when he showed him the place, he cut off a stick and threw it in there, and made the iron float."
2 Kings,6,7,"He said, “Take it up for yourself.” So he put out his hand and took it."
2 Kings,6,8,"Now the king of Aram was warring against Israel; and he counseled with his servants saying, “In such and such a place shall be my camp.”"
2 Kings,6,9,"The man of God sent word to the king of Israel saying, “Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Arameans are coming down there.”"
2 Kings,6,10,"The king of Israel sent to the place about which the man of God had told him; thus he warned him, so that he guarded himself there, more than once or twice."
2 Kings,6,11,"Now the heart of the king of Aram was enraged over this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, “Will you tell me which of us is for the king of Israel?”"
2 Kings,6,12,"One of his servants said, “No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.”"
2 Kings,6,13,"So he said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send and take him.” And it was told him, saying, “Behold, he is in Dothan.”"
2 Kings,6,14,"He sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city."
2 Kings,6,15,"Now when the attendant of the man of God had risen early and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was circling the city. And his servant said to him, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”"
2 Kings,6,16,"So he answered, “Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”"
2 Kings,6,17,"Then Elisha prayed and said, “O LORD, I pray, open his eyes that he may see.” And the LORD opened the servant’s eyes and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha."
2 Kings,6,18,"When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD and said, “Strike this people with blindness, I pray.” So He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha."
2 Kings,6,19,"Then Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, nor is this the city; follow me and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” And he brought them to Samaria."
2 Kings,6,20,"When they had come into Samaria, Elisha said, “O LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.” So the LORD opened their eyes and they saw; and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria."
2 Kings,6,21,"Then the king of Israel when he saw them, said to Elisha, “My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?”"
2 Kings,6,22,"He answered, “You shall not kill them. Would you kill those you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.”"
2 Kings,6,23,"So he prepared a great feast for them; and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the marauding bands of Arameans did not come again into the land of Israel."
2 Kings,6,24,"Now it came about after this, that Ben-hadad king of Aram gathered all his army and went up and besieged Samaria."
2 Kings,6,25,"There was a great famine in Samaria; and behold, they besieged it, until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a fourth of a kab of dove’s dung for five shekels of silver."
2 Kings,6,26,"As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall a woman cried out to him, saying, “Help, my lord, O king!”"
2 Kings,6,27,"He said, “If the LORD does not help you, from where shall I help you? From the threshing floor, or from the wine press?”"
2 Kings,6,28,"And the king said to her, “What is the matter with you?” And she answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’"
2 Kings,6,29,"So we boiled my son and ate him; and I said to her on the next day, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him’; but she has hidden her son.”"
2 Kings,6,30,"When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes—now he was passing by on the wall—and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth beneath on his body."
2 Kings,6,31,"Then he said, “May God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today.”"
2 Kings,6,32,"Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And the king sent a man from his presence; but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, “Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold the door shut against him. Is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?”"
2 Kings,6,33,"While he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him and he said, “Behold, this evil is from the LORD; why should I wait for the LORD any longer?”"
2 Kings,7,1,"Then Elisha said, “Listen to the word of the LORD; thus says the LORD, ‘Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour will be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.’”"
2 Kings,7,2,"The royal officer on whose hand the king was leaning answered the man of God and said, “Behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, could this thing be?” Then he said, “Behold, you will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat of it.”"
2 Kings,7,3,"Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said to one another, “Why do we sit here until we die?"
2 Kings,7,4,"If we say, ‘We will enter the city,’ then the famine is in the city and we will die there; and if we sit here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us go over to the camp of the Arameans. If they spare us, we will live; and if they kill us, we will but die.”"
2 Kings,7,5,"They arose at twilight to go to the camp of the Arameans; when they came to the outskirts of the camp of the Arameans, behold, there was no one there."
2 Kings,7,6,"For the Lord had caused the army of the Arameans to hear a sound of chariots and a sound of horses, even the sound of a great army, so that they said to one another, “Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.”"
2 Kings,7,7,"Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents and their horses and their donkeys, even the camp just as it was, and fled for their life."
2 Kings,7,8,"When these lepers came to the outskirts of the camp, they entered one tent and ate and drank, and carried from there silver and gold and clothes, and went and hid them; and they returned and entered another tent and carried from there also, and went and hid them."
2 Kings,7,9,"Then they said to one another, “We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, but we are keeping silent; if we wait until morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king’s household.”"
2 Kings,7,10,"So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and they told them, saying, “We came to the camp of the Arameans, and behold, there was no one there, nor the voice of man, only the horses tied and the donkeys tied, and the tents just as they were.”"
2 Kings,7,11,The gatekeepers called and told it within the king’s household.
2 Kings,7,12,"Then the king arose in the night and said to his servants, “I will now tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone from the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, ‘When they come out of the city, we will capture them alive and get into the city.’”"
2 Kings,7,13,"One of his servants said, “Please, let some men take five of the horses which remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they will be in any case like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it; behold, they will be in any case like all the multitude of Israel who have already perished, so let us send and see.”"
2 Kings,7,14,"They took therefore two chariots with horses, and the king sent after the army of the Arameans, saying, “Go and see.”"
2 Kings,7,15,"They went after them to the Jordan, and behold, all the way was full of clothes and equipment which the Arameans had thrown away in their haste. Then the messengers returned and told the king."
2 Kings,7,16,"So the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. Then a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD."
2 Kings,7,17,"Now the king appointed the royal officer on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate; but the people trampled on him at the gate, and he died just as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him."
2 Kings,7,18,"It happened just as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, “Two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, will be sold tomorrow about this time at the gate of Samaria.”"
2 Kings,7,19,"Then the royal officer answered the man of God and said, “Now behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, could such a thing be?” And he said, “Behold, you will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat of it.”"
2 Kings,7,20,"And so it happened to him, for the people trampled on him at the gate and he died."
2 Kings,8,1,"Now Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Arise and go with your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn; for the LORD has called for a famine, and it will even come on the land for seven years.”"
2 Kings,8,2,"So the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of God, and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years."
2 Kings,8,3,"At the end of seven years, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines; and she went out to appeal to the king for her house and for her field."
2 Kings,8,4,"Now the king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please relate to me all the great things that Elisha has done.”"
2 Kings,8,5,"As he was relating to the king how he had restored to life the one who was dead, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and for her field. And Gehazi said, “My lord, O king, this is the woman and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.”"
2 Kings,8,6,"When the king asked the woman, she related it to him. So the king appointed for her a certain officer, saying, “Restore all that was hers and all the produce of the field from the day that she left the land even until now.”"
2 Kings,8,7,"Then Elisha came to Damascus. Now Ben-hadad king of Aram was sick, and it was told him, saying, “The man of God has come here.”"
2 Kings,8,8,"The king said to Hazael, “Take a gift in your hand and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, ‘Will I recover from this sickness?’”"
2 Kings,8,9,"So Hazael went to meet him and took a gift in his hand, even every kind of good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ loads; and he came and stood before him and said, “Your son Ben-hadad king of Aram has sent me to you, saying, ‘Will I recover from this sickness?’”"
2 Kings,8,10,"Then Elisha said to him, “Go, say to him, ‘You will surely recover,’ but the LORD has shown me that he will certainly die.”"
2 Kings,8,11,"He fixed his gaze steadily on him until he was ashamed, and the man of God wept."
2 Kings,8,12,"Hazael said, “Why does my lord weep?” Then he answered, “Because I know the evil that you will do to the sons of Israel: their strongholds you will set on fire, and their young men you will kill with the sword, and their little ones you will dash in pieces, and their women with child you will rip up.”"
2 Kings,8,13,"Then Hazael said, “But what is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?” And Elisha answered, “The LORD has shown me that you will be king over Aram.”"
2 Kings,8,14,"So he departed from Elisha and returned to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he answered, “He told me that you would surely recover.”"
2 Kings,8,15,"On the following day, he took the cover and dipped it in water and spread it on his face, so that he died. And Hazael became king in his place."
2 Kings,8,16,"Now in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then the king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah became king."
2 Kings,8,17,"He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem."
2 Kings,8,18,"He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab became his wife; and he did evil in the sight of the LORD."
2 Kings,8,19,"However, the LORD was not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David His servant, since He had promised him to give a lamp to him through his sons always."
2 Kings,8,20,"In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves."
2 Kings,8,21,"Then Joram crossed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him. And he arose by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots; but his army fled to their tents."
2 Kings,8,22,So Edom revolted against Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
2 Kings,8,23,"The rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,8,24,So Joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son became king in his place.
2 Kings,8,25,"In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign."
2 Kings,8,26,"Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel."
2 Kings,8,27,"He walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD, like the house of Ahab had done, because he was a son-in-law of the house of Ahab."
2 Kings,8,28,"Then he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead, and the Arameans wounded Joram."
2 Kings,8,29,So King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was sick.
2 Kings,9,1,"Now Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him, “Gird up your loins, and take this flask of oil in your hand and go to Ramoth-gilead."
2 Kings,9,2,"When you arrive there, search out Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in and bid him arise from among his brothers, and bring him to an inner room."
2 Kings,9,3,"Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head and say, ‘Thus says the LORD, “I have anointed you king over Israel.”’ Then open the door and flee and do not wait.”"
2 Kings,9,4,"So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead."
2 Kings,9,5,"When he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting, and he said, “I have a word for you, O captain.” And Jehu said, “For which one of us?” And he said, “For you, O captain.”"
2 Kings,9,6,"He arose and went into the house, and he poured the oil on his head and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel."
2 Kings,9,7,"You shall strike the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel."
2 Kings,9,8,"For the whole house of Ahab shall perish, and I will cut off from Ahab every male person both bond and free in Israel."
2 Kings,9,9,"I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah."
2 Kings,9,10,"The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and none shall bury her.’” Then he opened the door and fled."
2 Kings,9,11,"Now Jehu came out to the servants of his master, and one said to him, “Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?” And he said to them, “You know very well the man and his talk.”"
2 Kings,9,12,"They said, “It is a lie, tell us now.” And he said, “Thus and thus he said to me, ‘Thus says the LORD, “I have anointed you king over Israel.”’”"
2 Kings,9,13,"Then they hurried and each man took his garment and placed it under him on the bare steps, and blew the trumpet, saying, “Jehu is king!”"
2 Kings,9,14,"So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Now Joram with all Israel was defending Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Aram,"
2 Kings,9,15,"but King Joram had returned to Jezreel to be healed of the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael king of Aram. So Jehu said, “If this is your mind, then let no one escape or leave the city to go tell it in Jezreel.”"
2 Kings,9,16,"Then Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there. Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram."
2 Kings,9,17,"Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and said, “I see a company.” And Joram said, “Take a horseman and send him to meet them and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’”"
2 Kings,9,18,"So a horseman went to meet him and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’” And Jehu said, “What have you to do with peace? Turn behind me.” And the watchman reported, “The messenger came to them, but he did not return.”"
2 Kings,9,19,"Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’” And Jehu answered, “What have you to do with peace? Turn behind me.”"
2 Kings,9,20,"The watchman reported, “He came even to them, and he did not return; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.”"
2 Kings,9,21,"Then Joram said, “Get ready.” And they made his chariot ready. Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu and found him in the property of Naboth the Jezreelite."
2 Kings,9,22,"When Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?” And he answered, “What peace, so long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?”"
2 Kings,9,23,"So Joram reined about and fled and said to Ahaziah, “There is treachery, O Ahaziah!”"
2 Kings,9,24,And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his arms; and the arrow went through his heart and he sank in his chariot.
2 Kings,9,25,"Then Jehu said to Bidkar his officer, “Take him up and cast him into the property of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite, for I remember when you and I were riding together after Ahab his father, that the LORD laid this oracle against him:"
2 Kings,9,26,"‘Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,’ says the LORD, ‘and I will repay you in this property,’ says the LORD. Now then, take and cast him into the property, according to the word of the LORD.”"
2 Kings,9,27,"When Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu pursued him and said, “Shoot him too, in the chariot.” So they shot him at the ascent of Gur, which is at Ibleam. But he fled to Megiddo and died there."
2 Kings,9,28,Then his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his grave with his fathers in the city of David.
2 Kings,9,29,"Now in the eleventh year of Joram, the son of Ahab, Ahaziah became king over Judah."
2 Kings,9,30,"When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it, and she painted her eyes and adorned her head and looked out the window."
2 Kings,9,31,"As Jehu entered the gate, she said, “Is it well, Zimri, your master’s murderer?”"
2 Kings,9,32,"Then he lifted up his face to the window and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” And two or three officials looked down at him."
2 Kings,9,33,"He said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down, and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses, and he trampled her under foot."
2 Kings,9,34,"When he came in, he ate and drank; and he said, “See now to this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king’s daughter.”"
2 Kings,9,35,"They went to bury her, but they found nothing more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands."
2 Kings,9,36,"Therefore they returned and told him. And he said, “This is the word of the LORD, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘In the property of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel;"
2 Kings,9,37,"and the corpse of Jezebel will be as dung on the face of the field in the property of Jezreel, so they cannot say, “This is Jezebel.”’”"
2 Kings,10,1,"Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, the elders, and to the guardians of the children of Ahab, saying,"
2 Kings,10,2,"“Now, when this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons are with you, as well as the chariots and horses and a fortified city and the weapons,"
2 Kings,10,3,"select the best and fittest of your master’s sons, and set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.”"
2 Kings,10,4,"But they feared greatly and said, “Behold, the two kings did not stand before him; how then can we stand?”"
2 Kings,10,5,"And the one who was over the household, and he who was over the city, the elders, and the guardians of the children, sent word to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants, all that you say to us we will do, we will not make any man king; do what is good in your sight.”"
2 Kings,10,6,"Then he wrote a letter to them a second time saying, “If you are on my side, and you will listen to my voice, take the heads of the men, your master’s sons, and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow about this time.” Now the king’s sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who were rearing them."
2 Kings,10,7,"When the letter came to them, they took the king’s sons and slaughtered them, seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him at Jezreel."
2 Kings,10,8,"When the messenger came and told him, saying, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons,” he said, “Put them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.”"
2 Kings,10,9,"Now in the morning he went out and stood and said to all the people, “You are innocent; behold, I conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these?"
2 Kings,10,10,"Know then that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab, for the LORD has done what He spoke through His servant Elijah.”"
2 Kings,10,11,"So Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men and his acquaintances and his priests, until he left him without a survivor."
2 Kings,10,12,"Then he arose and departed and went to Samaria. On the way while he was at Beth-eked of the shepherds,"
2 Kings,10,13,"Jehu met the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and said, “Who are you?” And they answered, “We are the relatives of Ahaziah; and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother.”"
2 Kings,10,14,"He said, “Take them alive.” So they took them alive and killed them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two men; and he left none of them."
2 Kings,10,15,"Now when he had departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he greeted him and said to him, “Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?” And Jehonadab answered, “It is.” Jehu said, “If it is, give me your hand.” And he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot."
2 Kings,10,16,"He said, “Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD.” So he made him ride in his chariot."
2 Kings,10,17,"When he came to Samaria, he killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke to Elijah."
2 Kings,10,18,"Then Jehu gathered all the people and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much."
2 Kings,10,19,"Now, summon all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers and all his priests; let no one be missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal; whoever is missing shall not live.” But Jehu did it in cunning, so that he might destroy the worshipers of Baal."
2 Kings,10,20,"And Jehu said, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.” And they proclaimed it."
2 Kings,10,21,"Then Jehu sent throughout Israel and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And when they went into the house of Baal, the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other."
2 Kings,10,22,"He said to the one who was in charge of the wardrobe, “Bring out garments for all the worshipers of Baal.” So he brought out garments for them."
2 Kings,10,23,"Jehu went into the house of Baal with Jehonadab the son of Rechab; and he said to the worshipers of Baal, “Search and see that there is here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but only the worshipers of Baal.”"
2 Kings,10,24,"Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed for himself eighty men outside, and he had said, “The one who permits any of the men whom I bring into your hands to escape shall give up his life in exchange.”"
2 Kings,10,25,"Then it came about, as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the royal officers, “Go in, kill them; let none come out.” And they killed them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the royal officers threw them out, and went to the inner room of the house of Baal."
2 Kings,10,26,They brought out the sacred pillars of the house of Baal and burned them.
2 Kings,10,27,"They also broke down the sacred pillar of Baal and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine to this day."
2 Kings,10,28,Thus Jehu eradicated Baal out of Israel.
2 Kings,10,29,"However, as for the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin, from these Jehu did not depart, even the golden calves that were at Bethel and that were at Dan."
2 Kings,10,30,"The LORD said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in executing what is right in My eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in My heart, your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.”"
2 Kings,10,31,"But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, which he made Israel sin."
2 Kings,10,32,In those days the LORD began to cut off portions from Israel; and Hazael defeated them throughout the territory of Israel:
2 Kings,10,33,"from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites and the Reubenites and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan."
2 Kings,10,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,10,35,"And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son became king in his place."
2 Kings,10,36,Now the time which Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
2 Kings,11,1,"When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she rose and destroyed all the royal offspring."
2 Kings,11,2,"But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king’s sons who were being put to death, and placed him and his nurse in the bedroom. So they hid him from Athaliah, and he was not put to death."
2 Kings,11,3,"So he was hidden with her in the house of the LORD six years, while Athaliah was reigning over the land."
2 Kings,11,4,"Now in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him in the house of the LORD. Then he made a covenant with them and put them under oath in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king’s son."
2 Kings,11,5,"He commanded them, saying, “This is the thing that you shall do: one third of you, who come in on the sabbath and keep watch over the king’s house"
2 Kings,11,6,"(one third also shall be at the gate Sur, and one third at the gate behind the guards), shall keep watch over the house for defense."
2 Kings,11,7,"Two parts of you, even all who go out on the sabbath, shall also keep watch over the house of the LORD for the king."
2 Kings,11,8,"Then you shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes within the ranks shall be put to death. And be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in.”"
2 Kings,11,9,"So the captains of hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each one of them took his men who were to come in on the sabbath, with those who were to go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest."
2 Kings,11,10,"The priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and shields that had been King David’s, which were in the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,11,11,"The guards stood each with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, by the altar and by the house, around the king."
2 Kings,11,12,"Then he brought the king’s son out and put the crown on him and gave him the testimony; and they made him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, “Long live the king!”"
2 Kings,11,13,"When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people in the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,11,14,"She looked and behold, the king was standing by the pillar, according to the custom, with the captains and the trumpeters beside the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, “Treason! Treason!”"
2 Kings,11,15,"And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were appointed over the army and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks, and whoever follows her put to death with the sword.” For the priest said, “Let her not be put to death in the house of the LORD.”"
2 Kings,11,16,"So they seized her, and when she arrived at the horses’ entrance of the king’s house, she was put to death there."
2 Kings,11,17,"Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they would be the LORD’S people, also between the king and the people."
2 Kings,11,18,"All the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and tore it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,11,19,"He took the captains of hundreds and the Carites and the guards and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guards to the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings."
2 Kings,11,20,So all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet. For they had put Athaliah to death with the sword at the king’s house.
2 Kings,11,21,Jehoash was seven years old when he became king.
2 Kings,12,1,"In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba."
2 Kings,12,2,Jehoash did right in the sight of the LORD all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
2 Kings,12,3,Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
2 Kings,12,4,"Then Jehoash said to the priests, “All the money of the sacred things which is brought into the house of the LORD, in current money, both the money of each man’s assessment and all the money which any man’s heart prompts him to bring into the house of the LORD,"
2 Kings,12,5,"let the priests take it for themselves, each from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the damages of the house wherever any damage may be found.”"
2 Kings,12,6,But it came about that in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash the priests had not repaired the damages of the house.
2 Kings,12,7,"Then King Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests and said to them, “Why do you not repair the damages of the house? Now therefore take no more money from your acquaintances, but pay it for the damages of the house.”"
2 Kings,12,8,"So the priests agreed that they would take no more money from the people, nor repair the damages of the house."
2 Kings,12,9,"But Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in its lid and put it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the LORD; and the priests who guarded the threshold put in it all the money which was brought into the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,12,10,"When they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king’s scribe and the high priest came up and tied it in bags and counted the money which was found in the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,12,11,"They gave the money which was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the house of the LORD; and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders who worked on the house of the LORD;"
2 Kings,12,12,"and to the masons and the stonecutters, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the damages to the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it."
2 Kings,12,13,"But there were not made for the house of the LORD silver cups, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver from the money which was brought into the house of the LORD;"
2 Kings,12,14,"for they gave that to those who did the work, and with it they repaired the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,12,15,"Moreover, they did not require an accounting from the men into whose hand they gave the money to pay to those who did the work, for they dealt faithfully."
2 Kings,12,16,The money from the guilt offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD; it was for the priests.
2 Kings,12,17,"Then Hazael king of Aram went up and fought against Gath and captured it, and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem."
2 Kings,12,18,"Jehoash king of Judah took all the sacred things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own sacred things and all the gold that was found among the treasuries of the house of the LORD and of the king’s house, and sent them to Hazael king of Aram. Then he went away from Jerusalem."
2 Kings,12,19,"Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,12,20,His servants arose and made a conspiracy and struck down Joash at the house of Millo as he was going down to Silla.
2 Kings,12,21,"For Jozacar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Amaziah his son became king in his place."
2 Kings,13,1,"In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu became king over Israel at Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years."
2 Kings,13,2,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel sin; he did not turn from them."
2 Kings,13,3,"So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and He gave them continually into the hand of Hazael king of Aram, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael."
2 Kings,13,4,"Then Jehoahaz entreated the favor of the LORD, and the LORD listened to him; for He saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Aram oppressed them."
2 Kings,13,5,"The LORD gave Israel a deliverer, so that they escaped from under the hand of the Arameans; and the sons of Israel lived in their tents as formerly."
2 Kings,13,6,"Nevertheless they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel sin, but walked in them; and the Asherah also remained standing in Samaria."
2 Kings,13,7,"For he left to Jehoahaz of the army not more than fifty horsemen and ten chariots and 10,000 footmen, for the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing."
2 Kings,13,8,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,13,9,"And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria; and Joash his son became king in his place."
2 Kings,13,10,"In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years."
2 Kings,13,11,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not turn away from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel sin, but he walked in them."
2 Kings,13,12,"Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,13,13,"So Joash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne; and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel."
2 Kings,13,14,"When Elisha became sick with the illness of which he was to die, Joash the king of Israel came down to him and wept over him and said, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”"
2 Kings,13,15,"Elisha said to him, “Take a bow and arrows.” So he took a bow and arrows."
2 Kings,13,16,"Then he said to the king of Israel, “Put your hand on the bow.” And he put his hand on it, then Elisha laid his hands on the king’s hands."
2 Kings,13,17,"He said, “Open the window toward the east,” and he opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot!” And he shot. And he said, “The LORD’S arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Aram; for you will defeat the Arameans at Aphek until you have destroyed them.”"
2 Kings,13,18,"Then he said, “Take the arrows,” and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground,” and he struck it three times and stopped."
2 Kings,13,19,"So the man of God was angry with him and said, “You should have struck five or six times, then you would have struck Aram until you would have destroyed it. But now you shall strike Aram only three times.”"
2 Kings,13,20,"Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites would invade the land in the spring of the year."
2 Kings,13,21,"As they were burying a man, behold, they saw a marauding band; and they cast the man into the grave of Elisha. And when the man touched the bones of Elisha he revived and stood up on his feet."
2 Kings,13,22,Now Hazael king of Aram had oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
2 Kings,13,23,"But the LORD was gracious to them and had compassion on them and turned to them because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them or cast them from His presence until now."
2 Kings,13,24,"When Hazael king of Aram died, Ben-hadad his son became king in his place."
2 Kings,13,25,Then Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken in war from the hand of Jehoahaz his father. Three times Joash defeated him and recovered the cities of Israel.
2 Kings,14,1,"In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah became king."
2 Kings,14,2,"He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem."
2 Kings,14,3,"He did right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father; he did according to all that Joash his father had done."
2 Kings,14,4,Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
2 Kings,14,5,"Now it came about, as soon as the kingdom was firmly in his hand, that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father."
2 Kings,14,6,"But the sons of the slayers he did not put to death, according to what is written in the book of the Law of Moses, as the LORD commanded, saying, “The fathers shall not be put to death for the sons, nor the sons be put to death for the fathers; but each shall be put to death for his own sin.”"
2 Kings,14,7,"He killed of Edom in the Valley of Salt 10,000 and took Sela by war, and named it Joktheel to this day."
2 Kings,14,8,"Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us face each other.”"
2 Kings,14,9,"Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thorn bush which was in Lebanon sent to the cedar which was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ But there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trampled the thorn bush."
2 Kings,14,10,"You have indeed defeated Edom, and your heart has become proud. Enjoy your glory and stay at home; for why should you provoke trouble so that you, even you, would fall, and Judah with you?”"
2 Kings,14,11,"But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah."
2 Kings,14,12,"Judah was defeated by Israel, and they fled each to his tent."
2 Kings,14,13,"Then Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem and tore down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, 400 cubits."
2 Kings,14,14,"He took all the gold and silver and all the utensils which were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasuries of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria."
2 Kings,14,15,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,14,16,So Jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son became king in his place.
2 Kings,14,17,Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
2 Kings,14,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,14,19,"They conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there."
2 Kings,14,20,Then they brought him on horses and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
2 Kings,14,21,"All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah."
2 Kings,14,22,He built Elath and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his fathers.
2 Kings,14,23,"In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel became king in Samaria, and reigned forty-one years."
2 Kings,14,24,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin."
2 Kings,14,25,"He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath as far as the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD, the God of Israel, which He spoke through His servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher."
2 Kings,14,26,"For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, which was very bitter; for there was neither bond nor free, nor was there any helper for Israel."
2 Kings,14,27,"The LORD did not say that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash."
2 Kings,14,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did and his might, how he fought and how he recovered for Israel, Damascus and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,14,29,"And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel, and Zechariah his son became king in his place."

2 Kings,15,4,Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
2 Kings,15,5,"The LORD struck the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death. And he lived in a separate house, while Jotham the king’s son was over the household, judging the people of the land."
2 Kings,15,6,"Now the rest of the acts of Azariah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?"

2 Kings,15,8,"In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in Samaria for six months."
2 Kings,15,9,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin."
2 Kings,15,10,"Then Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him and struck him before the people and killed him, and reigned in his place."
2 Kings,15,11,"Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel."
2 Kings,15,12,"This is the word of the LORD which He spoke to Jehu, saying, “Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.” And so it was."
2 Kings,15,13,"Shallum son of Jabesh became king in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, and he reigned one month in Samaria."
2 Kings,15,14,"Then Menahem son of Gadi went up from Tirzah and came to Samaria, and struck Shallum son of Jabesh in Samaria, and killed him and became king in his place."

2 Kings,15,19,"Pul, king of Assyria, came against the land, and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver so that his hand might be with him to strengthen the kingdom under his rule."
2 Kings,15,20,"Then Menahem exacted the money from Israel, even from all the mighty men of wealth, from each man fifty shekels of silver to pay the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria returned and did not remain there in the land."

2 Kings,15,35,Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD.
2 Kings,15,36,"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,15,37,In those days the LORD began to send Rezin king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah against Judah.
2 Kings,15,38,"And Jotham slept with his fathers, and he was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Ahaz his son became king in his place."
2 Kings,16,1,"In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham, king of Judah, became king."
2 Kings,16,2,"Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD his God, as his father David had done."
2 Kings,16,3,"But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and even made his son pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had driven out from before the sons of Israel."
2 Kings,16,4,He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.
2 Kings,16,5,"Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to wage war; and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him."
2 Kings,16,6,"At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram, and cleared the Judeans out of Elath entirely; and the Arameans came to Elath and have lived there to this day."
2 Kings,16,7,"So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son; come up and deliver me from the hand of the king of Aram and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are rising up against me.”"
2 Kings,16,8,"Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king’s house, and sent a present to the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,16,9,"So the king of Assyria listened to him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and captured it, and carried the people of it away into exile to Kir, and put Rezin to death."
2 Kings,16,10,"Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar which was at Damascus; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the pattern of the altar and its model, according to all its workmanship."
2 Kings,16,11,"So Urijah the priest built an altar; according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, thus Urijah the priest made it, before the coming of King Ahaz from Damascus."
2 Kings,16,12,"When the king came from Damascus, the king saw the altar; then the king approached the altar and went up to it,"
2 Kings,16,13,"and burned his burnt offering and his meal offering, and poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar."
2 Kings,16,14,"The bronze altar, which was before the LORD, he brought from the front of the house, from between his altar and the house of the LORD, and he put it on the north side of his altar."
2 Kings,16,15,"Then King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, “Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening meal offering and the king’s burnt offering and his meal offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their meal offering and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice. But the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.”"
2 Kings,16,16,So Urijah the priest did according to all that King Ahaz commanded.
2 Kings,16,17,"Then King Ahaz cut off the borders of the stands, and removed the laver from them; he also took down the sea from the bronze oxen which were under it and put it on a pavement of stone."
2 Kings,16,18,"The covered way for the sabbath which they had built in the house, and the outer entry of the king, he removed from the house of the LORD because of the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,16,19,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,16,20,"So Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and his son Hezekiah reigned in his place."
2 Kings,17,1,"In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned nine years."
2 Kings,17,2,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, only not as the kings of Israel who were before him."
2 Kings,17,3,"Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him, and Hoshea became his servant and paid him tribute."
2 Kings,17,4,"But the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea, who had sent messengers to So king of Egypt and had offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year; so the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison."
2 Kings,17,5,Then the king of Assyria invaded the whole land and went up to Samaria and besieged it three years.
2 Kings,17,6,"In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and carried Israel away into exile to Assyria, and settled them in Halah and Habor, on the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes."
2 Kings,17,7,"Now this came about because the sons of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up from the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and they had feared other gods"
2 Kings,17,8,"and walked in the customs of the nations whom the LORD had driven out before the sons of Israel, and in the customs of the kings of Israel which they had introduced."
2 Kings,17,9,"The sons of Israel did things secretly which were not right against the LORD their God. Moreover, they built for themselves high places in all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city."
2 Kings,17,10,"They set for themselves sacred pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree,"
2 Kings,17,11,and there they burned incense on all the high places as the nations did which the LORD had carried away to exile before them; and they did evil things provoking the LORD.
2 Kings,17,12,"They served idols, concerning which the LORD had said to them, “You shall not do this thing.”"
2 Kings,17,13,"Yet the LORD warned Israel and Judah through all His prophets and every seer, saying, “Turn from your evil ways and keep My commandments, My statutes according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you through My servants the prophets.”"
2 Kings,17,14,"However, they did not listen, but stiffened their neck like their fathers, who did not believe in the LORD their God."
2 Kings,17,15,"They rejected His statutes and His covenant which He made with their fathers and His warnings with which He warned them. And they followed vanity and became vain, and went after the nations which surrounded them, concerning which the LORD had commanded them not to do like them."
2 Kings,17,16,"They forsook all the commandments of the LORD their God and made for themselves molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah and worshiped all the host of heaven and served Baal."
2 Kings,17,17,"Then they made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire, and practiced divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him."
2 Kings,17,18,So the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them from His sight; none was left except the tribe of Judah.
2 Kings,17,19,"Also Judah did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the customs which Israel had introduced."
2 Kings,17,20,"The LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel and afflicted them and gave them into the hand of plunderers, until He had cast them out of His sight."
2 Kings,17,21,"When He had torn Israel from the house of David, they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. Then Jeroboam drove Israel away from following the LORD and made them commit a great sin."
2 Kings,17,22,The sons of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from them
2 Kings,17,23,"until the LORD removed Israel from His sight, as He spoke through all His servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away into exile from their own land to Assyria until this day."
2 Kings,17,24,"The king of Assyria brought men from Babylon and from Cuthah and from Avva and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the sons of Israel. So they possessed Samaria and lived in its cities."
2 Kings,17,25,"At the beginning of their living there, they did not fear the LORD; therefore the LORD sent lions among them which killed some of them."
2 Kings,17,26,"So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The nations whom you have carried away into exile in the cities of Samaria do not know the custom of the god of the land; so he has sent lions among them, and behold, they kill them because they do not know the custom of the god of the land.”"
2 Kings,17,27,"Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Take there one of the priests whom you carried away into exile and let him go and live there; and let him teach them the custom of the god of the land.”"
2 Kings,17,28,"So one of the priests whom they had carried away into exile from Samaria came and lived at Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD."
2 Kings,17,29,"But every nation still made gods of its own and put them in the houses of the high places which the people of Samaria had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived."
2 Kings,17,30,"The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima,"
2 Kings,17,31,and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim.
2 Kings,17,32,"They also feared the LORD and appointed from among themselves priests of the high places, who acted for them in the houses of the high places."
2 Kings,17,33,They feared the LORD and served their own gods according to the custom of the nations from among whom they had been carried away into exile.
2 Kings,17,34,"To this day they do according to the earlier customs: they do not fear the LORD, nor do they follow their statutes or their ordinances or the law, or the commandments which the LORD commanded the sons of Jacob, whom He named Israel;"
2 Kings,17,35,"with whom the LORD made a covenant and commanded them, saying, “You shall not fear other gods, nor bow down yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them."
2 Kings,17,36,"But the LORD, who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, Him you shall fear, and to Him you shall bow yourselves down, and to Him you shall sacrifice."
2 Kings,17,37,"The statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which He wrote for you, you shall observe to do forever; and you shall not fear other gods."
2 Kings,17,38,"The covenant that I have made with you, you shall not forget, nor shall you fear other gods."
2 Kings,17,39,But the LORD your God you shall fear; and He will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.”
2 Kings,17,40,"However, they did not listen, but they did according to their earlier custom."
2 Kings,17,41,"So while these nations feared the LORD, they also served their idols; their children likewise and their grandchildren, as their fathers did, so they do to this day."
2 Kings,18,1,"Now it came about in the third year of Hoshea, the son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah became king."
2 Kings,18,2,"He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah."
2 Kings,18,3,"He did right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father David had done."
2 Kings,18,4,"He removed the high places and broke down the sacred pillars and cut down the Asherah. He also broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the sons of Israel burned incense to it; and it was called Nehushtan."
2 Kings,18,5,"He trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel; so that after him there was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among those who were before him."
2 Kings,18,6,"For he clung to the LORD; he did not depart from following Him, but kept His commandments, which the LORD had commanded Moses."
2 Kings,18,7,And the LORD was with him; wherever he went he prospered. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.
2 Kings,18,8,"He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city."
2 Kings,18,9,"Now in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it."
2 Kings,18,10,"At the end of three years they captured it; in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was captured."
2 Kings,18,11,"Then the king of Assyria carried Israel away into exile to Assyria, and put them in Halah and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,"
2 Kings,18,12,"because they did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed His covenant, even all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded; they would neither listen nor do it."
2 Kings,18,13,"Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and seized them."
2 Kings,18,14,"Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, “I have done wrong. Withdraw from me; whatever you impose on me I will bear.” So the king of Assyria required of Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold."
2 Kings,18,15,"Hezekiah gave him all the silver which was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasuries of the king’s house."
2 Kings,18,16,"At that time Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the doorposts which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,18,17,"Then the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a large army to Jerusalem. So they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they went up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway of the fuller’s field."
2 Kings,18,18,"When they called to the king, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came out to them."
2 Kings,18,19,"Then Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, “What is this confidence that you have?"
2 Kings,18,20,"You say (but they are only empty words), ‘I have counsel and strength for the war.’ Now on whom do you rely, that you have rebelled against me?"
2 Kings,18,21,"Now behold, you rely on the staff of this crushed reed, even on Egypt; on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him."
2 Kings,18,22,"But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the LORD our God,’ is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem’?"
2 Kings,18,23,"Now therefore, come, make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them."
2 Kings,18,24,"How then can you repulse one official of the least of my master’s servants, and rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?"
2 Kings,18,25,"Have I now come up without the LORD’S approval against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, ‘Go up against this land and destroy it.’”’”"
2 Kings,18,26,"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, “Speak now to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak with us in Judean in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”"
2 Kings,18,27,"But Rabshakeh said to them, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, doomed to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?”"
2 Kings,18,28,"Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in Judean, saying, “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,18,29,"Thus says the king, ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you from my hand;"
2 Kings,18,30,"nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, “The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”"
2 Kings,18,31,"Do not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria, “Make your peace with me and come out to me, and eat each of his vine and each of his fig tree and drink each of the waters of his own cistern,"
2 Kings,18,32,"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey, that you may live and not die.” But do not listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you, saying, “The LORD will deliver us.”"
2 Kings,18,33,Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
2 Kings,18,34,"Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?"
2 Kings,18,35,"Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their land from my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?’”"
2 Kings,18,36,"But the people were silent and answered him not a word, for the king’s commandment was, “Do not answer him.”"
2 Kings,18,37,"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of Rabshakeh."
2 Kings,19,1,"And when King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth and entered the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,19,2,"Then he sent Eliakim who was over the household with Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz."
2 Kings,19,3,"They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a day of distress, rebuke, and rejection; for children have come to birth and there is no strength to deliver."
2 Kings,19,4,"Perhaps the LORD your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore, offer a prayer for the remnant that is left.’”"
2 Kings,19,5,So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
2 Kings,19,6,"Isaiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to your master, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me."
2 Kings,19,7,"Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.”’”"
2 Kings,19,8,"Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish."
2 Kings,19,9,"When he heard them say concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, “Behold, he has come out to fight against you,” he sent messengers again to Hezekiah saying,"
2 Kings,19,10,"“Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you saying, “Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”"
2 Kings,19,11,"Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them completely. So will you be spared?"
2 Kings,19,12,"Did the gods of those nations which my fathers destroyed deliver them, even Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?"
2 Kings,19,13,"Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Hena and Ivvah?’”"
2 Kings,19,14,"Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went up to the house of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD."
2 Kings,19,15,"Hezekiah prayed before the LORD and said, “O LORD, the God of Israel, who are enthroned above the cherubim, You are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth."
2 Kings,19,16,"Incline Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see; and listen to the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to reproach the living God."
2 Kings,19,17,"Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have devastated the nations and their lands"
2 Kings,19,18,"and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. So they have destroyed them."
2 Kings,19,19,"Now, O LORD our God, I pray, deliver us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, O LORD, are God.”"
2 Kings,19,20,"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard you.’"
2 Kings,19,21,"This is the word that the LORD has spoken against him: ‘She has despised you and mocked you, The virgin daughter of Zion; She has shaken her head behind you, The daughter of Jerusalem!"
2 Kings,19,22,"‘Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised your voice, And haughtily lifted up your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!"
2 Kings,19,23,"‘Through your messengers you have reproached the Lord, And you have said, “With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains, To the remotest parts of Lebanon; And I cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypresses. And I entered its farthest lodging place, its thickest forest."
2 Kings,19,24,"“I dug wells and drank foreign waters, And with the sole of my feet I dried up All the rivers of Egypt.”"
2 Kings,19,25,"‘Have you not heard? Long ago I did it; From ancient times I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, That you should turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps."
2 Kings,19,26,"‘Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength, They were dismayed and put to shame; They were as the vegetation of the field and as the green herb, As grass on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up."
2 Kings,19,27,"‘But I know your sitting down, And your going out and your coming in, And your raging against Me."
2 Kings,19,28,"‘Because of your raging against Me, And because your arrogance has come up to My ears, Therefore I will put My hook in your nose, And My bridle in your lips, And I will turn you back by the way which you came."
2 Kings,19,29,"‘Then this shall be the sign for you: you will eat this year what grows of itself, in the second year what springs from the same, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit."
2 Kings,19,30,The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
2 Kings,19,31,"For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and out of Mount Zion survivors. The zeal of the LORD will perform this."
2 Kings,19,32,"‘Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, “He will not come to this city or shoot an arrow there; and he will not come before it with a shield or throw up a siege ramp against it."
2 Kings,19,33,"By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he shall not come to this city,”’ declares the LORD."
2 Kings,19,34,‘For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.’”
2 Kings,19,35,"Then it happened that night that the angel of the LORD went out and struck 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men rose early in the morning, behold, all of them were dead."
2 Kings,19,36,"So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home, and lived at Nineveh."
2 Kings,19,37,"It came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place."
2 Kings,20,1,"In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.’”"
2 Kings,20,2,"Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, saying,"
2 Kings,20,3,"“Remember now, O LORD, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart and have done what is good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly."
2 Kings,20,4,"Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of the LORD came to him, saying,"
2 Kings,20,5,"“Return and say to Hezekiah the leader of My people, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of your father David, “I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,20,6,"I will add fifteen years to your life, and I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.”’”"
2 Kings,20,7,"Then Isaiah said, “Take a cake of figs.” And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered."
2 Kings,20,8,"Now Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What will be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of the LORD the third day?”"
2 Kings,20,9,"Isaiah said, “This shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that He has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps or go back ten steps?”"
2 Kings,20,10,"So Hezekiah answered, “It is easy for the shadow to decline ten steps; no, but let the shadow turn backward ten steps.”"
2 Kings,20,11,"Isaiah the prophet cried to the LORD, and He brought the shadow on the stairway back ten steps by which it had gone down on the stairway of Ahaz."
2 Kings,20,12,"At that time Berodach-baladan a son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick."
2 Kings,20,13,"Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all his treasure house, the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and the house of his armor and all that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them."
2 Kings,20,14,"Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where have they come to you?” And Hezekiah said, “They have come from a far country, from Babylon.”"
2 Kings,20,15,"He said, “What have they seen in your house?” So Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasuries that I have not shown them.”"
2 Kings,20,16,"Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD."
2 Kings,20,17,"‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and all that your fathers have laid up in store to this day will be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left,’ says the LORD."
2 Kings,20,18,"‘Some of your sons who shall issue from you, whom you will beget, will be taken away; and they will become officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”"
2 Kings,20,19,"Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the LORD which you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “Is it not so, if there will be peace and truth in my days?”"
2 Kings,20,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and all his might, and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,20,21,"So Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh his son became king in his place."
2 Kings,21,1,"Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hephzibah."
2 Kings,21,2,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD dispossessed before the sons of Israel."
2 Kings,21,3,"For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel had done, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them."
2 Kings,21,4,"He built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, “In Jerusalem I will put My name.”"
2 Kings,21,5,For he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
2 Kings,21,6,"He made his son pass through the fire, practiced witchcraft and used divination, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD provoking Him to anger."
2 Kings,21,7,"Then he set the carved image of Asherah that he had made, in the house of which the LORD said to David and to his son Solomon, “In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever."
2 Kings,21,8,"And I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them.”"
2 Kings,21,9,"But they did not listen, and Manasseh seduced them to do evil more than the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the sons of Israel."
2 Kings,21,10,"Now the LORD spoke through His servants the prophets, saying,"
2 Kings,21,11,"“Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, having done wickedly more than all the Amorites did who were before him, and has also made Judah sin with his idols;"
2 Kings,21,12,"therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, I am bringing such calamity on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears will tingle."
2 Kings,21,13,"I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down."
2 Kings,21,14,"I will abandon the remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies, and they will become as plunder and spoil to all their enemies;"
2 Kings,21,15,"because they have done evil in My sight, and have been provoking Me to anger since the day their fathers came from Egypt, even to this day.’”"
2 Kings,21,16,"Moreover, Manasseh shed very much innocent blood until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah sin, in doing evil in the sight of the LORD."
2 Kings,21,17,"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did and his sin which he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,21,18,"And Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza, and Amon his son became king in his place."
2 Kings,21,19,"Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah."
2 Kings,21,20,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, as Manasseh his father had done."
2 Kings,21,21,"For he walked in all the way that his father had walked, and served the idols that his father had served and worshiped them."
2 Kings,21,22,"So he forsook the LORD, the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the LORD."
2 Kings,21,23,The servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his own house.
2 Kings,21,24,"Then the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place."
2 Kings,21,25,"Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,21,26,"He was buried in his grave in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah his son became king in his place."
2 Kings,22,1,"Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath."
2 Kings,22,2,"He did right in the sight of the LORD and walked in all the way of his father David, nor did he turn aside to the right or to the left."
2 Kings,22,3,"Now in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam the scribe, to the house of the LORD saying,"
2 Kings,22,4,“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest that he may count the money brought in to the house of the LORD which the doorkeepers have gathered from the people.
2 Kings,22,5,"Let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD, and let them give it to the workmen who are in the house of the LORD to repair the damages of the house,"
2 Kings,22,6,to the carpenters and the builders and the masons and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
2 Kings,22,7,"Only no accounting shall be made with them for the money delivered into their hands, for they deal faithfully.”"
2 Kings,22,8,"Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan who read it."
2 Kings,22,9,"Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought back word to the king and said, “Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD.”"
2 Kings,22,10,"Moreover, Shaphan the scribe told the king saying, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it in the presence of the king."
2 Kings,22,11,"When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes."
2 Kings,22,12,"Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant saying,"
2 Kings,22,13,"“Go, inquire of the LORD for me and the people and all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD that burns against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.”"
2 Kings,22,14,"So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter); and they spoke to her."
2 Kings,22,15,"She said to them, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘Tell the man who sent you to me,"
2 Kings,22,16,"thus says the LORD, “Behold, I bring evil on this place and on its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read."
2 Kings,22,17,"Because they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods that they might provoke Me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore My wrath burns against this place, and it shall not be quenched.”’"
2 Kings,22,18,"But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD thus shall you say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD God of Israel, “Regarding the words which you have heard,"
2 Kings,22,19,"because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants that they should become a desolation and a curse, and you have torn your clothes and wept before Me, I truly have heard you,” declares the LORD."
2 Kings,22,20,"“Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes will not see all the evil which I will bring on this place.”’” So they brought back word to the king."
2 Kings,23,1,"Then the king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem."
2 Kings,23,2,"The king went up to the house of the LORD and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests and the prophets and all the people, both small and great; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,23,3,"The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to carry out the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people entered into the covenant."
2 Kings,23,4,"Then the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the doorkeepers, to bring out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven; and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel."
2 Kings,23,5,"He did away with the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah and in the surrounding area of Jerusalem, also those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and to the moon and to the constellations and to all the host of heaven."
2 Kings,23,6,"He brought out the Asherah from the house of the LORD outside Jerusalem to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and ground it to dust, and threw its dust on the graves of the common people."
2 Kings,23,7,"He also broke down the houses of the male cult prostitutes which were in the house of the LORD, where the women were weaving hangings for the Asherah."
2 Kings,23,8,"Then he brought all the priests from the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates which were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on one’s left at the city gate."
2 Kings,23,9,"Nevertheless the priests of the high places did not go up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers."
2 Kings,23,10,"He also defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter pass through the fire for Molech."
2 Kings,23,11,"He did away with the horses which the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the official, which was in the precincts; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire."
2 Kings,23,12,"The altars which were on the roof, the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, the king broke down; and he smashed them there and threw their dust into the brook Kidron."
2 Kings,23,13,"The high places which were before Jerusalem, which were on the right of the mount of destruction which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the sons of Ammon, the king defiled."
2 Kings,23,14,He broke in pieces the sacred pillars and cut down the Asherim and filled their places with human bones.
2 Kings,23,15,"Furthermore, the altar that was at Bethel and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down. Then he demolished its stones, ground them to dust, and burned the Asherah."
2 Kings,23,16,"Now when Josiah turned, he saw the graves that were there on the mountain, and he sent and took the bones from the graves and burned them on the altar and defiled it according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things."
2 Kings,23,17,"Then he said, “What is this monument that I see?” And the men of the city told him, “It is the grave of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which you have done against the altar of Bethel.”"
2 Kings,23,18,"He said, “Let him alone; let no one disturb his bones.” So they left his bones undisturbed with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria."
2 Kings,23,19,"Josiah also removed all the houses of the high places which were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made provoking the LORD; and he did to them just as he had done in Bethel."
2 Kings,23,20,All the priests of the high places who were there he slaughtered on the altars and burned human bones on them; then he returned to Jerusalem.
2 Kings,23,21,"Then the king commanded all the people saying, “Celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God as it is written in this book of the covenant.”"
2 Kings,23,22,"Surely such a Passover had not been celebrated from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and of the kings of Judah."
2 Kings,23,23,"But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was observed to the LORD in Jerusalem."
2 Kings,23,24,"Moreover, Josiah removed the mediums and the spiritists and the teraphim and the idols and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,23,25,"Before him there was no king like him who turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; nor did any like him arise after him."
2 Kings,23,26,"However, the LORD did not turn from the fierceness of His great wrath with which His anger burned against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked Him."
2 Kings,23,27,"The LORD said, “I will remove Judah also from My sight, as I have removed Israel. And I will cast off Jerusalem, this city which I have chosen, and the temple of which I said, ‘My name shall be there.’”"
2 Kings,23,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,23,29,"In his days Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up to the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates. And King Josiah went to meet him, and when Pharaoh Neco saw him he killed him at Megiddo."
2 Kings,23,30,"His servants drove his body in a chariot from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king in place of his father."
2 Kings,23,31,"Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah."
2 Kings,23,32,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done."
2 Kings,23,33,"Pharaoh Neco imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and he imposed on the land a fine of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold."
2 Kings,23,34,"Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz away and brought him to Egypt, and he died there."
2 Kings,23,35,"So Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh, but he taxed the land in order to give the money at the command of Pharaoh. He exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land, each according to his valuation, to give it to Pharaoh Neco."
2 Kings,23,36,"Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah."
2 Kings,23,37,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done."
2 Kings,24,1,"In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him."
2 Kings,24,2,"The LORD sent against him bands of Chaldeans, bands of Arameans, bands of Moabites, and bands of Ammonites. So He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD which He had spoken through His servants the prophets."
2 Kings,24,3,"Surely at the command of the LORD it came upon Judah, to remove them from His sight because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done,"
2 Kings,24,4,"and also for the innocent blood which he shed, for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; and the LORD would not forgive."
2 Kings,24,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,24,6,"So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son became king in his place."
2 Kings,24,7,"The king of Egypt did not come out of his land again, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates."
2 Kings,24,8,"Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem."
2 Kings,24,9,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done."
2 Kings,24,10,"At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon went up to Jerusalem, and the city came under siege."
2 Kings,24,11,"And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to the city, while his servants were besieging it."
2 Kings,24,12,"Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he and his mother and his servants and his captains and his officials. So the king of Babylon took him captive in the eighth year of his reign."
2 Kings,24,13,"He carried out from there all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, just as the LORD had said."
2 Kings,24,14,"Then he led away into exile all Jerusalem and all the captains and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths. None remained except the poorest people of the land."
2 Kings,24,15,"So he led Jehoiachin away into exile to Babylon; also the king’s mother and the king’s wives and his officials and the leading men of the land, he led away into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon."
2 Kings,24,16,"All the men of valor, seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths, one thousand, all strong and fit for war, and these the king of Babylon brought into exile to Babylon."
2 Kings,24,17,"Then the king of Babylon made his uncle Mattaniah king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah."
2 Kings,24,18,"Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah."
2 Kings,24,19,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done."
2 Kings,24,20,For through the anger of the LORD this came about in Jerusalem and Judah until He cast them out from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
2 Kings,25,1,"Now in the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, camped against it and built a siege wall all around it."
2 Kings,25,2,So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
2 Kings,25,3,On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
2 Kings,25,4,"Then the city was broken into, and all the men of war fled by night by way of the gate between the two walls beside the king’s garden, though the Chaldeans were all around the city. And they went by way of the Arabah."
2 Kings,25,5,But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho and all his army was scattered from him.
2 Kings,25,6,"Then they captured the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and he passed sentence on him."
2 Kings,25,7,"They slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, then put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him with bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon."
2 Kings,25,8,"Now on the seventh day of the fifth month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem."
2 Kings,25,9,"He burned the house of the LORD, the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; even every great house he burned with fire."
2 Kings,25,10,So all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls around Jerusalem.
2 Kings,25,11,"Then the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon and the rest of the people, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away into exile."
2 Kings,25,12,But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
2 Kings,25,13,"Now the bronze pillars which were in the house of the LORD, and the stands and the bronze sea which were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried the bronze to Babylon."
2 Kings,25,14,"They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the spoons, and all the bronze vessels which were used in temple service."
2 Kings,25,15,"The captain of the guard also took away the firepans and the basins, what was fine gold and what was fine silver."
2 Kings,25,16,"The two pillars, the one sea, and the stands which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD—the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight."
2 Kings,25,17,"The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a bronze capital was on it; the height of the capital was three cubits, with a network and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of bronze. And the second pillar was like these with network."
2 Kings,25,18,"Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest, with the three officers of the temple."
2 Kings,25,19,"From the city he took one official who was overseer of the men of war, and five of the king’s advisers who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city."
2 Kings,25,20,Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
2 Kings,25,21,Then the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was led away into exile from its land.
2 Kings,25,22,"Now as for the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, he appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan over them."
2 Kings,25,23,"When all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, namely, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men."
2 Kings,25,24,"Gedaliah swore to them and their men and said to them, “Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans; live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.”"
2 Kings,25,25,"But it came about in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with ten men and struck Gedaliah down so that he died along with the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah."
2 Kings,25,26,"Then all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces arose and went to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans."
2 Kings,25,27,"Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he became king, released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison;"
2 Kings,25,28,and he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
2 Kings,25,29,Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes and had his meals in the king’s presence regularly all the days of his life;
2 Kings,25,30,"and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king, a portion for each day, all the days of his life."

1 Chronicles,14,8,"When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up in search of David; and David heard of it and went out against them."
1 Chronicles,14,9,Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.
1 Chronicles,14,10,"David inquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? And will You give them into my hand?” Then the LORD said to him, “Go up, for I will give them into your hand.”"
1 Chronicles,14,11,"So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there; and David said, “God has broken through my enemies by my hand, like the breakthrough of waters.” Therefore they named that place Baal-perazim."
1 Chronicles,14,12,They abandoned their gods there; so David gave the order and they were burned with fire.
1 Chronicles,14,13,The Philistines made yet another raid in the valley.
1 Chronicles,14,14,"David inquired again of God, and God said to him, “You shall not go up after them; circle around behind them and come at them in front of the balsam trees."
1 Chronicles,14,15,"It shall be when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall go out to battle, for God will have gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.”"
1 Chronicles,14,16,"David did just as God had commanded him, and they struck down the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even as far as Gezer."
1 Chronicles,14,17,Then the fame of David went out into all the lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him on all the nations.
1 Chronicles,15,1,Now David built houses for himself in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
1 Chronicles,15,2,"Then David said, “No one is to carry the ark of God but the Levites; for the LORD chose them to carry the ark of God and to minister to Him forever.”"
1 Chronicles,15,3,And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place which he had prepared for it.
1 Chronicles,15,4,David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites:
1 Chronicles,15,5,"of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and 120 of his relatives;"
1 Chronicles,15,6,"of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and 220 of his relatives;"
1 Chronicles,15,7,"of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and 130 of his relatives;"
1 Chronicles,15,8,"of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and 200 of his relatives;"
1 Chronicles,15,9,"of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and 80 of his relatives;"
1 Chronicles,15,10,"of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and 112 of his relatives."
1 Chronicles,15,11,"Then David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel and Amminadab,"
1 Chronicles,15,12,"and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites; consecrate yourselves both you and your relatives, that you may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the place that I have prepared for it."
1 Chronicles,15,13,"Because you did not carry it at the first, the LORD our God made an outburst on us, for we did not seek Him according to the ordinance.”"
1 Chronicles,15,14,So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.
1 Chronicles,15,15,"The sons of the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD."
1 Chronicles,15,16,"Then David spoke to the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their relatives the singers, with instruments of music, harps, lyres, loud-sounding cymbals, to raise sounds of joy."
1 Chronicles,15,17,"So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel, and from his relatives, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and from the sons of Merari their relatives, Ethan the son of Kushaiah,"
1 Chronicles,15,18,"and with them their relatives of the second rank, Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom and Jeiel, the gatekeepers."
1 Chronicles,15,19,"So the singers, Heman, Asaph and Ethan were appointed to sound aloud cymbals of bronze;"
1 Chronicles,15,20,"and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah and Benaiah, with harps tuned to alamoth;"
1 Chronicles,15,21,"and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel and Azaziah, to lead with lyres tuned to the sheminith."
1 Chronicles,15,22,"Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was in charge of the singing; he gave instruction in singing because he was skillful."
1 Chronicles,15,23,Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark.
1 Chronicles,15,24,"Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah also were gatekeepers for the ark."
1 Chronicles,15,25,"So it was David, with the elders of Israel and the captains over thousands, who went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom with joy."
1 Chronicles,15,26,"Because God was helping the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams."
1 Chronicles,15,27,"Now David was clothed with a robe of fine linen with all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers and Chenaniah the leader of the singing with the singers. David also wore an ephod of linen."
1 Chronicles,15,28,"Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the horn, with trumpets, with loud-sounding cymbals, with harps and lyres."
1 Chronicles,15,29,"It happened when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David leaping and celebrating; and she despised him in her heart."
1 Chronicles,16,1,"And they brought in the ark of God and placed it inside the tent which David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God."
1 Chronicles,16,2,"When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD."
1 Chronicles,16,3,"He distributed to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread and a portion of meat and a raisin cake."
1 Chronicles,16,4,"He appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the ark of the LORD, even to celebrate and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:"
1 Chronicles,16,5,"Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom and Jeiel, with musical instruments, harps, lyres; also Asaph played loud-sounding cymbals,"
1 Chronicles,16,6,and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests blew trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
1 Chronicles,16,7,Then on that day David first assigned Asaph and his relatives to give thanks to the LORD.
1 Chronicles,16,8,"Oh give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; Make known His deeds among the peoples."
1 Chronicles,16,9,"Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; Speak of all His wonders."
1 Chronicles,16,10,Glory in His holy name; Let the heart of those who seek the LORD be glad.
1 Chronicles,16,11,Seek the LORD and His strength; Seek His face continually.
1 Chronicles,16,12,"Remember His wonderful deeds which He has done, His marvels and the judgments from His mouth,"
1 Chronicles,16,13,"O seed of Israel His servant, Sons of Jacob, His chosen ones!"
1 Chronicles,16,14,He is the LORD our God; His judgments are in all the earth.
1 Chronicles,16,15,"Remember His covenant forever, The word which He commanded to a thousand generations,"
1 Chronicles,16,16,"The covenant which He made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac."
1 Chronicles,16,17,"He also confirmed it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel as an everlasting covenant,"
1 Chronicles,16,18,"Saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan, As the portion of your inheritance.”"
1 Chronicles,16,19,"When they were only a few in number, Very few, and strangers in it,"
1 Chronicles,16,20,"And they wandered about from nation to nation, And from one kingdom to another people,"
1 Chronicles,16,21,"He permitted no man to oppress them, And He reproved kings for their sakes, saying,"
1 Chronicles,16,22,"“Do not touch My anointed ones, And do My prophets no harm.”"
1 Chronicles,16,23,"Sing to the LORD, all the earth; Proclaim good tidings of His salvation from day to day."
1 Chronicles,16,24,"Tell of His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all the peoples."
1 Chronicles,16,25,"For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; He also is to be feared above all gods."
1 Chronicles,16,26,"For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But the LORD made the heavens."
1 Chronicles,16,27,"Splendor and majesty are before Him, Strength and joy are in His place."
1 Chronicles,16,28,"Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, Ascribe to the LORD glory and strength."
1 Chronicles,16,29,"Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; Bring an offering, and come before Him; Worship the LORD in holy array."
1 Chronicles,16,30,"Tremble before Him, all the earth; Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved."
1 Chronicles,16,31,"Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; And let them say among the nations, “The LORD reigns.”"
1 Chronicles,16,32,"Let the sea roar, and all it contains; Let the field exult, and all that is in it."
1 Chronicles,16,33,Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before the LORD; For He is coming to judge the earth.
1 Chronicles,16,34,"O give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; For His lovingkindness is everlasting."
1 Chronicles,16,35,"Then say, “Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks to Your holy name, And glory in Your praise.”"
1 Chronicles,16,36,"Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. Then all the people said, “Amen,” and praised the LORD."
1 Chronicles,16,37,"So he left Asaph and his relatives there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required;"
1 Chronicles,16,38,"and Obed-edom with his 68 relatives; Obed-edom, also the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah as gatekeepers."
1 Chronicles,16,39,"He left Zadok the priest and his relatives the priests before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place which was at Gibeon,"
1 Chronicles,16,40,"to offer burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which He commanded Israel."
1 Chronicles,16,41,"With them were Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were designated by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because His lovingkindness is everlasting."
1 Chronicles,16,42,"And with them were Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those who should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of God, and the sons of Jeduthun for the gate."
1 Chronicles,16,43,"Then all the people departed each to his house, and David returned to bless his household."
1 Chronicles,17,1,"And it came about, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I am dwelling in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under curtains.”"
1 Chronicles,17,2,"Then Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.”"
1 Chronicles,17,3,"It came about the same night that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,"
1 Chronicles,17,4,"“Go and tell David My servant, ‘Thus says the LORD, “You shall not build a house for Me to dwell in;"
1 Chronicles,17,5,"for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day, but I have gone from tent to tent and from one dwelling place to another."
1 Chronicles,17,6,"In all places where I have walked with all Israel, have I spoken a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, ‘Why have you not built for Me a house of cedar?’”’"
1 Chronicles,17,7,"Now, therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, “I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be leader over My people Israel."
1 Chronicles,17,8,"I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth."
1 Chronicles,17,9,"I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place and not be moved again; and the wicked will not waste them anymore as formerly,"
1 Chronicles,17,10,"even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I tell you that the LORD will build a house for you."
1 Chronicles,17,11,"When your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up one of your descendants after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom."
1 Chronicles,17,12,"He shall build for Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever."
1 Chronicles,17,13,"I will be his father and he shall be My son; and I will not take My lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him who was before you."
1 Chronicles,17,14,"But I will settle him in My house and in My kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever.”’”"
1 Chronicles,17,15,"According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David."
1 Chronicles,17,16,"Then David the king went in and sat before the LORD and said, “Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house that You have brought me this far?"
1 Chronicles,17,17,"This was a small thing in Your eyes, O God; but You have spoken of Your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the standard of a man of high degree, O LORD God."
1 Chronicles,17,18,What more can David still say to You concerning the honor bestowed on Your servant? For You know Your servant.
1 Chronicles,17,19,"O LORD, for Your servant’s sake, and according to Your own heart, You have wrought all this greatness, to make known all these great things."
1 Chronicles,17,20,"O LORD, there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears."
1 Chronicles,17,21,"And what one nation in the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people, to make You a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before Your people, whom You redeemed out of Egypt?"
1 Chronicles,17,22,"For Your people Israel You made Your own people forever, and You, O LORD, became their God."
1 Chronicles,17,23,"“Now, O LORD, let the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as You have spoken."
1 Chronicles,17,24,"Let Your name be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel; and the house of David Your servant is established before You.’"
1 Chronicles,17,25,"For You, O my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build for him a house; therefore Your servant has found courage to pray before You."
1 Chronicles,17,26,"Now, O LORD, You are God, and have promised this good thing to Your servant."
1 Chronicles,17,27,"And now it has pleased You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You; for You, O LORD, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.”"
1 Chronicles,18,1,Now after this it came about that David defeated the Philistines and subdued them and took Gath and its towns from the hand of the Philistines.
1 Chronicles,18,2,"He defeated Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David, bringing tribute."
1 Chronicles,18,3,"David also defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah as far as Hamath, as he went to establish his rule to the Euphrates River."
1 Chronicles,18,4,"David took from him 1,000 chariots and 7,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers, and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved enough of them for 100 chariots."
1 Chronicles,18,5,"When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David killed 22,000 men of the Arameans."
1 Chronicles,18,6,"Then David put garrisons among the Arameans of Damascus; and the Arameans became servants to David, bringing tribute. And the LORD helped David wherever he went."
1 Chronicles,18,7,David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles,18,8,"Also from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a very large amount of bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the bronze utensils."
1 Chronicles,18,9,"Now when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,"
1 Chronicles,18,10,"he sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet him and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and had defeated him; for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou. And Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold and silver and bronze."
1 Chronicles,18,11,"King David also dedicated these to the LORD with the silver and the gold which he had carried away from all the nations: from Edom, Moab, the sons of Ammon, the Philistines, and from Amalek."
1 Chronicles,18,12,"Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah defeated 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt."
1 Chronicles,18,13,"Then he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the LORD helped David wherever he went."
1 Chronicles,18,14,So David reigned over all Israel; and he administered justice and righteousness for all his people.
1 Chronicles,18,15,"Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;"
1 Chronicles,18,16,"and Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were priests, and Shavsha was secretary;"
1 Chronicles,18,17,"and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and the sons of David were chiefs at the king’s side."
1 Chronicles,19,1,"Now it came about after this, that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon died, and his son became king in his place."
1 Chronicles,19,2,"Then David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the sons of Ammon to Hanun to console him."
1 Chronicles,19,3,"But the princes of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David is honoring your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?”"
1 Chronicles,19,4,"So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle as far as their hips, and sent them away."
1 Chronicles,19,5,"Then certain persons went and told David about the men. And he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly humiliated. And the king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards grow, and then return.”"
1 Chronicles,19,6,"When the sons of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the sons of Ammon sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah and from Zobah."
1 Chronicles,19,7,"So they hired for themselves 32,000 chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and camped before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon gathered together from their cities and came to battle."
1 Chronicles,19,8,"When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army, the mighty men."
1 Chronicles,19,9,"The sons of Ammon came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field."
1 Chronicles,19,10,"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and in the rear, he selected from all the choice men of Israel and they arrayed themselves against the Arameans."
1 Chronicles,19,11,But the remainder of the people he placed in the hand of Abshai his brother; and they arrayed themselves against the sons of Ammon.
1 Chronicles,19,12,"He said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you."
1 Chronicles,19,13,"Be strong, and let us show ourselves courageous for the sake of our people and for the cities of our God; and may the LORD do what is good in His sight.”"
1 Chronicles,19,14,"So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Arameans, and they fled before him."
1 Chronicles,19,15,"When the sons of Ammon saw that the Arameans fled, they also fled before Abshai his brother and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,19,16,"When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the River, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer leading them."
1 Chronicles,19,17,"When it was told David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan, and came upon them and drew up in formation against them. And when David drew up in battle array against the Arameans, they fought against him."
1 Chronicles,19,18,"The Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed of the Arameans 7,000 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers, and put to death Shophach the commander of the army."
1 Chronicles,19,19,"So when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and served him. Thus the Arameans were not willing to help the sons of Ammon anymore."
1 Chronicles,20,1,"Then it happened in the spring, at the time when kings go out to battle, that Joab led out the army and ravaged the land of the sons of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah and overthrew it."
1 Chronicles,20,2,"David took the crown of their king from his head, and he found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there was a precious stone in it; and it was placed on David’s head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount."
1 Chronicles,20,3,"He brought out the people who were in it, and cut them with saws and with sharp instruments and with axes. And thus David did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,20,4,"Now it came about after this, that war broke out at Gezer with the Philistines; then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the giants, and they were subdued."
1 Chronicles,20,5,"And there was war with the Philistines again, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam."
1 Chronicles,20,6,"Again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot; and he also was descended from the giants."
1 Chronicles,20,7,"When he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him."
1 Chronicles,20,8,"These were descended from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants."
1 Chronicles,21,1,Then Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number Israel.
1 Chronicles,21,2,"So David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, “Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan, and bring me word that I may know their number.”"
1 Chronicles,21,3,"Joab said, “May the LORD add to His people a hundred times as many as they are! But, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord seek this thing? Why should he be a cause of guilt to Israel?”"
1 Chronicles,21,4,"Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore, Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,21,5,"Joab gave the number of the census of all the people to David. And all Israel were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword; and Judah was 470,000 men who drew the sword."
1 Chronicles,21,6,"But he did not number Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s command was abhorrent to Joab."
1 Chronicles,21,7,"God was displeased with this thing, so He struck Israel."
1 Chronicles,21,8,"David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now, please take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.”"
1 Chronicles,21,9,"The LORD spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying,"
1 Chronicles,21,10,"“Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD, “I offer you three things; choose for yourself one of them, which I will do to you.”’”"
1 Chronicles,21,11,"So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Take for yourself"
1 Chronicles,21,12,"either three years of famine, or three months to be swept away before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or else three days of the sword of the LORD, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.’ Now, therefore, consider what answer I shall return to Him who sent me.”"
1 Chronicles,21,13,"David said to Gad, “I am in great distress; please let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are very great. But do not let me fall into the hand of man.”"
1 Chronicles,21,14,"So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel; 70,000 men of Israel fell."
1 Chronicles,21,15,"And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but as he was about to destroy it, the LORD saw and was sorry over the calamity, and said to the destroying angel, “It is enough; now relax your hand.” And the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,16,"Then David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, with his drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, covered with sackcloth, fell on their faces."
1 Chronicles,21,17,"David said to God, “Is it not I who commanded to count the people? Indeed, I am the one who has sinned and done very wickedly, but these sheep, what have they done? O LORD my God, please let Your hand be against me and my father’s household, but not against Your people that they should be plagued.”"
1 Chronicles,21,18,"Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,19,"So David went up at the word of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the LORD."
1 Chronicles,21,20,"Now Ornan turned back and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. And Ornan was threshing wheat."
1 Chronicles,21,21,"As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out from the threshing floor and prostrated himself before David with his face to the ground."
1 Chronicles,21,22,"Then David said to Ornan, “Give me the site of this threshing floor, that I may build on it an altar to the LORD; for the full price you shall give it to me, that the plague may be restrained from the people.”"
1 Chronicles,21,23,"Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself; and let my lord the king do what is good in his sight. See, I will give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for wood and the wheat for the grain offering; I will give it all.”"
1 Chronicles,21,24,"But King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will surely buy it for the full price; for I will not take what is yours for the LORD, or offer a burnt offering which costs me nothing.”"
1 Chronicles,21,25,So David gave Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the site.
1 Chronicles,21,26,Then David built an altar to the LORD there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And he called to the LORD and He answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
1 Chronicles,21,27,"The LORD commanded the angel, and he put his sword back in its sheath."
1 Chronicles,21,28,"At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he offered sacrifice there."
1 Chronicles,21,29,"For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were in the high place at Gibeon at that time."
1 Chronicles,21,30,"But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was terrified by the sword of the angel of the LORD."
