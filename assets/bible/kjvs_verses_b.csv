Joshua,1,11,"Pass{H5674}{(H8798)} through{H7130} the host{H4264}, and command{H6680}{(H8761)} the people{H5971}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Prepare{H3559}{(H8685)} you victuals{H6720}; for within three{H7969} days{H3117} ye shall pass over{H5674}{(H8802)} this Jordan{H3383}, to go in{H935}{(H8800)} to possess{H3423}{(H8800)} the land{H776}, which the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} giveth{H5414}{(H8802)} you to possess{H3423}{(H8800)} it."
Joshua,1,12,"And to the Reubenites{H7206}, and to the Gadites{H1425}, and to half{H2677} the tribe{H7626} of Manasseh{H4519}, spake{H559}{(H8804)} Joshua{H3091}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Joshua,1,13,"Remember{H2142}{(H8800)} the word{H1697} which Moses{H4872} the servant{H5650} of the LORD{H3068} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} you, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The LORD{H3068} your God{H430} hath given you rest{H5117}{(H8688)}, and hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} you this land{H776}."
Joshua,1,14,"Your wives{H802}, your little ones{H2945}, and your cattle{H4735}, shall remain{H3427}{(H8799)} in the land{H776} which Moses{H4872} gave{H5414}{(H8804)} you on this side{H5676} Jordan{H3383}; but ye shall pass{H5674}{(H8799)} before{H6440} your brethren{H251} armed{H2571}, all the mighty{H1368} men of valour{H2428}, and help{H5826}{(H8804)} them;"
Joshua,1,15,"Until the LORD{H3068} have given{H5117} your brethren{H251} rest{H5117}{(H8686)}, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed{H3423}{(H8804)} the land{H776} which the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} giveth{H5414}{(H8802)} them: then ye shall return{H7725}{(H8804)} unto the land{H776} of your possession{H3425}, and enjoy{H3423}{(H8804)} it, which Moses{H4872} the LORD'S{H3068} servant{H5650} gave{H5414}{(H8804)} you on this side{H5676} Jordan{H3383} toward the sunrising{H4217}{H8121}."
Joshua,1,16,"And they answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Joshua{H3091}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, All that thou commandest{H6680}{(H8765)} us we will do{H6213}{(H8799)}, and whithersoever{H834} thou sendest{H7971}{(H8799)} us, we will go{H3212}{(H8799)}."
Joshua,1,17,"According as we hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} unto Moses{H4872} in all things, so will we hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} unto thee: only the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} be with thee, as he was with Moses{H4872}."
Joshua,1,18,"Whosoever{H376} he be that doth rebel{H4784}{(H8686)} against thy commandment{H6310}, and will not hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} unto thy words{H1697} in all that thou commandest{H6680}{(H8762)} him, he shall be put to death{H4191}{(H8714)}: only be strong{H2388}{(H8798)} and of a good courage{H553}{(H8798)}."
Joshua,2,1,"And Joshua{H3091} the son{H1121} of Nun{H5126} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} out of Shittim{H7851} two{H8147} men{H582} to spy{H7270}{(H8764)} secretly{H2791}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} view{H7200}{(H8798)} the land{H776}, even Jericho{H3405}. And they went{H3212}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} into an harlot's{H2181}{(H8802)} house{H802}{H1004}, named{H8034} Rahab{H7343}, and lodged{H7901}{(H8799)} there."
Joshua,2,2,"And it was told{H559}{(H8735)} the king{H4428} of Jericho{H3405}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, there came{H935}{(H8804)} men{H582} in hither to night{H3915} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} to search out{H2658}{(H8800)} the country{H776}."
Joshua,2,3,"And the king{H4428} of Jericho{H3405} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto Rahab{H7343}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Bring forth{H3318}{(H8685)} the men{H582} that are come{H935}{(H8802)} to thee, which are entered{H935}{(H8804)} into thine house{H1004}: for they be come{H935}{(H8804)} to search out{H2658}{(H8800)} all the country{H776}."
Joshua,2,4,"And the woman{H802} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the two{H8147} men{H582}, and hid{H6845}{(H8799)} them, and said{H559}{(H8799)} thus, There came{H935}{(H8804)} men{H582} unto me, but I wist{H3045}{(H8804)} not whence{H370} they were:"
Joshua,2,5,"And it came to pass about the time of shutting{H5462}{(H8800)} of the gate{H8179}, when it was dark{H2822}, that the men{H582} went out{H3318}{(H8804)}: whither the men{H582} went{H1980}{(H8804)} I wot{H3045}{(H8804)} not: pursue{H7291}{(H8798)} after{H310} them quickly{H4118}; for ye shall overtake{H5381}{(H8686)} them."
Joshua,2,6,"But she had brought them up{H5927}{(H8689)} to the roof{H1406} of the house, and hid{H2934}{(H8799)} them with the stalks{H6086} of flax{H6593}, which she had laid in order{H6186}{(H8803)} upon the roof{H1406}."
Joshua,2,7,"And the men{H582} pursued{H7291}{(H8804)} after{H310} them the way{H1870} to Jordan{H3383} unto the fords{H4569}: and as soon as they which pursued{H7291}{(H8802)} after{H310} them were gone out{H3318}{(H8804)}, they shut{H5462}{(H8804)} the gate{H8179}."
Joshua,2,8,"And before they were laid down{H7901}{(H8799)}, she came up{H5927}{(H8804)} unto them upon the roof{H1406};"
Joshua,2,9,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the men{H582}, I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that the LORD{H3068} hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} you the land{H776}, and that your terror{H367} is fallen{H5307}{(H8804)} upon us, and that all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the land{H776} faint{H4127}{(H8738)} because{H6440} of you."
Joshua,2,10,"For we have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} how the LORD{H3068} dried up{H3001}{(H8689)} the water{H4325} of the Red{H5488} sea{H3220} for you{H6440}, when ye came out{H3318}{(H8800)} of Egypt{H4714}; and what ye did{H6213}{(H8804)} unto the two{H8147} kings{H4428} of the Amorites{H567}, that were on the other side{H5676} Jordan{H3383}, Sihon{H5511} and Og{H5747}, whom ye utterly destroyed{H2763}{(H8689)}."
Joshua,2,11,"And as soon as we had heard{H8085}{(H8799)} these things, our hearts{H3824} did melt{H4549}{(H8735)}, neither did there remain{H6965}{(H8804)} any more courage{H7307} in any man{H376}, because{H6440} of you: for the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, he is God{H430} in heaven{H8064} above{H4605}, and in earth{H776} beneath."
Joshua,2,12,"Now therefore, I pray you, swear{H7650}{(H8734)} unto me by the LORD{H3068}, since{H3588} I have shewed{H6213}{(H8804)} you kindness{H2617}, that ye will also shew{H6213}{(H8804)} kindness{H2617} unto my father's{H1} house{H1004}, and give{H5414}{(H8804)} me a true{H571} token{H226}:"
Joshua,2,13,"And that ye will save alive{H2421}{(H8689)} my father{H1}, and my mother{H517}, and my brethren{H251}, and my sisters{H269}, and all that they have, and deliver{H5337}{(H8689)} our lives{H5315} from death{H4194}."
Joshua,2,14,"And the men{H582} answered{H559}{(H8799)} her, Our life{H5315} for yours{H4191}{(H8800)}, if ye utter{H5046}{(H8686)} not this our business{H1697}. And it shall be, when the LORD{H3068} hath given{H5414}{(H8800)} us the land{H776}, that we will deal{H6213}{(H8804)} kindly{H2617} and truly{H571} with thee."
Joshua,2,15,"Then she let them down{H3381}{(H8686)} by a cord{H2256} through{H1157} the window{H2474}: for her house{H1004} was upon the town{H7023} wall{H2346}, and she dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} upon the wall{H2346}."
Joshua,2,16,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Get{H3212}{(H8798)} you to the mountain{H2022}, lest the pursuers{H7291}{(H8802)} meet{H6293}{(H8799)} you; and hide{H2247}{(H8738)} yourselves there three{H7969} days{H3117}, until the pursuers{H7291}{(H8802)} be returned{H7725}{(H8800)}: and afterward{H310} may ye go{H3212}{(H8799)} your way{H1870}."
Joshua,2,17,"And the men{H582} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, We will be blameless{H5355} of this thine oath{H7621} which thou hast made us swear{H7650}{(H8689)}."
Joshua,2,18,"Behold, when we come{H935}{(H8802)} into the land{H776}, thou shalt bind{H7194}{(H8799)} this line{H8615} of scarlet{H8144} thread{H2339} in the window{H2474} which thou didst let us down by{H3381}{(H8689)}: and thou shalt bring{H622}{(H8799)} thy father{H1}, and thy mother{H517}, and thy brethren{H251}, and all thy father's{H1} household{H1004}, home{H1004} unto thee."
Joshua,2,19,"And it shall be, that whosoever{H834} shall go out{H3318}{(H8799)} of the doors{H1817} of thy house{H1004} into the street{H2351}, his blood{H1818} shall be upon his head{H7218}, and we will be guiltless{H5355}: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house{H1004}, his blood{H1818} shall be on our head{H7218}, if any hand{H3027} be upon him."
Joshua,2,20,"And if thou utter{H5046}{(H8686)} this our business{H1697}, then we will be quit{H5355} of thine oath{H7621} which thou hast made us to swear{H7650}{(H8689)}."
Joshua,2,21,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, According unto your words{H1697}, so be it. And she sent them away{H7971}{(H8762)}, and they departed{H3212}{(H8799)}: and she bound{H7194}{(H8799)} the scarlet{H8144} line{H8615} in the window{H2474}."
Joshua,2,22,"And they went{H3212}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} unto the mountain{H2022}, and abode{H3427}{(H8799)} there three{H7969} days{H3117}, until the pursuers{H7291}{(H8802)} were returned{H7725}{(H8804)}: and the pursuers{H7291}{(H8802)} sought{H1245}{(H8762)} them throughout all the way{H1870}, but found{H4672}{(H8804)} them not."
Joshua,2,23,"So the two{H8147} men{H582} returned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and descended{H3381}{(H8799)} from the mountain{H2022}, and passed over{H5674}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Joshua{H3091} the son{H1121} of Nun{H5126}, and told{H5608}{(H8762)} him all things that befell{H4672}{(H8802)} them:"
Joshua,2,24,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091}, Truly{H3588} the LORD{H3068} hath delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} into our hands{H3027} all the land{H776}; for even all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the country{H776} do faint{H4127}{(H8738)} because{H6440} of us."
Joshua,3,1,"And Joshua{H3091} rose early{H7925}{(H8686)} in the morning{H1242}; and they removed{H5265}{(H8799)} from Shittim{H7851}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jordan{H3383}, he and all the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, and lodged{H3885}{(H8799)} there before they passed over{H5674}{(H8799)}."
Joshua,3,2,"And it came to pass after{H7097} three{H7969} days{H3117}, that the officers{H7860}{(H8802)} went{H5674}{(H8799)} through{H7130} the host{H4264};"
Joshua,3,3,"And they commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} the people{H5971}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, When ye see{H7200}{(H8800)} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, and the priests{H3548} the Levites{H3881} bearing{H5375}{(H8802)} it, then ye shall remove{H5265}{(H8799)} from your place{H4725}, and go{H1980}{(H8804)} after{H310} it."
Joshua,3,4,"Yet there shall be a space{H7350} between you and it, about two thousand{H505} cubits{H520} by measure{H4060}: come not near{H7126}{(H8799)} unto it, that ye may know{H3045}{(H8799)} the way{H1870} by which ye must go{H3212}{(H8799)}: for ye have not passed{H5674}{(H8804)} this way{H1870} heretofore{H8543}{H8032}."
Joshua,3,5,"And Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the people{H5971}, Sanctify{H6942}{(H8690)} yourselves: for to morrow{H4279} the LORD{H3068} will do{H6213}{(H8799)} wonders{H6381}{(H8737)} among{H7130} you."
Joshua,3,6,"And Joshua{H3091} spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto the priests{H3548}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Take up{H5375}{(H8798)} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285}, and pass over{H5674}{(H8798)} before{H6440} the people{H5971}. And they took up{H5375}{(H8799)} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the people{H5971}."
Joshua,3,7,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091}, This day{H3117} will I begin{H2490}{(H8686)} to magnify{H1431}{(H8763)} thee in the sight{H5869} of all Israel{H3478}, that they may know{H3045}{(H8799)} that, as I was with Moses{H4872}, so I will be with thee."
Joshua,3,8,"And thou shalt command{H6680}{(H8762)} the priests{H3548} that bear{H5375}{(H8802)} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, When ye are come{H935}{(H8800)} to the brink{H7097} of the water{H4325} of Jordan{H3383}, ye shall stand still{H5975}{(H8799)} in Jordan{H3383}."
Joshua,3,9,"And Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, Come hither{H5066}{(H8798)}, and hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the words{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}."
Joshua,3,10,"And Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Hereby ye shall know{H3045}{(H8799)} that the living{H2416} God{H410} is among{H7130} you, and that he will without fail{H3423}{(H8687)} drive out{H3423}{(H8686)} from before{H6440} you the Canaanites{H3669}, and the Hittites{H2850}, and the Hivites{H2340}, and the Perizzites{H6522}, and the Girgashites{H1622}, and the Amorites{H567}, and the Jebusites{H2983}."
Joshua,3,11,"Behold, the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of the Lord{H113} of all the earth{H776} passeth over{H5674}{(H8802)} before{H6440} you into Jordan{H3383}."
Joshua,3,12,"Now therefore take{H3947}{(H8798)} you twelve{H8147}{H6240} men{H376} out of the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}, out of every{H259} tribe{H7626} a man{H376}."
Joshua,3,13,"And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles{H3709} of the feet{H7272} of the priests{H3548} that bear{H5375}{(H8802)} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}, the Lord{H113} of all the earth{H776}, shall rest{H5117}{(H8800)} in the waters{H4325} of Jordan{H3383}, that the waters{H4325} of Jordan{H3383} shall be cut off{H3772}{(H8735)} from the waters{H4325} that come down{H3381}{(H8802)} from above{H4605}; and they shall stand{H5975}{(H8799)} upon an{H259} heap{H5067}."
Joshua,3,14,"And it came to pass, when the people{H5971} removed{H5265}{(H8800)} from their tents{H168}, to pass over{H5674}{(H8800)} Jordan{H3383}, and the priests{H3548} bearing{H5375}{(H8802)} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} before{H6440} the people{H5971};"
Joshua,3,15,"And as they that bare{H5375}{(H8802)} the ark{H727} were come{H935}{(H8800)} unto Jordan{H3383}, and the feet{H7272} of the priests{H3548} that bare{H5375}{(H8802)} the ark{H727} were dipped{H2881}{(H8738)} in the brim{H7097} of the water{H4325},(for Jordan{H3383} overfloweth{H4390}{(H8804)} all his banks{H1415} all the time{H3117} of harvest{H7105},)"
Joshua,3,16,"That the waters{H4325} which came down{H3381}{(H8802)} from above{H4605} stood{H5975}{(H8799)} and rose up{H6965}{(H8804)} upon an{H259} heap{H5067} very{H3966} far{H7368}{(H8687)} from the city{H5892} Adam{H121}, that is beside{H6654} Zaretan{H6891}: and those that came down{H3381}{(H8802)} toward the sea{H3220} of the plain{H6160}, even the salt{H4417} sea{H3220}, failed{H8552}{(H8804)}, and were cut off{H3772}{(H8738)}: and the people{H5971} passed over{H5674}{(H8804)} right against Jericho{H3405}."
Joshua,3,17,"And the priests{H3548} that bare{H5375}{(H8802)} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068} stood{H5975}{(H8799)} firm{H3559}{(H8687)} on dry ground{H2724} in the midst{H8432} of Jordan{H3383}, and all the Israelites{H3478} passed over{H5674}{(H8802)} on dry ground{H2724}, until all the people{H1471} were passed{H5674} clean{H8552}{(H8804)} over{H5674}{(H8800)} Jordan{H3383}."
Joshua,4,1,"And it came to pass, when all the people{H1471} were clean{H8552}{(H8804)} passed over{H5674}{(H8800)} Jordan{H3383}, that the LORD{H3068} spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Joshua,4,2,"Take{H3947}{(H8798)} you twelve{H8147}{H6240} men{H582} out of the people{H5971}, out of every{H259} tribe{H7626} a man{H376},"
Joshua,4,3,"And command{H6680}{(H8761)} ye them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Take{H5375}{(H8798)} you hence out of the midst{H8432} of Jordan{H3383}, out of the place where the priests{H3548}' feet{H7272} stood{H4673} firm{H3559}{(H8687)}, twelve{H8147}{H6240} stones{H68}, and ye shall carry them over{H5674}{(H8689)} with you, and leave{H3240}{(H8689)} them in the lodging place{H4411}, where ye shall lodge{H3885}{(H8799)} this night{H3915}."
Joshua,4,4,"Then Joshua{H3091} called{H7121}{(H8799)} the twelve{H8147}{H6240} men{H376}, whom he had prepared{H3559}{(H8689)} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, out of every{H259} tribe{H7626} a man{H376}:"
Joshua,4,5,"And Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Pass over{H5674}{(H8798)} before{H6440} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} into the midst{H8432} of Jordan{H3383}, and take ye up{H7311}{(H8685)} every{H259} man{H376} of you a stone{H68} upon his shoulder{H7926}, according unto the number{H4557} of the tribes{H7626} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}:"
Joshua,4,6,"That this may be a sign{H226} among{H7130} you, that when your children{H1121} ask{H7592}{(H8799)} their fathers in time to come{H4279}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, What mean ye by these stones{H68}?"
Joshua,4,7,"Then ye shall answer{H559}{(H8804)} them, That the waters{H4325} of Jordan{H3383} were cut off{H3772}{(H8738)} before{H6440} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068}; when it passed over{H5674}{(H8800)} Jordan{H3383}, the waters{H4325} of Jordan{H3383} were cut off{H3772}{(H8738)}: and these stones{H68} shall be for a memorial{H2146} unto the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} for{H5704} ever{H5769}."
Joshua,4,8,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} did{H6213}{(H8799)} so as Joshua{H3091} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}, and took up{H5375}{(H8799)} twelve{H8147}{H6240} stones{H68} out of the midst{H8432} of Jordan{H3383}, as the LORD{H3068} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} unto Joshua{H3091}, according to the number{H4557} of the tribes{H7626} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, and carried them over{H5674}{(H8686)} with them unto the place where they lodged{H4411}, and laid them down{H3240}{(H8686)} there."
Joshua,4,9,"And Joshua{H3091} set up{H6965}{(H8689)} twelve{H8147}{H6240} stones{H68} in the midst{H8432} of Jordan{H3383}, in the place where the feet{H7272} of the priests{H3548} which bare{H5375}{(H8802)} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} stood{H4673}: and they are there unto this day{H3117}."
Joshua,4,10,"For the priests{H3548} which bare{H5375}{(H8802)} the ark{H727} stood{H5975}{(H8802)} in the midst{H8432} of Jordan{H3383}, until every thing{H1697} was finished{H8552}{(H8800)} that the LORD{H3068} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} Joshua{H3091} to speak{H1696}{(H8763)} unto the people{H5971}, according to all that Moses{H4872} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} Joshua{H3091}: and the people{H5971} hasted{H4116}{(H8762)} and passed over{H5674}{(H8799)}."
Joshua,4,11,"And it came to pass, when all the people{H5971} were clean{H8552}{(H8804)} passed over{H5674}{(H8800)}, that the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068} passed over{H5674}{(H8799)}, and the priests{H3548}, in the presence{H6440} of the people{H5971}."
Joshua,4,12,"And the children{H1121} of Reuben{H7205}, and the children{H1121} of Gad{H1410}, and half{H2677} the tribe{H7626} of Manasseh{H4519}, passed over{H5674}{(H8799)} armed{H2571} before{H6440} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, as Moses{H4872} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} unto them:"
Joshua,4,13,"About forty{H705} thousand{H505} prepared{H2502}{(H8803)} for war{H6635} passed over{H5674}{(H8804)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} unto battle{H4421}, to the plains{H6160} of Jericho{H3405}."
Joshua,4,14,"On that day{H3117} the LORD{H3068} magnified{H1431}{(H8765)} Joshua{H3091} in the sight{H5869} of all Israel{H3478}; and they feared{H3372}{(H8799)} him, as they feared{H3372}{(H8804)} Moses{H4872}, all the days{H3117} of his life{H2416}."
Joshua,4,15,"And the LORD{H3068} spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Joshua,4,16,"Command{H6680}{(H8761)} the priests{H3548} that bear{H5375}{(H8802)} the ark{H727} of the testimony{H5715}, that they come up{H5927}{(H8799)} out of Jordan{H3383}."
Joshua,4,17,"Joshua{H3091} therefore commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} the priests{H3548}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Come ye up{H5927}{(H8798)} out of Jordan{H3383}."
Joshua,4,18,"And it came to pass, when the priests{H3548} that bare{H5375}{(H8802)} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068} were come up{H5927}{(H8800)} out of the midst{H8432} of Jordan{H3383}, and the soles{H3709} of the priests{H3548}' feet{H7272} were lifted up{H5423}{(H8738)} unto the dry land{H2724}, that the waters{H4325} of Jordan{H3383} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} unto their place{H4725}, and flowed{H3212}{(H8799)} over all his banks{H1415}, as{H8543} they did before{H8032}."
Joshua,4,19,"And the people{H5971} came up{H5927}{(H8804)} out of Jordan{H3383} on the tenth{H6218} day of the first{H7223} month{H2320}, and encamped{H2583}{(H8799)} in Gilgal{H1537}, in the east{H4217} border{H7097} of Jericho{H3405}."
Joshua,4,20,"And those twelve{H8147}{H6240} stones{H68}, which they took out{H3947}{(H8804)} of Jordan{H3383}, did Joshua{H3091} pitch{H6965}{(H8689)} in Gilgal{H1537}."
Joshua,4,21,"And he spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, When your children{H1121} shall ask{H7592}{(H8799)} their fathers{H1} in time to come{H4279}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, What mean these stones{H68}?"
Joshua,4,22,"Then ye shall let your children{H1121} know{H3045}{(H8689)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Israel{H3478} came over{H5674}{(H8804)} this Jordan{H3383} on dry land{H3004}."
Joshua,4,23,"For the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} dried up{H3001}{(H8689)} the waters{H4325} of Jordan{H3383} from before{H6440} you, until ye were passed over{H5674}{(H8800)}, as the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} did{H6213}{(H8804)} to the Red{H5488} sea{H3220}, which he dried up{H3001}{(H8689)} from before{H6440} us, until we were gone over{H5674}{(H8800)}:"
Joshua,4,24,"That all the people{H5971} of the earth{H776} might know{H3045}{(H8800)} the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068}, that it is mighty{H2389}: that ye might fear{H3372}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} for ever{H3117}."
Joshua,5,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings{H4428} of the Amorites{H567}, which were on the side{H5676} of Jordan{H3383} westward{H3220}, and all the kings{H4428} of the Canaanites{H3669}, which were by the sea{H3220}, heard{H8085}{(H8800)} that the LORD{H3068} had dried up{H3001}{(H8689)} the waters{H4325} of Jordan{H3383} from before{H6440} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, until we were passed over{H5674}{(H8800)}, that their heart{H3824} melted{H4549}{(H8735)}, neither was there spirit{H7307} in them any more, because{H6440} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}."
Joshua,5,2,"At that time{H6256} the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8804)} unto Joshua{H3091}, Make{H6213}{(H8798)} thee sharp{H6697} knives{H2719}, and circumcise{H4135}{(H8798)} again{H7725}{(H8798)} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} the second time{H8145}."
Joshua,5,3,"And Joshua{H3091} made{H6213}{(H8799)} him sharp{H6697} knives{H2719}, and circumcised{H4135}{(H8799)} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} at the hill{H1389} of the foreskins{H6190}."
Joshua,5,4,"And this is the cause{H1697} why Joshua{H3091} did circumcise{H4135}{(H8804)}: All the people{H5971} that came out{H3318}{(H8802)} of Egypt{H4714}, that were males{H2145}, even all the men{H582} of war{H4421}, died{H4191}{(H8804)} in the wilderness{H4057} by the way{H1870}, after they came out{H3318}{(H8800)} of Egypt{H4714}."
Joshua,5,5,"Now{H3588} all the people{H5971} that came out{H3318}{(H8802)} were circumcised{H4135}{(H8803)}: but all the people{H5971} that were born{H3209} in the wilderness{H4057} by the way{H1870} as they came forth{H3318}{(H8800)} out of Egypt{H4714}, them they had not circumcised{H4135}{(H8804)}."
Joshua,5,6,"For the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} walked{H1980}{(H8804)} forty{H705} years{H8141} in the wilderness{H4057}, till all the people{H1471} that were men{H582} of war{H4421}, which came out{H3318}{(H8802)} of Egypt{H4714}, were consumed{H8552}{(H8800)}, because they obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} not the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068}: unto whom the LORD{H3068} sware{H7650}{(H8738)} that he would not shew{H7200}{(H8687)} them the land{H776}, which the LORD{H3068} sware{H7650}{(H8738)} unto their fathers{H1} that he would give{H5414}{(H8800)} us, a land{H776} that floweth{H2100}{(H8802)} with milk{H2461} and honey{H1706}."
Joshua,5,7,"And their children{H1121}, whom he raised up{H6965}{(H8689)} in their stead, them Joshua{H3091} circumcised{H4135}{(H8804)}: for they were uncircumcised{H6189}, because they had not circumcised{H4135}{(H8804)} them by the way{H1870}."
Joshua,5,8,"And it came to pass, when they had done{H8552}{(H8804)} circumcising{H4135}{(H8736)} all the people{H1471}, that they abode{H3427}{(H8799)} in their places in the camp{H4264}, till they were whole{H2421}{(H8800)}."
Joshua,5,9,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091}, This day{H3117} have I rolled away{H1556}{(H8804)} the reproach{H2781} of Egypt{H4714} from off you. Wherefore the name{H8034} of the place{H4725} is called{H7121}{(H8799)} Gilgal{H1537} unto this day{H3117}."
Joshua,5,10,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} encamped{H2583}{(H8799)} in Gilgal{H1537}, and kept{H6213}{(H8799)} the passover{H6453} on the fourteenth{H702}{H6240} day{H3117} of the month{H2320} at even{H6153} in the plains{H6160} of Jericho{H3405}."
Joshua,5,11,"And they did eat{H398}{(H8799)} of the old corn{H5669} of the land{H776} on the morrow{H4283} after the passover{H6453}, unleavened cakes{H4682}, and parched{H7033}{(H8803)} corn in the selfsame{H6106} day{H3117}."
Joshua,5,12,And the manna{H4478} ceased{H7673}{(H8799)} on the morrow{H4283} after they had eaten{H398}{(H8800)} of the old corn{H5669} of the land{H776}; neither had the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} manna{H4478} any more; but they did eat{H398}{(H8799)} of the fruit{H8393} of the land{H776} of Canaan{H3667} that year{H8141}.
Joshua,5,13,"And it came to pass, when Joshua{H3091} was by Jericho{H3405}, that he lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} his eyes{H5869} and looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, behold, there stood{H5975}{(H8802)} a man{H376} over against him with his sword{H2719} drawn{H8025}{(H8803)} in his hand{H3027}: and Joshua{H3091} went{H3212}{(H8799)} unto him, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries{H6862}?"
Joshua,5,14,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Nay; but as captain{H8269} of the host{H6635} of the LORD{H3068} am I now come{H935}{(H8804)}. And Joshua{H3091} fell{H5307}{(H8799)} on his face{H6440} to the earth{H776}, and did worship{H7812}{(H8691)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, What saith{H1696}{(H8764)} my lord{H113} unto his servant{H5650}?"
Joshua,5,15,"And the captain{H8269} of the LORD'S{H3068} host{H6635} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091}, Loose{H5394}{(H8798)} thy shoe{H5275} from off thy foot{H7272}; for the place{H4725} whereon thou standest{H5975}{(H8802)} is holy{H6944}. And Joshua{H3091} did{H6213}{(H8799)} so."
Joshua,6,1,"Now Jericho{H3405} was straitly{H5462}{(H8802)} shut up{H5462}{(H8794)} because{H6440} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}: none went out{H3318}{(H8802)}, and none came in{H935}{(H8802)}."
Joshua,6,2,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091}, See{H7200}{(H8798)}, I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} into thine hand{H3027} Jericho{H3405}, and the king{H4428} thereof, and the mighty men{H1368} of valour{H2428}."
Joshua,6,3,"And ye shall compass{H5437}{(H8804)} the city{H5892}, all ye men{H582} of war{H4421}, and go round about{H5362}{(H8687)} the city{H5892} once{H6471}{H259}. Thus shalt thou do{H6213}{(H8799)} six{H8337} days{H3117}."
Joshua,6,4,"And seven{H7651} priests{H3548} shall bear{H5375}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the ark{H727} seven{H7651} trumpets{H7782} of rams' horns{H3104}: and the seventh{H7637} day{H3117} ye shall compass{H5437}{(H8799)} the city{H5892} seven{H7651} times{H6471}, and the priests{H3548} shall blow{H8628}{(H8799)} with the trumpets{H7782}."
Joshua,6,5,"And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long{H4900}{(H8800)} blast with the ram's{H3104} horn{H7161}, and when ye hear{H8085}{(H8800)} the sound{H6963} of the trumpet{H7782}, all the people{H5971} shall shout{H7321}{(H8686)} with a great{H1419} shout{H8643}; and the wall{H2346} of the city{H5892} shall fall down{H5307}{(H8804)} flat{H8478}, and the people{H5971} shall ascend up{H5927}{(H8804)} every man{H376} straight before him."
Joshua,6,6,"And Joshua{H3091} the son{H1121} of Nun{H5126} called{H7121}{(H8799)} the priests{H3548}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Take up{H5375}{(H8798)} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285}, and let seven{H7651} priests{H3548} bear{H5375}{(H8799)} seven{H7651} trumpets{H7782} of rams' horns{H3104} before{H6440} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}."
Joshua,6,7,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the people{H5971}, Pass on{H5674}{(H8798)}, and compass{H5437}{(H8798)} the city{H5892}, and let him that is armed{H2502}{(H8803)} pass on{H5674}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}."
Joshua,6,8,"And it came to pass, when Joshua{H3091} had spoken{H559}{(H8800)} unto the people{H5971}, that the seven{H7651} priests{H3548} bearing{H5375}{(H8802)} the seven{H7651} trumpets{H7782} of rams' horns{H3104} passed on{H5674}{(H8804)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, and blew{H8628}{(H8804)} with the trumpets{H7782}: and the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068} followed{H1980}{(H8802)} them{H310}."
Joshua,6,9,"And the armed{H2502}{(H8803)} men went{H1980}{(H8802)} before{H6440} the priests{H3548} that blew{H8628}{(H8802)}{(H8675)}{H8628}{(H8804)} with the trumpets{H7782}, and the rereward{H622}{(H8764)} came{H1980}{(H8802)} after{H310} the ark{H727}, the priests going on{H1980}{(H8800)}, and blowing{H8628}{(H8800)} with the trumpets{H7782}."
Joshua,6,10,"And Joshua{H3091} had commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} the people{H5971}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Ye shall not shout{H7321}{(H8686)}, nor make any noise{H8085}{(H8686)} with your voice{H6963}, neither shall any word{H1697} proceed{H3318}{(H8799)} out of your mouth{H6310}, until the day{H3117} I bid{H559}{(H8800)} you shout{H7321}{(H8685)}; then shall ye shout{H7321}{(H8689)}."
Joshua,6,11,"So the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068} compassed{H5437}{(H8686)} the city{H5892}, going about{H5362}{(H8687)} it once{H6471}{H259}: and they came{H935}{(H8799)} into the camp{H4264}, and lodged{H3885}{(H8799)} in the camp{H4264}."
Joshua,6,12,"And Joshua{H3091} rose early{H7925}{(H8686)} in the morning{H1242}, and the priests{H3548} took up{H5375}{(H8799)} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}."
Joshua,6,13,"And seven{H7651} priests{H3548} bearing{H5375}{(H8802)} seven{H7651} trumpets{H7782} of rams' horns{H3104} before{H6440} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068} went on{H1980}{(H8802)} continually{H1980}{(H8800)}, and blew{H8628}{(H8804)} with the trumpets{H7782}: and the armed men{H2502}{(H8803)} went{H1980}{(H8802)} before{H6440} them; but the rereward{H622}{(H8764)} came{H1980}{(H8802)} after{H310} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}, the priests going on{H1980}{(H8800)}, and blowing{H8628}{(H8800)} with the trumpets{H7782}."
Joshua,6,14,"And the second{H8145} day{H3117} they compassed{H5437}{(H8799)} the city{H5892} once{H6471}{H259}, and returned{H7725}{(H8799)} into the camp{H4264}: so they did{H6213}{(H8804)} six{H8337} days{H3117}."
Joshua,6,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh{H7637} day{H3117}, that they rose early{H7925}{(H8686)} about the dawning{H5927}{(H8800)} of the day{H7837}, and compassed{H5437}{(H8799)} the city{H5892} after the same manner{H4941} seven{H7651} times{H6471}: only on that day{H3117} they compassed{H5437}{(H8804)} the city{H5892} seven{H7651} times{H6471}."
Joshua,6,16,"And it came to pass at the seventh{H7637} time{H6471}, when the priests{H3548} blew{H8628}{(H8804)} with the trumpets{H7782}, Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the people{H5971}, Shout{H7321}{(H8685)}; for the LORD{H3068} hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} you the city{H5892}."
Joshua,6,17,"And the city{H5892} shall be accursed{H2764}, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD{H3068}: only Rahab{H7343} the harlot{H2181}{(H8802)} shall live{H2421}{(H8799)}, she and all that are with her in the house{H1004}, because she hid{H2244}{(H8689)} the messengers{H4397} that we sent{H7971}{(H8804)}."
Joshua,6,18,"And ye, in any wise{H7535} keep{H8104}{(H8798)} yourselves from the accursed thing{H2764}, lest ye make yourselves accursed{H2763}{(H8686)}, when ye take{H3947}{(H8804)} of the accursed thing{H2764}, and make{H7760}{(H8804)} the camp{H4264} of Israel{H3478} a curse{H2764}, and trouble{H5916}{(H8804)} it."
Joshua,6,19,"But all the silver{H3701}, and gold{H2091}, and vessels{H3627} of brass{H5178} and iron{H1270}, are consecrated{H6944} unto the LORD{H3068}: they shall come{H935}{(H8799)} into the treasury{H214} of the LORD{H3068}."
Joshua,6,20,"So the people{H5971} shouted{H7321}{(H8686)} when the priests blew{H8628}{(H8799)} with the trumpets{H7782}: and it came to pass, when the people{H5971} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} the sound{H6963} of the trumpet{H7782}, and the people{H5971} shouted{H7321}{(H8686)} with a great{H1419} shout{H8643}, that the wall{H2346} fell down flat{H5307}{(H8799)}, so that the people{H5971} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} into the city{H5892}, every man{H376} straight before him, and they took{H3920}{(H8799)} the city{H5892}."
Joshua,6,21,"And they utterly destroyed{H2763}{(H8686)} all that was in the city{H5892}, both man{H376} and woman{H802}, young{H5288} and old{H2205}, and ox{H7794}, and sheep{H7716}, and ass{H2543}, with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}."
Joshua,6,22,"But Joshua{H3091} had said{H559}{(H8804)} unto the two{H8147} men{H582} that had spied out{H7270}{(H8764)} the country{H776}, Go{H935}{(H8798)} into the harlot's{H2181}{(H8802)} house{H1004}, and bring out{H3318}{(H8685)} thence the woman{H802}, and all that she hath, as ye sware{H7650}{(H8738)} unto her."
Joshua,6,23,"And the young men{H5288} that were spies{H7270}{(H8764)} went in{H935}{(H8799)}, and brought out{H3318}{(H8686)} Rahab{H7343}, and her father{H1}, and her mother{H517}, and her brethren{H251}, and all that she had; and they brought out{H3318}{(H8689)} all her kindred{H4940}, and left{H3240}{(H8686)} them without{H2351} the camp{H4264} of Israel{H3478}."
Joshua,6,24,"And they burnt{H8313}{(H8804)} the city{H5892} with fire{H784}, and all that was therein: only the silver{H3701}, and the gold{H2091}, and the vessels{H3627} of brass{H5178} and of iron{H1270}, they put{H5414}{(H8804)} into the treasury{H214} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
Joshua,6,25,"And Joshua{H3091} saved{H2421} Rahab{H7343} the harlot{H2181}{(H8802)} alive{H2421}{(H8689)}, and her father's{H1} household{H1004}, and all that she had; and she dwelleth{H3427}{(H8799)} in{H7130} Israel{H3478} even unto this day{H3117}; because she hid{H2244}{(H8689)} the messengers{H4397}, which Joshua{H3091} sent{H7971}{(H8804)} to spy out{H7270}{(H8763)} Jericho{H3405}."
Joshua,6,26,"And Joshua{H3091} adjured{H7650}{(H8686)} them at that time{H6256}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Cursed{H779}{(H8803)} be the man{H376} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, that riseth up{H6965}{(H8799)} and buildeth{H1129}{(H8804)} this city{H5892} Jericho{H3405}: he shall lay the foundation{H3245}{(H8762)} thereof in his firstborn{H1060}, and in his youngest{H6810} son shall he set up{H5324}{(H8686)} the gates{H1817} of it."
Joshua,6,27,So the LORD{H3068} was with Joshua{H3091}; and his fame{H8089} was noised throughout all the country{H776}.
Joshua,7,1,"But the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} committed{H4603}{(H8799)} a trespass{H4604} in the accursed thing{H2764}: for Achan{H5912}, the son{H1121} of Carmi{H3756}, the son{H1121} of Zabdi{H2067}, the son{H1121} of Zerah{H2226}, of the tribe{H4294} of Judah{H3063}, took{H3947}{(H8799)} of the accursed thing{H2764}: and the anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} was kindled{H2734}{(H8799)} against the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}."
Joshua,7,2,"And Joshua{H3091} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} men{H582} from Jericho{H3405} to Ai{H5857}, which is beside{H5973} Bethaven{H1007}, on the east side{H6924} of Bethel{H1008}, and spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Go up{H5927}{(H8798)} and view{H7270}{(H8761)} the country{H776}. And the men{H582} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} and viewed{H7270}{(H8762)} Ai{H5857}."
Joshua,7,3,"And they returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to Joshua{H3091}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Let not all the people{H5971} go up{H5927}{(H8799)}; but let about two or three{H7969} thousand{H505} men{H376} go up{H5927}{(H8799)} and smite{H5221}{(H8686)} Ai{H5857}; and make not all the people{H5971} to labour{H3021}{(H8762)} thither; for they are but few{H4592}."
Joshua,7,4,So there went up{H5927}{(H8799)} thither of the people{H5971} about three{H7969} thousand{H505} men{H376}: and they fled{H5127}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the men{H582} of Ai{H5857}.
Joshua,7,5,"And the men{H582} of Ai{H5857} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} of them about thirty{H7970} and six{H8337} men{H376}: for they chased{H7291}{(H8799)} them from before{H6440} the gate{H8179} even unto Shebarim{H7671}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them in the going down{H4174}: wherefore the hearts{H3824} of the people{H5971} melted{H4549}{(H8735)}, and became as water{H4325}."
Joshua,7,6,"And Joshua{H3091} rent{H7167}{(H8799)} his clothes{H8071}, and fell{H5307}{(H8799)} to the earth{H776} upon his face{H6440} before{H6440} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068} until the eventide{H6153}, he and the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478}, and put{H5927}{(H8686)} dust{H6083} upon their heads{H7218}."
Joshua,7,7,"And Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Alas, O{H162} Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, wherefore hast thou at all{H5674}{(H8687)} brought{H5674} this people{H5971} over{H5674}{(H8689)} Jordan{H3383}, to deliver{H5414}{(H8800)} us into the hand{H3027} of the Amorites{H567}, to destroy{H6}{(H8687)} us? would to God{H3863} we had been content{H2974}{(H8689)}, and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} on the other side{H5676} Jordan{H3383}!"
Joshua,7,8,"O{H994} Lord{H136}, what shall I say{H559}{(H8799)}, when{H310} Israel{H3478} turneth{H2015}{(H8804)} their backs{H6203} before{H6440} their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}!"
Joshua,7,9,"For the Canaanites{H3669} and all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the land{H776} shall hear{H8085}{(H8799)} of it, and shall environ us round{H5437}{(H8738)}, and cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} our name{H8034} from the earth{H776}: and what wilt thou do{H6213}{(H8799)} unto thy great{H1419} name{H8034}?"
Joshua,7,10,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091}, Get thee up{H6965}{(H8798)}; wherefore liest{H5307}{(H8802)} thou thus upon thy face{H6440}?"
Joshua,7,11,"Israel{H3478} hath sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}, and they have also transgressed{H5674}{(H8804)} my covenant{H1285} which I commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} them: for they have even taken{H3947}{(H8804)} of the accursed thing{H2764}, and have also stolen{H1589}{(H8804)}, and dissembled{H3584}{(H8765)} also, and they have put{H7760}{(H8804)} it even among their own stuff{H3627}."
Joshua,7,12,"Therefore the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} could{H3201}{(H8799)} not stand{H6965}{(H8800)} before{H6440} their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, but turned{H6437}{(H8799)} their backs{H6203} before{H6440} their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, because they were accursed{H2764}: neither will I be with you any more{H3254}{(H8686)}, except{H3808} ye destroy{H8045}{(H8686)} the accursed{H2764} from among{H7130} you."
Joshua,7,13,"Up{H6965}{(H8798)}, sanctify{H6942}{(H8761)} the people{H5971}, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, Sanctify{H6942}{(H8690)} yourselves against to morrow{H4279}: for thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, There is an accursed thing{H2764} in the midst{H7130} of thee, O Israel{H3478}: thou canst{H3201}{(H8799)} not stand{H6965}{(H8800)} before{H6440} thine enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, until ye take away{H5493}{(H8687)} the accursed thing{H2764} from among{H7130} you."
Joshua,7,14,"In the morning{H1242} therefore ye shall be brought{H7126}{(H8738)} according to your tribes{H7626}: and it shall be, that the tribe{H7626} which the LORD{H3068} taketh{H3920}{(H8799)} shall come{H7126}{(H8799)} according to the families{H4940} thereof; and the family{H4940} which the LORD{H3068} shall take{H3920}{(H8799)} shall come{H7126}{(H8799)} by households{H1004}; and the household{H1004} which the LORD{H3068} shall take{H3920}{(H8799)} shall come{H7126}{(H8799)} man{H1397} by man{H1397}."
Joshua,7,15,"And it shall be, that he that is taken{H3920}{(H8737)} with the accursed thing{H2764} shall be burnt{H8313}{(H8735)} with fire{H784}, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed{H5674}{(H8804)} the covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068}, and because he hath wrought{H6213}{(H8804)} folly{H5039} in Israel{H3478}."
Joshua,7,16,"So Joshua{H3091} rose up early{H7925}{(H8686)} in the morning{H1242}, and brought{H7126}{(H8686)} Israel{H3478} by their tribes{H7626}; and the tribe{H7626} of Judah{H3063} was taken{H3920}{(H8735)}:"
Joshua,7,17,And he brought{H7126}{(H8686)} the family{H4940} of Judah{H3063}; and he took{H3920}{(H8799)} the family{H4940} of the Zarhites{H2227}: and he brought{H7126}{(H8686)} the family{H4940} of the Zarhites{H2227} man{H1397} by man{H1397}; and Zabdi{H2067} was taken{H3920}{(H8735)}:
Joshua,7,18,"And he brought{H7126}{(H8686)} his household{H1004} man{H1397} by man{H1397}; and Achan{H5912}, the son{H1121} of Carmi{H3756}, the son{H1121} of Zabdi{H2067}, the son{H1121} of Zerah{H2226}, of the tribe{H4294} of Judah{H3063}, was taken{H3920}{(H8735)}."
Joshua,7,19,"And Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Achan{H5912}, My son{H1121}, give{H7760}{(H8798)}, I pray thee, glory{H3519} to the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, and make{H5414}{(H8798)} confession{H8426} unto him; and tell{H5046}{(H8685)} me now what thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)}; hide{H3582}{(H8762)} it not from me."
Joshua,7,20,"And Achan{H5912} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Joshua{H3091}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Indeed{H546} I have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, and thus and thus have I done{H6213}{(H8804)}:"
Joshua,7,21,"When I saw{H7200}{(H8799)} among the spoils{H7998} a{H259} goodly{H2896} Babylonish{H8152} garment{H155}, and two hundred{H3967} shekels{H8255} of silver{H3701}, and a{H259} wedge{H3956} of gold{H2091} of fifty{H2572} shekels{H8255} weight{H4948}, then I coveted{H2530}{(H8799)} them, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} them; and, behold, they are hid{H2934}{(H8803)} in the earth{H776} in the midst{H8432} of my tent{H168}, and the silver{H3701} under it."
Joshua,7,22,"So Joshua{H3091} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397}, and they ran{H7323}{(H8799)} unto the tent{H168}; and, behold, it was hid{H2934}{(H8803)} in his tent{H168}, and the silver{H3701} under it."
Joshua,7,23,"And they took{H3947}{(H8799)} them out of the midst{H8432} of the tent{H168}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} them unto Joshua{H3091}, and unto all the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, and laid them out{H3332}{(H8686)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}."
Joshua,7,24,"And Joshua{H3091}, and all Israel{H3478} with him, took{H3947}{(H8799)} Achan{H5912} the son{H1121} of Zerah{H2226}, and the silver{H3701}, and the garment{H155}, and the wedge{H3956} of gold{H2091}, and his sons{H1121}, and his daughters{H1323}, and his oxen{H7794}, and his asses{H2543}, and his sheep{H6629}, and his tent{H168}, and all that he had: and they brought{H5927}{(H8686)} them unto the valley{H6010} of Achor{H5911}."
Joshua,7,25,"And Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Why{H4100} hast thou troubled{H5916}{(H8804)} us? the LORD{H3068} shall trouble{H5916}{(H8799)} thee this day{H3117}. And all Israel{H3478} stoned{H7275}{(H8799)} him with stones{H68}, and burned{H8313}{(H8799)} them with fire{H784}, after they had stoned{H5619}{(H8799)} them with stones{H68}."
Joshua,7,26,"And they raised{H6965}{(H8686)} over him a great{H1419} heap{H1530} of stones{H68} unto this day{H3117}. So the LORD{H3068} turned{H7725}{(H8799)} from the fierceness{H2740} of his anger{H639}. Wherefore the name{H8034} of that place{H4725} was called{H7121}{(H8804)}, The valley{H6010} of Achor{H5911}, unto this day{H3117}."
Joshua,8,1,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091}, Fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not, neither be thou dismayed{H2865}{(H8735)}: take{H3947}{(H8798)} all the people{H5971} of war{H4421} with thee, and arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, go up{H5927}{(H8798)} to Ai{H5857}: see{H7200}{(H8798)}, I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} into thy hand{H3027} the king{H4428} of Ai{H5857}, and his people{H5971}, and his city{H5892}, and his land{H776}:"
Joshua,8,2,"And thou shalt do{H6213}{(H8804)} to Ai{H5857} and her king{H4428} as thou didst{H6213}{(H8804)} unto Jericho{H3405} and her king{H4428}: only the spoil{H7998} thereof, and the cattle{H929} thereof, shall ye take for a prey{H962}{(H8799)} unto yourselves: lay{H7760}{(H8798)} thee an ambush{H693}{(H8802)} for the city{H5892} behind{H310} it."
Joshua,8,3,"So Joshua{H3091} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and all the people{H5971} of war{H4421}, to go up{H5927}{(H8800)} against Ai{H5857}: and Joshua{H3091} chose out{H977}{(H8799)} thirty{H7970} thousand{H505} mighty{H1368} men{H376} of valour{H2428}, and sent them away{H7971}{(H8799)} by night{H3915}."
Joshua,8,4,"And he commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold{H7200}{(H8798)}, ye shall lie in wait{H693}{(H8802)} against the city{H5892}, even behind{H310} the city{H5892}: go{H7368} not very{H3966} far{H7368}{(H8686)} from the city{H5892}, but be ye all ready{H3559}{(H8737)}:"
Joshua,8,5,"And I, and all the people{H5971} that are with me, will approach{H7126}{(H8799)} unto the city{H5892}: and it shall come to pass, when they come out{H3318}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} us, as at the first{H7223}, that we will flee{H5127}{(H8804)} before{H6440} them,"
Joshua,8,6,"(For they will come out{H3318}{(H8804)} after{H310} us) till we have drawn{H5423}{(H8687)} them from the city{H5892}; for they will say{H559}{(H8799)}, They flee{H5127}{(H8801)} before{H6440} us, as at the first{H7223}: therefore we will flee{H5127}{(H8804)} before{H6440} them."
Joshua,8,7,"Then ye shall rise up{H6965}{(H8799)} from the ambush{H693}{(H8802)}, and seize{H3423}{(H8689)} upon the city{H5892}: for the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} will deliver{H5414}{(H8804)} it into your hand{H3027}."
Joshua,8,8,"And it shall be, when ye have taken{H8610}{(H8800)} the city{H5892}, that ye shall set{H3341}{(H8686)} the city{H5892} on fire{H784}: according to the commandment{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} shall ye do{H6213}{(H8799)}. See{H7200}{(H8798)}, I have commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} you."
Joshua,8,9,"Joshua{H3091} therefore sent them forth{H7971}{(H8799)}: and they went{H3212}{(H8799)} to lie in ambush{H3993}, and abode{H3427}{(H8799)} between Bethel{H1008} and Ai{H5857}, on the west side{H3220} of Ai{H5857}: but Joshua{H3091} lodged{H3885}{(H8799)} that night{H3915} among{H8432} the people{H5971}."
Joshua,8,10,"And Joshua{H3091} rose up early{H7925}{(H8686)} in the morning{H1242}, and numbered{H6485}{(H8799)} the people{H5971}, and went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, he and the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478}, before{H6440} the people{H5971} to Ai{H5857}."
Joshua,8,11,"And all the people{H5971}, even the people of war{H4421} that were with him, went up{H5927}{(H8804)}, and drew nigh{H5066}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} before the city{H5892}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} on the north side{H6828} of Ai{H5857}: now there was a valley{H1516} between them and Ai{H5857}."
Joshua,8,12,"And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} about five{H2568} thousand{H505} men{H376}, and set{H7760}{(H8799)} them to lie in ambush{H693}{(H8802)} between Bethel{H1008} and Ai{H5857}, on the west side{H3220} of the city{H5857}{(H8675)}{H5892}."
Joshua,8,13,"And when they had set{H7760}{(H8799)} the people{H5971}, even all the host{H4264} that was on the north{H6828} of the city{H5892}, and their liers in wait{H6119} on the west{H3220} of the city{H5892}, Joshua{H3091} went{H3212}{(H8799)} that night{H3915} into the midst{H8432} of the valley{H6010}."
Joshua,8,14,"And it came to pass, when the king{H4428} of Ai{H5857} saw{H7200}{(H8800)} it, that they hasted{H4116}{(H8762)} and rose up early{H7925}{(H8686)}, and the men{H582} of the city{H5892} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} Israel{H3478} to battle{H4421}, he and all his people{H5971}, at a time appointed{H4150}, before{H6440} the plain{H6160}; but he wist{H3045}{(H8804)} not that there were liers in ambush{H693}{(H8802)} against him behind{H310} the city{H5892}."
Joshua,8,15,"And Joshua{H3091} and all Israel{H3478} made as if they were beaten{H5060}{(H8735)} before{H6440} them, and fled{H5127}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870} of the wilderness{H4057}."
Joshua,8,16,"And all the people{H5971} that were in Ai{H5857}{(H8675)}{H5892} were called{H2199}{(H8735)} together to pursue{H7291}{(H8800)} after{H310} them: and they pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} Joshua{H3091}, and were drawn away{H5423}{(H8735)} from the city{H5892}."
Joshua,8,17,"And there was not a man{H376} left{H7604}{(H8738)} in Ai{H5857} or Bethel{H1008}, that went not out{H3318}{(H8804)} after{H310} Israel{H3478}: and they left{H5800}{(H8799)} the city{H5892} open{H6605}{(H8803)}, and pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} after Israel{H3478}."
Joshua,8,18,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091}, Stretch out{H5186}{(H8798)} the spear{H3591} that is in thy hand{H3027} toward Ai{H5857}; for I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} it into thine hand{H3027}. And Joshua{H3091} stretched out{H5186}{(H8799)} the spear{H3591} that he had in his hand{H3027} toward the city{H5892}."
Joshua,8,19,"And the ambush{H693}{(H8802)} arose{H6965}{(H8804)} quickly{H4120} out of their place{H4725}, and they ran{H7323}{(H8799)} as soon as he had stretched out{H5186}{(H8800)} his hand{H3027}: and they entered{H935}{(H8799)} into the city{H5892}, and took{H3920}{(H8799)} it, and hasted{H4116}{(H8762)} and set{H3341}{(H8686)} the city{H5892} on fire{H784}."
Joshua,8,20,"And when the men{H582} of Ai{H5857} looked{H6437}{(H8799)} behind{H310} them, they saw{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, behold, the smoke{H6227} of the city{H5892} ascended up{H5927}{(H8804)} to heaven{H8064}, and they had no power{H3027} to flee{H5127}{(H8800)} this way or that way{H2008}: and the people{H5971} that fled{H5127}{(H8801)} to the wilderness{H4057} turned back{H2015}{(H8738)} upon the pursuers{H7291}{(H8802)}."
Joshua,8,21,"And when Joshua{H3091} and all Israel{H3478} saw{H7200}{(H8804)} that the ambush{H693}{(H8802)} had taken{H3920}{(H8804)} the city{H5892}, and that the smoke{H6227} of the city{H5892} ascended{H5927}{(H8804)}, then they turned again{H7725}{(H8799)}, and slew{H5221}{(H8686)} the men{H582} of Ai{H5857}."
Joshua,8,22,"And the other{H428} issued out{H3318}{(H8804)} of the city{H5892} against{H7125}{(H8800)} them; so they were in the midst{H8432} of Israel{H3478}, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them, so that{H5704} they let{H7604}{(H8689)} none of them remain{H8300} or escape{H6412}."
Joshua,8,23,"And the king{H4428} of Ai{H5857} they took{H8610}{(H8804)} alive{H2416}, and brought{H7126}{(H8686)} him to Joshua{H3091}."
Joshua,8,24,"And it came to pass, when Israel{H3478} had made an end{H3615}{(H8763)} of slaying{H2026}{(H8800)} all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Ai{H5857} in the field{H7704}, in the wilderness{H4057} wherein they chased{H7291}{(H8804)} them, and when they were all fallen{H5307}{(H8799)} on the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}, until they were consumed{H8552}{(H8800)}, that all the Israelites{H3478} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} unto Ai{H5857}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} it with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}."
Joshua,8,25,"And so it was, that all that fell{H5307}{(H8802)} that day{H3117}, both of men{H376} and women{H802}, were twelve{H8147}{H6240} thousand{H505}, even all the men{H582} of Ai{H5857}."
Joshua,8,26,"For Joshua{H3091} drew{H7725} not his hand{H3027} back{H7725}{(H8689)}, wherewith he stretched out{H5186}{(H8804)} the spear{H3591}, until he had utterly destroyed{H2763}{(H8689)} all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Ai{H5857}."
Joshua,8,27,"Only the cattle{H929} and the spoil{H7998} of that city{H5892} Israel{H3478} took for a prey{H962}{(H8804)} unto themselves, according unto the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} which he commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} Joshua{H3091}."
Joshua,8,28,"And Joshua{H3091} burnt{H8313}{(H8799)} Ai{H5857}, and made{H7760}{(H8799)} it an heap{H8510} for ever{H5769}, even a desolation{H8077} unto this day{H3117}."
Joshua,8,29,"And the king{H4428} of Ai{H5857} he hanged{H8518}{(H8804)} on a tree{H6086} until eventide{H6256}{H6153}: and as soon as the sun{H8121} was down{H935}{(H8800)}, Joshua{H3091} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} that they should take{H3381} his carcase{H5038} down{H3381}{(H8686)} from the tree{H6086}, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} it at the entering{H6607} of the gate{H8179} of the city{H5892}, and raise{H6965}{(H8686)} thereon a great{H1419} heap{H1530} of stones{H68}, that remaineth unto this day{H3117}."
Joshua,8,30,"Then Joshua{H3091} built{H1129}{(H8799)} an altar{H4196} unto the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} in mount{H2022} Ebal{H5858},"
Joshua,8,31,"As Moses{H4872} the servant{H5650} of the LORD{H3068} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, as it is written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the law{H8451} of Moses{H4872}, an altar{H4196} of whole{H8003} stones{H68}, over which no man hath lift up{H5130}{(H8689)} any iron{H1270}: and they offered{H5927}{(H8686)} thereon burnt offerings{H5930} unto the LORD{H3068}, and sacrificed{H2076}{(H8799)} peace offerings{H8002}."
Joshua,8,32,"And he wrote{H3789}{(H8799)} there upon the stones{H68} a copy{H4932} of the law{H8451} of Moses{H4872}, which he wrote{H3789}{(H8804)} in the presence{H6440} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}."
Joshua,8,33,"And all Israel{H3478}, and their elders{H2205}, and officers{H7860}{(H8802)}, and their judges{H8199}{(H8802)}, stood{H5975}{(H8802)} on this side the ark{H727} and on that side before the priests{H3548} the Levites{H3881}, which bare{H5375}{(H8802)} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068}, as well the stranger{H1616}, as he that was born{H249} among them; half{H2677} of them over{H413} against{H4136} mount{H2022} Gerizim{H1630}, and half{H2677} of them over against{H4136} mount{H2022} Ebal{H5858}; as Moses{H4872} the servant{H5650} of the LORD{H3068} had commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} before{H7223}, that they should bless{H1288}{(H8763)} the people{H5971} of Israel{H3478}."
Joshua,8,34,"And afterward{H310} he read{H7121}{(H8804)} all the words{H1697} of the law{H8451}, the blessings{H1293} and cursings{H7045}, according to all that is written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the law{H8451}."
Joshua,8,35,"There was not a word{H1697} of all that Moses{H4872} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}, which Joshua{H3091} read{H7121}{(H8804)} not before all the congregation{H6951} of Israel{H3478}, with the women{H802}, and the little ones{H2945}, and the strangers{H1616} that were conversant{H1980}{(H8802)} among{H7130} them."
Joshua,9,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings{H4428} which were on this side{H5676} Jordan{H3383}, in the hills{H2022}, and in the valleys{H8219}, and in all the coasts{H2348} of the great{H1419} sea{H3220} over against{H4136} Lebanon{H3844}, the Hittite{H2850}, and the Amorite{H567}, the Canaanite{H3669}, the Perizzite{H6522}, the Hivite{H2340}, and the Jebusite{H2983}, heard{H8085}{(H8800)} thereof;"
Joshua,9,2,"That they gathered{H6908}{(H8691)} themselves together{H3162}, to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} with Joshua{H3091} and with Israel{H3478}, with one{H259} accord{H6310}."
Joshua,9,3,"And when the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Gibeon{H1391} heard{H8085}{(H8804)} what Joshua{H3091} had done{H6213}{(H8804)} unto Jericho{H3405} and to Ai{H5857},"
Joshua,9,4,"They did work{H6213}{(H8799)} wilily{H6195}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} and made as if they had been ambassadors{H6737}{(H8691)}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} old{H1087} sacks{H8242} upon their asses{H2543}, and wine{H3196} bottles{H4997}, old{H1087}, and rent{H1234}{(H8794)}, and bound up{H6887}{(H8794)};"
Joshua,9,5,"And old{H1087} shoes{H5275} and clouted{H2921}{(H8794)} upon their feet{H7272}, and old{H1087} garments{H8008} upon them; and all the bread{H3899} of their provision{H6718} was dry{H3001}{(H8804)} and mouldy{H5350}."
Joshua,9,6,"And they went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Joshua{H3091} unto the camp{H4264} at Gilgal{H1537}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, and to the men{H376} of Israel{H3478}, We be come{H935}{(H8804)} from a far{H7350} country{H776}: now therefore make{H3772}{(H8798)} ye a league{H1285} with us."
Joshua,9,7,"And the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the Hivites{H2340}, Peradventure{H194} ye dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} among{H7130} us; and how shall we make{H3772}{(H8799)} a league{H1285} with you?"
Joshua,9,8,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091}, We are thy servants{H5650}. And Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Who are ye? and from whence{H370} come{H935}{(H8799)} ye?"
Joshua,9,9,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, From a very{H3966} far{H7350} country{H776} thy servants{H5650} are come{H935}{(H8804)} because of the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}: for we have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} the fame{H8089} of him, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)} in Egypt{H4714},"
Joshua,9,10,"And all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)} to the two{H8147} kings{H4428} of the Amorites{H567}, that were beyond{H5676} Jordan{H3383}, to Sihon{H5511} king{H4428} of Heshbon{H2809}, and to Og{H5747} king{H4428} of Bashan{H1316}, which was at Ashtaroth{H6252}."
Joshua,9,11,"Wherefore our elders{H2205} and all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of our country{H776} spake{H559}{(H8799)} to us, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} victuals{H6720} with you{H3027} for the journey{H1870}, and go{H3212}{(H8798)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} them, and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, We are your servants{H5650}: therefore now make{H3772}{(H8798)} ye a league{H1285} with us."
Joshua,9,12,"This our bread{H3899} we took hot{H2525} for our provision{H6679}{(H8694)} out of our houses{H1004} on the day{H3117} we came forth{H3318}{(H8800)} to go{H3212}{(H8800)} unto you; but now, behold, it is dry{H3001}{(H8804)}, and it is mouldy{H5350}:"
Joshua,9,13,"And these bottles{H4997} of wine{H3196}, which we filled{H4390}{(H8765)}, were new{H2319}; and, behold, they be rent{H1234}{(H8694)}: and these our garments{H8008} and our shoes{H5275} are become old{H1086}{(H8804)} by reason of the very{H3966} long{H7230} journey{H1870}."
Joshua,9,14,"And the men{H582} took{H3947}{(H8799)} of their victuals{H6718}, and asked{H7592}{(H8804)} not counsel at the mouth{H6310} of the LORD{H3068}."
Joshua,9,15,"And Joshua{H3091} made{H6213}{(H8799)} peace{H7965} with them, and made{H3772}{(H8799)} a league{H1285} with them, to let them live{H2421}{(H8763)}: and the princes{H5387} of the congregation{H5712} sware{H7650}{(H8735)} unto them."
Joshua,9,16,"And it came to pass at the end{H7097} of three{H7969} days{H3117} after{H310} they had made{H3772}{(H8804)} a league{H1285} with them, that they heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that they were their neighbours{H7138}, and that they dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} among{H7130} them."
Joshua,9,17,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} journeyed{H5265}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} unto their cities{H5892} on the third{H7992} day{H3117}. Now their cities{H5892} were Gibeon{H1391}, and Chephirah{H3716}, and Beeroth{H881}, and Kirjathjearim{H7157}."
Joshua,9,18,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} smote{H5221}{(H8689)} them not, because the princes{H5387} of the congregation{H5712} had sworn{H7650}{(H8738)} unto them by the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}. And all the congregation{H5712} murmured{H3885}{(H8735)} against the princes{H5387}."
Joshua,9,19,"But all the princes{H5387} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto all the congregation{H5712}, We have sworn{H7650}{(H8738)} unto them by the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}: now therefore we may{H3201}{(H8799)} not touch{H5060}{(H8800)} them."
Joshua,9,20,"This we will do{H6213}{(H8799)} to them; we will even let them live{H2421}{(H8687)}, lest wrath{H7110} be upon us, because of the oath{H7621} which we sware{H7650}{(H8738)} unto them."
Joshua,9,21,"And the princes{H5387} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Let them live{H2421}{(H8799)}; but let them be hewers{H2404}{(H8802)} of wood{H6086} and drawers{H7579}{(H8802)} of water{H4325} unto all the congregation{H5712}; as the princes{H5387} had promised{H1696}{(H8765)} them."
Joshua,9,22,"And Joshua{H3091} called{H7121}{(H8799)} for them, and he spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Wherefore have ye beguiled{H7411}{(H8765)} us, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, We are very{H3966} far{H7350} from you; when ye dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} among{H7130} us?"
Joshua,9,23,"Now therefore ye are cursed{H779}{(H8803)}, and there shall none of you be freed{H3772}{(H8735)} from being bondmen{H5650}, and hewers{H2404}{(H8802)} of wood{H6086} and drawers{H7579}{(H8802)} of water{H4325} for the house{H1004} of my God{H430}."
Joshua,9,24,"And they answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Joshua{H3091}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Because it was certainly{H5046}{(H8715)} told{H5046}{(H8717)} thy servants{H5650}, how that the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} his servant{H5650} Moses{H4872} to give{H5414}{(H8800)} you all the land{H776}, and to destroy{H8045}{(H8687)} all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the land{H776} from before{H6440} you, therefore we were sore{H3966} afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} of our lives{H5315} because{H6440} of you, and have done{H6213}{(H8799)} this thing{H1697}."
Joshua,9,25,"And now, behold, we{H2009} are in thine hand{H3027}: as it seemeth{H5869} good{H2896} and right{H3477} unto thee to do{H6213}{(H8800)} unto us, do{H6213}{(H8798)}."
Joshua,9,26,"And so did{H6213}{(H8799)} he unto them, and delivered{H5337}{(H8686)} them out of the hand{H3027} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, that they slew{H2026}{(H8804)} them not."
Joshua,9,27,"And Joshua{H3091} made{H5414}{(H8799)} them that day{H3117} hewers{H2404}{(H8802)} of wood{H6086} and drawers{H7579}{(H8802)} of water{H4325} for the congregation{H5712}, and for the altar{H4196} of the LORD{H3068}, even unto this day{H3117}, in the place{H4725} which he should choose{H977}{(H8799)}."
Joshua,10,1,"Now it came to pass, when Adonizedek{H139} king{H4428} of Jerusalem{H3389} had heard{H8085}{(H8800)} how{H3588} Joshua{H3091} had taken{H3920}{(H8804)} Ai{H5857}, and had utterly destroyed{H2763}{(H8686)} it; as he had done{H6213}{(H8804)} to Jericho{H3405} and her king{H4428}, so he had done{H6213}{(H8804)} to Ai{H5857} and her king{H4428}; and how the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Gibeon{H1391} had made peace{H7999}{(H8689)} with Israel{H3478}, and were among{H7130} them;"
Joshua,10,2,"That they feared{H3372}{(H8799)} greatly{H3966}, because Gibeon{H1391} was a great{H1419} city{H5892}, as one{H259} of the royal{H4467} cities{H5892}, and because it was greater{H1419} than Ai{H5857}, and all the men{H582} thereof were mighty{H1368}."
Joshua,10,3,"Wherefore Adonizedek{H139} king{H4428} of Jerusalem{H3389} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto Hoham{H1944} king{H4428} of Hebron{H2275}, and unto Piram{H6502} king{H4428} of Jarmuth{H3412}, and unto Japhia{H3309} king{H4428} of Lachish{H3923}, and unto Debir{H1688} king{H4428} of Eglon{H5700}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Joshua,10,4,"Come up{H5927}{(H8798)} unto me, and help{H5826}{(H8798)} me, that we may smite{H5221}{(H8686)} Gibeon{H1391}: for it hath made peace{H7999}{(H8689)} with Joshua{H3091} and with the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}."
Joshua,10,5,"Therefore the five{H2568} kings{H4428} of the Amorites{H567}, the king{H4428} of Jerusalem{H3389}, the king{H4428} of Hebron{H2275}, the king{H4428} of Jarmuth{H3412}, the king{H4428} of Lachish{H3923}, the king{H4428} of Eglon{H5700}, gathered themselves together{H622}{(H8735)}, and went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, they and all their hosts{H4264}, and encamped{H2583}{(H8799)} before Gibeon{H1391}, and made war{H3898}{(H8735)} against it."
Joshua,10,6,"And the men{H582} of Gibeon{H1391} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091} to the camp{H4264} to Gilgal{H1537}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Slack{H7503}{(H8686)} not thy hand{H3027} from thy servants{H5650}; come up{H5927}{(H8798)} to us quickly{H4120}, and save{H3467}{(H8685)} us, and help{H5826}{(H8798)} us: for all the kings{H4428} of the Amorites{H567} that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} in the mountains{H2022} are gathered together{H6908}{(H8738)} against us."
Joshua,10,7,"So Joshua{H3091} ascended{H5927}{(H8799)} from Gilgal{H1537}, he, and all the people{H5971} of war{H4421} with him, and all the mighty{H1368} men of valour{H2428}."
Joshua,10,8,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091}, Fear{H3372}{(H8799)} them not: for I have delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} them into thine hand{H3027}; there shall not a man{H376} of them stand{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} thee."
Joshua,10,9,"Joshua{H3091} therefore came{H935}{(H8799)} unto them suddenly{H6597}, and went up{H5927}{(H8804)} from Gilgal{H1537} all night{H3915}."
Joshua,10,10,"And the LORD{H3068} discomfited{H2000}{(H8799)} them before{H6440} Israel{H3478}, and slew{H5221}{(H8686)} them with a great{H1419} slaughter{H4347} at Gibeon{H1391}, and chased{H7291}{(H8799)} them along the way{H1870} that goeth up{H4608} to Bethhoron{H1032}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them to Azekah{H5825}, and unto Makkedah{H4719}."
Joshua,10,11,"And it came to pass, as they fled{H5127}{(H8800)} from before{H6440} Israel{H3478}, and were in the going down{H4174} to Bethhoron{H1032}, that the LORD{H3068} cast down{H7993}{(H8689)} great{H1419} stones{H68} from heaven{H8064} upon them unto Azekah{H5825}, and they died{H4191}{(H8799)}: they were more{H7227} which died{H4191}{(H8804)} with hailstones{H1259}{H68} than they whom{H834} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} slew{H2026}{(H8804)} with the sword{H2719}."
Joshua,10,12,"Then spake{H1696}{(H8762)} Joshua{H3091} to the LORD{H3068} in the day{H3117} when the LORD{H3068} delivered up{H5414}{(H8800)} the Amorites{H567} before{H6440} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, and he said{H559}{(H8799)} in the sight{H5869} of Israel{H3478}, Sun{H8121}, stand thou still{H1826}{(H8798)} upon Gibeon{H1391}; and thou, Moon{H3394}, in the valley{H6010} of Ajalon{H357}."
Joshua,10,13,"And the sun{H8121} stood still{H1826}{(H8799)}, and the moon{H3394} stayed{H5975}{(H8804)}, until the people{H1471} had avenged{H5358}{(H8799)} themselves upon their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}. Is not this{H1931} written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of Jasher{H3477}? So the sun{H8121} stood still{H5975}{(H8799)} in the midst{H2677} of heaven{H8064}, and hasted{H213}{(H8804)} not to go down{H935}{(H8800)} about a whole{H8549} day{H3117}."
Joshua,10,14,"And there was no day{H3117} like that before{H6440} it or after{H310} it, that the LORD{H3068} hearkened{H8085}{(H8800)} unto the voice{H6963} of a man{H376}: for the LORD{H3068} fought{H3898}{(H8737)} for Israel{H3478}."
Joshua,10,15,"And Joshua{H3091} returned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and all Israel{H3478} with him, unto the camp{H4264} to Gilgal{H1537}."
Joshua,10,16,"But these five{H2568} kings{H4428} fled{H5127}{(H8799)}, and hid{H2244}{(H8735)} themselves in a cave{H4631} at Makkedah{H4719}."
Joshua,10,17,"And it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} Joshua{H3091}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The five{H2568} kings{H4428} are found{H4672}{(H8738)} hid{H2244}{(H8737)} in a cave{H4631} at Makkedah{H4719}."
Joshua,10,18,"And Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Roll{H1556}{(H8798)} great{H1419} stones{H68} upon the mouth{H6310} of the cave{H4631}, and set{H6485}{(H8685)} men{H582} by it for to keep{H8104}{(H8800)} them:"
Joshua,10,19,"And stay{H5975}{(H8799)} ye not, but pursue{H7291}{(H8798)} after{H310} your enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, and smite the hindmost{H2179}{(H8765)} of them; suffer{H5414}{(H8799)} them not to enter{H935}{(H8800)} into their cities{H5892}: for the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} hath delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} them into your hand{H3027}."
Joshua,10,20,"And it came to pass, when Joshua{H3091} and the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} had made an end{H3615}{(H8763)} of slaying{H5221}{(H8687)} them with a very{H3966} great{H1419} slaughter{H4347}, till they were consumed{H8552}{(H8800)}, that the rest{H8300} which remained{H8277}{(H8804)} of them entered{H935}{(H8799)} into fenced{H4013} cities{H5892}."
Joshua,10,21,And all the people{H5971} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to the camp{H4264} to Joshua{H3091} at Makkedah{H4719} in peace{H7965}: none moved{H2782}{(H8804)} his tongue{H3956} against any{H376} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}.
Joshua,10,22,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Joshua{H3091}, Open{H6605}{(H8798)} the mouth{H6310} of the cave{H4631}, and bring out{H3318}{(H8685)} those five{H2568} kings{H4428} unto me out of the cave{H4631}."
Joshua,10,23,"And they did{H6213}{(H8799)} so, and brought forth{H3318}{(H8686)} those five{H2568} kings{H4428} unto him out of the cave{H4631}, the king{H4428} of Jerusalem{H3389}, the king{H4428} of Hebron{H2275}, the king{H4428} of Jarmuth{H3412}, the king{H4428} of Lachish{H3923}, and the king{H4428} of Eglon{H5700}."
Joshua,10,24,"And it came to pass, when they brought out{H3318}{(H8687)} those kings{H4428} unto Joshua{H3091}, that Joshua{H3091} called{H7121}{(H8799)} for all the men{H376} of Israel{H3478}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the captains{H7101} of the men{H582} of war{H4421} which went{H1980}{(H8804)} with him, Come near{H7126}{(H8798)}, put{H7760}{(H8798)} your feet{H7272} upon the necks{H6677} of these kings{H4428}. And they came near{H7126}{(H8799)}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} their feet{H7272} upon the necks{H6677} of them."
Joshua,10,25,"And Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not, nor be dismayed{H2865}{(H8735)}, be strong{H2388}{(H8798)} and of good courage{H553}{(H8798)}: for thus shall the LORD{H3068} do{H6213}{(H8799)} to all your enemies{H341}{(H8802)} against whom ye fight{H3898}{(H8737)}."
Joshua,10,26,"And afterward{H310} Joshua{H3091} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them, and slew{H4191}{(H8686)} them, and hanged{H8518}{(H8799)} them on five{H2568} trees{H6086}: and they were hanging{H8518}{(H8803)} upon the trees{H6086} until the evening{H6153}."
Joshua,10,27,"And it came to pass at the time{H6256} of the going down{H935}{(H8800)} of the sun{H8121}, that Joshua{H3091} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}, and they took them down{H3381}{(H8686)} off the trees{H6086}, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} them into the cave{H4631} wherein they had been hid{H2244}{(H8738)}, and laid{H7760}{(H8799)} great{H1419} stones{H68} in the cave's{H4631} mouth{H6310}, which remain until this very{H6106} day{H3117}."
Joshua,10,28,"And that day{H3117} Joshua{H3091} took{H3920}{(H8804)} Makkedah{H4719}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} it with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}, and the king{H4428} thereof he utterly destroyed{H2763}{(H8689)}, them, and all the souls{H5315} that were therein; he let{H7604}{(H8689)} none remain{H8300}: and he did{H6213}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} of Makkedah{H4719} as he did{H6213}{(H8804)} unto the king{H4428} of Jericho{H3405}."
Joshua,10,29,"Then Joshua{H3091} passed{H5674}{(H8799)} from Makkedah{H4719}, and all Israel{H3478} with him, unto Libnah{H3841}, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against Libnah{H3841}:"
Joshua,10,30,"And the LORD{H3068} delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} it also, and the king{H4428} thereof, into the hand{H3027} of Israel{H3478}; and he smote{H5221}{(H8686)} it with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}, and all the souls{H5315} that were therein; he let{H7604}{(H8689)} none remain{H8300} in it; but did{H6213}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428} thereof as he did{H6213}{(H8804)} unto the king{H4428} of Jericho{H3405}."
Joshua,10,31,"And Joshua{H3091} passed{H5674}{(H8799)} from Libnah{H3841}, and all Israel{H3478} with him, unto Lachish{H3923}, and encamped{H2583}{(H8799)} against it, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against it:"
Joshua,10,32,"And the LORD{H3068} delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} Lachish{H3923} into the hand{H3027} of Israel{H3478}, which took{H3920}{(H8799)} it on the second{H8145} day{H3117}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} it with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}, and all the souls{H5315} that were therein, according to all that he had done{H6213}{(H8804)} to Libnah{H3841}."
Joshua,10,33,"Then Horam{H2036} king{H4428} of Gezer{H1507} came up{H5927}{(H8804)} to help{H5826}{(H8800)} Lachish{H3923}; and Joshua{H3091} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} him and his people{H5971}, until he had left{H7604}{(H8689)} him none remaining{H8300}."
Joshua,10,34,"And from Lachish{H3923} Joshua{H3091} passed{H5674}{(H8799)} unto Eglon{H5700}, and all Israel{H3478} with him; and they encamped{H2583}{(H8799)} against it, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against it:"
Joshua,10,35,"And they took{H3920}{(H8799)} it on that day{H3117}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} it with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}, and all the souls{H5315} that were therein he utterly destroyed{H2763}{(H8689)} that day{H3117}, according to all that he had done{H6213}{(H8804)} to Lachish{H3923}."
Joshua,10,36,"And Joshua{H3091} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} from Eglon{H5700}, and all Israel{H3478} with him, unto Hebron{H2275}; and they fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against it:"
Joshua,10,37,"And they took{H3920}{(H8799)} it, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} it with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}, and the king{H4428} thereof, and all the cities{H5892} thereof, and all the souls{H5315} that were therein; he left{H7604}{(H8689)} none remaining{H8300}, according to all that he had done{H6213}{(H8804)} to Eglon{H5700}; but destroyed{H2763}{(H8686)} it utterly, and all the souls{H5315} that were therein."
Joshua,10,38,"And Joshua{H3091} returned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and all Israel{H3478} with him, to Debir{H1688}; and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against it:"

Joshua,10,40,"So Joshua{H3091} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} all the country{H776} of the hills{H2022}, and of the south{H5045}, and of the vale{H8219}, and of the springs{H794}, and all their kings{H4428}: he left{H7604}{(H8689)} none remaining{H8300}, but utterly destroyed{H2763}{(H8689)} all that breathed{H5397}, as the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}."
Joshua,10,41,"And Joshua{H3091} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them from Kadeshbarnea{H6947} even unto Gaza{H5804}, and all the country{H776} of Goshen{H1657}, even unto Gibeon{H1391}."
Joshua,10,42,"And all these kings{H4428} and their land{H776} did Joshua{H3091} take{H3920}{(H8804)} at one{H259} time{H6471}, because the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} fought{H3898}{(H8737)} for Israel{H3478}."
Joshua,10,43,"And Joshua{H3091} returned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and all Israel{H3478} with him, unto the camp{H4264} to Gilgal{H1537}."
Joshua,11,1,"And it came to pass, when Jabin{H2985} king{H4428} of Hazor{H2674} had heard{H8085}{(H8800)} those things, that he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Jobab{H3103} king{H4428} of Madon{H4068}, and to the king{H4428} of Shimron{H8110}, and to the king{H4428} of Achshaph{H407},"

Joshua,11,4,"And they went out{H3318}{(H8799)}, they and all their hosts{H4264} with them, much{H7227} people{H5971}, even as the sand{H2344} that is upon the sea{H3220} shore{H8193} in multitude{H7230}, with horses{H5483} and chariots{H7393} very{H3966} many{H7227}."
Joshua,11,5,"And when all these kings{H4428} were met together{H3259}{(H8735)}, they came{H935}{(H8799)} and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} together{H3162} at the waters{H4325} of Merom{H4792}, to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} against Israel{H3478}."

Joshua,11,18,Joshua{H3091} made{H6213}{(H8804)} war{H4421} a long{H7227} time{H3117} with all those kings{H4428}.

Joshua,11,22,"There was none of the Anakims{H6062} left{H3498}{(H8738)} in the land{H776} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}: only in Gaza{H5804}, in Gath{H1661}, and in Ashdod{H795}, there remained{H7604}{(H8738)}."
Joshua,11,23,"So Joshua{H3091} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the whole land{H776}, according to all that the LORD{H3068} said{H1696}{(H8765)} unto Moses{H4872}; and Joshua{H3091} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} it for an inheritance{H5159} unto Israel{H3478} according to their divisions{H4256} by their tribes{H7626}.

Joshua,13,30,"And their coast{H1366} was from Mahanaim{H4266}, all Bashan{H1316}, all the kingdom{H4468} of Og{H5747} king{H4428} of Bashan{H1316}, and all the towns{H2333} of Jair{H2971}, which are in Bashan{H1316}, threescore{H8346} cities{H5892}:"
Joshua,13,31,"And half{H2677} Gilead{H1568}, and Ashtaroth{H6252}, and Edrei{H154}, cities{H5892} of the kingdom{H4468} of Og{H5747} in Bashan{H1316}, were pertaining unto the children{H1121} of Machir{H4353} the son{H1121} of Manasseh{H4519}, even to the one half{H2677} of the children{H1121} of Machir{H4353} by their families{H4940}."
Joshua,13,32,"These are the countries which Moses{H4872} did distribute for inheritance{H5157}{(H8765)} in the plains{H6160} of Moab{H4124}, on the other side{H5676} Jordan{H3383}, by Jericho{H3405}, eastward{H4217}."
Joshua,13,33,"But unto the tribe{H7626} of Levi{H3878} Moses{H4872} gave{H5414}{(H8804)} not any inheritance{H5159}: the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} was their inheritance{H5159}, as he said{H1696}{(H8765)} unto them."
Joshua,14,1,"And these are the countries which the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} inherited{H5157}{(H8804)} in the land{H776} of Canaan{H3667}, which Eleazar{H499} the priest{H3548}, and Joshua{H3091} the son{H1121} of Nun{H5126}, and the heads{H7218} of the fathers{H1} of the tribes{H4294} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, distributed for inheritance{H5157}{(H8765)} to them."
Joshua,14,2,"By lot{H1486} was their inheritance{H5159}, as the LORD{H3068} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} by the hand{H3027} of Moses{H4872}, for the nine{H8672} tribes{H4294}, and for the half{H2677} tribe{H4294}."
Joshua,14,3,For Moses{H4872} had given{H5414}{(H8804)} the inheritance{H5159} of two{H8147} tribes{H4294} and an half{H2677} tribe{H4294} on the other side{H5676} Jordan{H3383}: but unto the Levites{H3881} he gave{H5414}{(H8804)} none inheritance{H5159} among{H8432} them.
Joshua,14,4,"For the children{H1121} of Joseph{H3130} were two{H8147} tribes{H4294}, Manasseh{H4519} and Ephraim{H669}: therefore they gave{H5414}{(H8804)} no part{H2506} unto the Levites{H3881} in the land{H776}, save cities{H5892} to dwell{H3427}{(H8800)} in, with their suburbs{H4054} for their cattle{H4735} and for their substance{H7075}."
Joshua,14,5,"As the LORD{H3068} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} Moses{H4872}, so the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} did{H6213}{(H8804)}, and they divided{H2505}{(H8799)} the land{H776}."
Joshua,14,6,"Then the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} came{H5066}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091} in Gilgal{H1537}: and Caleb{H3612} the son{H1121} of Jephunneh{H3312} the Kenezite{H7074} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} the thing{H1697} that the LORD{H3068} said{H1696}{(H8765)} unto Moses{H4872} the man{H376} of God{H430} concerning me{H182} and thee{H182} in Kadeshbarnea{H6947}."
Joshua,14,7,Forty{H705} years{H8141} old{H1121} was I when Moses{H4872} the servant{H5650} of the LORD{H3068} sent{H7971}{(H8800)} me from Kadeshbarnea{H6947} to espy out{H7270}{(H8763)} the land{H776}; and I brought{H7725} him word{H1697} again{H7725}{(H8686)} as it was in mine heart{H3824}.
Joshua,14,8,Nevertheless my brethren{H251} that went up{H5927}{(H8804)} with me made the heart{H3820} of the people{H5971} melt{H4529}{(H8689)}: but I wholly{H4390}{(H8765)} followed{H310} the LORD{H3068} my God{H430}.
Joshua,14,9,"And Moses{H4872} sware{H7650}{(H8735)} on that day{H3117}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Surely the land{H776} whereon thy feet{H7272} have trodden{H1869}{(H8804)} shall be thine inheritance{H5159}, and thy children's{H1121} for{H5704} ever{H5769}, because thou hast wholly{H4390}{(H8765)} followed{H310} the LORD{H3068} my God{H430}."
Joshua,14,10,"And now, behold, the LORD{H3068} hath kept me alive{H2421}{(H8689)}, as he said{H1696}{(H8765)}, these forty{H705} and five{H2568} years{H8141}, even since{H227} the LORD{H3068} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} this word{H1697} unto Moses{H4872}, while the children of Israel{H3478} wandered{H1980}{(H8804)} in the wilderness{H4057}: and now, lo, I am this day{H3117} fourscore{H8084} and five{H2568} years{H8141} old{H1121}."
Joshua,14,11,"As yet I am as strong{H2389} this day{H3117} as I was in the day{H3117} that Moses{H4872} sent{H7971}{(H8800)} me: as my strength{H3581} was then, even so is my strength{H3581} now, for war{H4421}, both to go out{H3318}{(H8800)}, and to come in{H935}{(H8800)}."
Joshua,14,12,"Now therefore give{H5414}{(H8798)} me this mountain{H2022}, whereof the LORD{H3068} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} in that day{H3117}; for thou heardest{H8085}{(H8804)} in that day{H3117} how the Anakims{H6062} were there, and that the cities{H5892} were great{H1419} and fenced{H1219}{(H8803)}: if so be{H194} the LORD{H3068} will be with{H854} me, then I shall be able to drive them out{H3423}{(H8689)}, as the LORD{H3068} said{H1696}{(H8765)}."
Joshua,14,13,"And Joshua{H3091} blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} him, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} unto Caleb{H3612} the son{H1121} of Jephunneh{H3312} Hebron{H2275} for an inheritance{H5159}."
Joshua,14,14,"Hebron{H2275} therefore became the inheritance{H5159} of Caleb{H3612} the son{H1121} of Jephunneh{H3312} the Kenezite{H7074} unto this day{H3117}, because that he wholly{H4390}{(H8765)} followed{H310} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}."
Joshua,14,15,And the name{H8034} of Hebron{H2275} before{H6440} was Kirjatharba{H7153}; which Arba was a great{H1419} man{H120} among the Anakims{H6062}. And the land{H776} had rest{H8252}{(H8804)} from war{H4421}.
Joshua,15,1,This then was the lot{H1486} of the tribe{H4294} of the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} by their families{H4940}; even to the border{H1366} of Edom{H123} the wilderness{H4057} of Zin{H6790} southward{H5045} was the uttermost part{H7097} of the south coast{H8486}.
Joshua,15,2,"And their south{H5045} border{H1366} was from the shore{H7097} of the salt{H4417} sea{H3220}, from the bay{H3956} that looketh{H6437}{(H8802)} southward{H5045}:"
Joshua,15,3,"And it went out{H3318}{(H8804)} to the south side{H5045} to Maalehacrabbim{H4610}, and passed{H5674}{(H8804)} along to Zin{H6790}, and ascended up{H5927}{(H8804)} on the south side{H5045} unto Kadeshbarnea{H6947}, and passed{H5674}{(H8804)} along to Hezron{H2696}, and went up{H5927}{(H8804)} to Adar{H146}, and fetched a compass{H5437}{(H8738)} to Karkaa{H7173}:"
Joshua,15,4,"From thence it passed{H5674}{(H8804)} toward Azmon{H6111}, and went out{H3318}{(H8804)} unto the river{H5158} of Egypt{H4714}; and the goings out{H8444} of that coast{H1366} were at the sea{H3220}: this shall be your south{H5045} coast{H1366}."
Joshua,15,5,"And the east{H6924} border{H1366} was the salt{H4417} sea{H3220}, even unto the end{H7097} of Jordan{H3383}. And their border{H1366} in the north{H6828} quarter{H6285} was from the bay{H3956} of the sea{H3220} at the uttermost part{H7097} of Jordan{H3383}:"
Joshua,15,6,"And the border{H1366} went up{H5927}{(H8804)} to Bethhogla{H1031}, and passed{H5674}{(H8804)} along by the north{H6828} of Betharabah{H1026}; and the border{H1366} went up{H5927}{(H8804)} to the stone{H68} of Bohan{H932} the son{H1121} of Reuben{H7205}:"
Joshua,15,7,"And the border{H1366} went up{H5927}{(H8804)} toward Debir{H1688} from the valley{H6010} of Achor{H5911}, and so northward{H6828}, looking{H6437}{(H8802)} toward Gilgal{H1537}, that is before{H5227} the going up{H4608} to Adummim{H131}, which is on the south side{H5045} of the river{H5158}: and the border{H1366} passed{H5674}{(H8804)} toward the waters{H4325} of Enshemesh{H5885}, and the goings out{H8444} thereof were at Enrogel{H5883}:"
Joshua,15,8,"And the border{H1366} went up{H5927}{(H8804)} by the valley{H1516} of the son{H1121} of Hinnom{H2011} unto the south{H5045} side{H3802} of the Jebusite{H2983}; the same is Jerusalem{H3389}: and the border{H1366} went up{H5927}{(H8804)} to the top{H7218} of the mountain{H2022} that lieth before{H6440} the valley{H1516} of Hinnom{H2011} westward{H3220}, which is at the end{H7097} of the valley{H6010} of the giants{H7497} northward{H6828}:"
Joshua,15,9,"And the border{H1366} was drawn{H8388}{(H8804)} from the top{H7218} of the hill{H2022} unto the fountain{H4599} of the water{H4325} of Nephtoah{H5318}, and went out{H3318}{(H8804)} to the cities{H5892} of mount{H2022} Ephron{H6085}; and the border{H1366} was drawn{H8388}{(H8804)} to Baalah{H1173}, which is Kirjathjearim{H7157}:"
Joshua,15,10,"And the border{H1366} compassed{H5437}{(H8738)} from Baalah{H1173} westward{H3220} unto mount{H2022} Seir{H8165}, and passed{H5674}{(H8804)} along unto the side{H3802} of mount{H2022} Jearim{H3297}, which is Chesalon{H3693}, on the north side{H6828}, and went down{H3381}{(H8804)} to Bethshemesh{H1053}, and passed on{H5674}{(H8804)} to Timnah{H8553}:"
Joshua,15,11,"And the border{H1366} went out{H3318}{(H8804)} unto the side{H3802} of Ekron{H6138} northward{H6828}: and the border{H1366} was drawn{H8388}{(H8804)} to Shicron{H7942}, and passed along{H5674}{(H8804)} to mount{H2022} Baalah{H1173}, and went out{H3318}{(H8804)} unto Jabneel{H2995}; and the goings out{H8444} of the border{H1366} were at the sea{H3220}."
Joshua,15,12,"And the west{H3220} border{H1366} was to the great{H1419} sea{H3220}, and the coast{H1366} thereof. This is the coast{H1366} of the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} round about{H5439} according to their families{H4940}."
Joshua,15,13,"And unto Caleb{H3612} the son{H1121} of Jephunneh{H3312} he gave{H5414}{(H8804)} a part{H2506} among{H8432} the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063}, according{H413} to the commandment{H6310} of the LORD{H3068} to Joshua{H3091}, even the city{H7151} of Arba{H704}{(H8677)}{H7153} the father{H1} of Anak{H6061}, which city is Hebron{H2275}."
Joshua,15,14,"And Caleb{H3612} drove{H3423}{(H8686)} thence the three{H7969} sons{H1121} of Anak{H6061}, Sheshai{H8344}, and Ahiman{H289}, and Talmai{H8526}, the children{H3211} of Anak{H6061}."
Joshua,15,15,And he went up{H5927}{(H8799)} thence to the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Debir{H1688}: and the name{H8034} of Debir{H1688} before{H6440} was Kirjathsepher{H7158}.
Joshua,15,16,"And Caleb{H3612} said{H559}{(H8799)}, He that smiteth{H5221}{(H8686)} Kirjathsepher{H7158}, and taketh{H3920}{(H8804)} it, to him will I give{H5414}{(H8804)} Achsah{H5915} my daughter{H1323} to wife{H802}."
Joshua,15,17,"And Othniel{H6274} the son{H1121} of Kenaz{H7073}, the brother{H251} of Caleb{H3612}, took{H3920}{(H8799)} it: and he gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him Achsah{H5915} his daughter{H1323} to wife{H802}."
Joshua,15,18,"And it came to pass, as she came{H935}{(H8800)} unto him, that she moved{H5496}{(H8686)} him to ask{H7592}{(H8800)} of her father{H1} a field{H7704}: and she lighted off{H6795}{(H8799)} her ass{H2543}; and Caleb{H3612} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, What wouldest thou?"
Joshua,15,19,"Who answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} me a blessing{H1293}; for thou hast given{H5414}{(H8804)} me a south{H5045} land{H776}; give{H5414}{(H8804)} me also springs{H1543} of water{H4325}.

Joshua,15,62,"And Nibshan{H5044}, and the city of Salt{H5898}, and Engedi{H5872}; six{H8337} cities{H5892} with their villages{H2691}."
Joshua,15,63,"As for the Jebusites{H2983} the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}, the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} could{H3201}{(H8804)}{(H8675)}{H3201}{(H8799)} not drive them out{H3423}{(H8687)}: but the Jebusites{H2983} dwell{H3427}{(H8799)} with the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} at Jerusalem{H3389} unto this day{H3117}."
Joshua,16,1,"And the lot{H1486} of the children{H1121} of Joseph{H3130} fell{H3318}{(H8799)} from Jordan{H3383} by Jericho{H3405}, unto the water{H4325} of Jericho{H3405} on the east{H4217}, to the wilderness{H4057} that goeth up{H5927}{(H8802)} from Jericho{H3405} throughout mount{H2022} Bethel{H1008},"
Joshua,16,2,"And goeth out{H3318}{(H8804)} from Bethel{H1008} to Luz{H3870}, and passeth along{H5674}{(H8804)} unto the borders{H1366} of Archi{H757} to Ataroth{H5852},"
Joshua,16,3,"And goeth down{H3381}{(H8804)} westward{H3220} to the coast{H1366} of Japhleti{H3311}, unto the coast{H1366} of Bethhoron{H1032} the nether{H8481}, and to Gezer{H1507}: and the goings out{H8444} thereof are at the sea{H3220}."
Joshua,16,4,"So the children{H1121} of Joseph{H3130}, Manasseh{H4519} and Ephraim{H669}, took their inheritance{H5157}{(H8799)}."
Joshua,16,5,"And the border{H1366} of the children{H1121} of Ephraim{H669} according to their families{H4940} was thus: even the border{H1366} of their inheritance{H5159} on the east side{H4217} was Atarothaddar{H5853}, unto Bethhoron{H1032} the upper{H5945};"
Joshua,16,6,"And the border{H1366} went out{H3318}{(H8804)} toward the sea{H3220} to Michmethah{H4366} on the north side{H6828}; and the border{H1366} went about{H5437}{(H8738)} eastward{H4217} unto Taanathshiloh{H8387}, and passed{H5674}{(H8804)} by it on the east{H4217} to Janohah{H3239};"
Joshua,16,7,"And it went down{H3381}{(H8804)} from Janohah{H3239} to Ataroth{H5852}, and to Naarath{H5292}, and came{H6293}{(H8804)} to Jericho{H3405}, and went out{H3318}{(H8804)} at Jordan{H3383}."
Joshua,16,8,The border{H1366} went out{H3212}{(H8799)} from Tappuah{H8599} westward{H3220} unto the river{H5158} Kanah{H7071}; and the goings out{H8444} thereof were at the sea{H3220}. This is the inheritance{H5159} of the tribe{H4294} of the children{H1121} of Ephraim{H669} by their families{H4940}.
Joshua,16,9,"And the separate{H3995} cities{H5892} for the children{H1121} of Ephraim{H669} were among{H8432} the inheritance{H5159} of the children{H1121} of Manasseh{H4519}, all the cities{H5892} with their villages{H2691}."
Joshua,16,10,"And they drave not out{H3423}{(H8689)} the Canaanites{H3669} that dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} in Gezer{H1507}: but the Canaanites{H3669} dwell{H3427}{(H8799)} among{H7130} the Ephraimites{H669} unto this day{H3117}, and serve{H5647}{(H8802)} under tribute{H4522}."
Joshua,17,1,"There was also a lot{H1486} for the tribe{H4294} of Manasseh{H4519}; for he was the firstborn{H1060} of Joseph{H3130}; to wit, for Machir{H4353} the firstborn{H1060} of Manasseh{H4519}, the father{H1} of Gilead{H1568}: because he was a man{H376} of war{H4421}, therefore he had Gilead{H1568} and Bashan{H1316}."
Joshua,17,2,"There was also a lot for the rest{H3498}{(H8737)} of the children{H1121} of Manasseh{H4519} by their families{H4940}; for the children{H1121} of Abiezer{H44}, and for the children{H1121} of Helek{H2507}, and for the children{H1121} of Asriel{H844}, and for the children{H1121} of Shechem{H7928}, and for the children{H1121} of Hepher{H2660}, and for the children{H1121} of Shemida{H8061}: these were the male{H2145} children{H1121} of Manasseh{H4519} the son{H1121} of Joseph{H3130} by their families{H4940}."
Joshua,17,3,"But Zelophehad{H6765}, the son{H1121} of Hepher{H2660}, the son{H1121} of Gilead{H1568}, the son{H1121} of Machir{H4353}, the son{H1121} of Manasseh{H4519}, had no sons{H1121}, but daughters{H1323}: and these are the names{H8034} of his daughters{H1323}, Mahlah{H4244}, and Noah{H5270}, Hoglah{H2295}, Milcah{H4435}, and Tirzah{H8656}."
Joshua,17,4,"And they came near{H7126}{(H8799)} before{H6440} Eleazar{H499} the priest{H3548}, and before{H6440} Joshua{H3091} the son{H1121} of Nun{H5126}, and before{H6440} the princes{H5387}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The LORD{H3068} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} Moses{H4872} to give{H5414}{(H8800)} us an inheritance{H5159} among{H8432} our brethren{H251}. Therefore according to the commandment{H6310} of the LORD{H3068} he gave{H5414}{(H8799)} them an inheritance{H5159} among{H8432} the brethren{H251} of their father{H1}."
Joshua,17,5,"And there fell{H5307}{(H8799)} ten{H6235} portions{H2256} to Manasseh{H4519}, beside the land{H776} of Gilead{H1568} and Bashan{H1316}, which were on the other side{H5676} Jordan{H3383};"
Joshua,17,6,Because the daughters{H1323} of Manasseh{H4519} had{H5157}{(H8804)} an inheritance{H5159} among{H8432} his sons{H1121}: and the rest{H3498}{(H8737)} of Manasseh's{H4519} sons{H1121} had the land{H776} of Gilead{H1568}.
Joshua,17,7,"And the coast{H1366} of Manasseh{H4519} was from Asher{H836} to Michmethah{H4366}, that lieth before{H6440} Shechem{H7927}; and the border{H1366} went along{H1980}{(H8804)} on the right hand{H3225} unto the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Entappuah{H5887}."
Joshua,17,8,Now Manasseh{H4519} had the land{H776} of Tappuah{H8599}: but Tappuah{H8599} on the border{H1366} of Manasseh{H4519} belonged to the children{H1121} of Ephraim{H669};
Joshua,17,9,"And the coast{H1366} descended{H3381}{(H8804)} unto the river{H5158} Kanah{H7071}, southward{H5045} of the river{H5158}: these cities{H5892} of Ephraim{H669} are among{H8432} the cities{H5892} of Manasseh{H4519}: the coast{H1366} of Manasseh{H4519} also was on the north side{H6828} of the river{H5158}, and the outgoings{H8444} of it were at the sea{H3220}:"
Joshua,17,10,"Southward{H5045} it was Ephraim's{H669}, and northward{H6828} it was Manasseh's{H4519}, and the sea{H3220} is his border{H1366}; and they met together{H6293}{(H8799)} in Asher{H836} on the north{H6828}, and in Issachar{H3485} on the east{H4217}."
Joshua,17,11,"And Manasseh{H4519} had in Issachar{H3485} and in Asher{H836} Bethshean{H1052} and her towns{H1323}, and Ibleam{H2991} and her towns{H1323}, and the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Dor{H1756} and her towns{H1323}, and the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Endor{H5874} and her towns{H1323}, and the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Taanach{H8590} and her towns{H1323}, and the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Megiddo{H4023} and her towns{H1323}, even three{H7969} countries{H5316}."
Joshua,17,12,Yet the children{H1121} of Manasseh{H4519} could{H3201}{(H8804)} not drive out{H3423}{(H8687)} the inhabitants of those cities{H5892}; but the Canaanites{H3669} would{H2974}{(H8686)} dwell{H3427}{(H8800)} in that land{H776}.
Joshua,17,13,"Yet it came to pass, when the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} were waxen strong{H2388}{(H8804)}, that they put{H5414}{(H8799)} the Canaanites{H3669} to tribute{H4522}; but did not utterly{H3423}{(H8687)} drive them out{H3423}{(H8689)}."
Joshua,17,14,"And the children{H1121} of Joseph{H3130} spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto Joshua{H3091}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Why hast thou given{H5414}{(H8804)} me but one{H259} lot{H1486} and one{H259} portion{H2256} to inherit{H5159}, seeing I am a great{H7227} people{H5971}, forasmuch as{H5704} the LORD{H3068} hath blessed{H1288}{(H8765)} me hitherto{H3541}?"
Joshua,17,15,"And Joshua{H3091} answered{H559}{(H8799)} them, If thou be a great{H7227} people{H5971}, then get thee up{H5927}{(H8798)} to the wood{H3293} country, and cut down{H1254}{(H8765)} for thyself there in the land{H776} of the Perizzites{H6522} and of the giants{H7497}, if mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669} be too narrow{H213}{(H8804)} for thee."
Joshua,17,16,"And the children{H1121} of Joseph{H3130} said{H559}{(H8799)}, The hill{H2022} is not enough{H4672}{(H8735)} for us: and all the Canaanites{H3669} that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} in the land{H776} of the valley{H6010} have chariots{H7393} of iron{H1270}, both they who are of Bethshean{H1052} and her towns{H1323}, and they who are of the valley{H6010} of Jezreel{H3157}."
Joshua,17,17,"And Joshua{H3091} spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto the house{H1004} of Joseph{H3130}, even to Ephraim{H669} and to Manasseh{H4519}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thou art a great{H7227} people{H5971}, and hast great{H1419} power{H3581}: thou shalt not have one{H259} lot{H1486} only:"
Joshua,17,18,"But the mountain{H2022} shall be thine; for it is a wood{H3293}, and thou shalt cut it down{H1254}{(H8765)}: and the outgoings{H8444} of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out{H3423}{(H8686)} the Canaanites{H3669}, though they have iron{H1270} chariots{H7393}, and though they be strong{H2389}."
Joshua,18,1,"And the whole congregation{H5712} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} assembled together{H6950}{(H8735)} at Shiloh{H7887}, and set up{H7931}{(H8686)} the tabernacle{H168} of the congregation{H4150} there. And the land{H776} was subdued{H3533}{(H8738)} before{H6440} them."
Joshua,18,2,"And there remained{H3498}{(H8735)} among the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} seven{H7651} tribes{H7626}, which had not yet received{H2505}{(H8804)} their inheritance{H5159}."
Joshua,18,3,"And Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, How long are ye slack{H7503}{(H8693)} to go{H935}{(H8800)} to possess{H3423}{(H8800)} the land{H776}, which the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of your fathers{H1} hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} you?"
Joshua,18,4,"Give out{H3051}{(H8798)} from among you three{H7969} men{H582} for each tribe{H7626}: and I will send{H7971}{(H8799)} them, and they shall rise{H6965}{(H8799)}, and go{H1980}{(H8691)} through the land{H776}, and describe{H3789}{(H8799)} it according{H6310} to the inheritance{H5159} of them; and they shall come{H935}{(H8799)} again to me."
Joshua,18,5,"And they shall divide{H2505}{(H8694)} it into seven{H7651} parts{H2506}: Judah{H3063} shall abide{H5975}{(H8799)} in their coast{H1366} on the south{H5045}, and the house{H1004} of Joseph{H3130} shall abide{H5975}{(H8799)} in their coasts{H1366} on the north{H6828}."
Joshua,18,6,"Ye shall therefore describe{H3789}{(H8799)} the land{H776} into seven{H7651} parts{H2506}, and bring{H935}{(H8689)} the description hither to me, that I may cast{H3384}{(H8804)} lots{H1486} for you here before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}."
Joshua,18,7,"But the Levites{H3881} have no part{H2506} among{H7130} you; for the priesthood{H3550} of the LORD{H3068} is their inheritance{H5159}: and Gad{H1410}, and Reuben{H7205}, and half{H2677} the tribe{H7626} of Manasseh{H4519}, have received{H3947}{(H8804)} their inheritance{H5159} beyond{H5676} Jordan{H3383} on the east{H4217}, which Moses{H4872} the servant{H5650} of the LORD{H3068} gave{H5414}{(H8804)} them."
Joshua,18,8,"And the men{H582} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went away{H3212}{(H8799)}: and Joshua{H3091} charged{H6680}{(H8762)} them that went{H1980}{(H8802)} to describe{H3789}{(H8800)} the land{H776}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} and walk{H1980}{(H8690)} through the land{H776}, and describe{H3789}{(H8798)} it, and come again{H7725}{(H8798)} to me, that I may here cast{H7993}{(H8686)} lots{H1486} for you before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} in Shiloh{H7887}."
Joshua,18,9,"And the men{H582} went{H3212}{(H8799)} and passed through{H5674}{(H8799)} the land{H776}, and described{H3789}{(H8799)} it by cities{H5892} into seven{H7651} parts{H2506} in a book{H5612}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} again to Joshua{H3091} to the host{H4264} at Shiloh{H7887}."
Joshua,18,10,And Joshua{H3091} cast{H7993}{(H8686)} lots{H1486} for them in Shiloh{H7887} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}: and there Joshua{H3091} divided{H2505}{(H8762)} the land{H776} unto the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} according to their divisions{H4256}.
Joshua,18,11,And the lot{H1486} of the tribe{H4294} of the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} came up{H5927}{(H8799)} according to their families{H4940}: and the coast{H1366} of their lot{H1486} came forth{H3318}{(H8799)} between the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} and the children{H1121} of Joseph{H3130}.
Joshua,18,12,"And their border{H1366} on the north{H6828} side{H6285} was from Jordan{H3383}; and the border{H1366} went up{H5927}{(H8804)} to the side{H3802} of Jericho{H3405} on the north{H6828} side, and went up{H5927}{(H8804)} through the mountains{H2022} westward{H3220}; and the goings out{H8444} thereof were at the wilderness{H4057} of Bethaven{H1007}."
Joshua,18,13,"And the border{H1366} went over{H5674}{(H8804)} from thence toward Luz{H3870}, to the side{H3802} of Luz{H3870}, which is Bethel{H1008}, southward{H5045}; and the border{H1366} descended{H3381}{(H8804)} to Atarothadar{H5853}, near the hill{H2022} that lieth on the south side{H5045} of the nether{H8481} Bethhoron{H1032}."
Joshua,18,14,"And the border{H1366} was drawn{H8388}{(H8804)} thence, and compassed{H5437}{(H8738)} the corner{H6285} of the sea{H3220} southward{H5045}, from the hill{H2022} that lieth before{H6440} Bethhoron{H1032} southward{H5045}; and the goings out{H8444} thereof were at Kirjathbaal{H7154}, which is Kirjathjearim{H7157}, a city{H5892} of the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063}: this was the west{H3220} quarter{H6285}."
Joshua,18,15,"And the south{H5045} quarter{H6285} was from the end{H7097} of Kirjathjearim{H7157}, and the border{H1366} went out{H3318}{(H8804)} on the west{H3220}, and went out{H3318}{(H8804)} to the well{H4599} of waters{H4325} of Nephtoah{H5318}:"
Joshua,18,16,"And the border{H1366} came down{H3381}{(H8804)} to the end{H7097} of the mountain{H2022} that lieth before{H6440} the valley{H1516} of the son{H1121} of Hinnom{H2011}, and which is in the valley{H6010} of the giants{H7497} on the north{H6828}, and descended{H3381}{(H8804)} to the valley{H1516} of Hinnom{H2011}, to the side{H3802} of Jebusi{H2983} on the south{H5045}, and descended{H3381}{(H8804)} to Enrogel{H5883},"

Joshua,18,19,And the border{H1366} passed along{H5674}{(H8804)} to the side{H3802} of Bethhoglah{H1031} northward{H6828}: and the outgoings{H8444} of the border{H1366} were at the north{H6828} bay{H3956} of the salt{H4417} sea{H3220} at the south{H5045} end{H7097} of Jordan{H3383}: this was the south{H5045} coast{H1366}.

Joshua,22,31,"And Phinehas{H6372} the son{H1121} of Eleazar{H499} the priest{H3548} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the children{H1121} of Reuben{H7205}, and to the children{H1121} of Gad{H1410}, and to the children{H1121} of Manasseh{H4519}, This day{H3117} we perceive{H3045}{(H8804)} that the LORD{H3068} is among{H8432} us, because ye have not committed{H4603}{(H8804)} this trespass{H4604} against the LORD{H3068}: now{H227} ye have delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} out of the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068}."
Joshua,22,32,"And Phinehas{H6372} the son{H1121} of Eleazar{H499} the priest{H3548}, and the princes{H5387}, returned{H7725}{(H8799)} from the children{H1121} of Reuben{H7205}, and from the children{H1121} of Gad{H1410}, out of the land{H776} of Gilead{H1568}, unto the land{H776} of Canaan{H3667}, to the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, and brought{H7725} them word{H1697} again{H7725}{(H8686)}."
Joshua,22,33,"And the thing{H1697} pleased{H3190}{(H8799)}{H5869} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}; and the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} God{H430}, and did not intend{H559}{(H8804)} to go up{H5927}{(H8800)} against them in battle{H6635}, to destroy{H7843}{(H8763)} the land{H776} wherein the children{H1121} of Reuben{H7205} and Gad{H1410} dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)}."
Joshua,22,34,And the children{H1121} of Reuben{H7205} and the children{H1121} of Gad{H1410} called{H7121}{(H8799)} the altar{H4196} Ed: for it shall be a witness{H5707} between us that the LORD{H3068} is God{H430}.
Joshua,23,1,"And it came to pass a long{H7227} time{H3117} after{H310} that the LORD{H3068} had given rest{H5117}{(H8689)} unto Israel{H3478} from all their enemies{H341}{(H8802)} round about{H5439}, that Joshua{H3091} waxed old{H2204}{(H8804)} and stricken{H935}{(H8804)} in age{H3117}."
Joshua,23,2,"And Joshua{H3091} called{H7121}{(H8799)} for all Israel{H3478}, and for their elders{H2205}, and for their heads{H7218}, and for their judges{H8199}{(H8802)}, and for their officers{H7860}{(H8802)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, I am old{H2204}{(H8804)} and stricken{H935}{(H8804)} in age{H3117}:"
Joshua,23,3,And ye have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} all that the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} unto all these nations{H1471} because{H6440} of you; for the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} is he that hath fought{H3898}{(H8737)} for you.
Joshua,23,4,"Behold{H7200}{(H8798)}, I have divided{H5307}{(H8689)} unto you by lot these nations{H1471} that remain{H7604}{(H8737)}, to be an inheritance{H5159} for your tribes{H7626}, from Jordan{H3383}, with all the nations{H1471} that I have cut off{H3772}{(H8689)}, even unto the great{H1419} sea{H3220} westward{H3996}{H8121}."
Joshua,23,5,"And the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, he shall expel{H1920}{(H8799)} them from before{H6440} you, and drive{H3423}{(H8689)} them from out of your sight{H6440}; and ye shall possess{H3423}{(H8804)} their land{H776}, as the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} hath promised{H1696}{(H8765)} unto you."
Joshua,23,6,"Be ye therefore very{H3966} courageous{H2388}{(H8804)} to keep{H8104}{(H8800)} and to do{H6213}{(H8800)} all that is written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the law{H8451} of Moses{H4872}, that ye turn{H5493}{(H8800)} not aside therefrom to the right hand{H3225} or to the left{H8040};"
Joshua,23,7,"That ye come{H935}{(H8800)} not among these nations{H1471}, these that remain{H7604}{(H8737)} among you; neither make mention{H2142}{(H8686)} of the name{H8034} of their gods{H430}, nor cause to swear{H7650}{(H8686)} by them, neither serve{H5647}{(H8799)} them, nor bow{H7812}{(H8691)} yourselves unto them:"
Joshua,23,8,"But cleave{H1692}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, as ye have done{H6213}{(H8804)} unto this day{H3117}."
Joshua,23,9,"For the LORD{H3068} hath driven out{H3423}{(H8686)} from before{H6440} you great{H1419} nations{H1471} and strong{H6099}: but as for you, no man{H376} hath been able to stand{H5975}{(H8804)} before{H6440} you unto this day{H3117}."
Joshua,23,10,"One{H259} man{H376} of you shall chase{H7291}{(H8799)} a thousand{H505}: for the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, he it is that fighteth{H3898}{(H8737)} for you, as he hath promised{H1696}{(H8765)} you."
Joshua,23,11,"Take good{H3966} heed{H8104}{(H8738)} therefore unto yourselves{H5315}, that ye love{H157}{(H8800)} the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}."
Joshua,23,12,"Else if ye do in any wise{H7725}{(H8800)} go back{H7725}{(H8799)}, and cleave{H1692}{(H8804)} unto the remnant{H3499} of these nations{H1471}, even these that remain{H7604}{(H8737)} among you, and shall make marriages{H2859}{(H8694)} with them, and go in{H935}{(H8804)} unto them, and they to you:"
Joshua,23,13,"Know{H3045}{(H8799)} for a certainty{H3045}{(H8800)} that the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} will no more{H3254}{(H8686)} drive out{H3423}{(H8687)} any of these nations{H1471} from before{H6440} you; but they shall be snares{H6341} and traps{H4170} unto you, and scourges{H7850} in your sides{H6654}, and thorns{H6796} in your eyes{H5869}, until ye perish{H6}{(H8800)} from off this good{H2896} land{H127} which the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} you."
Joshua,23,14,"And, behold, this day{H3117} I am going{H1980}{(H8802)} the way{H1870} of all the earth{H776}: and ye know{H3045}{(H8804)} in all your hearts{H3824} and in all your souls{H5315}, that not one{H259} thing{H1697} hath failed{H5307}{(H8804)} of all the good{H2896} things{H1697} which the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} concerning you; all are come to pass{H935}{(H8804)} unto you, and not one{H259} thing{H1697} hath failed{H5307}{(H8804)} thereof."
Joshua,23,15,"Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good{H2896} things{H1697} are come{H935}{(H8804)} upon you, which the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} promised{H1696}{(H8765)} you; so shall the LORD{H3068} bring{H935}{(H8686)} upon you all evil{H7451} things{H1697}, until he have destroyed{H8045}{(H8687)} you from off this good{H2896} land{H127} which the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} you."
Joshua,23,16,"When ye have transgressed{H5674}{(H8800)} the covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, which he commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} you, and have gone{H1980}{(H8804)} and served{H5647}{(H8804)} other{H312} gods{H430}, and bowed{H7812}{(H8694)} yourselves to them; then shall the anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} be kindled{H2734}{(H8804)} against you, and ye shall perish{H6}{(H8804)} quickly{H4120} from off the good{H2896} land{H776} which he hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} unto you."
Joshua,24,1,"And Joshua{H3091} gathered{H622}{(H8799)} all the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478} to Shechem{H7927}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} for the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478}, and for their heads{H7218}, and for their judges{H8199}{(H8802)}, and for their officers{H7860}{(H8802)}; and they presented{H3320}{(H8691)} themselves before{H6440} God{H430}."
Joshua,24,2,"And Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto all the people{H5971}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, Your fathers{H1} dwelt{H3427}{(H8804)} on the other side{H5676} of the flood{H5104} in old time{H5769}, even Terah{H8646}, the father{H1} of Abraham{H85}, and the father{H1} of Nachor{H5152}: and they served{H5647}{(H8799)} other{H312} gods{H430}."
Joshua,24,3,"And I took{H3947}{(H8799)} your father{H1} Abraham{H85} from the other side{H5676} of the flood{H5104}, and led{H3212}{(H8686)} him throughout all the land{H776} of Canaan{H3667}, and multiplied{H7235}{(H8686)} his seed{H2233}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him Isaac{H3327}."
Joshua,24,4,"And I gave{H5414}{(H8799)} unto Isaac{H3327} Jacob{H3290} and Esau{H6215}: and I gave{H5414}{(H8799)} unto Esau{H6215} mount{H2022} Seir{H8165}, to possess{H3423}{(H8800)} it; but Jacob{H3290} and his children{H1121} went down{H3381}{(H8804)} into Egypt{H4714}."
Joshua,24,5,"I sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Moses{H4872} also and Aaron{H175}, and I plagued{H5062}{(H8799)} Egypt{H4714}, according to that which{H834} I did{H6213}{(H8804)} among{H7130} them: and afterward{H310} I brought you out{H3318}{(H8689)}."
Joshua,24,6,And I brought{H3318}{(H8686)} your fathers{H1} out of Egypt{H4714}: and ye came{H935}{(H8799)} unto the sea{H3220}; and the Egyptians{H4714} pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} your fathers{H1} with chariots{H7393} and horsemen{H6571} unto the Red{H5488} sea{H3220}.
Joshua,24,7,"And when they cried{H6817}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}, he put{H7760}{(H8799)} darkness{H3990} between you and the Egyptians{H4713}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} the sea{H3220} upon them, and covered{H3680}{(H8762)} them; and your eyes{H5869} have seen{H7200}{(H8799)} what I have done{H6213}{(H8804)} in Egypt{H4714}: and ye dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in the wilderness{H4057} a long{H7227} season{H3117}."
Joshua,24,8,"And I brought{H935}{(H8686)} you into the land{H776} of the Amorites{H567}, which dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} on the other side{H5676} Jordan{H3383}; and they fought{H3898}{(H8735)} with you: and I gave{H5414}{(H8799)} them into your hand{H3027}, that ye might possess{H3423}{(H8799)} their land{H776}; and I destroyed{H8045}{(H8686)} them from before{H6440} you."
Joshua,24,9,"Then Balak{H1111} the son{H1121} of Zippor{H6834}, king{H4428} of Moab{H4124}, arose{H6965}{(H8799)} and warred{H3898}{(H8735)} against Israel{H3478}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and called{H7121}{(H8799)} Balaam{H1109} the son{H1121} of Beor{H1160} to curse{H7043}{(H8763)} you:"
Joshua,24,10,But I would{H14}{(H8804)} not hearken{H8085}{(H8800)} unto Balaam{H1109}; therefore he blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} you still{H1288}{(H8800)}: so I delivered{H5337}{(H8686)} you out of his hand{H3027}.
Joshua,24,11,"And ye went over{H5674}{(H8799)} Jordan{H3383}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} unto Jericho{H3405}: and the men{H1167} of Jericho{H3405} fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against you, the Amorites{H567}, and the Perizzites{H6522}, and the Canaanites{H3669}, and the Hittites{H2850}, and the Girgashites{H1622}, the Hivites{H2340}, and the Jebusites{H2983}; and I delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} them into your hand{H3027}."
Joshua,24,12,"And I sent{H7971}{(H8799)} the hornet{H6880} before{H6440} you, which drave them out{H1644}{(H8762)} from before{H6440} you, even the two{H8147} kings{H4428} of the Amorites{H567}; but not with thy sword{H2719}, nor with thy bow{H7198}."
Joshua,24,13,"And I have given{H5414}{(H8799)} you a land{H776} for which ye did not labour{H3021}{(H8804)}, and cities{H5892} which ye built{H1129}{(H8804)} not, and ye dwell{H3427}{(H8799)} in them; of the vineyards{H3754} and oliveyards{H2132} which ye planted{H5193}{(H8804)} not do ye eat{H398}{(H8802)}."
Joshua,24,14,"Now therefore fear{H3372}{(H8798)} the LORD{H3068}, and serve{H5647}{(H8798)} him in sincerity{H8549} and in truth{H571}: and put away{H5493}{(H8685)} the gods{H430} which your fathers{H1} served{H5647}{(H8804)} on the other side{H5676} of the flood{H5104}, and in Egypt{H4714}; and serve{H5647}{(H8798)} ye the LORD{H3068}."
Joshua,24,15,"And if it seem evil{H7489}{(H8804)} unto you{H4310} to serve{H5647}{(H8800)} the LORD{H3068}, choose{H977}{(H8798)} you this day{H3117} whom{H5869} ye will serve{H5647}{(H8799)}; whether the gods{H430} which your fathers{H1} served{H5647}{(H8804)} that were on the other side{H5676} of the flood{H5104}, or the gods{H430} of the Amorites{H567}, in whose land{H776} ye dwell{H3427}{(H8802)}: but as for me and my house{H1004}, we will serve{H5647}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}."
Joshua,24,16,"And the people{H5971} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, God forbid{H2486} that we should forsake{H5800}{(H8800)} the LORD{H3068}, to serve{H5647}{(H8800)} other{H312} gods{H430};"
Joshua,24,17,"For the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}, he it is that brought us up{H5927}{(H8688)} and our fathers{H1} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, from the house{H1004} of bondage{H5650}, and which did{H6213}{(H8804)} those great{H1419} signs{H226} in our sight{H5869}, and preserved{H8104}{(H8799)} us in all the way{H1870} wherein we went{H1980}{(H8804)}, and among all the people{H5971} through{H7130} whom we passed{H5674}{(H8804)}:"
Joshua,24,18,"And the LORD{H3068} drave out{H1644}{(H8762)} from before{H6440} us all the people{H5971}, even the Amorites{H567} which dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} in the land{H776}: therefore will we also serve{H5647}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}; for he is our God{H430}."
Joshua,24,19,"And Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the people{H5971}, Ye cannot{H3201}{(H8799)} serve{H5647}{(H8800)} the LORD{H3068}: for he is an holy{H6918} God{H430}; he is a jealous{H7072} God{H410}; he will not forgive{H5375}{(H8799)} your transgressions{H6588} nor your sins{H2403}."
Joshua,24,20,"If ye forsake{H5800}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}, and serve{H5647}{(H8804)} strange{H5236} gods{H430}, then he will turn{H7725}{(H8804)} and do you hurt{H7489}{(H8689)}, and consume{H3615}{(H8765)} you, after{H310} that he hath done you good{H3190}{(H8689)}."
Joshua,24,21,"And the people{H5971} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091}, Nay; but we will serve{H5647}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}."
Joshua,24,22,"And Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the people{H5971}, Ye are witnesses{H5707} against yourselves that ye have chosen{H977}{(H8804)} you the LORD{H3068}, to serve{H5647}{(H8800)} him. And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, We are witnesses{H5707}."
Joshua,24,23,"Now therefore put away{H5493}{(H8685)}, said he, the strange{H5236} gods{H430} which are among{H7130} you, and incline{H5186}{(H8685)} your heart{H3824} unto the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}."
Joshua,24,24,"And the people{H5971} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091}, The LORD{H3068} our God{H430} will we serve{H5647}{(H8799)}, and his voice{H6963} will we obey{H8085}{(H8799)}."
Joshua,24,25,"So Joshua{H3091} made{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285} with the people{H5971} that day{H3117}, and set{H7760}{(H8799)} them a statute{H2706} and an ordinance{H4941} in Shechem{H7927}."
Joshua,24,26,"And Joshua{H3091} wrote{H3789}{(H8799)} these words{H1697} in the book{H5612} of the law{H8451} of God{H430}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} a great{H1419} stone{H68}, and set it up{H6965}{(H8686)} there under an oak{H427}, that was by the sanctuary{H4720} of the LORD{H3068}."
Joshua,24,27,"And Joshua{H3091} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto all the people{H5971}, Behold, this stone{H68} shall be a witness{H5713} unto us; for it hath heard{H8085}{(H8804)} all the words{H561} of the LORD{H3068} which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} unto us: it shall be therefore a witness{H5713} unto you, lest ye deny{H3584}{(H8762)} your God{H430}."
Joshua,24,28,"So Joshua{H3091} let the people{H5971} depart{H7971}{(H8762)}, every man{H376} unto his inheritance{H5159}."
Joshua,24,29,"And it came to pass after{H310} these things{H1697}, that Joshua{H3091} the son{H1121} of Nun{H5126}, the servant{H5650} of the LORD{H3068}, died{H4191}{(H8799)}, being an hundred{H3967} and ten{H6235} years{H8141} old{H1121}."
Joshua,24,30,"And they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him in the border{H1366} of his inheritance{H5159} in Timnathserah{H8556}, which is in mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}, on the north side{H6828} of the hill{H2022} of Gaash{H1608}."
Joshua,24,31,"And Israel{H3478} served{H5647}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} all the days{H3117} of Joshua{H3091}, and all the days{H3117} of the elders{H2205} that overlived{H748}{(H8689)}{H3117}{H310} Joshua{H3091}, and which had known{H3045}{(H8804)} all the works{H4639} of the LORD{H3068}, that he had done{H6213}{(H8804)} for Israel{H3478}."
Joshua,24,32,"And the bones{H6106} of Joseph{H3130}, which the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} brought up{H5927}{(H8689)} out of Egypt{H4714}, buried{H6912}{(H8804)} they in Shechem{H7927}, in a parcel{H2513} of ground{H7704} which Jacob{H3290} bought{H7069}{(H8804)} of the sons{H1121} of Hamor{H2544} the father{H1} of Shechem{H7927} for an hundred{H3967} pieces of silver{H7192}: and it became the inheritance{H5159} of the children{H1121} of Joseph{H3130}."
Joshua,24,33,"And Eleazar{H499} the son{H1121} of Aaron{H175} died{H4191}{(H8804)}; and they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him in a hill{H1389} that pertained to Phinehas{H6372} his son{H1121}, which was given{H5414}{(H8738)} him in mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}."
Judges,1,1,"Now after{H310} the death{H4194} of Joshua{H3091} it came to pass, that the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} asked{H7592}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Who shall go up{H5927}{(H8799)} for us against the Canaanites{H3669} first{H8462}, to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} against them?"
Judges,1,2,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Judah{H3063} shall go up{H5927}{(H8799)}: behold, I have delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} the land{H776} into his hand{H3027}."
Judges,1,3,"And Judah{H3063} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Simeon{H8095} his brother{H251}, Come up{H5927}{(H8798)} with me into my lot{H1486}, that we may fight{H3898}{(H8735)} against the Canaanites{H3669}; and I likewise will go{H1980}{(H8804)} with thee into thy lot{H1486}. So Simeon{H8095} went{H3212}{(H8799)} with him."
Judges,1,4,And Judah{H3063} went up{H5927}{(H8799)}; and the LORD{H3068} delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} the Canaanites{H3669} and the Perizzites{H6522} into their hand{H3027}: and they slew{H5221}{(H8686)} of them in Bezek{H966} ten{H6235} thousand{H505} men{H376}.
Judges,1,5,"And they found{H4672}{(H8799)} Adonibezek{H137} in Bezek{H966}: and they fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against him, and they slew{H5221}{(H8686)} the Canaanites{H3669} and the Perizzites{H6522}."
Judges,1,6,"But Adonibezek{H137} fled{H5127}{(H8799)}; and they pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} him, and caught{H270}{(H8799)} him, and cut off{H7112}{(H8762)} his thumbs{H931}{H3027} and his great toes{H7272}."
Judges,1,7,"And Adonibezek{H137} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Threescore and ten{H7657} kings{H4428}, having their thumbs{H931}{H3027} and their great toes{H7272} cut off{H7112}{(H8794)}, gathered{H3950}{(H8764)} their meat under my table{H7979}: as I have done{H6213}{(H8804)}, so God{H430} hath requited{H7999}{(H8765)} me. And they brought{H935}{(H8686)} him to Jerusalem{H3389}, and there he died{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Judges,1,8,"Now the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} had fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against Jerusalem{H3389}, and had taken{H3920}{(H8799)} it, and smitten{H5221}{(H8686)} it with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}, and set{H7971}{(H8765)} the city{H5892} on fire{H784}."
Judges,1,9,"And afterward{H310} the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} went down{H3381}{(H8804)} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} against the Canaanites{H3669}, that dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} in the mountain{H2022}, and in the south{H5045}, and in the valley{H8219}."
Judges,1,10,"And Judah{H3063} went{H3212}{(H8799)} against the Canaanites{H3669} that dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} in Hebron{H2275}:(now the name{H8034} of Hebron{H2275} before{H6440} was Kirjatharba{H7153}:) and they slew{H5221}{(H8686)} Sheshai{H8344}, and Ahiman{H289}, and Talmai{H8526}."
Judges,1,11,And from thence he went{H3212}{(H8799)} against the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Debir{H1688}: and the name{H8034} of Debir{H1688} before{H6440} was Kirjathsepher{H7158}:
Judges,1,12,"And Caleb{H3612} said{H559}{(H8799)}, He that smiteth{H5221}{(H8686)} Kirjathsepher{H7158}, and taketh{H3920}{(H8804)} it, to him will I give{H5414}{(H8804)} Achsah{H5915} my daughter{H1323} to wife{H802}."
Judges,1,13,"And Othniel{H6274} the son{H1121} of Kenaz{H7073}, Caleb's{H3612} younger{H6996} brother{H251}, took{H3920}{(H8799)} it: and he gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him Achsah{H5915} his daughter{H1323} to wife{H802}."
Judges,1,14,"And it came to pass, when she came{H935}{(H8800)} to him, that she moved{H5496}{(H8686)} him to ask{H7592}{(H8800)} of her father{H1} a field{H7704}: and she lighted{H6795}{(H8799)} from off her ass{H2543}; and Caleb{H3612} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, What wilt thou?"
Judges,1,15,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Give{H3051}{(H8798)} me a blessing{H1293}: for thou hast given{H5414}{(H8804)} me a south{H5045} land{H776}; give{H5414}{(H8804)} me also springs{H1543} of water{H4325}. And Caleb{H3612} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} her the upper{H5942} springs{H1543} and the nether{H8482} springs{H1543}."
Judges,1,16,"And the children{H1121} of the Kenite{H7017}, Moses{H4872}' father in law{H2859}{(H8802)}, went up{H5927}{(H8804)} out of the city{H5892} of palm trees{H8558}{(H8677)}{H5899} with the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} into the wilderness{H4057} of Judah{H3063}, which lieth in the south{H5045} of Arad{H6166}; and they went{H3212}{(H8799)} and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} among{H854} the people{H5971}."
Judges,1,17,"And Judah{H3063} went{H3212}{(H8799)} with Simeon{H8095} his brother{H251}, and they slew{H5221}{(H8686)} the Canaanites{H3669} that inhabited{H3427}{(H8802)} Zephath{H6857}, and utterly destroyed{H2763}{(H8686)} it. And the name{H8034} of the city{H5892} was called{H7121}{(H8799)} Hormah{H2767}."
Judges,1,18,"Also Judah{H3063} took{H3920}{(H8799)} Gaza{H5804} with the coast{H1366} thereof, and Askelon{H831} with the coast{H1366} thereof, and Ekron{H6138} with the coast{H1366} thereof."
Judges,1,19,"And the LORD{H3068} was with Judah{H3063}; and he drave out{H3423}{(H8686)} the inhabitants of the mountain{H2022}; but could not{H3808} drive out{H3423}{(H8687)} the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the valley{H6010}, because they had chariots{H7393} of iron{H1270}."
Judges,1,20,"And they gave{H5414}{(H8799)} Hebron{H2275} unto Caleb{H3612}, as Moses{H4872} said{H1696}{(H8765)}: and he expelled{H3423}{(H8686)} thence the three{H7969} sons{H1121} of Anak{H6061}."
Judges,1,21,And the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} did not drive out{H3423}{(H8689)} the Jebusites{H2983} that inhabited{H3427}{(H8802)} Jerusalem{H3389}; but the Jebusites{H2983} dwell{H3427}{(H8799)} with the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} in Jerusalem{H3389} unto this day{H3117}.
Judges,1,22,"And the house{H1004} of Joseph{H3130}, they also went up{H5927}{(H8799)} against Bethel{H1008}: and the LORD{H3068} was with them."
Judges,1,23,And the house{H1004} of Joseph{H3130} sent to descry{H8446}{(H8686)} Bethel{H1008}.(Now the name{H8034} of the city{H5892} before{H6440} was Luz{H3870}.)
Judges,1,24,"And the spies{H8104}{(H8802)} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} a man{H376} come forth{H3318}{(H8802)} out of the city{H5892}, and they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Shew{H7200}{(H8685)} us, we pray thee, the entrance{H3996} into the city{H5892}, and we will shew{H6213}{(H8804)} thee mercy{H2617}."
Judges,1,25,"And when he shewed{H7200}{(H8686)} them the entrance{H3996} into the city{H5892}, they smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the city{H5892} with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}; but they let go{H7971}{(H8765)} the man{H376} and all his family{H4940}."

Judges,1,34,And the Amorites{H567} forced{H3905}{(H8799)} the children{H1121} of Dan{H1835} into the mountain{H2022}: for they would not suffer{H5414}{(H8804)} them to come down{H3381}{(H8800)} to the valley{H6010}:
Judges,1,35,"But the Amorites{H567} would{H2974}{(H8686)} dwell{H3427}{(H8800)} in mount{H2022} Heres{H2776} in Aijalon{H357}, and in Shaalbim{H8169}: yet the hand{H3027} of the house{H1004} of Joseph{H3130} prevailed{H3513}{(H8799)}, so that they became tributaries{H4522}."

Judges,2,2,And ye shall make{H3772}{(H8799)} no league{H1285} with the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of this land{H776}; ye shall throw down{H5422}{(H8799)} their altars{H4196}: but ye have not obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} my voice{H6963}: why have ye done{H6213}{(H8804)} this?
Judges,2,3,"Wherefore I also said{H559}{(H8804)}, I will not drive them out{H1644}{(H8762)} from before{H6440} you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides{H6654}, and their gods{H430} shall be a snare{H4170} unto you."

Judges,2,12,"And they forsook{H5800}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of their fathers{H1}, which brought them out{H3318}{(H8688)} of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, and followed{H3212}{(H8799)}{H310} other{H312} gods{H430}, of the gods{H430} of the people{H5971} that were round about{H5439} them, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD{H3068} to anger{H3707}{(H8686)}."
Judges,2,13,"And they forsook{H5800}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}, and served{H5647}{(H8799)} Baal{H1168} and Ashtaroth{H6252}."
Judges,2,14,"And the anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} was hot{H2734}{(H8799)} against Israel{H3478}, and he delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} them into the hands{H3027} of spoilers{H8154}{(H8802)} that spoiled{H8155}{(H8799)} them, and he sold{H4376}{(H8799)} them into the hands{H3027} of their enemies{H341}{(H8802)} round about{H5439}, so that they could{H3201}{(H8804)} not any longer{H5750} stand{H5975}{(H8800)} before{H6440} their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}."

Judges,2,17,"And yet they would not hearken{H8085}{(H8804)} unto their judges{H8199}{(H8802)}, but they went a whoring{H2181}{(H8804)} after{H310} other{H312} gods{H430}, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} themselves unto them: they turned{H5493}{(H8804)} quickly{H4118} out of the way{H1870} which their fathers{H1} walked in{H1980}{(H8804)}, obeying{H8085}{(H8800)} the commandments{H4687} of the LORD{H3068}; but they did{H6213}{(H8804)} not so."
Judges,2,18,"And when the LORD{H3068} raised{H6965}{(H8689)} them up judges{H8199}{(H8802)}, then the LORD{H3068} was with the judge{H8199}{(H8802)}, and delivered{H3467}{(H8689)} them out of the hand{H3027} of their enemies{H341}{(H8802)} all the days{H3117} of the judge{H8199}{(H8802)}: for it repented{H5162}{(H8735)} the LORD{H3068} because{H6440} of their groanings{H5009} by reason of them that oppressed{H3905}{(H8801)} them and vexed{H1766}{(H8802)} them."
Judges,2,19,"And it came to pass, when the judge{H8199}{(H8802)} was dead{H4194}, that they returned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and corrupted{H7843}{(H8689)} themselves more than their fathers{H1}, in following{H3212}{(H8800)}{H310} other{H312} gods{H430} to serve{H5647}{(H8800)} them, and to bow down{H7812}{(H8692)} unto them; they ceased{H5307}{(H8689)} not from their own doings{H4611}, nor from their stubborn{H7186} way{H1870}."
Judges,2,20,"And the anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} was hot{H2734}{(H8799)} against Israel{H3478}; and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Because that this people{H1471} hath transgressed{H5674}{(H8804)} my covenant{H1285} which I commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} their fathers{H1}, and have not hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} unto my voice{H6963};"
Judges,2,21,I also will not henceforth{H3254}{(H8686)} drive out{H3423}{(H8687)} any{H376} from before{H6440} them of the nations{H1471} which Joshua{H3091} left{H5800}{(H8804)} when he died{H4191}{(H8799)}:
Judges,2,22,"That through them I may prove{H5254}{(H8763)} Israel{H3478}, whether they will keep{H8104}{(H8802)} the way{H1870} of the LORD{H3068} to walk{H3212}{(H8800)} therein, as their fathers{H1} did keep{H8104}{(H8804)} it, or not."
Judges,2,23,"Therefore the LORD{H3068} left{H3240}{(H8686)} those nations{H1471}, without{H1115} driving them out{H3423}{(H8687)} hastily{H4118}; neither delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} he them into the hand{H3027} of Joshua{H3091}."
Judges,3,1,"Now these are the nations{H1471} which the LORD{H3068} left{H3240}{(H8689)}, to prove{H5254}{(H8763)} Israel{H3478} by them, even as many of Israel as had not known{H3045}{(H8804)} all the wars{H4421} of Canaan{H3667};"
Judges,3,2,"Only that{H7535} the generations{H1755} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} might know{H3045}{(H8800)}, to teach{H3925}{(H8763)} them war{H4421}, at the least such as before{H6440} knew{H3045}{(H8804)} nothing thereof;"
Judges,3,3,"Namely, five{H2568} lords{H5633} of the Philistines{H6430}, and all the Canaanites{H3669}, and the Sidonians{H6722}, and the Hivites{H2340} that dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} in mount{H2022} Lebanon{H3844}, from mount{H2022} Baalhermon{H1179} unto the entering in{H935}{(H8800)} of Hamath{H2574}."
Judges,3,4,"And they were to prove{H5254}{(H8763)} Israel{H3478} by them, to know{H3045}{(H8800)} whether they would hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} unto the commandments{H4687} of the LORD{H3068}, which he commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} their fathers{H1} by the hand{H3027} of Moses{H4872}."
Judges,3,5,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} dwelt{H3427}{(H8804)} among{H7130} the Canaanites{H3669}, Hittites{H2850}, and Amorites{H567}, and Perizzites{H6522}, and Hivites{H2340}, and Jebusites{H2983}:"
Judges,3,6,"And they took{H3947}{(H8799)} their daughters{H1323} to be their wives{H802}, and gave{H5414}{(H8804)} their daughters{H1323} to their sons{H1121}, and served{H5647}{(H8799)} their gods{H430}."
Judges,3,7,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} did{H6213}{(H8799)} evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, and forgat{H7911}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, and served{H5647}{(H8799)} Baalim{H1168} and the groves{H842}."
Judges,3,8,"Therefore the anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} was hot{H2734}{(H8799)} against Israel{H3478}, and he sold{H4376}{(H8799)} them into the hand{H3027} of Chushanrishathaim{H3573} king{H4428} of Mesopotamia{H763}: and the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} served{H5647}{(H8799)} Chushanrishathaim{H3573} eight{H8083} years{H8141}."
Judges,3,9,"And when the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} cried{H2199}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}, the LORD{H3068} raised up{H6965}{(H8686)} a deliverer{H3467}{(H8688)} to the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, who delivered{H3467}{(H8686)} them, even Othniel{H6274} the son{H1121} of Kenaz{H7073}, Caleb's{H3612} younger{H6996} brother{H251}."
Judges,3,10,"And the Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} came upon him, and he judged{H8199}{(H8799)} Israel{H3478}, and went out{H3318}{(H8799)} to war{H4421}: and the LORD{H3068} delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} Chushanrishathaim{H3573} king{H4428} of Mesopotamia{H763} into his hand{H3027}; and his hand{H3027} prevailed{H5810}{(H8799)} against Chushanrishathaim{H3573}."
Judges,3,11,And the land{H776} had rest{H8252}{(H8799)} forty{H705} years{H8141}. And Othniel{H6274} the son{H1121} of Kenaz{H7073} died{H4191}{(H8799)}.
Judges,3,12,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} did{H6213}{(H8800)} evil{H7451} again{H3254}{(H8686)} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}: and the LORD{H3068} strengthened{H2388}{(H8762)} Eglon{H5700} the king{H4428} of Moab{H4124} against Israel{H3478}, because they had done{H6213}{(H8804)} evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}."
Judges,3,13,"And he gathered{H622}{(H8799)} unto him the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} and Amalek{H6002}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} Israel{H3478}, and possessed{H3423}{(H8799)} the city{H5892} of palm trees{H8558}{(H8677)}{H5899}."
Judges,3,14,So the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} served{H5647}{(H8799)} Eglon{H5700} the king{H4428} of Moab{H4124} eighteen{H8083}{H6240} years{H8141}.
Judges,3,15,"But when the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} cried{H2199}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}, the LORD{H3068} raised them up{H6965}{(H8686)} a deliverer{H3467}{(H8688)}, Ehud{H164} the son{H1121} of Gera{H1617}, a Benjamite{H1145}, a man{H376} lefthanded{H334}{H3225}: and by him{H3027} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} a present{H4503} unto Eglon{H5700} the king{H4428} of Moab{H4124}."
Judges,3,16,"But Ehud{H164} made{H6213}{(H8799)} him a dagger{H2719} which had two{H8147} edges{H6366}, of a cubit{H1574} length{H753}; and he did gird{H2296}{(H8799)} it under his raiment{H4055} upon his right{H3225} thigh{H3409}."
Judges,3,17,And he brought{H7126}{(H8686)} the present{H4503} unto Eglon{H5700} king{H4428} of Moab{H4124}: and Eglon{H5700} was a very{H3966} fat{H1277} man{H376}.
Judges,3,18,"And when he had made an end{H3615}{(H8765)} to offer{H7126}{(H8687)} the present{H4503}, he sent away{H7971}{(H8762)} the people{H5971} that bare{H5375}{(H8802)} the present{H4503}."
Judges,3,19,"But he himself turned again{H7725}{(H8804)} from the quarries{H6456} that were by Gilgal{H1537}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, I have a secret{H5643} errand{H1697} unto thee, O king{H4428}: who said{H559}{(H8799)}, Keep silence{H2013}{(H8761)}. And all that stood{H5975}{(H8802)} by him went out{H3318}{(H8799)} from him."
Judges,3,20,"And Ehud{H164} came{H935}{(H8804)} unto him; and he was sitting{H3427}{(H8802)} in a summer{H4747} parlour{H5944}, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud{H164} said{H559}{(H8799)}, I have a message{H1697} from God{H430} unto thee. And he arose{H6965}{(H8799)} out of his seat{H3678}."
Judges,3,21,"And Ehud{H164} put forth{H7971}{(H8799)} his left{H8040} hand{H3027}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} the dagger{H2719} from his right{H3225} thigh{H3409}, and thrust{H8628}{(H8799)} it into his belly{H990}:"
Judges,3,22,"And the haft{H5325} also went in{H935}{(H8799)} after{H310} the blade{H3851}; and the fat{H2459} closed{H5462}{(H8799)} upon{H1157} the blade{H3851}, so that he could not draw{H8025}{(H8804)} the dagger{H2719} out of his belly{H990}; and the dirt{H6574} came out{H3318}{(H8799)}."
Judges,3,23,"Then Ehud{H164} went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} through the porch{H4528}, and shut{H5462}{(H8799)} the doors{H1817} of the parlour{H5944} upon him, and locked{H5274}{(H8804)} them."
Judges,3,24,"When he was gone out{H3318}{(H8804)}, his servants{H5650} came{H935}{(H8804)}; and when they saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that, behold, the doors{H1817} of the parlour{H5944} were locked{H5274}{(H8803)}, they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Surely he covereth{H5526}{(H8688)} his feet{H7272} in his summer{H4747} chamber{H2315}."
Judges,3,25,"And they tarried{H2342}{(H8799)} till they were ashamed{H954}{(H8800)}: and, behold, he opened{H6605}{(H8802)} not the doors{H1817} of the parlour{H5944}; therefore they took{H3947}{(H8799)} a key{H4668}, and opened{H6605}{(H8799)} them: and, behold, their lord{H113} was fallen down{H5307}{(H8802)} dead{H4191}{(H8801)} on the earth{H776}."
Judges,3,26,"And Ehud{H164} escaped{H4422}{(H8738)} while they tarried{H4102}{(H8699)}, and passed beyond{H5674}{(H8804)} the quarries{H6456}, and escaped{H4422}{(H8735)} unto Seirath{H8167}."
Judges,3,27,"And it came to pass, when he was come{H935}{(H8800)}, that he blew{H8628}{(H8799)} a trumpet{H7782} in the mountain{H2022} of Ephraim{H669}, and the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} went down{H3381}{(H8799)} with him from the mount{H2022}, and he before{H6440} them."
Judges,3,28,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Follow{H7291}{(H8798)} after{H310} me: for the LORD{H3068} hath delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} your enemies{H341}{(H8802)} the Moabites{H4124} into your hand{H3027}. And they went down{H3381}{(H8799)} after{H310} him, and took{H3920}{(H8799)} the fords{H4569} of Jordan{H3383} toward Moab{H4124}, and suffered{H5414}{(H8804)} not a man{H376} to pass over{H5674}{(H8800)}."
Judges,3,29,"And they slew{H5221}{(H8686)} of Moab{H4124} at that time{H6256} about ten{H6235} thousand{H505} men{H376}, all lusty{H8082}, and all men{H376} of valour{H2428}; and there escaped{H4422}{(H8738)} not a man{H376}."
Judges,3,30,So Moab{H4124} was subdued{H3665}{(H8735)} that day{H3117} under the hand{H3027} of Israel{H3478}. And the land{H776} had rest{H8252}{(H8799)} fourscore{H8084} years{H8141}.
Judges,3,31,"And after{H310} him was Shamgar{H8044} the son{H1121} of Anath{H6067}, which slew{H5221}{(H8686)} of the Philistines{H6430} six{H8337} hundred{H3967} men{H376} with an ox{H1241} goad{H4451}: and he also delivered{H3467}{(H8686)} Israel{H3478}."
Judges,4,1,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} again{H3254}{(H8686)} did{H6213}{(H8800)} evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, when Ehud{H164} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}."
Judges,4,2,"And the LORD{H3068} sold{H4376}{(H8799)} them into the hand{H3027} of Jabin{H2985} king{H4428} of Canaan{H3667}, that reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} in Hazor{H2674}; the captain{H8269} of whose host{H6635} was Sisera{H5516}, which dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} in Harosheth{H2800} of the Gentiles{H1471}."
Judges,4,3,And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} cried{H6817}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}: for he had nine{H8672} hundred{H3967} chariots{H7393} of iron{H1270}; and twenty{H6242} years{H8141} he mightily{H2394} oppressed{H3905}{(H8804)} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}.
Judges,4,4,"And Deborah{H1683}, a prophetess{H5031}, the wife{H802} of Lapidoth{H3941}, she judged{H8199}{(H8802)} Israel{H3478} at that time{H6256}."
Judges,4,5,And she dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} under the palm tree{H8560} of Deborah{H1683} between Ramah{H7414} and Bethel{H1008} in mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}: and the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} came up{H5927}{(H8799)} to her for judgment{H4941}.
Judges,4,6,"And she sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and called{H7121}{(H8799)} Barak{H1301} the son{H1121} of Abinoam{H42} out of Kedeshnaphtali{H6943}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Hath not the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}, saying, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} and draw{H4900}{(H8804)} toward mount{H2022} Tabor{H8396}, and take{H3947}{(H8804)} with thee ten{H6235} thousand{H505} men{H376} of the children{H1121} of Naphtali{H5321} and of the children{H1121} of Zebulun{H2074}?"
Judges,4,7,"And I will draw{H4900}{(H8804)} unto thee to the river{H5158} Kishon{H7028} Sisera{H5516}, the captain{H8269} of Jabin's{H2985} army{H6635}, with his chariots{H7393} and his multitude{H1995}; and I will deliver{H5414}{(H8804)} him into thine hand{H3027}."
Judges,4,8,"And Barak{H1301} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, If thou wilt go{H3212}{(H8799)} with me, then I will go{H1980}{(H8804)}: but if thou wilt not go{H3212}{(H8799)} with me, then I will not go{H3212}{(H8799)}."
Judges,4,9,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will surely{H1980}{(H8800)} go{H3212}{(H8799)} with thee: notwithstanding{H657} the journey{H1870} that thou takest{H1980}{(H8802)} shall not be for thine honour{H8597}; for the LORD{H3068} shall sell{H4376}{(H8799)} Sisera{H5516} into the hand{H3027} of a woman{H802}. And Deborah{H1683} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} with Barak{H1301} to Kedesh{H6943}."
Judges,4,10,And Barak{H1301} called{H2199}{(H8686)} Zebulun{H2074} and Naphtali{H5321} to Kedesh{H6943}; and he went up{H5927}{(H8799)} with ten{H6235} thousand{H505} men{H376} at his feet{H7272}: and Deborah{H1683} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} with him.
Judges,4,11,"Now Heber{H2268} the Kenite{H7017}, which was of the children{H1121} of Hobab{H2246} the father in law{H2859}{(H8802)} of Moses{H4872}, had severed{H6504}{(H8737)} himself from the Kenites{H7017}, and pitched{H5186}{(H8799)} his tent{H168} unto the plain{H436} of Zaanaim{H6815}, which is by Kedesh{H6943}."
Judges,4,12,And they shewed{H5046}{(H8686)} Sisera{H5516} that Barak{H1301} the son{H1121} of Abinoam{H42} was gone up{H5927}{(H8804)} to mount{H2022} Tabor{H8396}.
Judges,4,13,"And Sisera{H5516} gathered together{H2199}{(H8686)} all his chariots{H7393}, even nine{H8672} hundred{H3967} chariots{H7393} of iron{H1270}, and all the people{H5971} that were with him, from Harosheth{H2800} of the Gentiles{H1471} unto the river{H5158} of Kishon{H7028}."
Judges,4,14,"And Deborah{H1683} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Barak{H1301}, Up{H6965}{(H8798)}; for this is the day{H3117} in which the LORD{H3068} hath delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} Sisera{H5516} into thine hand{H3027}: is not the LORD{H3068} gone out{H3318}{(H8804)} before{H6440} thee? So Barak{H1301} went down{H3381}{(H8799)} from mount{H2022} Tabor{H8396}, and ten{H6235} thousand{H505} men{H376} after{H310} him."
Judges,4,15,"And the LORD{H3068} discomfited{H2000}{(H8799)} Sisera{H5516}, and all his chariots{H7393}, and all his host{H4264}, with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719} before{H6440} Barak{H1301}; so that Sisera{H5516} lighted down{H3381}{(H8799)} off his chariot{H4818}, and fled away{H5127}{(H8799)} on his feet{H7272}."
Judges,4,16,"But Barak{H1301} pursued{H7291}{(H8804)} after{H310} the chariots{H7393}, and after the host{H4264}, unto Harosheth{H2800} of the Gentiles{H1471}: and all the host{H4264} of Sisera{H5516} fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}; and there was not a man{H259} left{H7604}{(H8738)}."
Judges,4,17,Howbeit Sisera{H5516} fled away{H5127}{(H8804)} on his feet{H7272} to the tent{H168} of Jael{H3278} the wife{H802} of Heber{H2268} the Kenite{H7017}: for there was peace{H7965} between Jabin{H2985} the king{H4428} of Hazor{H2674} and the house{H1004} of Heber{H2268} the Kenite{H7017}.
Judges,4,18,"And Jael{H3278} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} Sisera{H5516}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Turn in{H5493}{(H8798)}, my lord{H113}, turn in{H5493}{(H8798)} to me; fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not. And when he had turned in{H5493}{(H8799)} unto her into the tent{H168}, she covered{H3680}{(H8762)} him with a mantle{H8063}."
Judges,4,19,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little{H4592} water{H4325} to drink{H8248}{(H8685)}; for I am thirsty{H6770}{(H8804)}. And she opened{H6605}{(H8799)} a bottle{H4997} of milk{H2461}, and gave him drink{H8248}{(H8686)}, and covered{H3680}{(H8762)} him."
Judges,4,20,"Again he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Stand in{H5975}{(H8798)} the door{H6607} of the tent{H168}, and it shall be, when any man{H376} doth come{H935}{(H8799)} and enquire{H7592}{(H8804)} of thee, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, Is there{H3426} any man{H376} here{H3426}? that thou shalt say{H559}{(H8804)}, No."
Judges,4,21,"Then Jael{H3278} Heber's{H2268} wife{H802} took{H3947}{(H8799)} a nail{H3489} of the tent{H168}, and took{H7760}{(H8799)} an hammer{H4718} in her hand{H3027}, and went{H935}{(H8799)} softly{H3814} unto him, and smote{H8628}{(H8799)} the nail{H3489} into his temples{H7541}, and fastened{H6795}{(H8799)} it into the ground{H776}: for he was fast asleep{H7290}{(H8738)} and weary{H5774}{(H8799)}. So he died{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Judges,4,22,"And, behold, as Barak{H1301} pursued{H7291}{(H8802)} Sisera{H5516}, Jael{H3278} came out{H3318}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and I will shew{H7200}{(H8686)} thee the man{H376} whom thou seekest{H1245}{(H8764)}. And when he came{H935}{(H8799)} into her tent, behold, Sisera{H5516} lay{H5307}{(H8802)} dead{H4191}{(H8801)}, and the nail{H3489} was in his temples{H7541}."
Judges,4,23,So God{H430} subdued{H3665}{(H8686)} on that day{H3117} Jabin{H2985} the king{H4428} of Canaan{H3667} before{H6440} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}.

Judges,6,19,"And Gideon{H1439} went in{H935}{(H8804)}, and made ready{H6213}{(H8799)} a kid{H5795}{H1423}, and unleavened cakes{H4682} of an ephah{H374} of flour{H7058}: the flesh{H1320} he put{H7760}{(H8804)} in a basket{H5536}, and he put{H7760}{(H8804)} the broth{H4839} in a pot{H6517}, and brought it out{H3318}{(H8686)} unto him under the oak{H424}, and presented{H5066}{(H8686)} it."
Judges,6,20,"And the angel{H4397} of God{H430} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} the flesh{H1320} and the unleavened cakes{H4682}, and lay{H3240}{(H8685)} them upon this{H1975} rock{H5553}, and pour out{H8210}{(H8798)} the broth{H4839}. And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} so."
Judges,6,21,"Then the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} put forth{H7971}{(H8799)} the end{H7097} of the staff{H4938} that was in his hand{H3027}, and touched{H5060}{(H8799)} the flesh{H1320} and the unleavened cakes{H4682}; and there rose up{H5927}{(H8799)} fire{H784} out of the rock{H6697}, and consumed{H398}{(H8799)} the flesh{H1320} and the unleavened cakes{H4682}. Then the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} departed{H1980}{(H8804)} out of his sight{H5869}."
Judges,6,22,"And when Gideon{H1439} perceived{H7200}{(H8799)} that he was an angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068}, Gideon{H1439} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Alas{H162}, O Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}! for because{H3651} I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} an angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} face{H6440} to face{H6440}."
Judges,6,23,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Peace{H7965} be unto thee; fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not: thou shalt not die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Judges,6,24,"Then Gideon{H1439} built{H1129}{(H8799)} an altar{H4196} there unto the LORD{H3068}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} it Jehovahshalom{H3073}: unto this day{H3117} it is yet in Ophrah{H6084} of the Abiezrites{H33}."
Judges,6,25,"And it came to pass the same night{H3915}, that the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} thy father's{H1} young{H6499} bullock{H7794}, even the second{H8145} bullock{H6499} of seven{H7651} years old{H8141}, and throw down{H2040}{(H8804)} the altar{H4196} of Baal{H1168} that thy father{H1} hath, and cut down{H3772}{(H8799)} the grove{H842} that is by it:"
Judges,6,26,"And build{H1129}{(H8804)} an altar{H4196} unto the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} upon the top{H7218} of this rock{H4581}, in the ordered place{H4634}, and take{H3947}{(H8804)} the second{H8145} bullock{H6499}, and offer{H5927}{(H8689)} a burnt sacrifice{H5930} with the wood{H6086} of the grove{H842} which thou shalt cut down{H3772}{(H8799)}."
Judges,6,27,"Then Gideon{H1439} took{H3947}{(H8799)} ten{H6235} men{H582} of his servants{H5650}, and did{H6213}{(H8799)} as the LORD{H3068} had said{H1696}{(H8765)} unto him: and so it was, because he feared{H3372}{(H8804)} his father's{H1} household{H1004}, and the men{H582} of the city{H5892}, that he could not do{H6213}{(H8800)} it by day{H3119}, that he did{H6213}{(H8799)} it by night{H3915}."
Judges,6,28,"And when the men{H582} of the city{H5892} arose early{H7925}{(H8686)} in the morning{H1242}, behold, the altar{H4196} of Baal{H1168} was cast down{H5422}{(H8795)}, and the grove{H842} was cut down{H3772}{(H8795)} that was by it, and the second{H8145} bullock{H6499} was offered{H5927}{(H8717)} upon the altar{H4196} that was built{H1129}{(H8803)}."
Judges,6,29,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} one{H376} to another{H7453}, Who hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} this thing{H1697}? And when they enquired{H1875}{(H8799)} and asked{H1245}{(H8762)}, they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Gideon{H1439} the son{H1121} of Joash{H3101} hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} this thing{H1697}."
Judges,6,30,"Then the men{H582} of the city{H5892} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joash{H3101}, Bring out{H3318}{(H8685)} thy son{H1121}, that he may die{H4191}{(H8799)}: because he hath cast down{H5422}{(H8804)} the altar{H4196} of Baal{H1168}, and because he hath cut down{H3772}{(H8804)} the grove{H842} that was by it."
Judges,6,31,"And Joash{H3101} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto all that stood{H5975}{(H8804)} against him, Will ye plead{H7378}{(H8799)} for Baal{H1168}? will ye save{H3467}{(H8686)} him? he that will plead{H7378}{(H8799)} for him, let him be put to death{H4191}{(H8714)} whilst it is yet morning{H1242}: if he be a god{H430}, let him plead{H7378}{(H8799)} for himself, because one hath cast down{H5422}{(H8804)} his altar{H4196}."
Judges,6,32,"Therefore on that day{H3117} he called{H7121}{(H8799)} him Jerubbaal{H3378}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Let Baal{H1168} plead{H7378}{(H8799)} against him, because he hath thrown down{H5422}{(H8804)} his altar{H4196}."
Judges,6,33,"Then all the Midianites{H4080} and the Amalekites{H6002} and the children{H1121} of the east{H6924} were gathered{H622}{(H8738)} together{H3162}, and went over{H5674}{(H8799)}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} in the valley{H6010} of Jezreel{H3157}."
Judges,6,34,"But the Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} came{H3847}{(H8804)} upon Gideon{H1439}, and he blew{H8628}{(H8799)} a trumpet{H7782}; and Abiezer{H44} was gathered{H2199}{(H8735)} after{H310} him."
Judges,6,35,"And he sent{H7971}{(H8804)} messengers{H4397} throughout all Manasseh{H4519}; who also was gathered{H2199}{(H8735)} after{H310} him: and he sent{H7971}{(H8804)} messengers{H4397} unto Asher{H836}, and unto Zebulun{H2074}, and unto Naphtali{H5321}; and they came up{H5927}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} them."
Judges,6,36,"And Gideon{H1439} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto God{H430}, If thou wilt{H3426} save{H3467}{(H8688)} Israel{H3478} by mine hand{H3027}, as thou hast said{H1696}{(H8765)},"
Judges,6,37,"Behold, I will put{H3322}{(H8688)} a fleece{H1492} of wool{H6785} in the floor{H1637}; and if the dew{H2919} be on the fleece{H1492} only, and it be dry{H2721} upon all the earth{H776} beside, then shall I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that thou wilt save{H3467}{(H8686)} Israel{H3478} by mine hand{H3027}, as thou hast said{H1696}{(H8765)}."
Judges,6,38,"And it was so: for he rose up early{H7925}{(H8686)} on the morrow{H4283}, and thrust{H2115} the fleece{H1492} together{H2115}{(H8799)}, and wringed{H4680}{(H8799)} the dew{H2919} out of the fleece{H1492}, a bowl{H5602} full{H4393} of water{H4325}."
Judges,6,39,"And Gideon{H1439} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto God{H430}, Let not thine anger{H639} be hot{H2734}{(H8799)} against me, and I will speak{H1696}{(H8762)} but this once{H6471}: let me prove{H5254}{(H8762)}, I pray thee, but this once{H6471} with the fleece{H1492}; let it now be dry{H2721} only upon the fleece{H1492}, and upon all the ground{H776} let there be dew{H2919}."
Judges,6,40,"And God{H430} did{H6213}{(H8799)} so that night{H3915}: for it was dry{H2721} upon the fleece{H1492} only, and there was dew{H2919} on all the ground{H776}."
Judges,7,1,"Then Jerubbaal{H3378}, who is Gideon{H1439}, and all the people{H5971} that were with him, rose up early{H7925}{(H8686)}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} beside the well of Harod{H5878}: so that the host{H4264} of the Midianites{H4080} were on the north side{H6828} of them, by the hill{H1389} of Moreh{H4176}, in the valley{H6010}."
Judges,7,2,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Gideon{H1439}, The people{H5971} that are with thee are too many{H7227} for me to give{H5414}{(H8800)} the Midianites{H4080} into their hands{H3027}, lest Israel{H3478} vaunt{H6286}{(H8691)} themselves against me, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Mine own hand{H3027} hath saved{H3467}{(H8689)} me."
Judges,7,3,"Now therefore go to{H4994}, proclaim{H7121}{(H8798)} in the ears{H241} of the people{H5971}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Whosoever is fearful{H3373} and afraid{H2730}, let him return{H7725}{(H8799)} and depart early{H6852}{(H8799)} from mount{H2022} Gilead{H1568}. And there returned{H7725}{(H8799)} of the people{H5971} twenty{H6242} and two{H8147} thousand{H505}; and there remained{H7604}{(H8738)} ten{H6235} thousand{H505}."
Judges,7,4,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Gideon{H1439}, The people{H5971} are yet too many{H7227}; bring them down{H3381}{(H8685)} unto the water{H4325}, and I will try{H6884}{(H8799)} them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say{H559}{(H8799)} unto thee, This shall go{H3212}{(H8799)} with thee, the same shall go{H3212}{(H8799)} with thee; and of whomsoever I say{H559}{(H8799)} unto thee, This shall not go{H3212}{(H8799)} with thee, the same shall not go{H3212}{(H8799)}."
Judges,7,5,"So he brought down{H3381}{(H8686)} the people{H5971} unto the water{H4325}: and the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Gideon{H1439}, Every one that lappeth{H3952}{(H8799)} of the water{H4325} with his tongue{H3956}, as a dog{H3611} lappeth{H3952}{(H8799)}, him shalt thou set{H3322}{(H8686)} by himself; likewise every one that boweth down{H3766}{(H8799)} upon his knees{H1290} to drink{H8354}{(H8800)}."
Judges,7,6,"And the number{H4557} of them that lapped{H3952}{(H8764)}, putting their hand{H3027} to their mouth{H6310}, were three{H7969} hundred{H3967} men{H376}: but all the rest{H3499} of the people{H5971} bowed down{H3766}{(H8804)} upon their knees{H1290} to drink{H8354}{(H8800)} water{H4325}."
Judges,7,7,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Gideon{H1439}, By the three{H7969} hundred{H3967} men{H376} that lapped{H3952}{(H8764)} will I save{H3467}{(H8686)} you, and deliver{H5414}{(H8804)} the Midianites{H4080} into thine hand{H3027}: and let all the other people{H5971} go{H3212}{(H8799)} every man{H376} unto his place{H4725}."
Judges,7,8,"So the people{H5971} took{H3947}{(H8799)} victuals{H6720} in their hand{H3027}, and their trumpets{H7782}: and he sent{H7971}{(H8765)} all{H376} the rest of Israel{H3478} every man{H376} unto his tent{H168}, and retained{H2388}{(H8689)} those three{H7969} hundred{H3967} men{H376}: and the host{H4264} of Midian{H4080} was beneath him in the valley{H6010}."
Judges,7,9,"And it came to pass the same night{H3915}, that the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, get thee down{H3381}{(H8798)} unto the host{H4264}; for I have delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} it into thine hand{H3027}."
Judges,7,10,"But if thou fear{H3373} to go down{H3381}{(H8800)}, go{H3381} thou with Phurah{H6513} thy servant{H5288} down{H3381}{(H8798)} to the host{H4264}:"
Judges,7,11,And thou shalt hear{H8085}{(H8804)} what they say{H1696}{(H8762)}; and afterward{H310} shall thine hands{H3027} be strengthened{H2388}{(H8799)} to go down{H3381}{(H8804)} unto the host{H4264}. Then went he down{H3381}{(H8799)} with Phurah{H6513} his servant{H5288} unto the outside{H7097} of the armed men{H2571} that were in the host{H4264}.
Judges,7,12,"And the Midianites{H4080} and the Amalekites{H6002} and all the children{H1121} of the east{H6924} lay{H5307}{(H8802)} along in the valley{H6010} like grasshoppers{H697} for multitude{H7230}; and their camels{H1581} were without number{H4557}, as the sand{H2344} by the sea{H3220} side{H8193} for multitude{H7230}."
Judges,7,13,"And when Gideon{H1439} was come{H935}{(H8799)}, behold, there was a man{H376} that told{H5608}{(H8764)} a dream{H2472} unto his fellow{H7453}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, I dreamed{H2492}{(H8804)} a dream{H2472}, and, lo, a cake{H6742}{(H8675)}{H6742} of barley{H8184} bread{H3899} tumbled{H2015}{(H8693)} into the host{H4264} of Midian{H4080}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} unto a tent{H168}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} it that it fell{H5307}{(H8799)}, and overturned{H2015}{(H8799)}{H4605} it, that the tent{H168} lay along{H5307}{(H8804)}."
Judges,7,14,"And his fellow{H7453} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, This is nothing else save the sword{H2719} of Gideon{H1439} the son{H1121} of Joash{H3101}, a man{H376} of Israel{H3478}: for into his hand{H3027} hath God{H430} delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} Midian{H4080}, and all the host{H4264}."
Judges,7,15,"And it was so, when Gideon{H1439} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} the telling{H4557} of the dream{H2472}, and the interpretation{H7667} thereof, that he worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)}, and returned{H7725}{(H8799)} into the host{H4264} of Israel{H3478}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}; for the LORD{H3068} hath delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} into your hand{H3027} the host{H4264} of Midian{H4080}."
Judges,7,16,"And he divided{H2673}{(H8799)} the three{H7969} hundred{H3967} men{H376} into three{H7969} companies{H7218}, and he put{H5414}{(H8799)} a trumpet{H7782} in every man's hand{H3027}, with empty{H7386} pitchers{H3537}, and lamps{H3940} within{H8432} the pitchers{H3537}."
Judges,7,17,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Look{H7200}{(H8799)} on me, and do{H6213}{(H8799)} likewise: and, behold, when I come{H935}{(H8802)} to the outside{H7097} of the camp{H4264}, it shall be that, as I do{H6213}{(H8799)}, so shall ye do{H6213}{(H8799)}."
Judges,7,18,"When I blow{H8628}{(H8804)} with a trumpet{H7782}, I and all that are with me, then blow{H8628}{(H8804)} ye the trumpets{H7782} also on every side{H5439} of all the camp{H4264}, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, The sword of the LORD{H3068}, and of Gideon{H1439}."
Judges,7,19,"So Gideon{H1439}, and the hundred{H3967} men{H376} that were with him, came{H935}{(H8799)} unto the outside{H7097} of the camp{H4264} in the beginning{H7218} of the middle{H8484} watch{H821}; and they had but{H389} newly{H6965}{(H8687)} set{H6965}{(H8689)} the watch{H8104}{(H8802)}: and they blew{H8628}{(H8799)} the trumpets{H7782}, and brake{H5310}{(H8800)} the pitchers{H3537} that were in their hands{H3027}."
Judges,7,20,"And the three{H7969} companies{H7218} blew{H8628}{(H8799)} the trumpets{H7782}, and brake{H7665}{(H8799)} the pitchers{H3537}, and held{H2388}{(H8686)} the lamps{H3940} in their left{H8040} hands{H3027}, and the trumpets{H7782} in their right{H3225} hands{H3027} to blow{H8628}{(H8800)} withal: and they cried{H7121}{(H8799)}, The sword{H2719} of the LORD{H3068}, and of Gideon{H1439}."
Judges,7,21,"And they stood{H5975}{(H8799)} every man{H376} in his place round about{H5439} the camp{H4264}: and all the host{H4264} ran{H7323}{(H8799)}, and cried{H7321}{(H8686)}, and fled{H5127}{(H8799)}{(H8675)}{H5127}{(H8686)}."
Judges,7,22,"And the three{H7969} hundred{H3967} blew{H8628}{(H8799)} the trumpets{H7782}, and the LORD{H3068} set{H7760}{(H8799)} every man's{H376} sword{H2719} against his fellow{H7453}, even throughout all the host{H4264}: and the host{H4264} fled{H5127}{(H8799)} to Bethshittah{H1029} in Zererath{H6888}, and to the border{H8193} of Abelmeholah{H65}, unto Tabbath{H2888}."
Judges,7,23,"And the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} gathered themselves together{H6817}{(H8735)} out of Naphtali{H5321}, and out of Asher{H836}, and out of all Manasseh{H4519}, and pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} the Midianites{H4080}."
Judges,7,24,"And Gideon{H1439} sent{H7971}{(H8804)} messengers{H4397} throughout all mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Come down{H3381}{(H8798)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} the Midianites{H4080}, and take{H3920}{(H8798)} before them the waters{H4325} unto Bethbarah{H1012} and Jordan{H3383}. Then all the men{H376} of Ephraim{H669} gathered themselves together{H6817}{(H8735)}, and took{H3920}{(H8799)} the waters{H4325} unto Bethbarah{H1012} and Jordan{H3383}."
Judges,7,25,"And they took{H3920}{(H8799)} two{H8147} princes{H8269} of the Midianites{H4080}, Oreb{H6159} and Zeeb{H2062}; and they slew{H2026}{(H8799)} Oreb{H6159} upon the rock{H6697} Oreb{H6159}, and Zeeb{H2062} they slew{H2026}{(H8804)} at the winepress{H3342} of Zeeb{H2062}, and pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} Midian{H4080}, and brought{H935}{(H8689)} the heads{H7218} of Oreb{H6159} and Zeeb{H2062} to Gideon{H1439} on the other side{H5676} Jordan{H3383}."
Judges,8,1,"And the men{H376} of Ephraim{H669} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Why hast thou{H4100} served{H6213}{(H8804)} us thus{H1697}, that thou calledst{H7121}{(H8800)} us not, when thou wentest{H1980}{(H8804)} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} with the Midianites{H4080}? And they did chide{H7378}{(H8799)} with him sharply{H2394}."
Judges,8,2,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, What have I done{H6213}{(H8804)} now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning{H5955} of the grapes of Ephraim{H669} better{H2896} than the vintage{H1210} of Abiezer{H44}?"
Judges,8,3,"God{H430} hath delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} into your hands{H3027} the princes{H8269} of Midian{H4080}, Oreb{H6159} and Zeeb{H2062}: and what was I able{H3201}{(H8804)} to do{H6213}{(H8800)} in comparison of you? Then their anger{H7307} was abated{H7503}{(H8804)} toward him, when he had said{H1697} that{H1696}{(H8763)}."
Judges,8,4,"And Gideon{H1439} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jordan{H3383}, and passed over{H5674}{(H8802)}, he, and the three{H7969} hundred{H3967} men{H376} that were with him, faint{H5889}, yet pursuing{H7291}{(H8802)} them."
Judges,8,5,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the men{H582} of Succoth{H5523}, Give{H5414}{(H8798)}, I pray you, loaves{H3603} of bread{H3899} unto the people{H5971} that follow{H7272} me; for they be faint{H5889}, and I am pursuing{H7291}{(H8802)} after{H310} Zebah{H2078} and Zalmunna{H6759}, kings{H4428} of Midian{H4080}."
Judges,8,6,"And the princes{H8269} of Succoth{H5523} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Are the hands{H3709} of Zebah{H2078} and Zalmunna{H6759} now in thine hand{H3027}, that we should give{H5414}{(H8799)} bread{H3899} unto thine army{H6635}?"
Judges,8,7,"And Gideon{H1439} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Therefore when the LORD{H3068} hath delivered{H5414}{(H8800)} Zebah{H2078} and Zalmunna{H6759} into mine hand{H3027}, then I will tear{H1758}{(H8804)} your flesh{H1320} with the thorns{H6975} of the wilderness{H4057} and with briers{H1303}."
Judges,8,8,"And he went up{H5927}{(H8799)} thence to Penuel{H6439}, and spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto them likewise{H2063}: and the men{H582} of Penuel{H6439} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} him as the men{H582} of Succoth{H5523} had answered{H6030}{(H8804)} him."
Judges,8,9,"And he spake{H559}{(H8799)} also unto the men{H582} of Penuel{H6439}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, When I come again{H7725}{(H8800)} in peace{H7965}, I will break down{H5422}{(H8799)} this tower{H4026}."
Judges,8,10,"Now Zebah{H2078} and Zalmunna{H6759} were in Karkor{H7174}, and their hosts{H4264} with them, about fifteen{H2568}{H6240} thousand{H505} men, all that were left{H3498}{(H8737)} of all the hosts{H4264} of the children{H1121} of the east{H6924}: for there fell{H5307}{(H8802)} an hundred{H3967} and twenty{H6242} thousand{H505} men{H376} that drew{H8025}{(H8802)} sword{H2719}."
Judges,8,11,"And Gideon{H1439} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870} of them that dwelt{H7931}{(H8803)} in tents{H168} on the east{H6924} of Nobah{H5025} and Jogbehah{H3011}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the host{H4264}: for the host{H4264} was secure{H983}."
Judges,8,12,"And when Zebah{H2078} and Zalmunna{H6759} fled{H5127}{(H8799)}, he pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} them, and took{H3920}{(H8799)} the two{H8147} kings{H4428} of Midian{H4080}, Zebah{H2078} and Zalmunna{H6759}, and discomfited{H2729}{(H8689)} all the host{H4264}."
Judges,8,13,"And Gideon{H1439} the son{H1121} of Joash{H3101} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} from battle{H4421} before{H4608} the sun{H2775} was up,"
Judges,8,14,"And caught{H3920}{(H8799)} a young man{H5288} of the men{H582} of Succoth{H5523}, and enquired{H7592}{(H8799)} of him: and he described{H3789}{(H8799)} unto him the princes{H8269} of Succoth{H5523}, and the elders{H2205} thereof, even threescore and seventeen{H7657}{H7651} men{H376}."
Judges,8,15,"And he came{H935}{(H8799)} unto the men{H582} of Succoth{H5523}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold Zebah{H2078} and Zalmunna{H6759}, with whom ye did upbraid{H2778}{(H8765)} me, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Are the hands{H3709} of Zebah{H2078} and Zalmunna{H6759} now in thine hand{H3027}, that we should give{H5414}{(H8799)} bread{H3899} unto thy men{H582} that are weary{H3287}?"
Judges,8,16,"And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} the elders{H2205} of the city{H5892}, and thorns{H6975} of the wilderness{H4057} and briers{H1303}, and with them he taught{H3045}{(H8686)} the men{H582} of Succoth{H5523}."
Judges,8,17,"And he beat down{H5422}{(H8804)} the tower{H4026} of Penuel{H6439}, and slew{H2026}{(H8799)} the men{H582} of the city{H5892}."
Judges,8,18,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto Zebah{H2078} and Zalmunna{H6759}, What{H375} manner of men{H582} were they whom ye slew{H2026}{(H8804)} at Tabor{H8396}? And they answered{H559}{(H8799)}, As thou{H3644} art, so were they; each one{H259} resembled{H8389} the children{H1121} of a king{H4428}."
Judges,8,19,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, They were my brethren{H251}, even the sons{H1121} of my mother{H517}: as the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, if{H3863} ye had saved them alive{H2421}{(H8689)}, I would not slay{H2026}{(H8804)} you."
Judges,8,20,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jether{H3500} his firstborn{H1060}, Up{H6965}{(H8798)}, and slay{H2026}{(H8798)} them. But the youth{H5288} drew{H8025}{(H8804)} not his sword{H2719}: for he feared{H3372}{(H8804)}, because he was yet a youth{H5288}."
Judges,8,21,"Then Zebah{H2078} and Zalmunna{H6759} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Rise{H6965}{(H8798)} thou, and fall{H6293}{(H8798)} upon us: for as the man{H376} is, so is his strength{H1369}. And Gideon{H1439} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and slew{H2026}{(H8799)} Zebah{H2078} and Zalmunna{H6759}, and took away{H3947}{(H8799)} the ornaments{H7720} that were on their camels{H1581}' necks{H6677}."
Judges,8,22,"Then the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Gideon{H1439}, Rule{H4910}{(H8798)} thou over us, both thou, and thy son{H1121}, and thy son's{H1121} son{H1121} also: for thou hast delivered{H3467}{(H8689)} us from the hand{H3027} of Midian{H4080}."
Judges,8,23,"And Gideon{H1439} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, I will not rule{H4910}{(H8799)} over you, neither shall my son{H1121} rule{H4910}{(H8799)} over you: the LORD{H3068} shall rule{H4910}{(H8799)} over you."
Judges,8,24,"And Gideon{H1439} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, I would desire{H7592}{(H8799)} a request{H7596} of you, that ye would give{H5414}{(H8798)} me every man{H376} the earrings{H5141} of his prey{H7998}.(For they had golden{H2091} earrings{H5141}, because they were Ishmaelites{H3459}.)"
Judges,8,25,"And they answered{H559}{(H8799)}, We will willingly{H5414}{(H8800)} give{H5414}{(H8799)} them. And they spread{H6566}{(H8799)} a garment{H8071}, and did cast{H7993}{(H8686)} therein every man{H376} the earrings{H5141} of his prey{H7998}."
Judges,8,26,"And the weight{H4948} of the golden{H2091} earrings{H5141} that he requested{H7592}{(H8804)} was a thousand{H505} and seven{H7651} hundred{H3967} shekels of gold{H2091}; beside ornaments{H7720}, and collars{H5188}, and purple{H713} raiment{H899} that was on the kings{H4428} of Midian{H4080}, and beside the chains{H6060} that were about their camels{H1581}' necks{H6677}."
Judges,8,27,"And Gideon{H1439} made{H6213}{(H8799)} an ephod{H646} thereof, and put{H3322}{(H8686)} it in his city{H5892}, even in Ophrah{H6084}: and all Israel{H3478} went thither a whoring{H2181}{(H8799)} after{H310} it: which thing became a snare{H4170} unto Gideon{H1439}, and to his house{H1004}."
Judges,8,28,"Thus was Midian{H4080} subdued{H3665}{(H8735)} before{H6440} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, so that they lifted up{H5375}{(H8800)} their heads{H7218} no more{H3254}{(H8804)}. And the country{H776} was in quietness{H8252}{(H8799)} forty{H705} years{H8141} in the days{H3117} of Gideon{H1439}."
Judges,8,29,And Jerubbaal{H3378} the son{H1121} of Joash{H3101} went{H3212}{(H8799)} and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in his own house{H1004}.
Judges,8,30,And Gideon{H1439} had threescore and ten{H7657} sons{H1121} of his body{H3409} begotten{H3318}{(H8802)}: for he had many{H7227} wives{H802}.
Judges,8,31,"And his concubine{H6370} that was in Shechem{H7927}, she also bare{H3205}{(H8804)} him a son{H1121}, whose name{H8034} he called{H7760}{(H8799)} Abimelech{H40}."
Judges,8,32,"And Gideon{H1439} the son{H1121} of Joash{H3101} died{H4191}{(H8799)} in a good{H2896} old age{H7872}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} in the sepulchre{H6913} of Joash{H3101} his father{H1}, in Ophrah{H6084} of the Abiezrites{H33}."
Judges,8,33,"And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon{H1439} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, that the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} turned again{H7725}{(H8799)}, and went a whoring{H2181}{(H8799)} after{H310} Baalim{H1168}, and made{H7760}{(H8799)} Baalberith{H1170} their god{H430}."
Judges,8,34,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} remembered{H2142}{(H8804)} not the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, who had delivered{H5337}{(H8688)} them out of the hands{H3027} of all their enemies{H341}{(H8802)} on every side{H5439}:"
Judges,8,35,"Neither shewed{H6213}{(H8804)} they kindness{H2617} to the house{H1004} of Jerubbaal{H3378}, namely, Gideon{H1439}, according to all the goodness{H2896} which he had shewed{H6213}{(H8804)} unto Israel{H3478}."
Judges,9,1,"And Abimelech{H40} the son{H1121} of Jerubbaal{H3378} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Shechem{H7927} unto his mother's{H517} brethren{H251}, and communed{H1696}{(H8762)} with them, and with all the family{H4940} of the house{H1004} of his mother's{H517} father{H1}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Judges,9,2,"Speak{H1696}{(H8761)}, I pray you, in the ears{H241} of all the men{H1167} of Shechem{H7927}, Whether is better{H2896} for you, either that all the sons{H1121} of Jerubbaal{H3378}, which are threescore and ten{H7657} persons{H376}, reign{H4910}{(H8800)} over you, or that one{H259} reign{H4910}{(H8800)} over you? remember{H2142}{(H8804)} also that I am your bone{H6106} and your flesh{H1320}."
Judges,9,3,"And his mother's{H517} brethren{H251} spake{H1696}{(H8762)} of him in the ears{H241} of all the men{H1167} of Shechem{H7927} all these words{H1697}: and their hearts{H3820} inclined{H5186}{(H8799)} to follow{H310} Abimelech{H40}; for they said{H559}{(H8804)}, He is our brother{H251}."
Judges,9,4,"And they gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him threescore and ten{H7657} pieces of silver{H3701} out of the house{H1004} of Baalberith{H1170}, wherewith Abimelech{H40} hired{H7936}{(H8799)} vain{H7386} and light{H6348}{(H8802)} persons{H582}, which followed{H3212}{(H8799)} him{H310}."
Judges,9,5,"And he went{H935}{(H8799)} unto his father's{H1} house{H1004} at Ophrah{H6084}, and slew{H2026}{(H8799)} his brethren{H251} the sons{H1121} of Jerubbaal{H3378}, being threescore and ten{H7657} persons{H376}, upon one{H259} stone{H68}: notwithstanding yet Jotham{H3147} the youngest{H6996} son{H1121} of Jerubbaal{H3378} was left{H3498}{(H8735)}; for he hid{H2244}{(H8738)} himself."
Judges,9,6,"And all the men{H1167} of Shechem{H7927} gathered together{H622}{(H8735)}, and all the house{H1004} of Millo{H4407}{(H8677)}{H1037}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)}, and made{H4427}{(H8686)} Abimelech{H40} king{H4428}, by the plain{H436} of the pillar{H5324}{(H8716)} that was in Shechem{H7927}."
Judges,9,7,"And when they told{H5046}{(H8686)} it to Jotham{H3147}, he went{H3212}{(H8799)} and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} in the top{H7218} of mount{H2022} Gerizim{H1630}, and lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} his voice{H6963}, and cried{H7121}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Hearken{H8085}{(H8798)} unto me, ye men{H1167} of Shechem{H7927}, that God{H430} may hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} unto you."
Judges,9,8,"The trees{H6086} went forth{H1980}{(H8804)}{(H8676)}{H1980}{(H8800)} on a time to anoint{H4886}{(H8800)} a king{H4428} over them; and they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the olive tree{H2132}, Reign{H4427}{(H8798)} thou over us."
Judges,9,9,"But the olive tree{H2132} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Should I leave{H2308}{(H8804)} my fatness{H1880}, wherewith by me they honour{H3513}{(H8762)} God{H430} and man{H582}, and go{H1980}{(H8804)} to be promoted{H5128}{(H8800)} over the trees{H6086}?"
Judges,9,10,"And the trees{H6086} said{H559}{(H8799)} to the fig tree{H8384}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)} thou, and reign{H4427}{(H8798)} over us."

Judges,9,25,"And the men{H1167} of Shechem{H7927} set{H7760}{(H8799)} liers in wait{H693}{(H8764)} for him in the top{H7218} of the mountains{H2022}, and they robbed{H1497}{(H8799)} all that came{H5674}{(H8799)} along that way{H1870} by them: and it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} Abimelech{H40}."
Judges,9,26,"And Gaal{H1603} the son{H1121} of Ebed{H5651} came{H935}{(H8799)} with his brethren{H251}, and went over{H5674}{(H8799)} to Shechem{H7927}: and the men{H1167} of Shechem{H7927} put their confidence{H982}{(H8799)} in him."
Judges,9,27,"And they went out{H3318}{(H8799)} into the fields{H7704}, and gathered{H1219}{(H8799)} their vineyards{H3754}, and trode{H1869}{(H8799)} the grapes, and made{H6213}{(H8799)} merry{H1974}, and went{H935}{(H8799)} into the house{H1004} of their god{H430}, and did eat{H398}{(H8799)} and drink{H8354}{(H8799)}, and cursed{H7043}{(H8762)} Abimelech{H40}."
Judges,9,28,"And Gaal{H1603} the son{H1121} of Ebed{H5651} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who is Abimelech{H40}, and who is Shechem{H7927}, that we should serve{H5647}{(H8799)} him? is not he the son{H1121} of Jerubbaal{H3378}? and Zebul{H2083} his officer{H6496}? serve{H5647}{(H8798)} the men{H582} of Hamor{H2544} the father{H1} of Shechem{H7927}: for why should we serve{H5647}{(H8799)} him?"
Judges,9,29,"And would to God this people{H5971} were under{H5414}{(H8799)} my hand{H3027}! then would I remove{H5493}{(H8686)} Abimelech{H40}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)} to Abimelech{H40}, Increase{H7235}{(H8761)} thine army{H6635}, and come out{H3318}{(H8798)}."
Judges,9,30,"And when Zebul{H2083} the ruler{H8269} of the city{H5892} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} the words{H1697} of Gaal{H1603} the son{H1121} of Ebed{H5651}, his anger{H639} was kindled{H2734}{(H8799)}."
Judges,9,31,"And he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} unto Abimelech{H40} privily{H8649}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, Gaal{H1603} the son{H1121} of Ebed{H5651} and his brethren{H251} be come{H935}{(H8802)} to Shechem{H7927}; and, behold, they fortify{H6696}{(H8802)} the city{H5892} against thee."
Judges,9,32,"Now therefore up{H6965}{(H8798)} by night{H3915}, thou and the people{H5971} that is with thee, and lie in wait{H693}{(H8798)} in the field{H7704}:"
Judges,9,33,"And it shall be, that in the morning{H1242}, as soon as the sun{H8121} is up{H2224}{(H8800)}, thou shalt rise early{H7925}{(H8686)}, and set{H6584}{(H8804)} upon the city{H5892}: and, behold, when he and the people{H5971} that is with him come out{H3318}{(H8802)} against thee, then mayest thou do{H6213}{(H8804)} to them as thou{H3027} shalt find occasion{H4672}{(H8799)}."
Judges,9,34,"And Abimelech{H40} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)}, and all the people{H5971} that were with him, by night{H3915}, and they laid wait{H693}{(H8799)} against Shechem{H7927} in four{H702} companies{H7218}."
Judges,9,35,"And Gaal{H1603} the son{H1121} of Ebed{H5651} went out{H3318}{(H8799)}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} in the entering{H6607} of the gate{H8179} of the city{H5892}: and Abimelech{H40} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)}, and the people{H5971} that were with him, from lying in wait{H3993}."
Judges,9,36,"And when Gaal{H1603} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the people{H5971}, he said{H559}{(H8799)} to Zebul{H2083}, Behold, there come{H3381} people{H5971} down{H3381}{(H8802)} from the top{H7218} of the mountains{H2022}. And Zebul{H2083} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Thou seest{H7200}{(H8802)} the shadow{H6738} of the mountains{H2022} as if they were men{H582}."
Judges,9,37,"And Gaal{H1603} spake{H1696}{(H8763)} again{H3254}{(H8686)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, See there come{H3381} people{H5971} down{H3381}{(H8802)} by the middle{H2872} of the land{H776}, and another{H259} company{H7218} come{H935}{(H8804)} along by the plain{H436} of{H1870} Meonenim{H6049}{(H8781)}."
Judges,9,38,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Zebul{H2083} unto him, Where is now{H645} thy mouth{H6310}, wherewith thou saidst{H559}{(H8799)}, Who is Abimelech{H40}, that we should serve{H5647}{(H8799)} him? is not this the people{H5971} that thou hast despised{H3988}{(H8804)}? go out{H3318}{(H8798)}, I pray now{H4994}, and fight{H3898}{(H8734)} with them."
Judges,9,39,"And Gaal{H1603} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the men{H1167} of Shechem{H7927}, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} with Abimelech{H40}."
Judges,9,40,"And Abimelech{H40} chased{H7291}{(H8799)} him, and he fled{H5127}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him, and many{H7227} were overthrown{H5307}{(H8799)} and wounded{H2491}, even unto the entering{H6607} of the gate{H8179}."
Judges,9,41,"And Abimelech{H40} dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} at Arumah{H725}: and Zebul{H2083} thrust out{H1644}{(H8762)} Gaal{H1603} and his brethren{H251}, that they should not dwell{H3427}{(H8800)} in Shechem{H7927}."
Judges,9,42,"And it came to pass on the morrow{H4283}, that the people{H5971} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} into the field{H7704}; and they told{H5046}{(H8686)} Abimelech{H40}."
Judges,9,43,"And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} the people{H5971}, and divided{H2673}{(H8799)} them into three{H7969} companies{H7218}, and laid wait{H693}{(H8799)} in the field{H7704}, and looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, behold, the people{H5971} were come forth{H3318}{(H8802)} out of the city{H5892}; and he rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} against them, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them."
Judges,9,44,"And Abimelech{H40}, and the company{H7218} that was with him, rushed forward{H6584}{(H8804)}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} in the entering{H6607} of the gate{H8179} of the city{H5892}: and the two{H8147} other companies{H7218} ran upon{H6584}{(H8804)} all the people that were in the fields{H7704}, and slew{H5221}{(H8686)} them."
Judges,9,45,"And Abimelech{H40} fought{H3898}{(H8738)} against the city{H5892} all that day{H3117}; and he took{H3920}{(H8799)} the city{H5892}, and slew{H2026}{(H8804)} the people{H5971} that was therein, and beat down{H5422}{(H8799)} the city{H5892}, and sowed{H2232}{(H8799)} it with salt{H4417}."
Judges,9,46,"And when all the men{H1167} of the tower{H4026} of Shechem{H7927} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that, they entered{H935}{(H8799)} into an hold{H6877} of the house{H1004} of the god{H410} Berith{H1286}."
Judges,9,47,"And it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} Abimelech{H40}, that all the men{H1167} of the tower{H4026} of Shechem{H7927} were gathered together{H6908}{(H8694)}."
Judges,9,48,"And Abimelech{H40} gat him up{H5927}{(H8799)} to mount{H2022} Zalmon{H6756}, he and all the people{H5971} that were with him; and Abimelech{H40} took{H3947}{(H8799)} an axe{H7134} in his hand{H3027}, and cut down{H3772}{(H8799)} a bough{H7754} from the trees{H6086}, and took{H5375}{(H8799)} it, and laid{H7760}{(H8799)} it on his shoulder{H7926}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the people{H5971} that were with him, What ye have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} me do{H6213}{(H8804)}, make haste{H4116}{(H8761)}, and do{H6213}{(H8798)} as I{H3644} have done."
Judges,9,49,"And all the people{H5971} likewise cut down{H3772}{(H8799)} every man{H376} his bough{H7754}, and followed{H3212}{(H8799)}{H310} Abimelech{H40}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} them to the hold{H6877}, and set{H3341}{(H8686)} the hold{H6877} on fire{H784} upon them; so that all the men{H582} of the tower{H4026} of Shechem{H7927} died{H4191}{(H8799)} also, about a thousand{H505} men{H376} and women{H802}."
Judges,9,50,"Then went{H3212}{(H8799)} Abimelech{H40} to Thebez{H8405}, and encamped{H2583}{(H8799)} against Thebez{H8405}, and took{H3920}{(H8799)} it."
Judges,9,51,"But there was a strong{H5797} tower{H4026} within{H8432} the city{H5892}, and thither fled{H5127}{(H8799)} all the men{H582} and women{H802}, and all they{H1167} of the city{H5892}, and shut{H5462}{(H8799)} it to them, and gat them up{H5927}{(H8799)} to the top{H1406} of the tower{H4026}."
Judges,9,52,"And Abimelech{H40} came{H935}{(H8799)} unto the tower{H4026}, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against it, and went hard{H5066}{(H8799)} unto the door{H6607} of the tower{H4026} to burn{H8313}{(H8800)} it with fire{H784}."
Judges,9,53,"And a certain{H259} woman{H802} cast{H7993}{(H8686)} a piece{H6400} of a millstone{H7393} upon Abimelech's{H40} head{H7218}, and all to brake{H7533}{(H8686)} his skull{H1538}."
Judges,9,54,"Then he called{H7121}{(H8799)} hastily{H4120} unto the young man{H5288} his armourbearer{H5375}{(H8802)}{H3627}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Draw{H8025}{(H8798)} thy sword{H2719}, and slay{H4191}{(H8786)} me, that men say{H559}{(H8799)} not of me, A woman{H802} slew{H2026}{(H8804)} him. And his young man{H5288} thrust him through{H1856}{(H8799)}, and he died{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Judges,9,55,"And when the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that Abimelech{H40} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, they departed{H3212}{(H8799)} every man{H376} unto his place{H4725}."
Judges,9,56,"Thus God{H430} rendered{H7725}{(H8686)} the wickedness{H7451} of Abimelech{H40}, which he did{H6213}{(H8804)} unto his father{H1}, in slaying{H2026}{(H8800)} his seventy{H7657} brethren{H251}:"
Judges,9,57,And all the evil{H7451} of the men{H582} of Shechem{H7927} did God{H430} render{H7725}{(H8689)} upon their heads{H7218}: and upon them came{H935}{(H8799)} the curse{H7045} of Jotham{H3147} the son{H1121} of Jerubbaal{H3378}.
Judges,10,1,"And after{H310} Abimelech{H40} there arose{H6965}{(H8799)} to defend{H3467}{(H8687)} Israel{H3478} Tola{H8439} the son{H1121} of Puah{H6312}, the son{H1121} of Dodo{H1734}, a man{H376} of Issachar{H3485}; and he dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} in Shamir{H8069} in mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}."
Judges,10,2,"And he judged{H8199}{(H8799)} Israel{H3478} twenty{H6242} and three{H7969} years{H8141}, and died{H4191}{(H8799)}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} in Shamir{H8069}."
Judges,10,3,"And after{H310} him arose{H6965}{(H8799)} Jair{H2971}, a Gileadite{H1569}, and judged{H8199}{(H8799)} Israel{H3478} twenty{H6242} and two{H8147} years{H8141}."
Judges,10,4,"And he had thirty{H7970} sons{H1121} that rode{H7392}{(H8802)} on thirty{H7970} ass colts{H5895}, and they had thirty{H7970} cities{H5892}, which are called{H7121}{(H8799)} Havothjair{H2334} unto this day{H3117}, which are in the land{H776} of Gilead{H1568}."
Judges,10,5,"And Jair{H2971} died{H4191}{(H8799)}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} in Camon{H7056}."
Judges,10,6,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} did{H6213}{(H8800)} evil{H7451} again{H3254}{(H8686)} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, and served{H5647}{(H8799)} Baalim{H1168}, and Ashtaroth{H6252}, and the gods{H430} of Syria{H758}, and the gods{H430} of Zidon{H6721}, and the gods{H430} of Moab{H4124}, and the gods{H430} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, and the gods{H430} of the Philistines{H6430}, and forsook{H5800}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}, and served{H5647}{(H8804)} not him."
Judges,10,7,"And the anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} was hot{H2734}{(H8799)} against Israel{H3478}, and he sold{H4376}{(H8799)} them into the hands{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430}, and into the hands{H3027} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}."
Judges,10,8,"And that year{H8141} they vexed{H7492}{(H8799)} and oppressed{H7533}{(H8779)} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}: eighteen{H8083}{H6240} years{H8141}, all the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} that were on the other side{H5676} Jordan{H3383} in the land{H776} of the Amorites{H567}, which is in Gilead{H1568}."
Judges,10,9,"Moreover the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} passed over{H5674}{(H8799)} Jordan{H3383} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} also against Judah{H3063}, and against Benjamin{H1144}, and against the house{H1004} of Ephraim{H669}; so that Israel{H3478} was sore{H3966} distressed{H3334}{(H8799)}."
Judges,10,10,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} cried{H2199}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, We have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against thee, both because we have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} our God{H430}, and also served{H5647}{(H8799)} Baalim{H1168}."
Judges,10,11,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians{H4714}, and from the Amorites{H567}, from the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, and from the Philistines{H6430}?"
Judges,10,12,"The Zidonians{H6722} also, and the Amalekites{H6002}, and the Maonites{H4584}, did oppress{H3905}{(H8804)} you; and ye cried{H6817}{(H8799)} to me, and I delivered{H3467}{(H8686)} you out of their hand{H3027}."
Judges,10,13,"Yet ye have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} me, and served{H5647}{(H8799)} other{H312} gods{H430}: wherefore I will deliver{H3467}{(H8687)} you no more{H3254}{(H8686)}."
Judges,10,14,Go{H3212}{(H8798)} and cry{H2199}{(H8798)} unto the gods{H430} which ye have chosen{H977}{(H8804)}; let them{H1992} deliver{H3467}{(H8686)} you in the time{H6256} of your tribulation{H6869}.
Judges,10,15,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}, We have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}: do{H6213}{(H8798)} thou unto us whatsoever seemeth{H5869} good{H2896} unto thee; deliver{H5337}{(H8685)} us only, we pray thee, this day{H3117}."
Judges,10,16,"And they put away{H5493}{(H8686)} the strange{H5236} gods{H430} from among{H7130} them, and served{H5647}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}: and his soul{H5315} was grieved{H7114}{(H8799)} for the misery{H5999} of Israel{H3478}."
Judges,10,17,"Then the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} were gathered together{H6817}{(H8735)}, and encamped{H2583}{(H8799)} in Gilead{H1568}. And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} assembled themselves together{H622}{(H8735)}, and encamped{H2583}{(H8799)} in Mizpeh{H4709}."
Judges,10,18,"And the people{H5971} and princes{H8269} of Gilead{H1568} said{H559}{(H8799)} one{H376} to another{H7453}, What man{H376} is he that will begin{H2490}{(H8686)} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} against the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}? he shall be head{H7218} over all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Gilead{H1568}."
Judges,11,1,"Now Jephthah{H3316} the Gileadite{H1569} was a mighty man{H1368} of valour{H2428}, and he was the son{H1121} of an harlot{H802}{H2181}{(H8802)}: and Gilead{H1568} begat{H3205}{(H8686)} Jephthah{H3316}."
Judges,11,2,"And Gilead's{H1568} wife{H802} bare{H3205}{(H8799)} him sons{H1121}; and his wife's{H802} sons{H1121} grew up{H1431}{(H8799)}, and they thrust out{H1644}{(H8762)} Jephthah{H3316}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Thou shalt not inherit{H5157}{(H8799)} in our father's{H1} house{H1004}; for thou art the son{H1121} of a strange{H312} woman{H802}."
Judges,11,3,"Then Jephthah{H3316} fled{H1272}{(H8799)} from{H6440} his brethren{H251}, and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in the land{H776} of Tob{H2897}: and there were gathered{H3950}{(H8691)} vain{H7386} men{H582} to Jephthah{H3316}, and went out{H3318}{(H8799)} with him."
Judges,11,4,"And it came to pass in process of time{H3117}, that the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} made war{H3898}{(H8735)} against Israel{H3478}."
Judges,11,5,"And it was so, that when the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} made war{H3898}{(H8738)} against Israel{H3478}, the elders{H2205} of Gilead{H1568} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to fetch{H3947}{(H8800)} Jephthah{H3316} out of the land{H776} of Tob{H2897}:"
Judges,11,6,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jephthah{H3316}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and be our captain{H7101}, that we may fight{H3898}{(H8735)} with the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}."
Judges,11,7,"And Jephthah{H3316} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the elders{H2205} of Gilead{H1568}, Did not ye hate{H8130}{(H8804)} me, and expel{H1644}{(H8762)} me out of my father's{H1} house{H1004}? and why are ye come{H935}{(H8804)} unto me now when ye are in distress{H6887}{(H8804)}?"
Judges,11,8,"And the elders{H2205} of Gilead{H1568} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jephthah{H3316}, Therefore we turn again{H7725}{(H8804)} to thee now, that thou mayest go{H1980}{(H8804)} with us, and fight{H3898}{(H8738)} against the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, and be our head{H7218} over all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Gilead{H1568}."
Judges,11,9,"And Jephthah{H3316} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the elders{H2205} of Gilead{H1568}, If ye bring me home again{H7725}{(H8688)} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} against the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, and the LORD{H3068} deliver{H5414}{(H8804)} them before{H6440} me, shall I be your head{H7218}?"
Judges,11,10,"And the elders{H2205} of Gilead{H1568} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jephthah{H3316}, The LORD{H3068} be witness{H8085}{(H8802)} between us, if we do{H6213}{(H8799)} not so according to thy words{H1697}."
Judges,11,11,"Then Jephthah{H3316} went{H3212}{(H8799)} with the elders{H2205} of Gilead{H1568}, and the people{H5971} made{H7760}{(H8799)} him head{H7218} and captain{H7101} over them: and Jephthah{H3316} uttered{H1696}{(H8762)} all his words{H1697} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} in Mizpeh{H4709}."
Judges,11,12,"And Jephthah{H3316} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} unto the king{H4428} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come{H935}{(H8804)} against me to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} in my land{H776}?"
Judges,11,13,"And the king{H4428} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} answered{H559}{(H8799)} unto the messengers{H4397} of Jephthah{H3316}, Because Israel{H3478} took away{H3947}{(H8804)} my land{H776}, when they came up{H5927}{(H8800)} out of Egypt{H4714}, from Arnon{H769} even unto Jabbok{H2999}, and unto Jordan{H3383}: now therefore restore those lands again{H7725}{(H8685)} peaceably{H7965}."
Judges,11,14,And Jephthah{H3316} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} again{H3254}{(H8686)} unto the king{H4428} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}:
Judges,11,15,"And said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} Jephthah{H3316}, Israel{H3478} took not away{H3947}{(H8804)} the land{H776} of Moab{H4124}, nor the land{H776} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}:"
Judges,11,16,"But when Israel{H3478} came up{H5927}{(H8800)} from Egypt{H4714}, and walked{H3212}{(H8799)} through the wilderness{H4057} unto the Red{H5488} sea{H3220}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Kadesh{H6946};"
Judges,11,17,"Then Israel{H3478} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} unto the king{H4428} of Edom{H123}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Let me, I pray thee, pass through{H5674}{(H8799)} thy land{H776}: but the king{H4428} of Edom{H123} would not hearken{H8085}{(H8804)} thereto. And in like manner they sent{H7971}{(H8804)} unto the king{H4428} of Moab{H4124}: but he would{H14}{(H8804)} not consent: and Israel{H3478} abode{H3427}{(H8799)} in Kadesh{H6946}."
Judges,11,18,"Then they went along{H3212}{(H8799)} through the wilderness{H4057}, and compassed{H5437}{(H8799)} the land{H776} of Edom{H123}, and the land{H776} of Moab{H4124}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} by the east side{H4217}{H8121} of the land{H776} of Moab{H4124}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} on the other side{H5676} of Arnon{H769}, but came{H935}{(H8804)} not within the border{H1366} of Moab{H4124}: for Arnon{H769} was the border{H1366} of Moab{H4124}."
Judges,11,19,"And Israel{H3478} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} unto Sihon{H5511} king{H4428} of the Amorites{H567}, the king{H4428} of Heshbon{H2809}; and Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Let us pass{H5674}{(H8799)}, we pray thee, through thy land{H776} into{H5704} my place{H4725}."
Judges,11,20,"But Sihon{H5511} trusted{H539}{(H8689)} not Israel{H3478} to pass{H5674}{(H8800)} through his coast{H1366}: but Sihon{H5511} gathered{H622} all his people{H5971} together{H622}{(H8799)}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} in Jahaz{H3096}, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against Israel{H3478}."
Judges,11,21,"And the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} Sihon{H5511} and all his people{H5971} into the hand{H3027} of Israel{H3478}, and they smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them: so Israel{H3478} possessed{H3423}{(H8799)} all the land{H776} of the Amorites{H567}, the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of that country{H776}."
Judges,11,22,"And they possessed{H3423}{(H8799)} all the coasts{H1366} of the Amorites{H567}, from Arnon{H769} even unto Jabbok{H2999}, and from the wilderness{H4057} even unto Jordan{H3383}."
Judges,11,23,"So now the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} hath dispossessed{H3423}{(H8689)} the Amorites{H567} from before{H6440} his people{H5971} Israel{H3478}, and shouldest thou possess{H3423}{(H8799)} it?"
Judges,11,24,"Wilt not thou possess{H3423}{(H8799)} that which Chemosh{H3645} thy god{H430} giveth thee to possess{H3423}{(H8686)}? So whomsoever the LORD{H3068} our God{H430} shall drive out{H3423}{(H8689)} from before{H6440} us, them will we possess{H3423}{(H8799)}."
Judges,11,25,"And now art thou any thing better{H2896} than Balak{H1111} the son{H1121} of Zippor{H6834}, king{H4428} of Moab{H4124}? did he ever{H7378}{(H8800)} strive{H7378}{(H8804)} against Israel{H3478}, or did he ever{H3898}{(H8736)} fight{H3898}{(H8738)} against them,"
Judges,11,26,"While Israel{H3478} dwelt{H3427}{(H8800)} in Heshbon{H2809} and her towns{H1323}, and in Aroer{H6177} and her towns{H1323}, and in all the cities{H5892} that be along by the coasts{H3027} of Arnon{H769}, three{H7969} hundred{H3967} years{H8141}? why therefore did ye not recover{H5337}{(H8689)} them within that time{H6256}?"
Judges,11,27,"Wherefore I have not sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against thee, but thou doest{H6213}{(H8802)}{H853} me wrong{H7451} to war{H3898}{(H8736)} against me: the LORD{H3068} the Judge{H8199}{(H8802)} be judge{H8199}{(H8799)} this day{H3117} between the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} and the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}."
Judges,11,28,Howbeit the king{H4428} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not unto the words{H1697} of Jephthah{H3316} which he sent{H7971}{(H8804)} him.
Judges,11,29,"Then the Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} came upon Jephthah{H3316}, and he passed over{H5674}{(H8799)} Gilead{H1568}, and Manasseh{H4519}, and passed over{H5674}{(H8799)} Mizpeh{H4708} of Gilead{H1568}, and from Mizpeh{H4708} of Gilead{H1568} he passed over{H5674}{(H8804)} unto the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}."
Judges,11,30,"And Jephthah{H3316} vowed{H5087}{(H8799)} a vow{H5088} unto the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, If thou shalt without fail{H5414}{(H8800)} deliver{H5414}{(H8799)} the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} into mine hands{H3027},"
Judges,11,31,"Then it shall be, that whatsoever{H3318}{(H8802)} cometh forth{H3318}{(H8799)} of the doors{H1817} of my house{H1004} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} me, when I return{H7725}{(H8800)} in peace{H7965} from the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, shall surely be the LORD'S{H3068}, and I will offer it up{H5927}{(H8689)} for a burnt offering{H5930}."
Judges,11,32,So Jephthah{H3316} passed over{H5674}{(H8799)} unto the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} against them; and the LORD{H3068} delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} them into his hands{H3027}.
Judges,11,33,"And he smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them from Aroer{H6177}, even till thou come{H935}{(H8800)} to Minnith{H4511}, even twenty{H6242} cities{H5892}, and unto the plain{H58} of the vineyards{H3754}{(H8677)}{H64}, with a very{H3966} great{H1419} slaughter{H4347}. Thus the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} were subdued{H3665}{(H8735)} before{H6440} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}."
Judges,11,34,"And Jephthah{H3316} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Mizpeh{H4709} unto his house{H1004}, and, behold, his daughter{H1323} came out{H3318}{(H8802)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} him with timbrels{H8596} and with dances{H4246}: and she was his only child{H3173}; beside her he had neither son{H1121} nor{H176} daughter{H1323}."
Judges,11,35,"And it came to pass, when he saw{H7200}{(H8800)} her, that he rent{H7167}{(H8799)} his clothes{H899}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Alas{H162}, my daughter{H1323}! thou hast brought{H3766} me very{H3766}{(H8689)} low{H3766}{(H8687)}, and thou art one of them that trouble{H5916}{(H8802)} me: for I have opened{H6475}{(H8804)} my mouth{H6310} unto the LORD{H3068}, and I cannot{H3201}{(H8799)} go back{H7725}{(H8800)}."
Judges,11,36,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, My father{H1}, if thou hast opened{H6475}{(H8804)} thy mouth{H6310} unto the LORD{H3068}, do{H6213}{(H8798)} to me according to that which{H834} hath proceeded{H3318}{(H8804)} out of thy mouth{H6310}; forasmuch{H310} as the LORD{H3068} hath taken{H6213}{(H8804)} vengeance{H5360} for thee of thine enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, even of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}."
Judges,11,37,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her father{H1}, Let this thing{H1697} be done{H6213}{(H8735)} for me: let me alone{H7503}{(H8685)} two{H8147} months{H2320}, that I may go up{H3212}{(H8799)} and down{H3381}{(H8804)} upon the mountains{H2022}, and bewail{H1058}{(H8799)} my virginity{H1331}, I and my fellows{H7464}{(H8675)}{H7474}."
Judges,11,38,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}. And he sent her away{H7971}{(H8799)} for two{H8147} months{H2320}: and she went{H3212}{(H8799)} with her companions{H7464}, and bewailed{H1058}{(H8799)} her virginity{H1331} upon the mountains{H2022}."
Judges,11,39,"And it came to pass at the end{H7093} of two{H8147} months{H2320}, that she returned{H7725}{(H8799)} unto her father{H1}, who did{H6213}{(H8799)} with her according to his vow{H5088} which he had vowed{H5087}{(H8804)}: and she knew{H3045}{(H8804)} no man{H376}. And it was a custom{H2706} in Israel{H3478},"
Judges,11,40,That the daughters{H1323} of Israel{H3478} went{H3212}{(H8799)} yearly{H3117}{H3117} to lament{H8567}{(H8763)} the daughter{H1323} of Jephthah{H3316} the Gileadite{H1569} four{H702} days{H3117} in a year{H8141}.
Judges,12,1,"And the men{H376} of Ephraim{H669} gathered themselves together{H6817}{(H8735)}, and went{H5674}{(H8799)} northward{H6828}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jephthah{H3316}, Wherefore passedst thou over{H5674}{(H8804)} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} against the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, and didst not call{H7121}{(H8804)} us to go{H3212}{(H8800)} with thee? we will burn{H8313}{(H8799)} thine house{H1004} upon thee with fire{H784}."
Judges,12,2,"And Jephthah{H3316} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, I and my people{H5971} were{H1961}{(H8804)} at great{H3966} strife{H376}{H7379} with the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}; and when I called{H2199}{(H8799)} you, ye delivered{H3467}{(H8689)} me not out of their hands{H3027}."
Judges,12,3,"And when I saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that ye delivered{H3467}{(H8688)} me not, I put{H7760}{(H8799)} my life{H5315} in my hands{H3709}, and passed over{H5674}{(H8799)} against the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, and the LORD{H3068} delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} them into my hand{H3027}: wherefore then are ye come up{H5927}{(H8804)} unto me this day{H3117}, to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} against me?"
Judges,12,4,"Then Jephthah{H3316} gathered together{H6908}{(H8799)} all the men{H582} of Gilead{H1568}, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} with Ephraim{H669}: and the men{H582} of Gilead{H1568} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} Ephraim{H669}, because they said{H559}{(H8804)}, Ye Gileadites{H1568} are fugitives{H6412} of Ephraim{H669} among{H8432} the Ephraimites{H669}, and among{H8432} the Manassites{H4519}."
Judges,12,5,"And the Gileadites{H1568} took{H3920}{(H8799)} the passages{H4569} of Jordan{H3383} before the Ephraimites{H669}: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites{H669} which were escaped{H6412} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let me go over{H5674}{(H8799)}; that the men{H582} of Gilead{H1568} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite{H673}? If he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Nay;"
Judges,12,6,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} they unto him, Say{H559}{(H8798)} now Shibboleth{H7641}: and he said{H559}{(H8799)} Sibboleth{H5451}: for he could not frame{H3559} to pronounce{H1696}{(H8763)} it right{H3559}{(H8686)}. Then they took{H270}{(H8799)} him, and slew{H7819}{(H8799)} him at the passages{H4569} of Jordan{H3383}: and there fell{H5307}{(H8799)} at that time{H6256} of the Ephraimites{H669} forty{H705} and two{H8147} thousand{H505}."
Judges,12,7,"And Jephthah{H3316} judged{H8199}{(H8799)} Israel{H3478} six{H8337} years{H8141}. Then died{H4191}{(H8799)} Jephthah{H3316} the Gileadite{H1569}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} in one of the cities{H5892} of Gilead{H1568}."
Judges,12,8,And after{H310} him Ibzan{H78} of Bethlehem{H1035} judged{H8199}{(H8799)} Israel{H3478}.
Judges,12,9,"And he had thirty{H7970} sons{H1121}, and thirty{H7970} daughters{H1323}, whom he sent{H7971}{(H8765)} abroad{H2351}, and took{H935}{(H8689)} in thirty{H7970} daughters{H1323} from abroad{H2351} for his sons{H1121}. And he judged{H8199}{(H8799)} Israel{H3478} seven{H7651} years{H8141}."
Judges,12,10,"Then died{H4191}{(H8799)} Ibzan{H78}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} at Bethlehem{H1035}."
Judges,12,11,"And after{H310} him Elon{H356}, a Zebulonite{H2075}, judged{H8199}{(H8799)} Israel{H3478}; and he judged{H8199}{(H8799)} Israel{H3478} ten{H6235} years{H8141}."
Judges,12,12,"And Elon{H356} the Zebulonite{H2075} died{H4191}{(H8799)}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} in Aijalon{H357} in the country{H776} of Zebulun{H2074}."
Judges,12,13,"And after{H310} him Abdon{H5658} the son{H1121} of Hillel{H1985}, a Pirathonite{H6553}, judged{H8199}{(H8799)} Israel{H3478}."
Judges,12,14,"And he had forty{H705} sons{H1121} and thirty{H7970} nephews{H1121}{H1121}, that rode{H7392}{(H8802)} on threescore and ten{H7657} ass colts{H5895}: and he judged{H8199}{(H8799)} Israel{H3478} eight{H8083} years{H8141}."
Judges,12,15,"And Abdon{H5658} the son{H1121} of Hillel{H1985} the Pirathonite{H6553} died{H4191}{(H8799)}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} in Pirathon{H6552} in the land{H776} of Ephraim{H669}, in the mount{H2022} of the Amalekites{H6003}."
Judges,13,1,And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} did{H6213}{(H8800)} evil{H7451} again{H3254}{(H8686)} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}; and the LORD{H3068} delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} them into the hand{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430} forty{H705} years{H8141}.
Judges,13,2,"And there was a certain{H259} man{H376} of Zorah{H6881}, of the family{H4940} of the Danites{H1839}, whose name{H8034} was Manoah{H4495}; and his wife{H802} was barren{H6135}, and bare{H3205}{(H8804)} not."
Judges,13,3,"And the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} appeared{H7200}{(H8735)} unto the woman{H802}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Behold now, thou art barren{H6135}, and bearest{H3205}{(H8804)} not: but thou shalt conceive{H2029}{(H8804)}, and bear{H3205}{(H8804)} a son{H1121}."
Judges,13,4,"Now therefore beware{H8104}{(H8734)}, I pray thee, and drink{H8354}{(H8799)} not wine{H3196} nor strong drink{H7941}, and eat{H398}{(H8799)} not any unclean{H2931} thing:"
Judges,13,5,"For, lo, thou shalt conceive{H2030}, and bear{H3205}{(H8802)} a son{H1121}; and no razor{H4177} shall come{H5927}{(H8799)} on his head{H7218}: for the child{H5288} shall be a Nazarite{H5139} unto God{H430} from the womb{H990}: and he shall begin{H2490}{(H8686)} to deliver{H3467}{(H8687)} Israel{H3478} out of the hand{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430}."
Judges,13,6,"Then the woman{H802} came{H935}{(H8799)} and told{H559}{(H8799)} her husband{H376}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, A man{H376} of God{H430} came{H935}{(H8804)} unto me, and his countenance{H4758} was like the countenance{H4758} of an angel{H4397} of God{H430}, very{H3966} terrible{H3372}{(H8737)}: but I asked{H7592}{(H8804)} him not whence he was, neither told{H5046}{(H8689)} he me his name{H8034}:"
Judges,13,7,"But he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive{H2030}, and bear{H3205}{(H8802)} a son{H1121}; and now drink{H7941} no wine{H3196} nor strong drink{H8354}{(H8799)}, neither eat{H398}{(H8799)} any unclean{H2932} thing: for the child{H5288} shall be a Nazarite{H5139} to God{H430} from the womb{H990} to the day{H3117} of his death{H4194}."
Judges,13,8,"Then Manoah{H4495} intreated{H6279}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, O{H994} my Lord{H136}, let{H4994} the man{H376} of God{H430} which thou didst send{H7971}{(H8804)} come again{H935}{(H8799)} unto us, and teach{H3384}{(H8686)} us what we shall do{H6213}{(H8799)} unto the child{H5288} that shall be born{H3205}{(H8795)}."
Judges,13,9,And God{H430} hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} to the voice{H6963} of Manoah{H4495}; and the angel{H4397} of God{H430} came again{H935}{(H8799)} unto the woman{H802} as she sat{H3427}{(H8802)} in the field{H7704}: but Manoah{H4495} her husband{H376} was not with her.
Judges,13,10,"And the woman{H802} made haste{H4116}{(H8762)}, and ran{H7323}{(H8799)}, and shewed{H5046}{(H8686)} her husband{H376}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Behold, the man{H376} hath appeared{H7200}{(H8738)} unto me, that came{H935}{(H8804)} unto me the other day{H3117}."
Judges,13,11,"And Manoah{H4495} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} after{H310} his wife{H802}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to the man{H376}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Art thou the man{H376} that spakest{H1696}{(H8765)} unto the woman{H802}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I am."
Judges,13,12,"And Manoah{H4495} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Now let thy words{H1697} come to pass{H935}{(H8799)}. How shall we order{H4941} the child{H5288}, and how shall we do{H4639} unto him?"
Judges,13,13,"And the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Manoah{H4495}, Of all that I said{H559}{(H8804)} unto the woman{H802} let her beware{H8104}{(H8735)}."
Judges,13,14,"She may not eat{H398}{(H8799)} of any thing that cometh{H3318}{(H8799)} of the vine{H1612}, neither let her drink{H8354}{(H8799)} wine{H3196} or strong drink{H7941}, nor eat{H398}{(H8799)} any unclean{H2932} thing: all that I commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} her let her observe{H8104}{(H8799)}."
Judges,13,15,"And Manoah{H4495} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068}, I pray thee, let us detain{H6113}{(H8799)} thee, until we shall have made ready{H6213}{(H8799)} a kid{H1423}{H5795} for{H6440} thee."
Judges,13,16,"And the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Manoah{H4495}, Though thou detain{H6113}{(H8799)} me, I will not eat{H398}{(H8799)} of thy bread{H3899}: and if{H518} thou wilt offer{H6213}{(H8799)} a burnt offering{H5930}, thou must offer{H5927}{(H8686)} it unto the LORD{H3068}. For Manoah{H4495} knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not that he was an angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068}."
Judges,13,17,"And Manoah{H4495} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068}, What is thy name{H8034}, that when thy sayings{H1697} come to pass{H935}{(H8799)} we may do thee honour{H3513}{(H8765)}?"
Judges,13,18,"And the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Why askest{H7592}{(H8799)} thou thus after my name{H8034}, seeing it is secret{H6383}{(H8675)}{H6383}?"
Judges,13,19,"So Manoah{H4495} took{H3947}{(H8799)} a kid{H1423}{H5795} with a meat offering{H4503}, and offered{H5927}{(H8799)} it upon a rock{H6697} unto the LORD{H3068}: and the angel did{H6213}{(H8800)} wondrously{H6381}{(H8688)}; and Manoah{H4495} and his wife{H802} looked on{H7200}{(H8802)}."
Judges,13,20,"For it came to pass, when the flame{H3851} went up{H5927}{(H8800)} toward heaven{H8064} from off the altar{H4196}, that the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} ascended{H5927}{(H8799)} in the flame{H3851} of the altar{H4196}. And Manoah{H4495} and his wife{H802} looked on{H7200}{(H8802)} it, and fell on{H5307}{(H8799)} their faces{H6440} to the ground{H776}."
Judges,13,21,But the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} did no more{H3254}{(H8804)} appear{H7200}{(H8736)} to Manoah{H4495} and to his wife{H802}. Then Manoah{H4495} knew{H3045}{(H8804)} that he was an angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068}.
Judges,13,22,"And Manoah{H4495} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his wife{H802}, We shall surely{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}, because we have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} God{H430}."
Judges,13,23,"But his wife{H802} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, If{H3863} the LORD{H3068} were pleased{H2654}{(H8804)} to kill{H4191}{(H8687)} us, he would not have received{H3947}{(H8804)} a burnt offering{H5930} and a meat offering{H4503} at our hands{H3027}, neither would he have shewed{H7200}{(H8689)} us all these things, nor would as at this time{H6256} have told{H8085}{(H8689)} us such things as these{H2063}."
Judges,13,24,"And the woman{H802} bare{H3205}{(H8799)} a son{H1121}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} his name{H8034} Samson{H8123}: and the child{H5288} grew{H1431}{(H8799)}, and the LORD{H3068} blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} him."
Judges,13,25,And the Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} began{H2490}{(H8686)} to move him at times{H6470}{(H8800)} in the camp{H4264} of Dan{H1835} between Zorah{H6881} and Eshtaol{H847}.
Judges,14,1,"And Samson{H8123} went down{H3381}{(H8799)} to Timnath{H8553}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} a woman{H802} in Timnath{H8553} of the daughters{H1323} of the Philistines{H6430}."
Judges,14,2,"And he came up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} his father{H1} and his mother{H517}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} a woman{H802} in Timnath{H8553} of the daughters{H1323} of the Philistines{H6430}: now therefore get{H3947}{(H8798)} her for me to wife{H802}."
Judges,14,3,"Then his father{H1} and his mother{H517} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Is there never{H369} a woman{H802} among the daughters{H1323} of thy brethren{H251}, or among all my people{H5971}, that thou goest{H1980}{(H8802)} to take{H3947}{(H8800)} a wife{H802} of the uncircumcised{H6189} Philistines{H6430}? And Samson{H8123} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his father{H1}, Get{H3947}{(H8798)} her for me; for she pleaseth me well{H3474}{(H8804)}{H5869}."
Judges,14,4,"But his father{H1} and his mother{H517} knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not that it was of the LORD{H3068}, that he sought{H1245}{(H8764)} an occasion{H8385} against the Philistines{H6430}: for at that time{H6256} the Philistines{H6430} had dominion{H4910}{(H8802)} over Israel{H3478}."
Judges,14,5,"Then went{H3381} Samson{H8123} down{H3381}{(H8799)}, and his father{H1} and his mother{H517}, to Timnath{H8553}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to the vineyards{H3754} of Timnath{H8553}: and, behold, a young{H3715} lion{H738} roared{H7580}{(H8802)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} him."
Judges,14,6,"And the Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} came mightily{H6743}{(H8799)} upon him, and he rent{H8156}{(H8762)} him as he would have rent{H8156}{(H8763)} a kid{H1423}, and he had nothing{H3972} in his hand{H3027}: but he told{H5046}{(H8689)} not his father{H1} or his mother{H517} what he had done{H6213}{(H8804)}."
Judges,14,7,"And he went down{H3381}{(H8799)}, and talked{H1696}{(H8762)} with the woman{H802}; and she pleased{H3474} Samson{H8123} well{H3474}{(H8799)}{H5869}."
Judges,14,8,"And after a time{H3117} he returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to take{H3947}{(H8800)} her, and he turned aside{H5493}{(H8799)} to see{H7200}{(H8800)} the carcase{H4658} of the lion{H738}: and, behold, there was a swarm{H5712} of bees{H1682} and honey{H1706} in the carcase{H1472} of the lion{H738}."
Judges,14,9,"And he took{H7287}{(H8799)} thereof in his hands{H3709}, and went on{H3212}{(H8799)} eating{H398}{(H8800)}, and came{H1980}{(H8800)} to his father{H1} and mother{H517}, and he gave{H5414}{(H8799)} them, and they did eat{H398}{(H8799)}: but he told{H5046}{(H8689)} not them that he had taken{H7287}{(H8804)} the honey{H1706} out of the carcase{H1472} of the lion{H738}."
Judges,14,10,So his father{H1} went down{H3381}{(H8799)} unto the woman{H802}: and Samson{H8123} made{H6213}{(H8799)} there a feast{H4960}; for so used the young men{H970} to do{H6213}{(H8799)}.
Judges,14,11,"And it came to pass, when they saw{H7200}{(H8800)} him, that they brought{H3947}{(H8799)} thirty{H7970} companions{H4828} to be with him."
Judges,14,12,"And Samson{H8123} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, I will now put forth{H2330}{(H8799)} a riddle{H2420} unto you: if ye can certainly{H5046}{(H8687)} declare{H5046}{(H8686)} it me within the seven{H7651} days{H3117} of the feast{H4960}, and find it out{H4672}{(H8804)}, then I will give{H5414}{(H8804)} you thirty{H7970} sheets{H5466} and thirty{H7970} change{H2487} of garments{H899}:"
Judges,14,13,"But if ye cannot{H3201}{(H8799)} declare{H5046}{(H8687)} it me, then shall ye give{H5414}{(H8804)} me thirty{H7970} sheets{H5466} and thirty{H7970} change{H2487} of garments{H899}. And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Put forth{H2330}{(H8798)} thy riddle{H2420}, that we may hear{H8085}{(H8799)} it."
Judges,14,14,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Out of the eater{H398}{(H8802)} came forth{H3318}{(H8804)} meat{H3978}, and out of the strong{H5794} came forth{H3318}{(H8804)} sweetness{H4966}. And they could{H3201}{(H8804)} not in three{H7969} days{H3117} expound{H5046}{(H8687)} the riddle{H2420}."
Judges,14,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh{H7637} day{H3117}, that they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Samson's{H8123} wife{H802}, Entice{H6601}{(H8761)} thy husband{H376}, that he may declare{H5046}{(H8686)} unto us the riddle{H2420}, lest we burn{H8313}{(H8799)} thee and thy father's{H1} house{H1004} with fire{H784}: have ye called{H7121}{(H8804)} us to take that we have{H3423}{(H8800)}? is it not so?"
Judges,14,16,"And Samson's{H8123} wife{H802} wept{H1058}{(H8799)} before him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou dost but hate{H8130}{(H8804)} me, and lovest{H157}{(H8804)} me not: thou hast put forth{H2330}{(H8804)} a riddle{H2420} unto the children{H1121} of my people{H5971}, and hast not told{H5046}{(H8689)} it me. And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Behold, I have not told{H5046}{(H8689)} it my father{H1} nor my mother{H517}, and shall I tell{H5046}{(H8686)} it thee?"
Judges,14,17,"And she wept{H1058}{(H8799)} before him the seven{H7651} days{H3117}, while their feast{H4960} lasted{H1961}{(H8804)}: and it came to pass on the seventh{H7637} day{H3117}, that he told{H5046}{(H8686)} her, because she lay sore{H6693}{(H8689)} upon him: and she told{H5046}{(H8686)} the riddle{H2420} to the children{H1121} of her people{H5971}."
Judges,14,18,"And the men{H582} of the city{H5892} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him on the seventh{H7637} day{H3117} before the sun{H2775} went down{H935}{(H8799)}, What is sweeter{H4966} than honey{H1706}? and what is stronger{H5794} than a lion{H738}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, If{H3884} ye had not plowed{H2790}{(H8804)} with my heifer{H5697}, ye had not found out{H4672}{(H8804)} my riddle{H2420}."
Judges,14,19,"And the Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} came{H6743}{(H8799)} upon him, and he went down{H3381}{(H8799)} to Ashkelon{H831}, and slew{H5221}{(H8686)} thirty{H7970} men{H376} of them, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} their spoil{H2488}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} change{H2487} of garments unto them which expounded{H5046}{(H8688)} the riddle{H2420}. And his anger{H639} was kindled{H2734}{(H8799)}, and he went up{H5927}{(H8799)} to his father's{H1} house{H1004}."
Judges,14,20,"But Samson's{H8123} wife{H802} was given to his companion{H4828}, whom he had used as his friend{H7462}{(H8765)}."
Judges,15,1,"But it came to pass within a while after{H3117}, in the time{H3117} of wheat{H2406} harvest{H7105}, that Samson{H8123} visited{H6485}{(H8799)} his wife{H802} with a kid{H1423}{H5795}; and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will go in{H935}{(H8799)} to my wife{H802} into the chamber{H2315}. But her father{H1} would not suffer{H5414}{(H8804)} him to go in{H935}{(H8800)}."
Judges,15,2,"And her father{H1} said{H559}{(H8799)}, I verily{H559}{(H8800)} thought{H559}{(H8804)} that thou hadst utterly{H8130}{(H8800)} hated{H8130}{(H8804)} her; therefore I gave{H5414}{(H8799)} her to thy companion{H4828}: is not her younger{H6996} sister{H269} fairer{H2896} than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her."
Judges,15,3,"And Samson{H8123} said{H559}{(H8799)} concerning them, Now{H6471} shall I be more blameless{H5352}{(H8738)} than the Philistines{H6430}, though I do{H6213}{(H8802)} them a displeasure{H7451}."
Judges,15,4,"And Samson{H8123} went{H3212}{(H8799)} and caught{H3920}{(H8799)} three{H7969} hundred{H3967} foxes{H7776}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} firebrands{H3940}, and turned{H6437}{(H8686)} tail{H2180} to tail{H2180}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} a{H259} firebrand{H3940} in the midst{H8432} between two{H8147} tails{H2180}."
Judges,15,5,"And when he had set{H1197}{(H8686)} the brands{H3940} on fire{H784}, he let them go{H7971}{(H8762)} into the standing corn{H7054} of the Philistines{H6430}, and burnt up{H1197}{(H8686)} both the shocks{H1430}, and also the standing corn{H7054}, with the vineyards{H3754} and olives{H2132}."
Judges,15,6,"Then the Philistines{H6430} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} this? And they answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Samson{H8123}, the son in law{H2860} of the Timnite{H8554}, because he had taken{H3947}{(H8804)} his wife{H802}, and given{H5414}{(H8799)} her to his companion{H4828}. And the Philistines{H6430} came up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and burnt{H8313}{(H8799)} her and her father{H1} with fire{H784}."
Judges,15,7,"And Samson{H8123} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Though{H518} ye have done{H6213}{(H8799)} this{H2063}, yet will I be avenged{H5358}{(H8738)} of you, and after{H310} that I will cease{H2308}{(H8799)}."
Judges,15,8,And he smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them hip{H7785} and{H5921} thigh{H3409} with a great{H1419} slaughter{H4347}: and he went down{H3381}{(H8799)} and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in the top{H5585} of the rock{H5553} Etam{H5862}.
Judges,15,9,"Then the Philistines{H6430} went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} in Judah{H3063}, and spread{H5203}{(H8735)} themselves in Lehi{H3896}."
Judges,15,10,"And the men{H376} of Judah{H3063} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Why are ye come up{H5927}{(H8804)} against us? And they answered{H559}{(H8799)}, To bind{H631}{(H8800)} Samson{H8123} are we come up{H5927}{(H8804)}, to do{H6213}{(H8800)} to him as he hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} to us."
Judges,15,11,"Then three{H7969} thousand{H505} men{H376} of Judah{H3063} went{H3381}{(H8799)} to the top{H5585} of the rock{H5553} Etam{H5862}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} to Samson{H8123}, Knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} thou not that the Philistines{H6430} are rulers{H4910}{(H8802)} over us? what is this that thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)} unto us? And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, As they did{H6213}{(H8804)} unto me, so have I done{H6213}{(H8804)} unto them."
Judges,15,12,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, We are come down{H3381}{(H8804)} to bind{H631}{(H8800)} thee, that we may deliver{H5414}{(H8800)} thee into the hand{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430}. And Samson{H8123} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Swear{H7650}{(H8734)} unto me, that ye will not fall upon{H6293}{(H8799)} me yourselves."
Judges,15,13,"And they spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, No; but we will bind{H631}{(H8799)} thee fast{H631}{(H8800)}, and deliver{H5414}{(H8804)} thee into their hand{H3027}: but surely{H4191}{(H8687)} we will not kill{H4191}{(H8686)} thee. And they bound{H631}{(H8799)} him with two{H8147} new{H2319} cords{H5688}, and brought him up{H5927}{(H8686)} from the rock{H5553}."
Judges,15,14,"And when he came{H935}{(H8804)} unto Lehi{H3896}, the Philistines{H6430} shouted{H7321}{(H8689)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} him: and the Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} came mightily{H6743}{(H8799)} upon him, and the cords{H5688} that were upon his arms{H2220} became as flax{H6593} that was burnt{H1197}{(H8804)} with fire{H784}, and his bands{H612} loosed{H4549}{(H8735)} from off his hands{H3027}."
Judges,15,15,"And he found{H4672}{(H8799)} a new{H2961} jawbone{H3895} of an ass{H2543}, and put forth{H7971}{(H8799)} his hand{H3027}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} it, and slew{H5221}{(H8686)} a thousand{H505} men{H376} therewith."
Judges,15,16,"And Samson{H8123} said{H559}{(H8799)}, With the jawbone{H3895} of an ass{H2543}, heaps{H2565} upon heaps{H2565}, with the jaw{H3895} of an ass{H2543} have I slain{H5221}{(H8689)} a thousand{H505} men{H376}."
Judges,15,17,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end{H3615}{(H8763)} of speaking{H1696}{(H8763)}, that he cast away{H7993}{(H8686)} the jawbone{H3895} out of his hand{H3027}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} that place{H4725} Ramathlehi{H7437}."
Judges,15,18,"And he was sore{H3966} athirst{H6770}{(H8799)}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} on the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou hast given{H5414}{(H8804)} this great{H1419} deliverance{H8668} into the hand{H3027} of thy servant{H5650}: and now shall I die{H4191}{(H8799)} for thirst{H6772}, and fall{H5307}{(H8804)} into the hand{H3027} of the uncircumcised{H6189}?"
Judges,15,19,"But God{H430} clave{H1234}{(H8799)} an hollow place{H4388} that was in the jaw{H3895}, and there came{H3318}{(H8799)} water{H4325} thereout; and when he had drunk{H8354}{(H8799)}, his spirit{H7307} came again{H7725}{(H8799)}, and he revived{H2421}{(H8799)}: wherefore he called{H7121}{(H8802)} the name{H8034} thereof Enhakkore{H5875}, which is in Lehi{H3896} unto this day{H3117}."
Judges,15,20,And he judged{H8199}{(H8799)} Israel{H3478} in the days{H3117} of the Philistines{H6430} twenty{H6242} years{H8141}.
Judges,16,1,"Then went{H3212}{(H8799)} Samson{H8123} to Gaza{H5804}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} there an harlot{H802}{H2181}{(H8802)}, and went in{H935}{(H8799)} unto her."
Judges,16,2,"And it was told the Gazites{H5841}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Samson{H8123} is come{H935}{(H8804)} hither. And they compassed him in{H5437}{(H8799)}, and laid wait{H693}{(H8799)} for him all night{H3915} in the gate{H8179} of the city{H5892}, and were quiet{H2790}{(H8691)} all the night{H3915}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, In the morning{H1242}, when it is day{H216}, we shall kill{H2026}{(H8804)} him."
Judges,16,3,"And Samson{H8123} lay{H7901}{(H8799)} till midnight{H2677}{H3915}, and arose{H6965}{(H8799)} at midnight{H2677}{H3915}, and took{H270}{(H8799)} the doors{H1817} of the gate{H8179} of the city{H5892}, and the two{H8147} posts{H4201}, and went away{H5265}{(H8799)} with them, bar{H1280} and all, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} them upon his shoulders{H3802}, and carried them up{H5927}{(H8686)} to the top{H7218} of an hill{H2022} that is before{H6440} Hebron{H2275}."
Judges,16,4,"And it came to pass afterward{H310}, that he loved{H157}{(H8799)} a woman{H802} in the valley{H5158} of Sorek{H7796}, whose name{H8034} was Delilah{H1807}."
Judges,16,5,"And the lords{H5633} of the Philistines{H6430} came up{H5927}{(H8799)} unto her, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Entice{H6601}{(H8761)} him, and see{H7200}{(H8798)} wherein his great{H1419} strength{H3581} lieth, and by what means we may prevail{H3201}{(H8799)} against him, that we may bind{H631}{(H8804)} him to afflict{H6031}{(H8763)} him: and we will give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee every one{H376} of us eleven hundred{H505}{H3967} pieces of silver{H3701}."
Judges,16,6,"And Delilah{H1807} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Samson{H8123}, Tell{H5046}{(H8685)} me, I pray thee, wherein thy great{H1419} strength{H3581} lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound{H631}{(H8735)} to afflict{H6031}{(H8763)} thee."
Judges,16,7,"And Samson{H8123} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, If they bind{H631}{(H8799)} me with seven{H7651} green{H3892} withs{H3499} that were never dried{H2717}{(H8795)}, then shall I be weak{H2470}{(H8804)}, and be as another{H259} man{H120}."
Judges,16,8,"Then the lords{H5633} of the Philistines{H6430} brought up{H5927}{(H8686)} to her seven{H7651} green{H3892} withs{H3499} which had not been dried{H2717}{(H8795)}, and she bound{H631}{(H8799)} him with them."
Judges,16,9,"Now there were men lying in wait{H693}{(H8802)}, abiding{H3427}{(H8802)} with her in the chamber{H2315}. And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, The Philistines{H6430} be upon thee, Samson{H8123}. And he brake{H5423}{(H8762)} the withs{H3499}, as a thread{H6616} of tow{H5296} is broken{H5423}{(H8735)} when it toucheth{H7306}{(H8687)} the fire{H784}. So his strength{H3581} was not known{H3045}{(H8738)}."
Judges,16,10,"And Delilah{H1807} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Samson{H8123}, Behold, thou hast mocked{H2048}{(H8765)} me, and told{H1696}{(H8762)} me lies{H3577}: now tell{H5046}{(H8685)} me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound{H631}{(H8735)}."
Judges,16,11,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, If they bind{H631}{(H8799)} me fast{H631}{(H8800)} with new{H2319} ropes{H5688} that never were occupied{H4399}{H6213}{(H8738)}, then shall I be weak{H2470}{(H8804)}, and be as another{H259} man{H120}."
Judges,16,12,"Delilah{H1807} therefore took{H3947}{(H8799)} new{H2319} ropes{H5688}, and bound{H631}{(H8799)} him therewith, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, The Philistines{H6430} be upon thee, Samson{H8123}. And there were liers in wait{H693}{(H8802)} abiding{H3427}{(H8802)} in the chamber{H2315}. And he brake{H5423}{(H8762)} them from off his arms{H2220} like a thread{H2339}."
Judges,16,13,"And Delilah{H1807} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Samson{H8123}, Hitherto{H2008} thou hast mocked{H2048}{(H8765)} me, and told{H1696}{(H8762)} me lies{H3577}: tell{H5046}{(H8685)} me wherewith thou mightest be bound{H631}{(H8735)}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, If thou weavest{H707}{(H8799)} the seven{H7651} locks{H4253} of my head{H7218} with the web{H4545}."
Judges,16,14,"And she fastened{H8628}{(H8799)} it with the pin{H3489}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, The Philistines{H6430} be upon thee, Samson{H8123}. And he awaked{H3364}{(H8799)} out of his sleep{H8142}, and went away{H5265}{(H8799)} with the pin{H3489} of the beam{H708}, and with the web{H4545}."
Judges,16,15,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, How{H349} canst thou say{H559}{(H8799)}, I love{H157}{(H8804)} thee, when thine heart{H3820} is not with me? thou hast mocked{H2048}{(H8765)} me these three{H7969} times{H6471}, and hast not told{H5046}{(H8689)} me wherein thy great{H1419} strength{H3581} lieth."
Judges,16,16,"And it came to pass, when she pressed{H6693}{(H8689)} him daily{H3117} with her words{H1697}, and urged{H509}{(H8762)} him, so that his soul{H5315} was vexed{H7114}{(H8799)} unto death{H4191}{(H8800)};"
Judges,16,17,"That he told{H5046}{(H8686)} her all his heart{H3820}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, There hath not come{H5927}{(H8804)} a razor{H4177} upon mine head{H7218}; for I have been a Nazarite{H5139} unto God{H430} from my mother's{H517} womb{H990}: if I be shaven{H1548}{(H8795)}, then my strength{H3581} will go{H5493}{(H8804)} from me, and I shall become weak{H2470}{(H8804)}, and be like any other man{H120}."
Judges,16,18,"And when Delilah{H1807} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that he had told{H5046}{(H8689)} her all his heart{H3820}, she sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and called{H7121}{(H8799)} for the lords{H5633} of the Philistines{H6430}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Come up{H5927}{(H8798)} this once{H6471}, for he hath shewed{H5046}{(H8689)} me all his heart{H3820}. Then the lords{H5633} of the Philistines{H6430} came up{H5927}{(H8804)} unto her, and brought{H5927}{(H8686)} money{H3701} in their hand{H3027}."
Judges,16,19,"And she made him sleep{H3462}{(H8762)} upon her knees{H1290}; and she called{H7121}{(H8799)} for a man{H376}, and she caused him to shave off{H1548}{(H8762)} the seven{H7651} locks{H4253} of his head{H7218}; and she began{H2490}{(H8686)} to afflict{H6031}{(H8763)} him, and his strength{H3581} went{H5493}{(H8799)} from him."
Judges,16,20,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, The Philistines{H6430} be upon thee, Samson{H8123}. And he awoke{H3364}{(H8799)} out of his sleep{H8142}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will go out{H3318}{(H8799)} as at other times before{H6471}, and shake{H5287}{(H8735)} myself. And he wist{H3045}{(H8804)} not that the LORD{H3068} was departed{H5493}{(H8804)} from him."
Judges,16,21,"But the Philistines{H6430} took{H270}{(H8799)} him, and put out{H5365}{(H8762)} his eyes{H5869}, and brought him down{H3381}{(H8686)} to Gaza{H5804}, and bound{H631}{(H8799)} him with fetters of brass{H5178}; and he did grind{H2912}{(H8802)} in the prison{H631}{(H8803)} house{H1004}."
Judges,16,22,Howbeit the hair{H8181} of his head{H7218} began{H2490}{(H8686)} to grow again{H6779}{(H8763)} after{H834} he was shaven{H1548}{(H8795)}.
Judges,16,23,"Then the lords{H5633} of the Philistines{H6430} gathered them together{H622}{(H8738)} for to offer{H2076}{(H8800)} a great{H1419} sacrifice{H2077} unto Dagon{H1712} their god{H430}, and to rejoice{H8057}: for they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Our god{H430} hath delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} Samson{H8123} our enemy{H341}{(H8802)} into our hand{H3027}."
Judges,16,24,"And when the people{H5971} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} him, they praised{H1984}{(H8762)} their god{H430}: for they said{H559}{(H8804)}, Our god{H430} hath delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} into our hands{H3027} our enemy{H341}{(H8802)}, and the destroyer{H2717}{(H8688)} of our country{H776}, which slew{H2491} many{H7235}{(H8689)} of us."
Judges,16,25,"And it came to pass, when their hearts{H3820} were merry{H2896}, that they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Call{H7121}{(H8798)} for Samson{H8123}, that he may make us sport{H7832}{(H8762)}. And they called{H7121}{(H8799)} for Samson{H8123} out of the prison{H631}{(H8803)} house{H1004}; and he made them{H6440} sport{H6711}{(H8762)}: and they set{H5975}{(H8686)} him between the pillars{H5982}."
Judges,16,26,"And Samson{H8123} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the lad{H5288} that held{H2388}{(H8688)} him by the hand{H3027}, Suffer{H3240}{(H8685)} me that I may feel{H4184}{(H8685)}{(H8675)}{H3237}{(H8685)} the pillars{H5982} whereupon the house{H1004} standeth{H3559}{(H8737)}, that I may lean{H8172}{(H8735)} upon them."
Judges,16,27,"Now the house{H1004} was full{H4390}{(H8804)} of men{H582} and women{H802}; and all the lords{H5633} of the Philistines{H6430} were there; and there were upon the roof{H1406} about three{H7969} thousand{H505} men{H376} and women{H802}, that beheld{H7200}{(H8802)} while Samson{H8123} made sport{H7832}{(H8800)}."
Judges,16,28,"And Samson{H8123} called{H7121}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, O Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, remember{H2142}{(H8798)} me, I pray thee, and strengthen{H2388}{(H8761)} me, I pray thee, only this once{H6471}, O God{H430}, that I may be at once{H259} avenged{H5358}{(H8735)}{H5359} of the Philistines{H6430} for my two{H8147} eyes{H5869}."
Judges,16,29,"And Samson{H8123} took hold{H3943}{(H8799)} of the two{H8147} middle{H8432} pillars{H5982} upon which the house{H1004} stood{H3559}{(H8737)}, and on which it was borne up{H5564}{(H8735)}, of the one{H259} with his right hand{H3225}, and of the other{H259} with his left{H8040}."
Judges,16,30,"And Samson{H8123} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let me die{H4191}{(H8799)}{H5315} with the Philistines{H6430}. And he bowed{H5186}{(H8799)} himself with all his might{H3581}; and the house{H1004} fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon the lords{H5633}, and upon all the people{H5971} that were therein. So the dead{H4191}{(H8801)} which he slew{H4191}{(H8689)} at his death{H4194} were more{H7227} than they which he slew{H4191}{(H8689)} in his life{H2416}."
Judges,16,31,"Then his brethren{H251} and all the house{H1004} of his father{H1} came down{H3381}{(H8799)}, and took{H5375}{(H8799)} him, and brought him up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him between Zorah{H6881} and Eshtaol{H847} in the buryingplace{H6913} of Manoah{H4495} his father{H1}. And he judged{H8199}{(H8804)} Israel{H3478} twenty{H6242} years{H8141}."
Judges,17,1,"And there was a man{H376} of mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}, whose name{H8034} was Micah{H4321}."
Judges,17,2,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his mother{H517}, The eleven hundred{H505}{H3967} shekels of silver{H3701} that were taken{H3947}{(H8795)} from thee, about which thou cursedst{H422}{(H8804)}, and spakest{H559}{(H8804)} of also in mine ears{H241}, behold, the silver{H3701} is with me; I took{H3947}{(H8804)} it. And his mother{H517} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be thou of the LORD{H3068}, my son{H1121}."
Judges,17,3,"And when he had restored{H7725}{(H8686)} the eleven hundred{H505}{H3967} shekels of silver{H3701} to his mother{H517}, his mother{H517} said{H559}{(H8799)}, I had wholly{H6942}{(H8687)} dedicated{H6942}{(H8689)} the silver{H3701} unto the LORD{H3068} from my hand{H3027} for my son{H1121}, to make{H6213}{(H8800)} a graven image{H6459} and a molten image{H4541}: now therefore I will restore{H7725}{(H8686)} it unto thee."
Judges,17,4,"Yet he restored{H7725}{(H8686)} the money{H3701} unto his mother{H517}; and his mother{H517} took{H3947}{(H8799)} two hundred{H3967} shekels of silver{H3701}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} them to the founder{H6884}{(H8802)}, who made{H6213}{(H8799)} thereof a graven image{H6459} and a molten image{H4541}: and they were in the house{H1004} of Micah{H4321}."
Judges,17,5,"And the man{H376} Micah{H4318} had an house{H1004} of gods{H430}, and made{H6213}{(H8799)} an ephod{H646}, and teraphim{H8655}, and consecrated{H4390}{(H8762)}{H3027} one{H259} of his sons{H1121}, who became his priest{H3548}."
Judges,17,6,"In those days{H3117} there was no king{H4428} in Israel{H3478}, but every man{H376} did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was right{H3477} in his own eyes{H5869}."
Judges,17,7,"And there was a young man{H5288} out of Bethlehemjudah{H1035}{H3063} of the family{H4940} of Judah{H3063}, who was a Levite{H3881}, and he sojourned{H1481}{(H8804)} there."
Judges,17,8,"And the man{H376} departed{H3212}{(H8799)} out of the city{H5892} from Bethlehemjudah{H1035}{H3063} to sojourn{H1481}{(H8800)} where he could find{H4672}{(H8799)} a place: and he came{H935}{(H8799)} to mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669} to the house{H1004} of Micah{H4318}, as he journeyed{H6213}{(H8800)}{H1870}."
Judges,17,9,"And Micah{H4318} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Whence{H370} comest{H935}{(H8799)} thou? And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, I am a Levite{H3881} of Bethlehemjudah{H1035}{H3063}, and I go{H1980}{(H8802)} to sojourn{H1481}{(H8800)} where I may find{H4672}{(H8799)} a place."
Judges,17,10,"And Micah{H4318} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Dwell{H3427}{(H8798)} with me, and be unto me a father{H1} and a priest{H3548}, and I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee ten{H6235} shekels of silver{H3701} by the year{H3117}, and a suit{H6187} of apparel{H899}, and thy victuals{H4241}. So the Levite{H3881} went in{H3212}{(H8799)}."
Judges,17,11,And the Levite{H3881} was content{H2974}{(H8686)} to dwell{H3427}{(H8800)} with the man{H376}; and the young man{H5288} was unto him as one{H259} of his sons{H1121}.
Judges,17,12,"And Micah{H4318} consecrated{H4390}{(H8762)}{H3027} the Levite{H3881}; and the young man{H5288} became his priest{H3548}, and was in the house{H1004} of Micah{H4318}."
Judges,17,13,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Micah{H4318}, Now know{H3045}{(H8804)} I that the LORD{H3068} will do me good{H3190}{(H8686)}, seeing I have a Levite{H3881} to my priest{H3548}."
Judges,18,1,In those days{H3117} there was no king{H4428} in Israel{H3478}: and in those days{H3117} the tribe{H7626} of the Danites{H1839} sought{H1245}{(H8764)} them an inheritance{H5159} to dwell in{H3427}{(H8800)}; for unto that day{H3117} all their inheritance{H5159} had not fallen{H5307}{(H8804)} unto them among{H8432} the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}.
Judges,18,2,"And the children{H1121} of Dan{H1835} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} of their family{H4940} five{H2568} men{H582} from their coasts{H7098}, men{H1121} of valour{H2428}, from Zorah{H6881}, and from Eshtaol{H847}, to spy{H7270}{(H8763)} out the land{H776}, and to search{H2713}{(H8800)} it; and they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, search{H2713}{(H8798)} the land{H776}: who when they came{H935}{(H8799)} to mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}, to the house{H1004} of Micah{H4318}, they lodged{H3885}{(H8799)} there."
Judges,18,3,"When they were by the house{H1004} of Micah{H4318}, they knew{H5234}{(H8689)} the voice{H6963} of the young man{H5288} the Levite{H3881}: and they turned in{H5493}{(H8799)} thither, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Who brought{H935}{(H8689)} thee hither{H1988}? and what makest{H6213}{(H8802)} thou in this place? and what hast thou here?"
Judges,18,4,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Thus{H2090} and thus{H2090} dealeth{H6213}{(H8804)} Micah{H4318} with me, and hath hired{H7936}{(H8799)} me, and I am his priest{H3548}."
Judges,18,5,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Ask counsel{H7592}{(H8798)}, we pray thee, of God{H430}, that we may know{H3045}{(H8799)} whether our way{H1870} which we go{H1980}{(H8802)} shall be prosperous{H6743}{(H8686)}."
Judges,18,6,"And the priest{H3548} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} in peace{H7965}: before{H5227} the LORD{H3068} is your way{H1870} wherein ye go{H3212}{(H8799)}."
Judges,18,7,"Then the five{H2568} men{H582} departed{H3212}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Laish{H3919}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the people{H5971} that were therein{H7130}, how they dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} careless{H983}, after the manner{H4941} of the Zidonians{H6722}, quiet{H8252}{(H8802)} and secure{H982}{(H8802)}; and there was no magistrate{H3423}{(H8802)}{H6114} in the land{H776}, that might put them to shame{H3637}{(H8688)} in any thing{H1697}; and they were far{H7350} from the Zidonians{H6722}, and had no business{H1697} with any man{H120}."
Judges,18,8,"And they came{H935}{(H8799)} unto their brethren{H251} to Zorah{H6881} and Eshtaol{H847}: and their brethren{H251} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, What say ye?"
Judges,18,9,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, that we may go up{H5927}{(H8799)} against them: for we have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} the land{H776}, and, behold, it is very{H3966} good{H2896}: and are ye still{H2814}{(H8688)}? be not slothful{H6101}{(H8735)} to go{H3212}{(H8800)}, and to enter{H935}{(H8800)} to possess{H3423}{(H8800)} the land{H776}."
Judges,18,10,"When ye go{H935}{(H8800)}, ye shall come{H935}{(H8799)} unto a people{H5971} secure{H982}{(H8802)}, and to a large{H7342} land{H776}: for God{H430} hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} it into your hands{H3027}; a place{H4725} where there is no want{H4270} of any thing{H1697} that is in the earth{H776}."
Judges,18,11,"And there went{H5265}{(H8799)} from thence of the family{H4940} of the Danites{H1839}, out of Zorah{H6881} and out of Eshtaol{H847}, six{H8337} hundred{H3967} men{H376} appointed{H2296}{(H8803)} with weapons{H3627} of war{H4421}."
Judges,18,12,"And they went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} in Kirjathjearim{H7157}, in Judah{H3063}: wherefore they called{H7121}{(H8804)} that place{H4725} Mahanehdan{H4265} unto this day{H3117}: behold, it is behind{H310} Kirjathjearim{H7157}."
Judges,18,13,"And they passed{H5674}{(H8799)} thence unto mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} unto the house{H1004} of Micah{H4318}."
Judges,18,14,"Then answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the five{H2568} men{H582} that went{H1980}{(H8802)} to spy out{H7270}{(H8763)} the country{H776} of Laish{H3919}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto their brethren{H251}, Do ye know{H3045}{(H8804)} that there is{H3426} in these houses{H1004} an ephod{H646}, and teraphim{H8655}, and a graven image{H6459}, and a molten image{H4541}? now therefore consider{H3045}{(H8798)} what ye have to do{H6213}{(H8799)}."
Judges,18,15,"And they turned{H5493}{(H8799)} thitherward, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to the house{H1004} of the young man{H5288} the Levite{H3881}, even unto the house{H1004} of Micah{H4318}, and saluted{H7592}{(H8799)}{H7965} him."
Judges,18,16,"And the six{H8337} hundred{H3967} men{H376} appointed{H2296}{(H8803)} with their weapons{H3627} of war{H4421}, which were of the children{H1121} of Dan{H1835}, stood{H5324}{(H8737)} by the entering{H6607} of the gate{H8179}."
Judges,18,17,"And the five{H2568} men{H582} that went{H1980}{(H8802)} to spy out{H7270}{(H8763)} the land{H776} went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and came in{H935}{(H8804)} thither, and took{H3947}{(H8804)} the graven image{H6459}, and the ephod{H646}, and the teraphim{H8655}, and the molten image{H4541}: and the priest{H3548} stood{H5324}{(H8737)} in the entering{H6607} of the gate{H8179} with the six{H8337} hundred{H3967} men{H376} that were appointed{H2296}{(H8803)} with weapons{H3627} of war{H4421}."
Judges,18,18,"And these went{H935}{(H8804)} into Micah's{H4318} house{H1004}, and fetched{H3947}{(H8799)} the carved image{H6459}, the ephod{H646}, and the teraphim{H8655}, and the molten image{H4541}. Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the priest{H3548} unto them, What do{H6213}{(H8802)} ye?"
Judges,18,19,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Hold thy peace{H2790}{(H8685)}, lay{H7760}{(H8798)} thine hand{H3027} upon thy mouth{H6310}, and go{H3212}{(H8798)} with us, and be to us{H1961}{(H8800)} a father{H1} and a priest{H3548}: is it better{H2896} for thee to be a priest{H3548} unto the house{H1004} of one{H259} man{H376}, or that thou be a priest{H3548} unto a tribe{H7626} and a family{H4940} in Israel{H3478}?"
Judges,18,20,"And the priest's{H3548} heart{H3820} was glad{H3190}{(H8799)}, and he took{H3947}{(H8799)} the ephod{H646}, and the teraphim{H8655}, and the graven image{H6459}, and went in{H935}{(H8799)} the midst{H7130} of the people{H5971}."
Judges,18,21,"So they turned{H6437}{(H8799)} and departed{H3212}{(H8799)}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} the little ones{H2945} and the cattle{H4735} and the carriage{H3520} before{H6440} them."
Judges,18,22,"And when they were a good way{H7368}{(H8689)} from the house{H1004} of Micah{H4318}, the men{H582} that were in the houses{H1004} near to Micah's{H4318} house{H1004} were gathered together{H2199}{(H8738)}, and overtook{H1692}{(H8686)} the children{H1121} of Dan{H1835}."
Judges,18,23,"And they cried{H7121}{(H8799)} unto the children{H1121} of Dan{H1835}. And they turned{H5437}{(H8686)} their faces{H6440}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Micah{H4318}, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company{H2199}{(H8738)}?"
Judges,18,24,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Ye have taken away{H3947}{(H8804)} my gods{H430} which I made{H6213}{(H8804)}, and the priest{H3548}, and ye are gone away{H3212}{(H8799)}: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, What aileth thee?"
Judges,18,25,"And the children{H1121} of Dan{H1835} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Let not thy voice{H6963} be heard{H8085}{(H8686)} among us, lest angry{H4751}{H5315} fellows{H582} run{H6293}{(H8799)} upon thee, and thou lose{H622}{(H8804)} thy life{H5315}, with the lives{H5315} of thy household{H1004}."
Judges,18,26,"And the children{H1121} of Dan{H1835} went{H3212}{(H8799)} their way{H1870}: and when Micah{H4318} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that they were too strong{H2389} for him, he turned{H6437}{(H8799)} and went back{H7725}{(H8799)} unto his house{H1004}."
Judges,18,27,"And they took{H3947}{(H8804)} the things which Micah{H4318} had made{H6213}{(H8804)}, and the priest{H3548} which he had, and came{H935}{(H8799)} unto Laish{H3919}, unto a people{H5971} that were at quiet{H8252}{(H8802)} and secure{H982}{(H8802)}: and they smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}, and burnt{H8313}{(H8804)} the city{H5892} with fire{H784}."
Judges,18,28,"And there was no deliverer{H5337}{(H8688)}, because it was far{H7350} from Zidon{H6721}, and they had no business{H1697} with any man{H120}; and it was in the valley{H6010} that lieth by Bethrehob{H1050}. And they built{H1129}{(H8799)} a city{H5892}, and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} therein."
Judges,18,29,"And they called{H7121}{(H8799)} the name{H8034} of the city{H5892} Dan{H1835}, after the name{H8034} of Dan{H1835} their father{H1}, who was born{H3205}{(H8795)} unto Israel{H3478}: howbeit{H199} the name{H8034} of the city{H5892} was Laish{H3919} at the first{H7223}."
Judges,18,30,"And the children{H1121} of Dan{H1835} set up{H6965}{(H8686)} the graven image{H6459}: and Jonathan{H3083}, the son{H1121} of Gershom{H1647}, the son{H1121} of Manasseh{H4519}, he and his sons{H1121} were priests{H3548} to the tribe{H7626} of Dan{H1839} until the day{H3117} of the captivity{H1540}{(H8800)} of the land{H776}."
Judges,18,31,"And they set them up{H7760}{(H8799)} Micah's{H4318} graven image{H6459}, which he made{H6213}{(H8804)}, all the time{H3117} that the house{H1004} of God{H430} was in Shiloh{H7887}."
Judges,19,1,"And it came to pass in those days{H3117}, when there was no king{H4428} in Israel{H3478}, that there was a certain{H376} Levite{H3881} sojourning{H1481}{(H8802)} on the side{H3411} of mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}, who took{H3947}{(H8799)} to him a concubine{H802}{H6370} out of Bethlehemjudah{H1035}{H3063}."
Judges,19,2,"And his concubine{H6370} played the whore{H2181}{(H8799)} against him, and went away{H3212}{(H8799)} from him unto her father's{H1} house{H1004} to Bethlehemjudah{H1035}{H3063}, and was there four{H702} whole months{H2320}{H3117}."
Judges,19,3,"And her husband{H376} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} after{H310} her, to speak{H1696}{(H8763)} friendly{H3820} unto her, and to bring her again{H7725}{(H8687)}, having his servant{H5288} with him, and a couple{H6776} of asses{H2543}: and she brought{H935}{(H8686)} him into her father's{H1} house{H1004}: and when the father{H1} of the damsel{H5291} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} him, he rejoiced{H8055}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} him."
Judges,19,4,"And his father in law{H2859}{(H8802)}, the damsel's{H5291} father{H1}, retained{H2388}{(H8686)} him; and he abode{H3427}{(H8799)} with him three{H7969} days{H3117}: so they did eat{H398}{(H8799)} and drink{H8354}{(H8799)}, and lodged{H3885}{(H8799)} there."
Judges,19,5,"And it came to pass on the fourth{H7243} day{H3117}, when they arose early{H7925}{(H8686)} in the morning{H1242}, that he rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} to depart{H3212}{(H8800)}: and the damsel's{H5291} father{H1} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his son in law{H2860}, Comfort{H5582}{(H8798)} thine heart{H3820} with a morsel{H6595} of bread{H3899}, and afterward{H310} go your way{H3212}{(H8799)}."
Judges,19,6,"And they sat down{H3427}{(H8799)}, and did eat{H398}{(H8799)} and drink{H8354}{(H8799)} both{H8147} of them together{H3162}: for the damsel's{H5291} father{H1} had said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the man{H376}, Be content{H2974}{(H8685)}, I pray thee, and tarry all night{H3885}{(H8798)}, and let thine heart{H3820} be merry{H3190}{(H8799)}."
Judges,19,7,"And when the man{H376} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} to depart{H3212}{(H8800)}, his father in law{H2859}{(H8802)} urged{H6484}{(H8799)} him: therefore he lodged{H3885}{(H8799)} there again{H7725}{(H8799)}."
Judges,19,8,"And he arose early{H7925}{(H8686)} in the morning{H1242} on the fifth{H2549} day{H3117} to depart{H3212}{(H8800)}: and the damsel's{H5291} father{H1} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Comfort{H5582}{(H8798)} thine heart{H3824}, I pray thee. And they tarried{H4102}{(H8701)} until afternoon{H3117}{H5186}{(H8800)}, and they did eat{H398}{(H8799)} both{H8147} of them."
Judges,19,9,"And when the man{H376} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} to depart{H3212}{(H8800)}, he, and his concubine{H6370}, and his servant{H5288}, his father in law{H2859}{(H8802)}, the damsel's{H5291} father{H1}, said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Behold, now the day{H3117} draweth{H7503}{(H8804)} toward evening{H6150}{(H8800)}, I pray you tarry all night{H3885}{(H8798)}: behold, the day{H3117} groweth to an end{H2583}{(H8800)}, lodge{H3885}{(H8798)} here, that thine heart{H3824} may be merry{H3190}{(H8799)}; and to morrow{H4279} get you early{H7925}{(H8689)} on your way{H1870}, that thou mayest go{H1980}{(H8804)} home{H168}."
Judges,19,10,"But the man{H376} would{H14}{(H8804)} not tarry that night{H3885}{(H8800)}, but he rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} and departed{H3212}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} over against{H5227} Jebus{H2982}, which is Jerusalem{H3389}; and there were with him two{H6776} asses{H2543} saddled{H2280}{(H8803)}, his concubine{H6370} also was with him."
Judges,19,11,"And when they were by Jebus{H2982}, the day{H3117} was far{H3966} spent{H7286}{(H8804)}; and the servant{H5288} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his master{H113}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, I pray thee, and let us turn in{H5493}{(H8799)} into this city{H5892} of the Jebusites{H2983}, and lodge{H3885}{(H8799)} in it."
Judges,19,12,"And his master{H113} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, We will not turn aside{H5493}{(H8799)} hither into the city{H5892} of a stranger{H5237}, that is not of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}; we will pass over{H5674}{(H8804)} to Gibeah{H1390}."
Judges,19,13,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his servant{H5288}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and let us draw near{H7126}{(H8799)} to one{H259} of these places{H4725} to lodge all night{H3885}{(H8804)}, in Gibeah{H1390}, or in Ramah{H7414}."
Judges,19,14,"And they passed on{H5674}{(H8799)} and went their way{H3212}{(H8799)}; and the sun{H8121} went down{H935}{(H8799)} upon them when they were by{H681} Gibeah{H1390}, which belongeth to Benjamin{H1144}."
Judges,19,15,"And they turned aside{H5493}{(H8799)} thither, to go in{H935}{(H8800)} and to lodge{H3885}{(H8800)} in Gibeah{H1390}: and when he went in{H935}{(H8799)}, he sat him down{H3427}{(H8799)} in a street{H7339} of the city{H5892}: for there was no man{H376} that took{H622}{(H8764)} them into his house{H1004} to lodging{H3885}{(H8800)}."
Judges,19,16,"And, behold, there came{H935}{(H8804)} an old{H2205} man{H376} from his work{H4639} out of the field{H7704} at even{H6153}, which was also{H376} of mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}; and he sojourned{H1481}{(H8804)} in Gibeah{H1390}: but the men{H582} of the place{H4725} were Benjamites{H1145}."
Judges,19,17,"And when he had lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} his eyes{H5869}, he saw{H7200}{(H8799)} a wayfaring{H732}{(H8802)} man{H376} in the street{H7339} of the city{H5892}: and the old{H2205} man{H376} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Whither goest{H3212}{(H8799)} thou? and whence{H370} comest{H935}{(H8799)} thou?"
Judges,19,18,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, We are passing{H5674}{(H8802)} from Bethlehemjudah{H1035}{H3063} toward the side{H3411} of mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}; from thence am I: and I went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Bethlehemjudah{H1035}{H3063}, but I am now going{H1980}{(H8802)} to the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}; and there is no man{H376} that receiveth{H622}{(H8764)} me to house{H1004}."
Judges,19,19,"Yet there is{H3426} both straw{H8401} and provender{H4554} for our asses{H2543}; and there is bread{H3899} and wine{H3196} also for me, and for thy handmaid{H519}, and for the young man{H5288} which is with thy servants{H5650}: there is no want{H4270} of any thing{H1697}."
Judges,19,20,"And the old{H2205} man{H376} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Peace{H7965} be with thee; howsoever{H7535} let all thy wants{H4270} lie upon me; only lodge{H3885}{(H8799)} not in the street{H7339}."
Judges,19,21,"So he brought{H935}{(H8686)} him into his house{H1004}, and gave provender{H1101}{(H8799)} unto the asses{H2543}: and they washed{H7364}{(H8799)} their feet{H7272}, and did eat{H398}{(H8799)} and drink{H8354}{(H8799)}."
Judges,19,22,"Now as they were making their hearts{H3820} merry{H3190}{(H8688)}, behold, the men{H582} of the city{H5892}, certain{H582} sons{H1121} of Belial{H1100}, beset{H5437} the house{H1004} round about{H5437}{(H8738)}, and beat{H1849}{(H8693)} at the door{H1817}, and spake{H559}{(H8799)} to the master{H1167} of the house{H1004}, the old{H2205} man{H376}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Bring forth{H3318}{(H8685)} the man{H376} that came{H935}{(H8804)} into thine house{H1004}, that we may know{H3045}{(H8799)} him."
Judges,19,23,"And the man{H376}, the master{H1167} of the house{H1004}, went out{H3318}{(H8799)} unto them, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Nay{H408}, my brethren{H251}, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly{H7489}{(H8686)}; seeing{H310} that this man{H376} is come{H935}{(H8804)} into mine house{H1004}, do{H6213}{(H8799)} not this folly{H5039}."
Judges,19,24,"Behold, here is my daughter{H1323} a maiden{H1330}, and his concubine{H6370}; them I will bring out{H3318}{(H8686)} now, and humble{H6031}{(H8761)} ye them, and do{H6213}{(H8798)} with them what seemeth{H5869} good{H2896} unto you: but unto this man{H376} do{H6213}{(H8799)} not so{H2063} vile{H5039} a thing{H1697}."
Judges,19,25,"But the men{H582} would{H14}{(H8804)} not hearken{H8085}{(H8800)} to him: so the man{H376} took{H2388}{(H8686)} his concubine{H6370}, and brought{H3318}{(H8686)} her forth{H2351} unto them; and they knew{H3045}{(H8799)} her, and abused{H5953}{(H8691)} her all the night{H3915} until the morning{H1242}: and when the day{H7837} began to spring{H5927}{(H8800)}, they let her go{H7971}{(H8762)}."
Judges,19,26,"Then came{H935}{(H8799)} the woman{H802} in the dawning{H6437}{(H8800)} of the day{H1242}, and fell down{H5307}{(H8799)} at the door{H6607} of the man's{H376} house{H1004} where her lord{H113} was, till it was light{H216}."
Judges,19,27,"And her lord{H113} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} in the morning{H1242}, and opened{H6605}{(H8799)} the doors{H1817} of the house{H1004}, and went out{H3318}{(H8799)} to go{H3212}{(H8800)} his way{H1870}: and, behold, the woman{H802} his concubine{H6370} was fallen down{H5307}{(H8802)} at the door{H6607} of the house{H1004}, and her hands{H3027} were upon the threshold{H5592}."
Judges,19,28,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Up{H6965}{(H8798)}, and let us be going{H3212}{(H8799)}. But none answered{H6030}{(H8802)}. Then the man{H376} took{H3947}{(H8799)} her up upon an ass{H2543}, and the man{H376} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)}, and gat{H3212}{(H8799)} him unto his place{H4725}."
Judges,19,29,"And when he was come{H935}{(H8799)} into his house{H1004}, he took{H3947}{(H8799)} a knife{H3979}, and laid hold{H2388}{(H8686)} on his concubine{H6370}, and divided{H5408}{(H8762)} her, together with her bones{H6106}, into twelve{H8147}{H6240} pieces{H5409}, and sent{H7971}{(H8762)} her into all the coasts{H1366} of Israel{H3478}."
Judges,19,30,"And it was so{H1961}{(H8738)}, that all that saw{H7200}{(H8802)} it said{H559}{(H8804)}, There was no such deed{H2063} done nor seen{H7200}{(H8738)} from the day{H3117} that the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} came up{H5927}{(H8800)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} unto this day{H3117}: consider{H7760}{(H8798)} of it, take advice{H5779}{(H8798)}, and speak{H1696}{(H8761)} your minds."
Judges,20,1,"Then all the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} went out{H3318}{(H8799)}, and the congregation{H5712} was gathered together{H6950}{(H8735)} as one{H259} man{H376}, from Dan{H1835} even to Beersheba{H884}, with the land{H776} of Gilead{H1568}, unto the LORD{H3068} in Mizpeh{H4709}."
Judges,20,2,"And the chief{H6438} of all the people{H5971}, even of all the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}, presented{H3320}{(H8691)} themselves in the assembly{H6951} of the people{H5971} of God{H430}, four{H702} hundred{H3967} thousand{H505} footmen{H376}{H7273} that drew{H8025}{(H8802)} sword{H2719}."
Judges,20,3,"(Now the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} were gone up{H5927}{(H8804)} to Mizpeh{H4709}.) Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, Tell{H1696}{(H8761)} us, how was{H1961}{(H8738)} this wickedness{H7451}?"
Judges,20,4,"And the Levite{H3881}{H376}, the husband{H376} of the woman{H802} that was slain{H7523}{(H8737)}, answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, I came{H935}{(H8804)} into Gibeah{H1390} that belongeth to Benjamin{H1144}, I and my concubine{H6370}, to lodge{H3885}{(H8800)}."
Judges,20,5,"And the men{H1167} of Gibeah{H1390} rose{H6965}{(H8799)} against me, and beset{H5437} the house{H1004} round about{H5437}{(H8799)} upon me by night{H3915}, and thought{H1819}{(H8765)} to have slain{H2026}{(H8800)} me: and my concubine{H6370} have they forced{H6031}{(H8765)}, that she is dead{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Judges,20,6,"And I took{H270}{(H8799)} my concubine{H6370}, and cut her in pieces{H5408}{(H8762)}, and sent{H7971}{(H8762)} her throughout all the country{H7704} of the inheritance{H5159} of Israel{H3478}: for they have committed{H6213}{(H8804)} lewdness{H2154} and folly{H5039} in Israel{H3478}."
Judges,20,7,"Behold, ye are all children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}; give{H3051}{(H8798)} here{H1988} your advice{H1697} and counsel{H6098}."
Judges,20,8,"And all the people{H5971} arose{H6965}{(H8799)} as one{H259} man{H376}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, We will not any{H376} of us go{H3212}{(H8799)} to his tent{H168}, neither will we any{H376} of us turn{H5493}{(H8799)} into his house{H1004}."
Judges,20,9,But now this shall be the thing{H1697} which we will do{H6213}{(H8799)} to Gibeah{H1390}; we will go up by lot{H1486} against it;
Judges,20,10,"And we will take{H3947}{(H8804)} ten{H6235} men{H582} of an hundred{H3967} throughout all the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}, and an hundred{H3967} of a thousand{H505}, and a thousand{H505} out of ten thousand{H7233}, to fetch{H3947}{(H8800)} victual{H6720} for the people{H5971}, that they may do{H6213}{(H8800)}, when they come{H935}{(H8800)} to Gibeah{H1387} of Benjamin{H1144}, according to all the folly{H5039} that they have wrought{H6213}{(H8804)} in Israel{H3478}."
Judges,20,11,"So all the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} were gathered{H622}{(H8735)} against the city{H5892}, knit together{H2270} as one{H259} man{H376}."
Judges,20,12,"And the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} men{H582} through all the tribe{H7626} of Benjamin{H1144}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, What wickedness{H7451} is this that is done{H1961}{(H8738)} among you?"
Judges,20,13,"Now therefore deliver{H5414}{(H8798)} us the men{H582}, the children{H1121} of Belial{H1100}, which are in Gibeah{H1390}, that we may put them to death{H4191}{(H8686)}, and put away{H1197}{(H8762)} evil{H7451} from Israel{H3478}. But the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} would{H14}{(H8804)} not hearken{H8085}{(H8800)} to the voice{H6963} of their brethren{H251} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}:"
Judges,20,14,"But the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} gathered themselves together{H622}{(H8735)} out of the cities{H5892} unto Gibeah{H1390}, to go out{H3318}{(H8800)} to battle{H4421} against the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}."
Judges,20,15,"And the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} were numbered{H6485}{(H8691)} at that time{H3117} out of the cities{H5892} twenty{H6242} and six{H8337} thousand{H505} men{H376} that drew{H8025}{(H8802)} sword{H2719}, beside the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Gibeah{H1390}, which were numbered{H6485}{(H8694)} seven{H7651} hundred{H3967} chosen{H977}{(H8803)} men{H376}."
Judges,20,16,"Among all this people{H5971} there were seven{H7651} hundred{H3967} chosen{H977}{(H8803)} men{H376} lefthanded{H334}{H3027}{H3225}; every one could sling{H7049}{(H8802)} stones{H68} at an hair{H8185} breadth, and not miss{H2398}{(H8686)}."
Judges,20,17,"And the men{H376} of Israel{H3478}, beside Benjamin{H1144}, were numbered{H6485}{(H8694)} four{H702} hundred{H3967} thousand{H505} men{H376} that drew{H8025}{(H8802)} sword{H2719}: all these were men{H376} of war{H4421}."
Judges,20,18,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went up{H5927}{(H8799)} to the house{H1004} of God{H430}{(H8677)}{H1008}, and asked{H7592}{(H8799)} counsel of God{H430}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Which{H4310} of us shall go up{H5927}{(H8799)} first{H8462} to the battle{H4421} against the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144}? And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Judah{H3063} shall go up first{H8462}."
Judges,20,19,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} in the morning{H1242}, and encamped{H2583}{(H8799)} against Gibeah{H1390}."
Judges,20,20,And the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} to battle{H4421} against Benjamin{H1144}; and the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} put themselves in array{H6186}{(H8799)} to fight{H4421} against them at Gibeah{H1390}.
Judges,20,21,"And the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} came forth{H3318}{(H8799)} out of Gibeah{H1390}, and destroyed down{H7843}{(H8686)} to the ground{H776} of the Israelites{H3478} that day{H3117} twenty{H6242} and two{H8147} thousand{H505} men{H376}."
Judges,20,22,"And the people{H5971} the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} encouraged{H2388}{(H8691)} themselves, and set their battle{H4421} again{H3254}{(H8686)} in array{H6186}{(H8800)} in the place{H4725} where they put themselves in array{H6186}{(H8804)} the first{H7223} day{H3117}."
Judges,20,23,"(And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} and wept{H1058}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} until even{H6153}, and asked{H7592}{(H8799)} counsel of the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Shall I go up{H5066}{(H8800)} again{H3254}{(H8686)} to battle{H4421} against the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} my brother{H251}? And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go up{H5927}{(H8798)} against him.)"
Judges,20,24,And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} came near{H7126}{(H8799)} against the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} the second{H8145} day{H3117}.
Judges,20,25,"And Benjamin{H1144} went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} them out of Gibeah{H1390} the second{H8145} day{H3117}, and destroyed down{H7843}{(H8686)} to the ground{H776} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} again eighteen{H8083}{H6240} thousand{H505} men{H376}; all these drew{H8025}{(H8802)} the sword{H2719}."
Judges,20,26,"Then all the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, and all the people{H5971}, went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} unto the house{H1004} of God{H430}{(H8677)}{H1008}, and wept{H1058}{(H8799)}, and sat{H3427}{(H8799)} there before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, and fasted{H6684}{(H8799)} that day{H3117} until even{H6153}, and offered{H5927}{(H8686)} burnt offerings{H5930} and peace offerings{H8002} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}."
Judges,20,27,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} enquired{H7592}{(H8799)} of the LORD{H3068},(for the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of God{H430} was there in those days{H3117},"
Judges,20,28,"And Phinehas{H6372}, the son{H1121} of Eleazar{H499}, the son{H1121} of Aaron{H175}, stood{H5975}{(H8802)} before{H6440} it in those days{H3117},) saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Shall I yet again{H3254}{(H8686)} go out{H3318}{(H8800)} to battle{H4421} against the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} my brother{H251}, or shall I cease{H2308}{(H8799)}?

Judges,20,29,And Israel{H3478} set{H7760}{(H8799)} liers in wait{H693}{(H8802)} round about{H5439} Gibeah{H1390}.
Judges,20,30,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} against the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} on the third{H7992} day{H3117}, and put themselves in array{H6186}{(H8799)} against Gibeah{H1390}, as at other times{H6471}."

Judges,20,32,"And the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} said{H559}{(H8799)}, They are smitten down{H5062}{(H8737)} before{H6440} us, as at the first{H7223}. But the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8804)}, Let us flee{H5127}{(H8799)}, and draw{H5423}{(H8804)} them from the city{H5892} unto the highways{H4546}."

Judges,20,34,"And there came{H935}{(H8799)} against{H5048} Gibeah{H1390} ten{H6235} thousand{H505} chosen{H977}{(H8803)} men{H376} out of all Israel{H3478}, and the battle{H4421} was sore{H3513}{(H8804)}: but they knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not that evil{H7451} was near{H5060}{(H8802)} them."
Judges,20,35,And the LORD{H3068} smote{H5062}{(H8799)} Benjamin{H1144} before{H6440} Israel{H3478}: and the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} destroyed{H7843}{(H8686)} of the Benjamites{H1145} that day{H3117} twenty{H6242} and five{H2568} thousand{H505} and an hundred{H3967} men{H376}: all these drew{H8025}{(H8802)} the sword{H2719}.
Judges,20,36,"So the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that they were smitten{H5062}{(H8738)}: for the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} place{H4725} to the Benjamites{H1145}, because they trusted{H982}{(H8804)} unto the liers in wait{H693}{(H8802)} which they had set{H7760}{(H8804)} beside Gibeah{H1390}."
Judges,20,37,"And the liers in wait{H693}{(H8802)} hasted{H2363}{(H8689)}, and rushed{H6584}{(H8799)} upon Gibeah{H1390}; and the liers in wait{H693}{(H8802)} drew themselves along{H4900}{(H8799)}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} all the city{H5892} with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}."
Judges,20,38,"Now there was an appointed sign{H4150} between the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} and{H5973} the liers in wait{H693}{(H8802)}, that they should make a great{H7235}{(H8685)} flame{H4864} with smoke{H6227} rise up{H5927}{(H8687)} out of the city{H5892}."
Judges,20,39,"And when the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} retired{H2015}{(H8799)} in the battle{H4421}, Benjamin{H1144} began{H2490}{(H8689)} to smite{H5221}{(H8687)} and kill{H2491} of the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} about thirty{H7970} persons{H376}: for they said{H559}{(H8804)}, Surely{H5062}{(H8736)} they are smitten down{H5062}{(H8737)} before{H6440} us, as in the first{H7223} battle{H4421}."
Judges,20,40,"But when the flame{H4864} began{H2490}{(H8689)} to arise up{H5927}{(H8800)} out of the city{H5892} with a pillar{H5982} of smoke{H6227}, the Benjamites{H1145} looked{H6437}{(H8799)} behind{H310} them, and, behold, the flame{H3632} of the city{H5892} ascended up{H5927}{(H8804)} to heaven{H8064}."
Judges,20,41,"And when the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} turned again{H2015}{(H8804)}, the men{H376} of Benjamin{H1144} were amazed{H926}{(H8735)}: for they saw{H7200}{(H8804)} that evil{H7451} was come{H5060}{(H8804)} upon them."
Judges,20,42,Therefore they turned{H6437}{(H8799)} their backs before{H6440} the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} unto the way{H1870} of the wilderness{H4057}; but the battle{H4421} overtook{H1692}{(H8689)} them; and them which came out of the cities{H5892} they destroyed{H7843}{(H8688)} in the midst{H8432} of them.
Judges,20,43,"Thus they inclosed{H3803}{(H8765)} the Benjamites{H1145} round about{H3803}{(H8765)}, and chased{H7291}{(H8689)} them, and trode them down{H1869}{(H8689)} with ease{H4496} over against{H5227} Gibeah{H1390} toward the sunrising{H4217}{H8121}."
Judges,20,44,And there fell{H5307}{(H8799)} of Benjamin{H1144} eighteen{H8083}{H6240} thousand{H505} men{H376}; all these were men{H582} of valour{H2428}.
Judges,20,45,"And they turned{H6437}{(H8799)} and fled{H5127}{(H8799)} toward the wilderness{H4057} unto the rock{H5553} of Rimmon{H7417}: and they gleaned{H5953}{(H8779)} of them in the highways{H4546} five{H2568} thousand{H505} men{H376}; and pursued{H1692}{(H8686)} hard after{H310} them unto Gidom{H1440}, and slew{H5221}{(H8686)} two thousand{H505} men{H376} of them."
Judges,20,46,So that all which fell{H5307}{(H8802)} that day{H3117} of Benjamin{H1144} were twenty{H6242} and five{H2568} thousand{H505} men{H376} that drew{H8025}{(H8802)} the sword{H2719}; all these were men{H582} of valour{H2428}.
Judges,20,47,"But six{H8337} hundred{H3967} men{H376} turned{H6437}{(H8799)} and fled{H5127}{(H8799)} to the wilderness{H4057} unto the rock{H5553} Rimmon{H7417}, and abode{H3427}{(H8799)} in the rock{H5553} Rimmon{H7417} four{H702} months{H2320}."
Judges,20,48,"And the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} turned again{H7725}{(H8804)} upon the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}, as well the men{H4974} of every city{H5892}, as{H5704} the beast{H929}, and all that came to hand{H4672}{(H8737)}: also they set{H7971}{(H8765)} on fire{H784} all the cities{H5892} that they came to{H4672}{(H8737)}."
Judges,21,1,"Now the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} had sworn{H7650}{(H8738)} in Mizpeh{H4709}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, There shall not any{H376} of us give{H5414}{(H8799)} his daughter{H1323} unto Benjamin{H1144} to wife{H802}."
Judges,21,2,"And the people{H5971} came{H935}{(H8799)} to the house{H1004} of God{H430}{(H8677)}{H1008}, and abode{H3427}{(H8799)} there till even{H6153} before{H6440} God{H430}, and lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} their voices{H6963}, and wept{H1058}{(H8799)}{H1065} sore{H1419};"
Judges,21,3,"And said{H559}{(H8799)}, O LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, why is this come to pass in Israel{H3478}, that there should be to day{H3117} one{H259} tribe{H7626} lacking{H6485}{(H8736)} in Israel{H3478}?"
Judges,21,4,"And it came to pass on the morrow{H4283}, that the people{H5971} rose early{H7925}{(H8686)}, and built{H1129}{(H8799)} there an altar{H4196}, and offered{H5927}{(H8686)} burnt offerings{H5930} and peace offerings{H8002}."
Judges,21,5,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who is there among all the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478} that{H834} came{H5927}{(H8804)} not up with the congregation{H6951} unto the LORD{H3068}? For they had made a great{H1419} oath{H7621} concerning him that came not up{H5927}{(H8804)} to the LORD{H3068} to Mizpeh{H4709}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, He shall surely{H4191}{(H8800)} be put to death{H4191}{(H8714)}."
Judges,21,6,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} repented{H5162}{(H8735)} them for Benjamin{H1144} their brother{H251}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, There is one{H259} tribe{H7626} cut off{H1438}{(H8738)} from Israel{H3478} this day{H3117}."
Judges,21,7,"How shall we do{H6213}{(H8799)} for wives{H802} for them that remain{H3498}{(H8737)}, seeing we have sworn{H7650}{(H8738)} by the LORD{H3068} that we will not give{H5414}{(H8800)} them of our daughters{H1323} to wives{H802}?"
Judges,21,8,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, What one{H259} is there of the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478} that came not up{H5927}{(H8804)} to Mizpeh{H4709} to the LORD{H3068}? And, behold, there came{H935}{(H8804)} none{H376} to the camp{H4264} from Jabeshgilead{H3003}{H1568} to the assembly{H6951}."
Judges,21,9,"For the people{H5971} were numbered{H6485}{(H8691)}, and, behold, there were none{H376} of the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jabeshgilead{H3003}{H1568} there."
Judges,21,10,"And the congregation{H5712} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} thither twelve{H8147}{H6240} thousand{H505} men{H376} of the valiantest{H1121}{H2428}, and commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} and smite{H5221}{(H8689)} the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jabeshgilead{H3003}{H1568} with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}, with the women{H802} and the children{H2945}."
Judges,21,11,"And this is the thing{H1697} that ye shall do{H6213}{(H8799)}, Ye shall utterly destroy{H2763}{(H8686)} every male{H2145}, and every woman{H802} that hath lain{H4904} by man{H3045}{(H8802)}."
Judges,21,12,"And they found{H4672}{(H8799)} among the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jabeshgilead{H3003}{H1568} four{H702} hundred{H3967} young{H5291} virgins{H1330}, that had known{H3045}{(H8804)} no man{H376} by lying{H4904} with any male{H2145}: and they brought{H935}{(H8686)} them unto the camp{H4264} to Shiloh{H7887}, which is in the land{H776} of Canaan{H3667}."
Judges,21,13,"And the whole congregation{H5712} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} some to speak{H1696}{(H8762)} to the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} that were in the rock{H5553} Rimmon{H7417}, and to call{H7121}{(H8799)} peaceably{H7965} unto them."
Judges,21,14,And Benjamin{H1144} came again{H7725}{(H8799)} at that time{H6256}; and they gave{H5414}{(H8799)} them wives{H802} which they had saved alive{H2421}{(H8765)} of the women{H802} of Jabeshgilead{H3003}{H1568}: and yet so they sufficed{H4672}{(H8804)} them not.
Judges,21,15,"And the people{H5971} repented{H5162}{(H8737)} them for Benjamin{H1144}, because that the LORD{H3068} had made{H6213}{(H8804)} a breach{H6556} in the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}."
Judges,21,16,"Then the elders{H2205} of the congregation{H5712} said{H559}{(H8799)}, How shall we do{H6213}{(H8799)} for wives{H802} for them that remain{H3498}{(H8737)}, seeing the women{H802} are destroyed{H8045}{(H8738)} out of Benjamin{H1144}?"
Judges,21,17,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, There must be an inheritance{H3425} for them that be escaped{H6413} of Benjamin{H1144}, that a tribe{H7626} be not destroyed{H4229}{(H8735)} out of Israel{H3478}."
Judges,21,18,"Howbeit we may{H3201}{(H8799)} not give{H5414}{(H8800)} them wives{H802} of our daughters{H1323}: for the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} have sworn{H7650}{(H8738)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Cursed{H779}{(H8803)} be he that giveth{H5414}{(H8802)} a wife{H802} to Benjamin{H1144}."
Judges,21,19,"Then they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, there is a feast{H2282} of the LORD{H3068} in Shiloh{H7887} yearly{H3117}{H3117} in a place which is on the north side{H6828} of Bethel{H1008}, on the east side{H4217}{H8121} of the highway{H4546} that goeth up{H5927}{(H8802)} from Bethel{H1008} to Shechem{H7927}, and on the south{H5045} of Lebonah{H3829}."
Judges,21,20,"Therefore they commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} and lie in wait{H693}{(H8804)} in the vineyards{H3754};"
Judges,21,21,"And see{H7200}{(H8804)}, and, behold, if the daughters{H1323} of Shiloh{H7887} come out{H3318}{(H8799)} to dance{H2342}{(H8800)} in dances{H4246}, then come ye out{H3318}{(H8804)} of the vineyards{H3754}, and catch{H2414}{(H8804)} you every man{H376} his wife{H802} of the daughters{H1323} of Shiloh{H7887}, and go{H1980}{(H8804)} to the land{H776} of Benjamin{H1144}."
Judges,21,22,"And it shall be, when their fathers{H1} or their brethren{H251} come{H935}{(H8799)} unto us to complain{H7378}{(H8800)}, that we will say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Be favourable{H2603}{(H8798)} unto them for our sakes: because we reserved{H3947}{(H8804)} not to each man{H376} his wife{H802} in the war{H4421}: for ye did not give{H5414}{(H8804)} unto them at this time{H6256}, that ye should be guilty{H816}{(H8799)}."
Judges,21,23,"And the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} did so{H6213}{(H8799)}, and took{H5375}{(H8799)} them wives{H802}, according to their number{H4557}, of them that danced{H2342}{(H8789)}, whom they caught{H1497}{(H8804)}: and they went{H3212}{(H8799)} and returned{H7725}{(H8799)} unto their inheritance{H5159}, and repaired{H1129}{(H8799)} the cities{H5892}, and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in them."
Judges,21,24,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} departed{H1980}{(H8691)} thence at that time{H6256}, every man{H376} to his tribe{H7626} and to his family{H4940}, and they went out{H3318}{(H8799)} from thence every man{H376} to his inheritance{H5159}."
Judges,21,25,In those days{H3117} there was no king{H4428} in Israel{H3478}: every man{H376} did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was right{H3477} in his own eyes{H5869}.
Ruth,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the days{H3117} when the judges{H8199}{(H8802)} ruled{H8199}{(H8800)}, that there was a famine{H7458} in the land{H776}. And a certain man{H376} of Bethlehemjudah{H1035}{H3063} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to sojourn{H1481}{(H8800)} in the country{H7704} of Moab{H4124}, he, and his wife{H802}, and his two{H8147} sons{H1121}."
Ruth,1,2,"And the name{H8034} of the man{H376} was Elimelech{H458}, and the name{H8034} of his wife{H802} Naomi{H5281}, and the name{H8034} of his two{H8147} sons{H1121} Mahlon{H4248} and Chilion{H3630}, Ephrathites{H673} of Bethlehemjudah{H1035}{H3063}. And they came{H935}{(H8799)} into the country{H7704} of Moab{H4124}, and continued there."
Ruth,1,3,"And Elimelech{H458} Naomi's{H5281} husband{H376} died{H4191}{(H8799)}; and she was left{H7604}{(H8735)}, and her two{H8147} sons{H1121}."
Ruth,1,4,"And they took{H5375}{(H8799)} them wives{H802} of the women{H802} of Moab{H4125}; the name{H8034} of the one{H259} was Orpah{H6204}, and the name{H8034} of the other{H8145} Ruth{H7327}: and they dwelled{H3427}{(H8799)} there about ten{H6235} years{H8141}."
Ruth,1,5,And Mahlon{H4248} and Chilion{H3630} died{H4191}{(H8799)} also both{H8147} of them; and the woman{H802} was left{H7604}{(H8735)} of her two{H8147} sons{H3206} and her husband{H376}.
Ruth,1,6,"Then she arose{H6965}{(H8799)} with her daughters in law{H3618}, that she might return{H7725}{(H8799)} from the country{H7704} of Moab{H4124}: for she had heard{H8085}{(H8804)} in the country{H7704} of Moab{H4124} how that the LORD{H3068} had visited{H6485}{(H8804)} his people{H5971} in giving{H5414}{(H8800)} them bread{H3899}."
Ruth,1,7,"Wherefore she went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} out of the place{H4725} where she was, and her two{H8147} daughters in law{H3618} with her; and they went{H3212}{(H8799)} on the way{H1870} to return{H7725}{(H8800)} unto the land{H776} of Judah{H3063}."
Ruth,1,8,"And Naomi{H5281} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her two{H8147} daughters in law{H3618}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, return{H7725}{(H8798)} each{H802} to her mother's{H517} house{H1004}: the LORD{H3068} deal{H6213}{(H8799)} kindly{H2617} with you, as ye have dealt{H6213}{(H8804)} with the dead{H4191}{(H8801)}, and with me."
Ruth,1,9,"The LORD{H3068} grant{H5414}{(H8799)} you that ye may find{H4672}{(H8798)} rest{H4496}, each{H802} of you in the house{H1004} of her husband{H376}. Then she kissed{H5401}{(H8799)} them; and they lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} their voice{H6963}, and wept{H1058}{(H8799)}."
Ruth,1,10,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Surely we will return{H7725}{(H8799)} with thee unto thy people{H5971}."
Ruth,1,11,"And Naomi{H5281} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Turn again{H7725}{(H8798)}, my daughters{H1323}: why will ye go{H3212}{(H8799)} with me? are there yet any more sons{H1121} in my womb{H4578}, that they may be your husbands{H582}?"
Ruth,1,12,"Turn again{H7725}{(H8798)}, my daughters{H1323}, go{H3212}{(H8798)} your way; for I am too old{H2204}{(H8804)} to have an husband{H376}. If I should say{H559}{(H8804)}, I have{H3426} hope{H8615}, if I should have an husband{H376} also to night{H3915}, and should also bear{H3205}{(H8804)} sons{H1121};"
Ruth,1,13,"Would ye tarry{H7663}{(H8762)} for them{H3860} till they were grown{H1431}{(H8799)}? would ye stay{H5702}{(H8735)} for them{H3860} from having husbands{H376}? nay, my daughters{H1323}; for it grieveth{H4843}{(H8804)} me much{H3966} for your sakes that the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068} is gone out{H3318}{(H8804)} against me."
Ruth,1,14,"And they lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} their voice{H6963}, and wept again{H1058}{(H8799)}: and Orpah{H6204} kissed{H5401}{(H8799)} her mother in law{H2545}; but Ruth{H7327} clave{H1692}{(H8804)} unto her."
Ruth,1,15,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, thy sister in law{H2994} is gone back{H7725}{(H8804)} unto her people{H5971}, and unto her gods{H430}: return{H7725}{(H8798)} thou after{H310} thy sister in law{H2994}."
Ruth,1,16,"And Ruth{H7327} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Intreat{H6293}{(H8799)} me not to leave{H5800}{(H8800)} thee, or to return{H7725}{(H8800)} from following after{H310} thee: for whither thou goest{H3212}{(H8799)}, I will go{H3212}{(H8799)}; and where thou lodgest{H3885}{(H8799)}, I will lodge{H3885}{(H8799)}: thy people{H5971} shall be my people{H5971}, and thy God{H430} my God{H430}:"
Ruth,1,17,"Where thou diest{H4191}{(H8799)}, will I die{H4191}{(H8799)}, and there will I be buried{H6912}{(H8735)}: the LORD{H3068} do{H6213}{(H8799)} so to me, and more{H3254}{(H8686)} also, if ought but death{H4194} part{H6504}{(H8686)} thee and me."
Ruth,1,18,"When she saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that she was stedfastly minded{H553}{(H8693)} to go{H3212}{(H8800)} with her, then she left{H2308}{(H8799)} speaking{H1696}{(H8763)} unto her."
Ruth,1,19,"So they two{H8147} went{H3212}{(H8799)} until they came{H935}{(H8800)} to Bethlehem{H1035}. And it came to pass, when they were come{H935}{(H8800)} to Bethlehem{H1035}, that all the city{H5892} was moved{H1949}{(H8735)} about them, and they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is this Naomi{H5281}?"
Ruth,1,20,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Call{H7121}{(H8799)} me not Naomi{H5281}, call{H7121}{(H8798)} me Mara{H4755}: for the Almighty{H7706} hath dealt very{H3966} bitterly{H4843}{(H8689)} with me."
Ruth,1,21,"I went out{H1980}{(H8804)} full{H4392}, and the LORD{H3068} hath brought me home again{H7725}{(H8689)} empty{H7387}: why then call{H7121}{(H8799)} ye me Naomi{H5281}, seeing the LORD{H3068} hath testified{H6030}{(H8804)} against me, and the Almighty{H7706} hath afflicted{H7489}{(H8689)} me?"
Ruth,1,22,"So Naomi{H5281} returned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and Ruth{H7327} the Moabitess{H4125}, her daughter in law{H3618}, with her, which returned{H7725}{(H8804)} out of the country{H7704} of Moab{H4124}: and they came{H935}{(H8804)} to Bethlehem{H1035} in the beginning{H8462} of barley{H8184} harvest{H7105}."
Ruth,2,1,"And Naomi{H5281} had a kinsman{H4129}{(H8675)}{H3045}{(H8794)} of her husband's{H376}, a mighty{H1368} man{H376} of wealth{H2428}, of the family{H4940} of Elimelech{H458}; and his name{H8034} was Boaz{H1162}."
Ruth,2,2,"And Ruth{H7327} the Moabitess{H4125} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Naomi{H5281}, Let me now go{H3212}{(H8799)} to the field{H7704}, and glean{H3950}{(H8762)} ears of corn{H7641} after{H310} him in whose sight{H5869} I shall find{H4672}{(H8799)} grace{H2580}. And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, my daughter{H1323}."
Ruth,2,3,"And she went{H3212}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)}, and gleaned{H3950}{(H8762)} in the field{H7704} after{H310} the reapers{H7114}{(H8802)}: and her hap{H4745} was to light{H7136}{(H8799)} on a part{H2513} of the field{H7704} belonging unto Boaz{H1162}, who was of the kindred{H4940} of Elimelech{H458}."
Ruth,2,4,"And, behold, Boaz{H1162} came{H935}{(H8802)} from Bethlehem{H1035}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the reapers{H7114}{(H8802)}, The LORD{H3068} be with you. And they answered{H559}{(H8799)} him, The LORD{H3068} bless{H1288}{(H8762)} thee."
Ruth,2,5,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Boaz{H1162} unto his servant{H5288} that was set{H5324}{(H8737)} over the reapers{H7114}{(H8802)}, Whose damsel{H5291} is this?"
Ruth,2,6,"And the servant{H5288} that was set{H5324}{(H8737)} over the reapers{H7114}{(H8802)} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, It is the Moabitish{H4125} damsel{H5291} that came back{H7725}{(H8804)} with Naomi{H5281} out of the country{H7704} of Moab{H4124}:"
Ruth,2,7,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, I pray you, let me glean{H3950}{(H8762)} and gather{H622}{(H8804)} after{H310} the reapers{H7114}{(H8802)} among the sheaves{H6016}: so she came{H935}{(H8799)}, and hath continued{H5975}{(H8799)} even{H227} from the morning{H1242} until now, that she tarried{H3427}{(H8800)} a little{H4592} in the house{H1004}."
Ruth,2,8,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Boaz{H1162} unto Ruth{H7327}, Hearest{H8085}{(H8804)} thou not, my daughter{H1323}? Go{H3212}{(H8799)} not to glean{H3950}{(H8800)} in another{H312} field{H7704}, neither go{H5674}{(H8799)} from hence, but abide{H1692}{(H8799)} here fast by my maidens{H5291}:"
Ruth,2,9,"Let thine eyes{H5869} be on the field{H7704} that they do reap{H7114}{(H8799)}, and go{H1980}{(H8804)} thou after{H310} them: have I not charged{H6680}{(H8765)} the young men{H5288} that they shall not touch{H5060}{(H8800)} thee? and when thou art athirst{H6770}{(H8804)}, go{H1980}{(H8804)} unto the vessels{H3627}, and drink{H8354}{(H8804)} of that which the young men{H5288} have drawn{H7579}{(H8799)}."
Ruth,2,10,"Then she fell{H5307}{(H8799)} on her face{H6440}, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} herself to the ground{H776}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Why have I found{H4672}{(H8804)} grace{H2580} in thine eyes{H5869}, that thou shouldest take knowledge{H5234}{(H8687)} of me, seeing I am a stranger{H5237}?"
Ruth,2,11,"And Boaz{H1162} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, It hath fully{H5046}{(H8715)} been shewed{H5046}{(H8717)} me, all that thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)} unto thy mother in law{H2545} since{H310} the death{H4194} of thine husband{H376}: and how thou hast left{H5800}{(H8799)} thy father{H1} and thy mother{H517}, and the land{H776} of thy nativity{H4138}, and art come{H3212}{(H8799)} unto a people{H5971} which thou knewest{H3045}{(H8804)} not heretofore{H8543}{H8032}."
Ruth,2,12,"The LORD{H3068} recompense{H7999}{(H8762)} thy work{H6467}, and a full{H8003} reward{H4909} be given thee of the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, under whose wings{H3671} thou art come{H935}{(H8804)} to trust{H2620}{(H8800)}."
Ruth,2,13,"Then she said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let me find{H4672}{(H8799)} favour{H2580} in thy sight{H5869}, my lord{H113}; for that thou hast comforted{H5162}{(H8765)} me, and for that thou hast spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} friendly{H3820} unto thine handmaid{H8198}, though I be not like unto one{H259} of thine handmaidens{H8198}."
Ruth,2,14,"And Boaz{H1162} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, At mealtime{H6256}{H400} come{H5066}{(H8798)} thou hither{H1988}, and eat{H398}{(H8804)} of the bread{H3899}, and dip{H2881}{(H8804)} thy morsel{H6595} in the vinegar{H2558}. And she sat{H3427}{(H8799)} beside{H6654} the reapers{H7114}{(H8802)}: and he reached{H6642}{(H8799)} her parched{H7039} corn, and she did eat{H398}{(H8799)}, and was sufficed{H7646}{(H8799)}, and left{H3498}{(H8686)}."
Ruth,2,15,"And when she was risen up{H6965}{(H8799)} to glean{H3950}{(H8763)}, Boaz{H1162} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} his young men{H5288}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Let her glean{H3950}{(H8762)} even among the sheaves{H6016}, and reproach{H3637}{(H8686)} her not:"
Ruth,2,16,"And let fall{H7997}{(H8799)} also some of the handfuls{H6653} of purpose{H7997}{(H8800)} for her, and leave{H5800}{(H8804)} them, that she may glean{H3950}{(H8765)} them, and rebuke{H1605}{(H8799)} her not."
Ruth,2,17,"So she gleaned{H3950}{(H8762)} in the field{H7704} until even{H6153}, and beat out{H2251}{(H8799)} that she had gleaned{H3950}{(H8765)}: and it was about an ephah{H374} of barley{H8184}."
Ruth,2,18,"And she took it up{H5375}{(H8799)}, and went{H935}{(H8799)} into the city{H5892}: and her mother in law{H2545} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} what she had gleaned{H3950}{(H8765)}: and she brought forth{H3318}{(H8686)}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} to her that she had reserved{H3498}{(H8689)} after she was sufficed{H7648}."
Ruth,2,19,"And her mother in law{H2545} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Where hast thou gleaned{H3950}{(H8765)} to day{H3117}? and where{H375} wroughtest{H6213}{(H8804)} thou? blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be he that did take knowledge{H5234}{(H8688)} of thee. And she shewed{H5046}{(H8686)} her mother in law{H2545} with whom she had wrought{H6213}{(H8804)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, The man's{H376} name{H8034} with whom I wrought{H6213}{(H8804)} to day{H3117} is Boaz{H1162}."
Ruth,2,20,"And Naomi{H5281} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her daughter in law{H3618}, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be he of the LORD{H3068}, who hath not left off{H5800}{(H8804)} his kindness{H2617} to the living{H2416} and to the dead{H4191}{(H8801)}. And Naomi{H5281} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, The man{H376} is near of kin{H7138} unto us, one of our next kinsmen{H1350}{(H8802)}."
Ruth,2,21,"And Ruth{H7327} the Moabitess{H4125} said{H559}{(H8799)}, He said{H559}{(H8804)} unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast{H1692}{(H8799)} by my young men{H5288}, until they have ended{H3615}{(H8765)} all my harvest{H7105}."
Ruth,2,22,"And Naomi{H5281} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Ruth{H7327} her daughter in law{H3618}, It is good{H2896}, my daughter{H1323}, that thou go out{H3318}{(H8799)} with his maidens{H5291}, that they meet{H6293}{(H8799)} thee not in any other{H312} field{H7704}."
Ruth,2,23,So she kept fast{H1692}{(H8799)} by the maidens{H5291} of Boaz{H1162} to glean{H3950}{(H8763)} unto the end{H3615}{(H8800)} of barley{H8184} harvest{H7105} and of wheat{H2406} harvest{H7105}; and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} with her mother in law{H2545}.
Ruth,3,1,"Then Naomi{H5281} her mother in law{H2545} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, My daughter{H1323}, shall I not seek{H1245}{(H8762)} rest{H4494} for thee, that it may be well{H3190}{(H8799)} with thee?"
Ruth,3,2,"And now is not Boaz{H1162} of our kindred{H4130}, with whose maidens{H5291} thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth{H2219}{(H8802)} barley{H8184} to night{H3915} in the threshingfloor{H1637}."
Ruth,3,3,"Wash{H7364}{(H8804)} thyself therefore, and anoint{H5480}{(H8804)} thee, and put{H7760}{(H8804)} thy raiment{H8071} upon thee, and get thee down{H3381}{(H8804)} to the floor{H1637}: but make not thyself known{H3045}{(H8735)} unto the man{H376}, until he shall have done{H3615}{(H8763)} eating{H398}{(H8800)} and drinking{H8354}{(H8800)}."
Ruth,3,4,"And it shall be, when he lieth down{H7901}{(H8800)}, that thou shalt mark{H3045}{(H8804)} the place{H4725} where he shall lie{H7901}{(H8799)}, and thou shalt go in{H935}{(H8804)}, and uncover{H1540}{(H8765)} his feet{H4772}, and lay thee down{H7901}{(H8804)}; and he will tell{H5046}{(H8686)} thee what thou shalt do{H6213}{(H8799)}."
Ruth,3,5,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, All that thou sayest{H559}{(H8799)} unto me I will do{H6213}{(H8799)}."
Ruth,3,6,"And she went down{H3381}{(H8799)} unto the floor{H1637}, and did{H6213}{(H8799)} according to all that her mother in law{H2545} bade{H6680}{(H8765)} her."
Ruth,3,7,"And when Boaz{H1162} had eaten{H398}{(H8799)} and drunk{H8354}{(H8799)}, and his heart{H3820} was merry{H3190}{(H8799)}, he went{H935}{(H8799)} to lie down{H7901}{(H8800)} at the end{H7097} of the heap of corn{H6194}: and she came{H935}{(H8799)} softly{H3909}, and uncovered{H1540}{(H8762)} his feet{H4772}, and laid her down{H7901}{(H8799)}."
Ruth,3,8,"And it came to pass at midnight{H2677}{H3915}, that the man{H376} was afraid{H2729}{(H8799)}, and turned{H3943}{(H8735)} himself: and, behold, a woman{H802} lay{H7901}{(H8802)} at his feet{H4772}."
Ruth,3,9,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who art thou? And she answered{H559}{(H8799)}, I am Ruth{H7327} thine handmaid{H519}: spread{H6566}{(H8804)} therefore thy skirt{H3671} over thine handmaid{H519}; for thou art a near kinsman{H1350}{(H8802)}."
Ruth,3,10,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be thou of the LORD{H3068}, my daughter{H1323}: for thou hast shewed{H3190}{(H8689)} more kindness{H2617} in the latter end{H314} than at the beginning{H7223}, inasmuch as thou followedst{H3212}{(H8800)}{H310} not{H1115} young men{H970}, whether poor{H1800} or rich{H6223}."
Ruth,3,11,"And now, my daughter{H1323}, fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not; I will do{H6213}{(H8799)} to thee all that thou requirest{H559}{(H8799)}: for all the city{H8179} of my people{H5971} doth know{H3045}{(H8802)} that thou art a virtuous{H2428} woman{H802}."
Ruth,3,12,And now it is true{H551} that I am thy near kinsman{H1350}{(H8802)}: howbeit there is{H3426} a kinsman{H1350}{(H8802)} nearer{H7138} than I.
Ruth,3,13,"Tarry{H3885}{(H8798)} this night{H3915}, and it shall be in the morning{H1242}, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman{H1350}{(H8799)}, well{H2896}; let him do the kinsman's part{H1350}{(H8799)}: but if he will{H2654}{(H8799)} not do the part of a kinsman{H1350}{(H8800)} to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman{H1350}{(H8804)} to thee, as the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}: lie down{H7901}{(H8798)} until the morning{H1242}."
Ruth,3,14,"And she lay{H7901}{(H8799)} at his feet{H4772} until the morning{H1242}: and she rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} before{H2958} one{H376} could know{H5234}{(H8686)} another{H7453}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let it not be known{H3045}{(H8735)} that a woman{H802} came{H935}{(H8804)} into the floor{H1637}."
Ruth,3,15,"Also he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Bring{H3051}{(H8798)} the vail{H4304} that thou hast upon thee, and hold{H270}{(H8798)} it. And when she held{H270}{(H8799)} it, he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} six{H8337} measures of barley{H8184}, and laid{H7896}{(H8799)} it on her: and she went{H935}{(H8799)} into the city{H5892}."
Ruth,3,16,"And when she came{H935}{(H8799)} to her mother in law{H2545}, she said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who art thou, my daughter{H1323}? And she told{H5046}{(H8686)} her all that the man{H376} had done{H6213}{(H8804)} to her."
Ruth,3,17,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, These six{H8337} measures of barley{H8184} gave{H5414}{(H8804)} he me; for he said{H559}{(H8804)} to me, Go{H935}{(H8799)} not empty{H7387} unto thy mother in law{H2545}."
Ruth,3,18,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} she, Sit still{H3427}{(H8798)}, my daughter{H1323}, until thou know{H3045}{(H8799)} how the matter{H1697} will fall{H5307}{(H8799)}: for the man{H376} will not be in rest{H8252}{(H8799)}, until{H518} he have finished{H3615}{(H8765)} the thing{H1697} this day{H3117}."
Ruth,4,1,"Then went{H5927} Boaz{H1162} up{H5927}{(H8804)} to the gate{H8179}, and sat him down{H3427}{(H8799)} there: and, behold, the kinsman{H1350}{(H8802)} of whom Boaz{H1162} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} came{H5674}{(H8802)} by; unto whom he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Ho{H1945}, such{H6423} a one{H492}! turn aside{H5493}{(H8798)}, sit down{H3427}{(H8798)} here. And he turned aside{H5493}{(H8799)}, and sat down{H3427}{(H8799)}."
Ruth,4,2,"And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} ten{H6235} men{H582} of the elders{H2205} of the city{H5892}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Sit ye down{H3427}{(H8798)} here. And they sat down{H3427}{(H8799)}."
Ruth,4,3,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the kinsman{H1350}{(H8802)}, Naomi{H5281}, that is come again{H7725}{(H8804)} out of the country{H7704} of Moab{H4124}, selleth{H4376}{(H8804)} a parcel{H2513} of land{H7704}, which was our brother{H251} Elimelech's{H458}:"
Ruth,4,4,"And I thought{H559}{(H8804)} to advertise{H1540}{(H8799)}{H241} thee, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Buy{H7069}{(H8798)} it before the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)}, and before the elders{H2205} of my people{H5971}. If thou wilt redeem{H1350}{(H8799)} it, redeem{H1350}{(H8798)} it: but if thou wilt not redeem{H1350}{(H8799)} it, then tell{H5046}{(H8685)} me, that I may know{H3045}{(H8799)}: for there is none to redeem{H1350}{(H8800)} it beside{H2108} thee; and I am after{H310} thee. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will redeem{H1350}{(H8799)} it."
Ruth,4,5,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Boaz{H1162}, What day{H3117} thou buyest{H7069}{(H8800)} the field{H7704} of the hand{H3027} of Naomi{H5281}, thou must buy{H7069}{(H8804)} it also of Ruth{H7327} the Moabitess{H4125}, the wife{H802} of the dead{H4191}{(H8801)}, to raise up{H6965}{(H8687)} the name{H8034} of the dead{H4191}{(H8801)} upon his inheritance{H5159}."
Ruth,4,6,"And the kinsman{H1350}{(H8802)} said{H559}{(H8799)}, I cannot{H3201}{(H8799)} redeem{H1350}{(H8800)} it for myself, lest I mar{H7843}{(H8686)} mine own inheritance{H5159}: redeem{H1350}{(H8798)} thou my right{H1353} to thyself; for I cannot{H3201}{(H8799)} redeem{H1350}{(H8800)} it."
Ruth,4,7,"Now this was the manner in former time{H6440} in Israel{H3478} concerning redeeming{H1353} and concerning changing{H8545}, for to confirm{H6965}{(H8763)} all things{H1697}; a man{H376} plucked off{H8025}{(H8804)} his shoe{H5275}, and gave{H5414}{(H8804)} it to his neighbour{H7453}: and this was a testimony{H8584} in Israel{H3478}."
Ruth,4,8,"Therefore the kinsman{H1350}{(H8802)} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Boaz{H1162}, Buy{H7069}{(H8798)} it for thee. So he drew off{H8025}{(H8799)} his shoe{H5275}."
Ruth,4,9,"And Boaz{H1162} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the elders{H2205}, and unto all the people{H5971}, Ye are witnesses{H5707} this day{H3117}, that I have bought{H7069}{(H8804)} all that was Elimelech's{H458}, and all that was Chilion's{H3630} and Mahlon's{H4248}, of the hand{H3027} of Naomi{H5281}."
Ruth,4,10,"Moreover Ruth{H7327} the Moabitess{H4125}, the wife{H802} of Mahlon{H4248}, have I purchased{H7069}{(H8804)} to be my wife{H802}, to raise up{H6965}{(H8687)} the name{H8034} of the dead{H4191}{(H8801)} upon his inheritance{H5159}, that the name{H8034} of the dead{H4191}{(H8801)} be not cut off{H3772}{(H8735)} from among{H5973} his brethren{H251}, and from the gate{H8179} of his place{H4725}: ye are witnesses{H5707} this day{H3117}."
Ruth,4,11,"And all the people{H5971} that were in the gate{H8179}, and the elders{H2205}, said{H559}{(H8799)}, We are witnesses{H5707}. The LORD{H3068} make{H5414}{(H8799)} the woman{H802} that is come{H935}{(H8802)} into thine house{H1004} like Rachel{H7354} and like Leah{H3812}, which two{H8147} did build{H1129}{(H8804)} the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}: and do{H6213}{(H8798)} thou worthily{H2428} in Ephratah{H672}, and be famous{H7121}{(H8798)}{H8034} in Bethlehem{H1035}:"
Ruth,4,12,"And let thy house{H1004} be like the house{H1004} of Pharez{H6557}, whom Tamar{H8559} bare{H3205}{(H8804)} unto Judah{H3063}, of the seed{H2233} which the LORD{H3068} shall give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee of this young woman{H5291}."
Ruth,4,13,"So Boaz{H1162} took{H3947}{(H8799)} Ruth{H7327}, and she was his wife{H802}: and when he went in{H935}{(H8799)} unto her, the LORD{H3068} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} her conception{H2032}, and she bare{H3205}{(H8799)} a son{H1121}."
Ruth,4,14,"And the women{H802} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Naomi{H5281}, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be the LORD{H3068}, which hath not left{H7673}{(H8689)} thee this day{H3117} without a kinsman{H1350}{(H8802)}, that his name{H8034} may be famous{H7121}{(H8735)} in Israel{H3478}."
Ruth,4,15,"And he shall be unto thee a restorer{H7725}{(H8688)} of thy life{H5315}, and a nourisher{H3557}{(H8771)} of thine old age{H7872}: for thy daughter in law{H3618}, which loveth{H157}{(H8804)} thee, which is better{H2896} to thee than seven{H7651} sons{H1121}, hath born{H3205}{(H8804)} him."
Ruth,4,16,"And Naomi{H5281} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the child{H3206}, and laid{H7896}{(H8799)} it in her bosom{H2436}, and became nurse{H539}{(H8802)} unto it."
Ruth,4,17,"And the women her neighbours{H7934} gave{H7121}{(H8799)} it a name{H8034}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, There is a son{H1121} born{H3205}{(H8795)} to Naomi{H5281}; and they called{H7121}{(H8799)} his name{H8034} Obed{H5744}: he is the father{H1} of Jesse{H3448}, the father{H1} of David{H1732}."
Ruth,4,18,"Now these are the generations{H8435} of Pharez{H6557}: Pharez{H6557} begat{H3205}{(H8689)} Hezron{H2696},"
Ruth,4,19,"And Hezron{H2696} begat{H3205}{(H8689)} Ram{H7410}, and Ram{H7410} begat{H3205}{(H8689)} Amminadab{H5992},"
Ruth,4,20,"And Amminadab{H5992} begat{H3205}{(H8689)} Nahshon{H5177}, and Nahshon{H5177} begat{H3205}{(H8689)} Salmon{H8009},"
Ruth,4,21,"And Salmon{H8012} begat{H3205}{(H8689)} Boaz{H1162}, and Boaz{H1162} begat{H3205}{(H8689)} Obed{H5744},"
Ruth,4,22,"And Obed{H5744} begat{H3205}{(H8689)} Jesse{H3448}, and Jesse{H3448} begat{H3205}{(H8689)} David{H1732}."
1 Samuel,1,1,"Now there was a certain{H259} man{H376} of Ramathaimzophim{H7436}, of mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}, and his name{H8034} was Elkanah{H511}, the son{H1121} of Jeroham{H3395}, the son{H1121} of Elihu{H453}, the son{H1121} of Tohu{H8459}, the son{H1121} of Zuph{H6689}, an Ephrathite{H673}:"
1 Samuel,1,2,"And he had two{H8147} wives{H802}; the name{H8034} of the one{H259} was Hannah{H2584}, and the name{H8034} of the other{H8145} Peninnah{H6444}: and Peninnah{H6444} had children{H3206}, but Hannah{H2584} had no children{H3206}."
1 Samuel,1,3,"And this{H1931} man{H376} went up{H5927}{(H8804)} out of his city{H5892} yearly{H3117}{H3117} to worship{H7812}{(H8692)} and to sacrifice{H2076}{(H8800)} unto the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} in Shiloh{H7887}. And the two{H8147} sons{H1121} of Eli{H5941}, Hophni{H2652} and Phinehas{H6372}, the priests{H3548} of the LORD{H3068}, were there."
1 Samuel,1,4,"And when the time{H3117} was that Elkanah{H511} offered{H2076}{(H8799)}, he gave{H5414}{(H8804)} to Peninnah{H6444} his wife{H802}, and to all her sons{H1121} and her daughters{H1323}, portions{H4490}:"
1 Samuel,1,5,But unto Hannah{H2584} he gave{H5414}{(H8799)} a{H259} worthy{H639} portion{H4490}; for he loved{H157}{(H8804)} Hannah{H2584}: but the LORD{H3068} had shut up{H5462}{(H8804)} her womb{H7358}.
1 Samuel,1,6,"And her adversary{H6869} also provoked{H3707}{(H8765)} her sore{H3708}, for to make her fret{H7481}{(H8687)}, because the LORD{H3068} had shut{H5462}{(H8804)} up{H1157} her womb{H7358}."
1 Samuel,1,7,"And as he did{H6213}{(H8799)} so year{H8141} by year{H8141}, when{H1767} she went up{H5927}{(H8800)} to the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, so she provoked{H3707}{(H8686)} her; therefore she wept{H1058}{(H8799)}, and did not eat{H398}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,1,8,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Elkanah{H511} her husband{H376} to her, Hannah{H2584}, why weepest{H1058}{(H8799)} thou? and why eatest{H398}{(H8799)} thou not? and why is thy heart{H3824} grieved{H3415}{(H8799)}? am not I better{H2896} to thee than ten{H6235} sons{H1121}?"
1 Samuel,1,9,"So Hannah{H2584} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} after{H310} they had eaten{H398}{(H8800)} in Shiloh{H7887}, and after{H310} they had drunk{H8354}{(H8800)}. Now Eli{H5941} the priest{H3548} sat{H3427}{(H8802)} upon a seat{H3678} by a post{H4201} of the temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,1,10,"And she was in bitterness{H4751} of soul{H5315}, and prayed{H6419}{(H8691)} unto the LORD{H3068}, and wept{H1058}{(H8799)} sore{H1058}{(H8800)}."
1 Samuel,1,11,"And she vowed{H5087}{(H8799)} a vow{H5088}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, O LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, if thou wilt indeed{H7200}{(H8800)} look{H7200}{(H8799)} on the affliction{H6040} of thine handmaid{H519}, and remember{H2142}{(H8804)} me, and not forget{H7911}{(H8799)} thine handmaid{H519}, but wilt give{H5414}{(H8804)} unto thine handmaid{H519} a man{H582} child{H2233}, then I will give{H5414}{(H8804)} him unto the LORD{H3068} all the days{H3117} of his life{H2416}, and there shall no razor{H4177} come{H5927}{(H8799)} upon his head{H7218}."
1 Samuel,1,12,"And it came to pass, as she continued{H7235}{(H8689)} praying{H6419}{(H8692)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, that Eli{H5941} marked{H8104}{(H8802)} her mouth{H6310}."
1 Samuel,1,13,"Now Hannah{H2584}, she spake{H1696}{(H8764)} in her heart{H3820}; only her lips{H8193} moved{H5128}{(H8801)}, but her voice{H6963} was not heard{H8085}{(H8735)}: therefore Eli{H5941} thought{H2803}{(H8799)} she had been drunken{H7910}."
1 Samuel,1,14,"And Eli{H5941} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken{H7937}{(H8691)}? put away{H5493}{(H8685)} thy wine{H3196} from thee."
1 Samuel,1,15,"And Hannah{H2584} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, No, my lord{H113}, I am a woman{H802} of a sorrowful{H7186} spirit{H7307}: I have drunk{H8354}{(H8804)} neither wine{H3196} nor strong drink{H7941}, but have poured out{H8210}{(H8799)} my soul{H5315} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,1,16,Count{H5414}{(H8799)} not thine handmaid{H519} for{H6440} a daughter{H1323} of Belial{H1100}: for out of the abundance{H7230} of my complaint{H7879} and grief{H3708} have I spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} hitherto.
1 Samuel,1,17,"Then Eli{H5941} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} in peace{H7965}: and the God{H430} of Israel{H3478} grant{H5414}{(H8799)} thee thy petition{H7596} that thou hast asked{H7592}{(H8804)} of him."
1 Samuel,1,18,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let thine handmaid{H8198} find{H4672}{(H8799)} grace{H2580} in thy sight{H5869}. So the woman{H802} went{H3212}{(H8799)} her way{H1870}, and did eat{H398}{(H8799)}, and her countenance{H6440} was no more sad."
1 Samuel,1,19,"And they rose up{H7925} in the morning{H1242} early{H7925}{(H8686)}, and worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, and returned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to their house{H1004} to Ramah{H7414}: and Elkanah{H511} knew{H3045}{(H8799)} Hannah{H2584} his wife{H802}; and the LORD{H3068} remembered{H2142}{(H8799)} her."
1 Samuel,1,20,"Wherefore it came to pass, when the time{H3117} was come{H8622} about after Hannah{H2584} had conceived{H2029}{(H8799)}, that she bare{H3205}{(H8799)} a son{H1121}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} his name{H8034} Samuel{H8050}, saying, Because I have asked{H7592}{(H8804)} him of the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,1,21,"And the man{H376} Elkanah{H511}, and all his house{H1004}, went up{H5927}{(H8799)} to offer{H2076}{(H8800)} unto the LORD{H3068} the yearly{H3117} sacrifice{H2077}, and his vow{H5088}."
1 Samuel,1,22,"But Hannah{H2584} went not up{H5927}{(H8804)}; for she said{H559}{(H8804)} unto her husband{H376}, I will not go up until the child{H5288} be weaned{H1580}{(H8735)}, and then I will bring{H935}{(H8689)} him, that he may appear{H7200}{(H8738)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, and there abide{H3427}{(H8804)} for{H5704} ever{H5769}."
1 Samuel,1,23,"And Elkanah{H511} her husband{H376} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Do{H6213}{(H8798)} what seemeth{H5869} thee good{H2896}; tarry{H3427}{(H8798)} until thou have weaned{H1580}{(H8800)} him; only the LORD{H3068} establish{H6965}{(H8686)} his word{H1697}. So the woman{H802} abode{H3427}{(H8799)}, and gave her son{H1121} suck{H3243}{(H8686)} until she weaned{H1580}{(H8800)} him."
1 Samuel,1,24,"And when she had weaned{H1580}{(H8804)} him, she took him up{H5927}{(H8686)} with her, with three{H7969} bullocks{H6499}, and one{H259} ephah{H374} of flour{H7058}, and a bottle{H5035} of wine{H3196}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} him unto the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} in Shiloh{H7887}: and the child{H5288} was young{H5288}."
1 Samuel,1,25,"And they slew{H7819}{(H8799)} a bullock{H6499}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} the child{H5288} to Eli{H5941}."
1 Samuel,1,26,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, Oh{H994} my lord{H113}, as thy soul{H5315} liveth{H2416}, my lord{H113}, I am the woman{H802} that stood{H5324}{(H8737)} by thee here, praying{H6419}{(H8692)} unto the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,1,27,For this child{H5288} I prayed{H6419}{(H8694)}; and the LORD{H3068} hath given{H5414}{(H8799)} me my petition{H7596} which I asked{H7592}{(H8804)} of him:
1 Samuel,1,28,Therefore also I have lent{H7592}{(H8689)} him to the LORD{H3068}; as long as he liveth{H3117} he shall be lent{H7592}{(H8803)} to the LORD{H3068}. And he worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)} the LORD{H3068} there.
1 Samuel,2,1,"And Hannah{H2584} prayed{H6419}{(H8691)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, My heart{H3820} rejoiceth{H5970}{(H8804)} in the LORD{H3068}, mine horn{H7161} is exalted{H7311}{(H8804)} in the LORD{H3068}: my mouth{H6310} is enlarged{H7337}{(H8804)} over mine enemies{H341}{(H8802)}; because I rejoice{H8055}{(H8804)} in thy salvation{H3444}."
1 Samuel,2,2,There is none holy{H6918} as the LORD{H3068}: for there is none beside{H1115} thee: neither is there any rock{H6697} like our God{H430}.
1 Samuel,2,3,"Talk{H1696}{(H8762)} no more{H7235}{(H8686)} so exceeding{H1364} proudly{H1364}; let not arrogancy{H6277} come{H3318}{(H8799)} out of your mouth{H6310}: for the LORD{H3068} is a God{H410} of knowledge{H1844}, and by him actions{H5949} are weighed{H8505}{(H8738)}."
1 Samuel,2,4,"The bows{H7198} of the mighty men{H1368} are broken{H2844}, and they that stumbled{H3782}{(H8737)} are girded{H247}{(H8804)} with strength{H2428}."
1 Samuel,2,5,They that were full{H7649} have hired out{H7936}{(H8738)} themselves for bread{H3899}; and they that were hungry{H7457} ceased{H2308}{(H8804)}: so that the barren{H6135} hath born{H3205}{(H8804)} seven{H7651}; and she that hath many{H7227} children{H1121} is waxed feeble{H535}{(H8797)}.
1 Samuel,2,6,"The LORD{H3068} killeth{H4191}{(H8688)}, and maketh alive{H2421}{(H8764)}: he bringeth down{H3381}{(H8688)} to the grave{H7585}, and bringeth up{H5927}{(H8686)}."
1 Samuel,2,7,"The LORD{H3068} maketh poor{H3423}{(H8688)}, and maketh rich{H6238}{(H8688)}: he bringeth low{H8213}{(H8688)}, and{H637} lifteth up{H7311}{(H8789)}."
1 Samuel,2,8,"He raiseth up{H6965}{(H8688)} the poor{H1800} out of the dust{H6083}, and lifteth up{H7311}{(H8686)} the beggar{H34} from the dunghill{H830}, to set{H3427}{(H8687)} them among princes{H5081}, and to make them inherit{H5157}{(H8686)} the throne{H3678} of glory{H3519}: for the pillars{H4690} of the earth{H776} are the LORD'S{H3068}, and he hath set{H7896}{(H8799)} the world{H8398} upon them."
1 Samuel,2,9,"He will keep{H8104}{(H8799)} the feet{H7272} of his saints{H2623}, and the wicked{H7563} shall be silent{H1826}{(H8735)} in darkness{H2822}; for by strength{H3581} shall no man{H376} prevail{H1396}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,2,10,"The adversaries{H7378}{(H8688)} of the LORD{H3068} shall be broken to pieces{H2865}{(H8735)}; out of heaven{H8064} shall he thunder{H7481}{(H8686)} upon them: the LORD{H3068} shall judge{H1777}{(H8799)} the ends{H657} of the earth{H776}; and he shall give{H5414}{(H8799)} strength{H5797} unto his king{H4428}, and exalt{H7311}{(H8686)} the horn{H7161} of his anointed{H4899}."
1 Samuel,2,11,And Elkanah{H511} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Ramah{H7414} to his house{H1004}. And the child{H5288} did{H1961}{(H8804)} minister{H8334}{(H8764)} unto the LORD{H3068} before{H6440} Eli{H5941} the priest{H3548}.
1 Samuel,2,12,Now the sons{H1121} of Eli{H5941} were sons{H1121} of Belial{H1100}; they knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not the LORD{H3068}.
1 Samuel,2,13,"And the priests{H3548}' custom{H4941} with the people{H5971} was, that, when any man{H376} offered{H2076}{(H8802)} sacrifice{H2077}, the priest's{H3548} servant{H5288} came{H935}{(H8804)}, while the flesh{H1320} was in seething{H1310}{(H8763)}, with a fleshhook{H4207} of three{H7969} teeth{H8127} in his hand{H3027};"
1 Samuel,2,14,"And he struck{H5221}{(H8689)} it into the pan{H3595}, or kettle{H1731}, or caldron{H7037}, or pot{H6517}; all that the fleshhook{H4207} brought up{H5927}{(H8686)} the priest{H3548} took{H3947}{(H8799)} for himself. So they did{H6213}{(H8799)} in Shiloh{H7887} unto all the Israelites{H3478} that came{H935}{(H8802)} thither."
1 Samuel,2,15,"Also before they burnt{H6999}{(H8686)} the fat{H2459}, the priest's{H3548} servant{H5288} came{H935}{(H8804)}, and said{H559}{(H8804)} to the man{H376} that sacrificed{H2076}{(H8802)}, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} flesh{H1320} to roast{H6740}{(H8800)} for the priest{H3548}; for he will not have{H3947}{(H8799)} sodden{H1310}{(H8794)} flesh{H1320} of thee, but raw{H2416}."
1 Samuel,2,16,"And if any man{H376} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Let them not fail{H6999}{(H8686)} to burn{H6999}{(H8763)} the fat{H2459} presently{H3117}, and then take{H3947}{(H8798)} as much as thy soul{H5315} desireth{H183}{(H8762)}; then he would answer{H559}{(H8804)} him, Nay; but thou shalt give{H5414}{(H8799)} it me now: and if not, I will take{H3947}{(H8804)} it by force{H2394}."
1 Samuel,2,17,Wherefore the sin{H2403} of the young men{H5288} was very{H3966} great{H1419} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}: for men{H582} abhorred{H5006}{(H8765)} the offering{H4503} of the LORD{H3068}.
1 Samuel,2,18,"But Samuel{H8050} ministered{H8334}{(H8764)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, being a child{H5288}, girded{H2296}{(H8803)} with a linen{H906} ephod{H646}."
1 Samuel,2,19,"Moreover his mother{H517} made{H6213}{(H8799)} him a little{H6996} coat{H4598}, and brought{H5927}{(H8689)} it to him from year{H3117} to year{H3117}, when she came up{H5927}{(H8800)} with her husband{H376} to offer{H2076}{(H8800)} the yearly{H3117} sacrifice{H2077}."
1 Samuel,2,20,"And Eli{H5941} blessed{H1288}{(H8765)} Elkanah{H511} and his wife{H802}, and said{H559}{(H8804)}, The LORD{H3068} give{H7760}{(H8799)} thee seed{H2233} of this woman{H802} for the loan{H7596} which is lent{H7592}{(H8804)} to the LORD{H3068}. And they went{H1980}{(H8804)} unto their own home{H4725}."
1 Samuel,2,21,"And{H3588} the LORD{H3068} visited{H6485}{(H8804)} Hannah{H2584}, so that she conceived{H2029}{(H8799)}, and bare{H3205}{(H8799)} three{H7969} sons{H1121} and two{H8147} daughters{H1323}. And the child{H5288} Samuel{H8050} grew{H1431}{(H8799)} before{H5973} the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,2,22,"Now Eli{H5941} was very{H3966} old{H2204}{(H8804)}, and heard{H8085}{(H8804)} all that his sons{H1121} did{H6213}{(H8799)} unto all Israel{H3478}; and how they lay{H7901}{(H8799)} with the women{H802} that assembled{H6633}{(H8802)} at the door{H6607} of the tabernacle{H168} of the congregation{H4150}."
1 Samuel,2,23,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Why do{H6213}{(H8799)} ye such things{H1697}? for I hear{H8085}{(H8802)} of your evil{H7451} dealings{H1697} by all this people{H5971}."
1 Samuel,2,24,"Nay, my sons{H1121}; for it is no good{H2896} report{H8052} that I hear{H8085}{(H8802)}: ye make the LORD'S{H3068} people{H5971} to transgress{H5674}{(H8688)}."
1 Samuel,2,25,"If one man{H376} sin{H2398}{(H8799)} against another{H376}, the judge{H430} shall judge{H6419}{(H8765)} him: but if a man{H376} sin{H2398}{(H8799)} against the LORD{H3068}, who shall intreat{H6419}{(H8691)} for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} not unto the voice{H6963} of their father{H1}, because the LORD{H3068} would{H2654}{(H8804)} slay{H4191}{(H8687)} them."
1 Samuel,2,26,"And the child{H5288} Samuel{H8050} grew{H1432} on{H1980}{(H8802)}, and was in favour{H2896} both with the LORD{H3068}, and also with men{H582}."
1 Samuel,2,27,"And there came{H935}{(H8799)} a man{H376} of God{H430} unto Eli{H5941}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Did I plainly{H1540}{(H8736)} appear{H1540}{(H8738)} unto the house{H1004} of thy father{H1}, when they were in Egypt{H4714} in Pharaoh's{H6547} house{H1004}?"
1 Samuel,2,28,"And did I choose{H977}{(H8800)} him out of all the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478} to be my priest{H3548}, to offer{H5927}{(H8800)} upon mine altar{H4196}, to burn{H6999}{(H8687)} incense{H7004}, to wear{H5375}{(H8800)} an ephod{H646} before{H6440} me? and did I give{H5414}{(H8799)} unto the house{H1004} of thy father{H1} all the offerings made by fire{H801} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}?"
1 Samuel,2,29,"Wherefore kick{H1163}{(H8799)} ye at my sacrifice{H2077} and at mine offering{H4503}, which I have commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} in my habitation{H4583}; and honourest{H3513}{(H8762)} thy sons{H1121} above me, to make yourselves fat{H1254}{(H8687)} with the chiefest{H7225} of all the offerings{H4503} of Israel{H3478} my people{H5971}?"
1 Samuel,2,30,"Wherefore the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} saith{H5002}{(H8803)}, I said{H559}{(H8804)} indeed{H559}{(H8800)} that thy house{H1004}, and the house{H1004} of thy father{H1}, should walk{H1980}{(H8691)} before{H6440} me for{H5704} ever{H5769}: but now the LORD{H3068} saith{H5002}{(H8803)}, Be it far from me{H2486}; for them that honour{H3513}{(H8764)} me I will honour{H3513}{(H8762)}, and they that despise{H959}{(H8802)} me shall be lightly esteemed{H7043}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,2,31,"Behold, the days{H3117} come{H935}{(H8802)}, that I will cut off{H1438}{(H8804)} thine arm{H2220}, and the arm{H2220} of thy father's{H1} house{H1004}, that there shall not be an old man{H2205} in thine house{H1004}."
1 Samuel,2,32,"And thou shalt see{H5027}{(H8689)} an enemy{H6862} in my habitation{H4583}, in all the wealth which God shall give{H3190}{(H8686)} Israel{H3478}: and there shall not be an old man{H2205} in thine house{H1004} for ever{H3117}."
1 Samuel,2,33,"And the man{H376} of thine, whom I shall not cut off{H3772}{(H8686)} from mine altar{H4196}, shall be to consume{H3615}{(H8763)} thine eyes{H5869}, and to grieve{H109} thine heart{H5315}: and all the increase{H4768} of thine house{H1004} shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} in the flower of their age{H582}."
1 Samuel,2,34,"And this shall be a sign{H226} unto thee, that shall come{H935}{(H8799)} upon thy two{H8147} sons{H1121}, on Hophni{H2652} and Phinehas{H6372}; in one{H259} day{H3117} they shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} both{H8147} of them."
1 Samuel,2,35,"And I will raise me up{H6965}{(H8689)} a faithful{H539}{(H8737)} priest{H3548}, that shall do{H6213}{(H8799)} according to that which is in mine heart{H3824} and in my mind{H5315}: and I will build{H1129}{(H8804)} him a sure{H539}{(H8737)} house{H1004}; and he shall walk{H1980}{(H8694)} before{H6440} mine anointed{H4899} for ever{H3117}."
1 Samuel,2,36,"And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left{H3498}{(H8737)} in thine house{H1004} shall come{H935}{(H8799)} and crouch{H7812}{(H8692)} to him for a piece{H95} of silver{H3701} and a morsel{H3603} of bread{H3899}, and shall say{H559}{(H8804)}, Put{H5596}{(H8798)} me, I pray thee, into one{H259} of the priests' offices{H3550}, that I may eat{H398}{(H8800)} a piece{H6595} of bread{H3899}."
1 Samuel,3,1,And the child{H5288} Samuel{H8050} ministered{H8334}{(H8764)} unto the LORD{H3068} before{H6440} Eli{H5941}. And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} was precious{H3368} in those days{H3117}; there was no open{H6555}{(H8737)} vision{H2377}.
1 Samuel,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time{H3117}, when Eli{H5941} was laid down{H7901}{(H8802)} in his place{H4725}, and his eyes{H5869} began{H2490}{(H8689)} to wax dim{H3544}, that he could{H3201}{(H8799)} not see{H7200}{(H8800)};"
1 Samuel,3,3,"And ere the lamp{H5216} of God{H430} went out{H3518}{(H8799)} in the temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068}, where the ark{H727} of God{H430} was, and Samuel{H8050} was laid down{H7901}{(H8802)} to sleep;"
1 Samuel,3,4,"That the LORD{H3068} called{H7121}{(H8799)} Samuel{H8050}: and he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Here am I."
1 Samuel,3,5,"And he ran{H7323}{(H8799)} unto Eli{H5941}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Here am I{H2009}; for thou calledst{H7121}{(H8804)} me. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I called{H7121}{(H8804)} not; lie down{H7901}{(H8798)} again{H7725}{(H8798)}. And he went{H3212}{(H8799)} and lay down{H7901}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,3,6,"And the LORD{H3068} called{H7121}{(H8800)} yet again{H3254}{(H8686)}, Samuel{H8050}. And Samuel{H8050} arose{H6965}{(H8799)} and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Eli{H5941}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Here am I; for thou didst call{H7121}{(H8804)} me. And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, I called{H7121}{(H8804)} not, my son{H1121}; lie down{H7901}{(H8798)} again{H7725}{(H8798)}."
1 Samuel,3,7,"Now Samuel{H8050} did not yet{H2962} know{H3045}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, neither was the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} yet revealed{H1540}{(H8735)} unto him."
1 Samuel,3,8,"And the LORD{H3068} called{H7121}{(H8800)} Samuel{H8050} again{H3254}{(H8686)} the third time{H7992}. And he arose{H6965}{(H8799)} and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Eli{H5941}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Here am I; for thou didst call{H7121}{(H8804)} me. And Eli{H5941} perceived{H995}{(H8799)} that the LORD{H3068} had called{H7121}{(H8802)} the child{H5288}."
1 Samuel,3,9,"Therefore Eli{H5941} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Samuel{H8050}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, lie down{H7901}{(H8798)}: and it shall be, if he call{H7121}{(H8799)} thee, that thou shalt say{H559}{(H8804)}, Speak{H1696}{(H8761)}, LORD{H3068}; for thy servant{H5650} heareth{H8085}{(H8802)}. So Samuel{H8050} went{H3212}{(H8799)} and lay down{H7901}{(H8799)} in his place{H4725}."
1 Samuel,3,10,"And the LORD{H3068} came{H935}{(H8799)}, and stood{H3320}{(H8691)}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} as at other times{H6471}, Samuel{H8050}, Samuel{H8050}. Then Samuel{H8050} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Speak{H1696}{(H8761)}; for thy servant{H5650} heareth{H8085}{(H8802)}."
1 Samuel,3,11,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Samuel{H8050}, Behold, I will do{H6213}{(H8802)} a thing{H1697} in Israel{H3478}, at which both{H8147} the ears{H241} of every one that heareth{H8085}{(H8802)} it shall tingle{H6750}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,3,12,"In that day{H3117} I will perform{H6965}{(H8686)} against Eli{H5941} all things which I have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} concerning{H413} his house{H1004}: when I begin{H2490}{(H8687)}, I will also make an end{H3615}{(H8763)}."
1 Samuel,3,13,"For I have told{H5046}{(H8689)} him that I will judge{H8199}{(H8802)} his house{H1004} for{H5704} ever{H5769} for the iniquity{H5771} which he knoweth{H3045}{(H8804)}; because his sons{H1121} made themselves vile{H7043}{(H8764)}, and he restrained{H3543}{(H8765)} them not."
1 Samuel,3,14,"And therefore I have sworn{H7650}{(H8738)} unto the house{H1004} of Eli{H5941}, that the iniquity{H5771} of Eli's{H5941} house{H1004} shall not be purged{H3722}{(H8691)} with sacrifice{H2077} nor offering{H4503} for{H5704} ever{H5769}."
1 Samuel,3,15,"And Samuel{H8050} lay{H7901}{(H8799)} until the morning{H1242}, and opened{H6605}{(H8799)} the doors{H1817} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}. And Samuel{H8050} feared{H3372}{(H8804)} to shew{H5046}{(H8687)} Eli{H5941} the vision{H4759}."
1 Samuel,3,16,"Then Eli{H5941} called{H7121}{(H8799)} Samuel{H8050}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Samuel{H8050}, my son{H1121}. And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Here am I."
1 Samuel,3,17,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, What is the thing{H1697} that the LORD hath said{H1696}{(H8765)} unto thee? I pray thee hide{H3582}{(H8762)} it not from me: God{H430} do so{H6213}{(H8799)} to thee, and more also{H3254}{(H8686)}, if thou hide{H3582}{(H8762)} any thing{H1697} from me of all the things{H1697} that he said{H1696}{(H8765)} unto thee."
1 Samuel,3,18,"And Samuel{H8050} told{H5046}{(H8686)} him every whit{H1697}, and hid{H3582}{(H8765)} nothing from him. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, It is the LORD{H3068}: let him do{H6213}{(H8799)} what seemeth{H5869} him good{H2896}."
1 Samuel,3,19,"And Samuel{H8050} grew{H1431}{(H8799)}, and the LORD{H3068} was with him, and did let none of his words{H1697} fall{H5307}{(H8689)} to the ground{H776}."
1 Samuel,3,20,And all Israel{H3478} from Dan{H1835} even to Beersheba{H884} knew{H3045}{(H8799)} that Samuel{H8050} was established{H539}{(H8737)} to be a prophet{H5030} of the LORD{H3068}.
1 Samuel,3,21,And the LORD{H3068} appeared{H7200}{(H8736)} again{H3254}{(H8686)} in Shiloh{H7887}: for the LORD{H3068} revealed{H1540}{(H8738)} himself to Samuel{H8050} in Shiloh{H7887} by the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}.
1 Samuel,4,1,"And the word{H1697} of Samuel{H8050} came to all Israel{H3478}. Now Israel{H3478} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} the Philistines{H6430} to battle{H4421}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} beside Ebenezer{H72}: and the Philistines{H6430} pitched{H2583}{(H8804)} in Aphek{H663}."
1 Samuel,4,2,"And the Philistines{H6430} put themselves in array{H6186}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} Israel{H3478}: and when they joined{H5203}{(H8799)} battle{H4421}, Israel{H3478} was smitten{H5062}{(H8735)} before{H6440} the Philistines{H6430}: and they slew{H5221}{(H8686)} of the army{H4634} in the field{H7704} about four{H702} thousand{H505} men{H376}."
1 Samuel,4,3,"And when the people{H5971} were come{H935}{(H8799)} into the camp{H4264}, the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Wherefore hath the LORD{H3068} smitten{H5062}{(H8804)} us to day{H3117} before{H6440} the Philistines{H6430}? Let us fetch{H3947}{(H8799)} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068} out of Shiloh{H7887} unto us, that, when it cometh{H935}{(H8799)} among{H7130} us, it may save{H3467}{(H8686)} us out of the hand{H3709} of our enemies{H341}{(H8802)}."
1 Samuel,4,4,"So the people{H5971} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Shiloh{H7887}, that they might bring{H5375}{(H8799)} from thence the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, which dwelleth{H3427}{(H8802)} between the cherubims{H3742}: and the two{H8147} sons{H1121} of Eli{H5941}, Hophni{H2652} and Phinehas{H6372}, were there with the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of God{H430}."
1 Samuel,4,5,"And when the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068} came{H935}{(H8800)} into the camp{H4264}, all Israel{H3478} shouted{H7321}{(H8686)} with a great{H1419} shout{H8643}, so that the earth{H776} rang again{H1949}{(H8735)}."
1 Samuel,4,6,"And when the Philistines{H6430} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} the noise{H6963} of the shout{H8643}, they said{H559}{(H8799)}, What meaneth the noise{H6963} of this great{H1419} shout{H8643} in the camp{H4264} of the Hebrews{H5680}? And they understood{H3045}{(H8799)} that the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068} was come{H935}{(H8804)} into the camp{H4264}."
1 Samuel,4,7,"And the Philistines{H6430} were afraid{H3372}{(H8799)}, for they said{H559}{(H8804)}, God{H430} is come{H935}{(H8804)} into the camp{H4264}. And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Woe{H188} unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore{H865}{H8032}."
1 Samuel,4,8,Woe{H188} unto us! who shall deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} us out of the hand{H3027} of these mighty{H117} Gods{H430}? these are the Gods{H430} that smote{H5221}{(H8688)} the Egyptians{H4714} with all the plagues{H4347} in the wilderness{H4057}.
1 Samuel,4,9,"Be strong{H2388}{(H8690)}, and quit{H1961}{(H8798)} yourselves like men{H582}, O ye Philistines{H6430}, that ye be not servants{H5647}{(H8799)} unto the Hebrews{H5680}, as they have been{H5647}{(H8804)} to you: quit{H1961}{(H8804)} yourselves like men{H582}, and fight{H3898}{(H8738)}."
1 Samuel,4,10,"And the Philistines{H6430} fought{H3898}{(H8735)}, and Israel{H3478} was smitten{H5062}{(H8735)}, and they fled{H5127}{(H8799)} every man{H376} into his tent{H168}: and there was a very{H3966} great{H1419} slaughter{H4347}; for there fell{H5307}{(H8799)} of Israel{H3478} thirty{H7970} thousand{H505} footmen{H7273}."
1 Samuel,4,11,"And the ark{H727} of God{H430} was taken{H3947}{(H8738)}; and the two{H8147} sons{H1121} of Eli{H5941}, Hophni{H2652} and Phinehas{H6372}, were slain{H4191}{(H8804)}."
1 Samuel,4,12,"And there ran{H7323}{(H8799)} a man{H376} of Benjamin{H1144} out of the army{H4634}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Shiloh{H7887} the same day{H3117} with his clothes{H4055} rent{H7167}{(H8803)}, and with earth{H127} upon his head{H7218}."
1 Samuel,4,13,"And when he came{H935}{(H8799)}, lo, Eli{H5941} sat{H3427}{(H8802)} upon a seat{H3678} by the wayside{H1870}{H3027}{(H8675)}{H3197} watching{H6822}{(H8764)}: for his heart{H3820} trembled{H2730} for the ark{H727} of God{H430}. And when the man{H376} came{H935}{(H8802)} into the city{H5892}, and told{H5046}{(H8687)} it, all the city{H5892} cried out{H2199}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,4,14,"And when Eli{H5941} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} the noise{H6963} of the crying{H6818}, he said{H559}{(H8799)}, What meaneth the noise{H6963} of this tumult{H1995}? And the man{H376} came{H935}{(H8799)} in hastily{H4116}{(H8765)}, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} Eli{H5941}."
1 Samuel,4,15,"Now Eli{H5941} was ninety{H8673} and eight{H8083} years{H8141} old{H1121}; and his eyes{H5869} were dim{H6965}{(H8804)}, that he could{H3201}{(H8804)} not see{H7200}{(H8800)}."
1 Samuel,4,16,"And the man{H376} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Eli{H5941}, I am he that came{H935}{(H8802)} out of the army{H4634}, and I fled{H5127}{(H8804)} to day{H3117} out of the army{H4634}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, What is there done{H1697}, my son{H1121}?"
1 Samuel,4,17,"And the messenger{H1319}{(H8764)} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Israel{H3478} is fled{H5127}{(H8804)} before{H6440} the Philistines{H6430}, and there hath been also a great{H1419} slaughter{H4046} among the people{H5971}, and thy two{H8147} sons{H1121} also, Hophni{H2652} and Phinehas{H6372}, are dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, and the ark{H727} of God{H430} is taken{H3947}{(H8738)}."
1 Samuel,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention{H2142}{(H8687)} of the ark{H727} of God{H430}, that he fell{H5307}{(H8799)} from off the seat{H3678} backward{H322} by{H1157} the side{H3027} of the gate{H8179}, and his neck{H4665} brake{H7665}{(H8735)}, and he died{H4191}{(H8799)}: for he was an old{H2204}{(H8804)} man{H376}, and heavy{H3513}{(H8804)}. And he had judged{H8199}{(H8804)} Israel{H3478} forty{H705} years{H8141}."
1 Samuel,4,19,"And his daughter in law{H3618}, Phinehas{H6372}' wife{H802}, was with child{H2030}, near to be delivered{H3205}{(H8800)}: and when she heard{H8085}{(H8799)} the tidings{H8052} that{H413} the ark{H727} of God{H430} was taken{H3947}{(H8736)}, and that her father in law{H2524} and her husband{H376} were dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, she bowed{H3766}{(H8799)} herself and travailed{H3205}{(H8799)}; for her pains{H6735} came{H2015}{(H8738)} upon her."
1 Samuel,4,20,"And about the time{H6256} of her death{H4191}{(H8800)} the women that stood{H5324}{(H8737)} by her said{H1696}{(H8762)} unto her, Fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not; for thou hast born{H3205}{(H8804)} a son{H1121}. But she answered{H6030}{(H8804)} not, neither did she regard{H7896}{(H8804)}{H3820} it."
1 Samuel,4,21,"And she named{H7121}{(H8799)} the child{H5288} Ichabod{H350}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The glory{H3519} is departed{H1540}{(H8804)} from Israel{H3478}: because{H413} the ark{H727} of God{H430} was taken{H3947}{(H8736)}, and because of her father in law{H2524} and her husband{H376}."
1 Samuel,4,22,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, The glory{H3519} is departed{H1540}{(H8804)} from Israel{H3478}: for the ark{H727} of God{H430} is taken{H3947}{(H8738)}."
1 Samuel,5,1,"And the Philistines{H6430} took{H3947}{(H8804)} the ark{H727} of God{H430}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} it from Ebenezer{H72} unto Ashdod{H795}."
1 Samuel,5,2,"When the Philistines{H6430} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the ark{H727} of God{H430}, they brought{H935}{(H8686)} it into the house{H1004} of Dagon{H1712}, and set{H3322}{(H8686)} it by{H681} Dagon{H1712}."
1 Samuel,5,3,"And when they of Ashdod{H796} arose early{H7925}{(H8686)} on the morrow{H4283}, behold, Dagon{H1712} was fallen{H5307}{(H8802)} upon his face{H6440} to the earth{H776} before{H6440} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}. And they took{H3947}{(H8799)} Dagon{H1712}, and set{H7725} him in his place{H4725} again{H7725}{(H8686)}."
1 Samuel,5,4,"And when they arose early{H7925}{(H8686)} on the morrow{H4283} morning{H1242}, behold, Dagon{H1712} was fallen{H5307}{(H8802)} upon his face{H6440} to the ground{H776} before{H6440} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}; and the head{H7218} of Dagon{H1712} and both{H8147} the palms{H3709} of his hands{H3027} were cut off{H3772}{(H8803)} upon the threshold{H4670}; only the stump of Dagon{H1712} was left{H7604}{(H8738)} to him."
1 Samuel,5,5,"Therefore neither the priests{H3548} of Dagon{H1712}, nor any that come{H935}{(H8802)} into Dagon's{H1712} house{H1004}, tread{H1869}{(H8799)} on the threshold{H4670} of Dagon{H1712} in Ashdod{H795} unto this day{H3117}."
1 Samuel,5,6,"But the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068} was heavy{H3513}{(H8799)} upon them of Ashdod{H796}, and he destroyed{H8074}{(H8686)} them, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them with emerods{H2914}{(H8675)}{H6076}, even Ashdod{H795} and the coasts{H1366} thereof."
1 Samuel,5,7,"And when the men{H582} of Ashdod{H795} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that it was so, they said{H559}{(H8804)}, The ark{H727} of the God{H430} of Israel{H3478} shall not abide{H3427}{(H8799)} with us: for his hand{H3027} is sore{H7185}{(H8804)} upon us, and upon Dagon{H1712} our god{H430}."
1 Samuel,5,8,"They sent{H7971}{(H8799)} therefore and gathered{H622}{(H8799)} all the lords{H5633} of the Philistines{H6430} unto them, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, What shall we do{H6213}{(H8799)} with the ark{H727} of the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}? And they answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Let the ark{H727} of the God{H430} of Israel{H3478} be carried about{H5437}{(H8735)} unto Gath{H1661}. And they carried{H5437} the ark{H727} of the God{H430} of Israel{H3478} about{H5437}{(H8686)} thither."
1 Samuel,5,9,"And it was so, that, after{H310} they had carried it about{H5437}{(H8689)}, the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068} was against the city{H5892} with a very{H3966} great{H1419} destruction{H4103}: and he smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the men{H582} of the city{H5892}, both small{H6996} and great{H1419}, and they had emerods{H2914}{(H8675)}{H6076} in their secret parts{H8368}{(H8735)}."
1 Samuel,5,10,"Therefore they sent{H7971}{(H8762)} the ark{H727} of God{H430} to Ekron{H6138}. And it came to pass, as the ark{H727} of God{H430} came{H935}{(H8800)} to Ekron{H6138}, that the Ekronites{H6139} cried out{H2199}{(H8799)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, They have brought about{H5437}{(H8689)} the ark{H727} of the God{H430} of Israel{H3478} to us, to slay{H4191}{(H8687)} us and our people{H5971}."
1 Samuel,5,11,"So they sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and gathered together{H622}{(H8799)} all the lords{H5633} of the Philistines{H6430}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Send away{H7971}{(H8761)} the ark{H727} of the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, and let it go again{H7725}{(H8799)} to his own place{H4725}, that it slay{H4191}{(H8686)} us not, and our people{H5971}: for there was a deadly{H4194} destruction{H4103} throughout all the city{H5892}; the hand{H3027} of God{H430} was very{H3966} heavy{H3513}{(H8804)} there."
1 Samuel,5,12,And the men{H582} that died{H4191}{(H8804)} not were smitten{H5221}{(H8717)} with the emerods{H2914}{(H8675)}{H6076}: and the cry{H7775} of the city{H5892} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} to heaven{H8064}.
1 Samuel,6,1,And the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068} was in the country{H7704} of the Philistines{H6430} seven{H7651} months{H2320}.
1 Samuel,6,2,"And the Philistines{H6430} called{H7121}{(H8799)} for the priests{H3548} and the diviners{H7080}{(H8802)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, What shall we do{H6213}{(H8799)} to the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}? tell{H3045}{(H8685)} us wherewith we shall send{H7971}{(H8762)} it to his place{H4725}."
1 Samuel,6,3,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, If ye send away{H7971}{(H8764)} the ark{H727} of the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, send{H7971}{(H8762)} it not empty{H7387}; but in any wise{H7725}{(H8687)} return{H7725}{(H8686)} him a trespass offering{H817}: then ye shall be healed{H7495}{(H8735)}, and it shall be known{H3045}{(H8738)} to you why his hand{H3027} is not removed{H5493}{(H8799)} from you."
1 Samuel,6,4,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} they, What shall be the trespass offering{H817} which we shall return{H7725}{(H8686)} to him? They answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Five{H2568} golden{H2091} emerods{H2914}{(H8675)}{H6076}, and five{H2568} golden{H2091} mice{H5909}, according to the number{H4557} of the lords{H5633} of the Philistines{H6430}: for one{H259} plague{H4046} was on you all, and on your lords{H5633}."
1 Samuel,6,5,"Wherefore ye shall make{H6213}{(H8804)} images{H6754} of your emerods{H2914}{(H8675)}{H6076}, and images{H6754} of your mice{H5909} that mar{H7843}{(H8688)} the land{H776}; and ye shall give{H5414}{(H8804)} glory{H3519} unto the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}: peradventure he will lighten{H7043}{(H8686)} his hand{H3027} from off you, and from off your gods{H430}, and from off your land{H776}."
1 Samuel,6,6,"Wherefore then do ye harden{H3513}{(H8762)} your hearts{H3824}, as the Egyptians{H4714} and Pharaoh{H6547} hardened{H3513}{(H8765)} their hearts{H3820}? when he had wrought wonderfully{H5953}{(H8694)} among them, did they not let the people go{H7971}{(H8762)}, and they departed{H3212}{(H8799)}?"
1 Samuel,6,7,"Now therefore make{H6213}{(H8798)} a{H259} new{H2319} cart{H5699}, and take{H3947}{(H8798)} two{H8147} milch{H5763}{(H8802)} kine{H6510}, on which there hath come{H5927}{(H8804)} no yoke{H5923}, and tie{H631}{(H8804)} the kine{H6510} to the cart{H5699}, and bring{H7725}{(H8689)} their calves{H1121} home{H1004} from them{H310}:"
1 Samuel,6,8,"And take{H3947}{(H8804)} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}, and lay{H5414}{(H8804)} it upon the cart{H5699}; and put{H7760}{(H8799)} the jewels{H3627} of gold{H2091}, which ye return{H7725}{(H8689)} him for a trespass offering{H817}, in a coffer{H712} by the side{H6654} thereof; and send it away{H7971}{(H8765)}, that it may go{H1980}{(H8804)}."
1 Samuel,6,9,"And see{H7200}{(H8804)}, if it goeth up{H5927}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870} of his own coast{H1366} to Bethshemesh{H1053}, then he hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} us this great{H1419} evil{H7451}: but if not, then we shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that it is not his hand{H3027} that smote{H5060}{(H8804)} us: it was a chance{H4745} that happened to us{H1961}{(H8804)}."
1 Samuel,6,10,"And the men{H582} did so{H6213}{(H8799)}; and took{H3947}{(H8799)} two{H8147} milch{H5763}{(H8802)} kine{H6510}, and tied{H631}{(H8799)} them to the cart{H5699}, and shut up{H3607}{(H8804)} their calves{H1121} at home{H1004}:"
1 Samuel,6,11,"And they laid{H7760}{(H8799)} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068} upon the cart{H5699}, and the coffer{H712} with the mice{H5909} of gold{H2091} and the images{H6754} of their emerods{H2914}."
1 Samuel,6,12,"And the kine{H6510} took the straight{H3474}{(H8799)} way{H1870} to the way{H1870} of Bethshemesh{H1053}, and went along{H1980}{(H8804)} the highway{H4546}{H259}, lowing{H1600}{(H8800)} as they went{H1980}{(H8800)}, and turned not aside{H5493}{(H8804)} to the right hand{H3225} or to the left{H8040}; and the lords{H5633} of the Philistines{H6430} went{H1980}{(H8802)} after{H310} them unto the border{H1366} of Bethshemesh{H1053}."
1 Samuel,6,13,"And they of Bethshemesh{H1053} were reaping{H7114}{(H8802)} their wheat{H2406} harvest{H7105} in the valley{H6010}: and they lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} their eyes{H5869}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the ark{H727}, and rejoiced{H8055}{(H8799)} to see{H7200}{(H8800)} it."
1 Samuel,6,14,"And the cart{H5699} came{H935}{(H8802)} into the field{H7704} of Joshua{H3091}, a Bethshemite{H1030}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} there, where there was a great{H1419} stone{H68}: and they clave{H1234}{(H8762)} the wood{H6086} of the cart{H5699}, and offered{H5927}{(H8689)} the kine{H6510} a burnt offering{H5930} unto the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,6,15,"And the Levites{H3881} took down{H3381}{(H8689)} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}, and the coffer{H712} that was with it, wherein the jewels{H3627} of gold{H2091} were, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} them on the great{H1419} stone{H68}: and the men{H582} of Bethshemesh{H1053} offered{H5927}{(H8689)} burnt offerings{H5930} and sacrificed{H2076}{(H8799)} sacrifices{H2077} the same day{H3117} unto the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,6,16,"And when the five{H2568} lords{H5633} of the Philistines{H6430} had seen{H7200}{(H8804)} it, they returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to Ekron{H6138} the same day{H3117}."
1 Samuel,6,17,"And these are the golden{H2091} emerods{H2914} which the Philistines{H6430} returned{H7725}{(H8689)} for a trespass offering{H817} unto the LORD{H3068}; for Ashdod{H795} one{H259}, for Gaza{H5804} one{H259}, for Askelon{H831} one{H259}, for Gath{H1661} one{H259}, for Ekron{H6138} one{H259};"
1 Samuel,6,18,"And the golden{H2091} mice{H5909}, according to the number{H4557} of all the cities{H5892} of the Philistines{H6430} belonging to the five{H2568} lords{H5633}, both of fenced{H4013} cities{H5892}, and of country{H6521} villages{H3724}, even unto the great{H1419} stone of Abel{H59}, whereon they set down{H3240}{(H8689)} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}: which stone remaineth unto this day{H3117} in the field{H7704} of Joshua{H3091}, the Bethshemite{H1030}."
1 Samuel,6,19,"And he smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the men{H376} of Bethshemesh{H1053}, because they had looked{H7200}{(H8804)} into the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}, even he smote{H5221}{(H8686)} of the people{H5971} fifty{H2572} thousand{H505} and threescore and ten{H7657} men{H582}: and the people{H5971} lamented{H56}{(H8691)}, because the LORD{H3068} had smitten{H5221}{(H8689)} many of the people{H5971} with a great{H1419} slaughter{H4347}."
1 Samuel,6,20,"And the men{H582} of Bethshemesh{H1053} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who is able{H3201}{(H8799)} to stand{H5975}{(H8800)} before{H6440} this holy{H6918} LORD{H3068} God{H430}? and to whom shall he go up{H5927}{(H8799)} from us?"
1 Samuel,6,21,"And they sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} to the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Kirjathjearim{H7157}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The Philistines{H6430} have brought again{H7725}{(H8689)} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}; come ye down{H3381}{(H8798)}, and fetch it up{H5927}{(H8685)} to you."
1 Samuel,7,1,"And the men{H582} of Kirjathjearim{H7157} came{H935}{(H8799)}, and fetched up{H5927}{(H8686)} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} it into the house{H1004} of Abinadab{H41} in the hill{H1389}, and sanctified{H6942}{(H8765)} Eleazar{H499} his son{H1121} to keep{H8104}{(H8800)} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,7,2,"And it came to pass, while{H3117} the ark{H727} abode{H3427}{(H8800)} in Kirjathjearim{H7157}, that the time{H3117} was long{H7235}{(H8799)}; for it was twenty{H6242} years{H8141}: and all the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} lamented{H5091}{(H8735)} after{H310} the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,7,3,"And Samuel{H8050} spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto all the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, If ye do return{H7725}{(H8802)} unto the LORD{H3068} with all your hearts{H3824}, then put away{H5493}{(H8685)} the strange{H5236} gods{H430} and Ashtaroth{H6252} from among{H8432} you, and prepare{H3559}{(H8685)} your hearts{H3824} unto the LORD{H3068}, and serve{H5647}{(H8798)} him only: and he will deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} you out of the hand{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430}."
1 Samuel,7,4,"Then the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} did put away{H5493}{(H8686)} Baalim{H1168} and Ashtaroth{H6252}, and served{H5647}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} only."
1 Samuel,7,5,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Gather{H6908}{(H8798)} all Israel{H3478} to Mizpeh{H4708}, and I will pray{H6419}{(H8691)} for you unto the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,7,6,"And they gathered together{H6908}{(H8735)} to Mizpeh{H4709}, and drew{H7579}{(H8799)} water{H4325}, and poured it out{H8210}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, and fasted{H6684}{(H8799)} on that day{H3117}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} there, We have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against the LORD{H3068}. And Samuel{H8050} judged{H8199}{(H8799)} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} in Mizpeh{H4708}."
1 Samuel,7,7,"And when the Philistines{H6430} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} were gathered together{H6908}{(H8694)} to Mizpeh{H4708}, the lords{H5633} of the Philistines{H6430} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} against Israel{H3478}. And when the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} it, they were afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} of{H6440} the Philistines{H6430}."
1 Samuel,7,8,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Samuel{H8050}, Cease{H2790}{(H8686)} not to cry{H2199}{(H8800)} unto the LORD{H3068} our God{H430} for us, that he will save{H3467}{(H8686)} us out of the hand{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430}."
1 Samuel,7,9,"And Samuel{H8050} took{H3947}{(H8799)} a{H259} sucking{H2461} lamb{H2924}, and offered{H5927}{(H8686)} it for a burnt offering{H5930} wholly{H3632} unto the LORD{H3068}: and Samuel{H8050} cried{H2199}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068} for Israel{H3478}; and the LORD{H3068} heard{H6030}{(H8799)} him."
1 Samuel,7,10,"And as Samuel{H8050} was offering up{H5927}{(H8688)} the burnt offering{H5930}, the Philistines{H6430} drew near{H5066}{(H8738)} to battle{H4421} against Israel{H3478}: but the LORD{H3068} thundered{H7481}{(H8686)} with a great{H1419} thunder{H6963} on that day{H3117} upon the Philistines{H6430}, and discomfited{H2000}{(H8799)} them; and they were smitten{H5062}{(H8735)} before{H6440} Israel{H3478}."
1 Samuel,7,11,"And the men{H582} of Israel{H3478} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} of Mizpeh{H4709}, and pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} the Philistines{H6430}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them, until they came under Bethcar{H1033}."
1 Samuel,7,12,"Then Samuel{H8050} took{H3947}{(H8799)} a{H259} stone{H68}, and set{H7760}{(H8799)} it between Mizpeh{H4709} and Shen{H8129}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} the name{H8034} of it Ebenezer{H72}, saying{H559}{(H8799)}, Hitherto hath the LORD{H3068} helped{H5826}{(H8804)} us."
1 Samuel,7,13,"So the Philistines{H6430} were subdued{H3665}{(H8735)}, and they came{H935}{(H8800)} no more{H3254}{(H8804)} into the coast{H1366} of Israel{H3478}: and the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068} was against the Philistines{H6430} all the days{H3117} of Samuel{H8050}."
1 Samuel,7,14,"And the cities{H5892} which the Philistines{H6430} had taken{H3947}{(H8804)} from Israel{H3478} were restored{H7725}{(H8799)} to Israel{H3478}, from Ekron{H6138} even unto Gath{H1661}; and the coasts{H1366} thereof did Israel{H3478} deliver{H5337}{(H8689)} out of the hands{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430}. And there was peace{H7965} between Israel{H3478} and the Amorites{H567}."
1 Samuel,7,15,And Samuel{H8050} judged{H8199}{(H8799)} Israel{H3478} all the days{H3117} of his life{H2416}.
1 Samuel,7,16,"And he went{H1980}{(H8804)} from{H1767} year{H8141} to year{H8141} in circuit{H5437}{(H8804)} to Bethel{H1008}, and Gilgal{H1537}, and Mizpeh{H4709}, and judged{H8199}{(H8804)} Israel{H3478} in all those places{H4725}."
1 Samuel,7,17,And his return{H8666} was to Ramah{H7414}; for there was his house{H1004}; and there he judged{H8199}{(H8804)} Israel{H3478}; and there he built{H1129}{(H8799)} an altar{H4196} unto the LORD{H3068}.
1 Samuel,8,1,"And it came to pass, when Samuel{H8050} was old{H2204}{(H8804)}, that he made{H7760}{(H8799)} his sons{H1121} judges{H8199}{(H8802)} over Israel{H3478}."
1 Samuel,8,2,"Now the name{H8034} of his firstborn{H1121}{H1060} was Joel{H3100}; and the name{H8034} of his second{H4932}, Abiah{H29}: they were judges{H8199}{(H8802)} in Beersheba{H884}."
1 Samuel,8,3,"And his sons{H1121} walked{H1980}{(H8804)} not in his ways{H1870}, but turned aside{H5186}{(H8799)} after{H310} lucre{H1215}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} bribes{H7810}, and perverted{H5186}{(H8686)} judgment{H4941}."
1 Samuel,8,4,"Then all the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478} gathered themselves together{H6908}{(H8691)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Samuel{H8050} unto Ramah{H7414},"
1 Samuel,8,5,"And said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Behold, thou art old{H2204}{(H8804)}, and thy sons{H1121} walk{H1980}{(H8804)} not in thy ways{H1870}: now make{H7760}{(H8798)} us a king{H4428} to judge{H8199}{(H8800)} us like all the nations{H1471}."
1 Samuel,8,6,"But the thing{H1697} displeased{H3415}{(H8799)}{H5869} Samuel{H8050}, when they said{H559}{(H8804)}, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} us a king{H4428} to judge{H8199}{(H8800)} us. And Samuel{H8050} prayed{H6419}{(H8691)} unto the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,8,7,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Samuel{H8050}, Hearken{H8085}{(H8798)} unto the voice{H6963} of the people{H5971} in all that they say{H559}{(H8799)} unto thee: for they have not rejected{H3988}{(H8804)} thee, but they have rejected{H3988}{(H8804)} me, that I should not reign{H4427}{(H8800)} over them."
1 Samuel,8,8,"According to all the works{H4639} which they have done{H6213}{(H8804)} since the day{H3117} that I brought them up{H5927}{(H8687)} out of Egypt{H4714} even unto this day{H3117}, wherewith they have forsaken{H5800}{(H8799)} me, and served{H5647}{(H8799)} other{H312} gods{H430}, so do{H6213}{(H8802)} they also unto thee."
1 Samuel,8,9,"Now therefore hearken{H8085}{(H8798)} unto their voice{H6963}: howbeit{H389} yet protest{H5749}{(H8686)} solemnly{H5749}{(H8687)} unto them, and shew{H5046}{(H8689)} them the manner{H4941} of the king{H4428} that shall reign{H4427}{(H8799)} over them."
1 Samuel,8,10,And Samuel{H8050} told{H559}{(H8799)} all the words{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} unto the people{H5971} that asked{H7592}{(H8802)} of him a king{H4428}.
1 Samuel,8,11,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, This will be the manner{H4941} of the king{H4428} that shall reign{H4427}{(H8799)} over you: He will take{H3947}{(H8799)} your sons{H1121}, and appoint{H7760}{(H8804)} them for himself, for his chariots{H4818}, and to be his horsemen{H6571}; and some shall run{H7323}{(H8804)} before{H6440} his chariots{H4818}."
1 Samuel,8,12,"And he will appoint{H7760}{(H8800)} him captains{H8269} over thousands{H505}, and captains{H8269} over fifties{H2572}; and will set them to ear{H2790}{(H8800)} his ground{H2758}, and to reap{H7114}{(H8800)} his harvest{H7105}, and to make{H6213}{(H8800)} his instruments{H3627} of war{H4421}, and instruments{H3627} of his chariots{H7393}."
1 Samuel,8,13,"And he will take{H3947}{(H8799)} your daughters{H1323} to be confectionaries{H7548}, and to be cooks{H2879}, and to be bakers{H644}{(H8802)}."
1 Samuel,8,14,"And he will take{H3947}{(H8799)} your fields{H7704}, and your vineyards{H3754}, and your oliveyards{H2132}, even the best{H2896} of them, and give{H5414}{(H8804)} them to his servants{H5650}."
1 Samuel,8,15,"And he will take the tenth{H6237}{(H8799)} of your seed{H2233}, and of your vineyards{H3754}, and give{H5414}{(H8804)} to his officers{H5631}, and to his servants{H5650}."
1 Samuel,8,16,"And he will take{H3947}{(H8799)} your menservants{H5650}, and your maidservants{H8198}, and your goodliest{H2896} young men{H970}, and your asses{H2543}, and put{H6213}{(H8804)} them to his work{H4399}."
1 Samuel,8,17,He will take the tenth{H6237}{(H8799)} of your sheep{H6629}: and ye shall be his servants{H5650}.
1 Samuel,8,18,And ye shall cry out{H2199}{(H8804)} in that day{H3117} because{H6440} of your king{H4428} which ye shall have chosen{H977}{(H8804)} you; and the LORD{H3068} will not hear{H6030}{(H8799)} you in that day{H3117}.
1 Samuel,8,19,"Nevertheless the people{H5971} refused{H3985}{(H8762)} to obey{H8085}{(H8800)} the voice{H6963} of Samuel{H8050}; and they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Nay; but we will have a king{H4428} over us;"
1 Samuel,8,20,"That we also may be like all the nations{H1471}; and that our king{H4428} may judge{H8199}{(H8804)} us, and go out{H3318}{(H8804)} before{H6440} us, and fight{H3898}{(H8738)} our battles{H4421}."
1 Samuel,8,21,"And Samuel{H8050} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} all the words{H1697} of the people{H5971}, and he rehearsed{H1696}{(H8762)} them in the ears{H241} of the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,8,22,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Samuel{H8050}, Hearken{H8085}{(H8798)} unto their voice{H6963}, and make{H4427}{(H8689)} them a king{H4428}. And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the men{H582} of Israel{H3478}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} ye every man{H376} unto his city{H5892}."
1 Samuel,9,1,"Now there was a man{H376} of Benjamin{H1144}, whose name{H8034} was Kish{H7027}, the son{H1121} of Abiel{H22}, the son{H1121} of Zeror{H6872}, the son{H1121} of Bechorath{H1064}, the son{H1121} of Aphiah{H647}, a Benjamite{H1145}, a mighty{H1368} man{H376} of power{H2428}."
1 Samuel,9,2,"And he had a son{H1121}, whose name{H8034} was Saul{H7586}, a choice young man{H970}, and a goodly{H2896}: and there was not among the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} a goodlier{H2896} person{H376} than he: from his shoulders{H7926} and upward{H4605} he was higher{H1364} than any of the people{H5971}."
1 Samuel,9,3,"And the asses{H860} of Kish{H7027} Saul's{H7586} father{H1} were lost{H6}{(H8799)}. And Kish{H7027} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Saul{H7586} his son{H1121}, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} now one{H259} of the servants{H5288} with thee, and arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, go{H3212}{(H8798)} seek{H1245}{(H8761)} the asses{H860}."
1 Samuel,9,4,"And he passed through{H5674}{(H8799)} mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}, and passed through{H5674}{(H8799)} the land{H776} of Shalisha{H8031}, but they found{H4672}{(H8804)} them not: then they passed through{H5674}{(H8799)} the land{H776} of Shalim{H8171}, and there they were not: and he passed through{H5674}{(H8799)} the land{H776} of the Benjamites{H1145}, but they found{H4672}{(H8804)} them not."
1 Samuel,9,5,"And when they were come{H935}{(H8804)} to the land{H776} of Zuph{H6689}, Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8804)} to his servant{H5288} that was with him, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and let us return{H7725}{(H8799)}; lest my father{H1} leave{H2308}{(H8799)} caring for the asses{H860}, and take thought{H1672}{(H8804)} for us."
1 Samuel,9,6,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Behold now, there is in this city{H5892} a man{H376} of God{H430}, and he is an honourable{H3513}{(H8737)} man{H376}; all that he saith{H1696}{(H8762)} cometh{H935}{(H8799)} surely to pass{H935}{(H8800)}: now let us go{H3212}{(H8799)} thither; peradventure he can shew{H5046}{(H8686)} us our way{H1870} that we should go{H1980}{(H8804)}."
1 Samuel,9,7,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Saul{H7586} to his servant{H5288}, But, behold, if we go{H3212}{(H8799)}, what shall we bring{H935}{(H8686)} the man{H376}? for the bread{H3899} is spent{H235}{(H8804)} in our vessels{H3627}, and there is not a present{H8670} to bring{H935}{(H8687)} to the man{H376} of God{H430}: what have we?"
1 Samuel,9,8,"And the servant{H5288} answered{H6030}{(H8800)} Saul{H7586} again{H3254}{(H8686)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, I have{H4672}{(H8738)} here at hand{H3027} the fourth part{H7253} of a shekel{H8255} of silver{H3701}: that will I give{H5414}{(H8804)} to the man{H376} of God{H430}, to tell{H5046}{(H8689)} us our way{H1870}."
1 Samuel,9,9,"(Beforetime{H6440} in Israel{H3478}, when a man{H376} went{H3212}{(H8800)} to enquire{H1875}{(H8800)} of God{H430}, thus he spake{H559}{(H8804)}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and let us go{H3212}{(H8799)} to the seer{H7200}{(H8802)}: for he that is now{H3117} called a Prophet{H5030} was beforetime{H6440} called{H7121}{(H8735)} a Seer{H7200}{(H8802)}.)"
1 Samuel,9,10,"Then said{H1697} Saul{H7586} to his servant{H5288}, Well{H2896} said{H559}{(H8799)}; come{H3212}{(H8798)}, let us go{H3212}{(H8799)}. So they went{H3212}{(H8799)} unto the city{H5892} where the man{H376} of God{H430} was."
1 Samuel,9,11,"And as they went up{H5927}{(H8802)} the hill{H4608} to the city{H5892}, they found{H4672}{(H8804)} young maidens{H5291} going out{H3318}{(H8802)} to draw{H7579}{(H8800)} water{H4325}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Is{H3426} the seer{H7200}{(H8802)} here?"
1 Samuel,9,12,"And they answered{H6030}{(H8799)} them, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, He is{H3426}; behold, he is before{H6440} you: make haste{H4116}{(H8761)} now, for he came{H935}{(H8804)} to day{H3117} to the city{H5892}; for there is a sacrifice{H2077} of the people{H5971} to day{H3117} in the high place{H1116}:"
1 Samuel,9,13,"As soon as ye be come{H935}{(H8800)} into the city{H5892}, ye shall straightway{H3651} find{H4672}{(H8799)} him, before he go up{H5927}{(H8799)} to the high place{H1116} to eat{H398}{(H8800)}: for the people{H5971} will not eat{H398}{(H8799)} until he come{H935}{(H8800)}, because he doth bless{H1288}{(H8762)} the sacrifice{H2077}; and afterwards{H310}{H3651} they eat{H398}{(H8799)} that be bidden{H7121}{(H8803)}. Now therefore get you up{H5927}{(H8798)}; for about this time{H3117} ye shall find{H4672}{(H8799)} him."
1 Samuel,9,14,"And they went up{H5927}{(H8799)} into{H8432} the city{H5892}: and when they were come{H935}{(H8802)} into the city{H5892}, behold, Samuel{H8050} came out{H3318}{(H8802)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} them, for to go up{H5927}{(H8800)} to the high place{H1116}."
1 Samuel,9,15,"Now the LORD{H3068} had told{H1540}{(H8804)} Samuel{H8050} in his ear{H241} a{H259} day{H3117} before{H6440} Saul{H7586} came{H935}{(H8800)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
1 Samuel,9,16,"To morrow{H4279} about this time{H6256} I will send{H7971}{(H8799)} thee a man{H376} out of the land{H776} of Benjamin{H1144}, and thou shalt anoint{H4886}{(H8804)} him to be captain{H5057} over my people{H5971} Israel{H3478}, that he may save{H3467}{(H8689)} my people{H5971} out of the hand{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430}: for I have looked{H7200}{(H8804)} upon my people{H5971}, because their cry{H6818} is come{H935}{(H8804)} unto me."
1 Samuel,9,17,"And when Samuel{H8050} saw{H7200}{(H8804)} Saul{H7586}, the LORD{H3068} said{H6030}{(H8804)} unto him, Behold the man{H376} whom I spake{H559}{(H8804)} to thee of! this same shall reign{H6113}{(H8799)} over my people{H5971}."
1 Samuel,9,18,"Then Saul{H7586} drew near{H5066}{(H8799)} to Samuel{H8050} in{H8432} the gate{H8179}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Tell{H5046}{(H8685)} me, I pray thee, where{H335} the seer's{H7200}{(H8802)} house{H1004} is."
1 Samuel,9,19,"And Samuel{H8050} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Saul{H7586}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, I am the seer{H7200}{(H8802)}: go up{H5927}{(H8798)} before{H6440} me unto the high place{H1116}; for ye shall eat{H398}{(H8804)} with me to day{H3117}, and to morrow{H1242} I will let thee go{H7971}{(H8765)}, and will tell{H5046}{(H8686)} thee all that is in thine heart{H3824}."
1 Samuel,9,20,"And as for thine asses{H860} that were lost{H6}{(H8802)} three{H7969} days{H3117} ago{H3117}, set{H7760}{(H8799)} not thy mind{H3820} on them; for they are found{H4672}{(H8738)}. And on whom is all the desire{H2532} of Israel{H3478}? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's{H1} house{H1004}?"
1 Samuel,9,21,"And Saul{H7586} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Am not I a Benjamite{H1145}, of the smallest{H6996} of the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}? and my family{H4940} the least{H6810} of all the families{H4940} of the tribe{H7626} of Benjamin{H1144}? wherefore then speakest{H1696}{(H8765)} thou so{H1697} to me?"
1 Samuel,9,22,"And Samuel{H8050} took{H3947}{(H8799)} Saul{H7586} and his servant{H5288}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} them into the parlour{H3957}, and made them sit{H5414}{(H8799)} in the chiefest{H7218} place{H4725} among them that were bidden{H7121}{(H8803)}, which were about thirty{H7970} persons{H376}."
1 Samuel,9,23,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the cook{H2876}, Bring{H5414}{(H8798)} the portion{H4490} which I gave{H5414}{(H8804)} thee, of which I said{H559}{(H8804)} unto thee, Set{H7760}{(H8798)} it by thee."
1 Samuel,9,24,"And the cook{H2876} took up{H7311}{(H8686)} the shoulder{H7785}, and that which was upon it, and set{H7760}{(H8799)} it before{H6440} Saul{H7586}. And Samuel said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold that which is left{H7604}{(H8737)}! set{H7760}{(H8798)} it before{H6440} thee, and eat{H398}{(H8798)}: for unto this time{H4150} hath it been kept{H8104}{(H8803)} for thee since I said{H559}{(H8800)}, I have invited{H7121}{(H8804)} the people{H5971}. So Saul{H7586} did eat{H398}{(H8799)} with Samuel{H8050} that day{H3117}."
1 Samuel,9,25,"And when they were come down{H3381}{(H8799)} from the high place{H1116} into the city{H5892}, Samuel communed{H1696}{(H8762)} with Saul{H7586} upon the top of the house{H1406}."
1 Samuel,9,26,"And they arose early{H7925}{(H8686)}: and it came to pass about the spring{H5927}{(H8800)} of the day{H7837}, that Samuel{H8050} called{H7121}{(H8799)} Saul{H7586} to the top of the house{H1406}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Up{H6965}{(H8798)}, that I may send thee away{H7971}{(H8762)}. And Saul{H7586} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and they went out{H3318}{(H8799)} both{H8147} of them, he and Samuel{H8050}, abroad{H2351}."
1 Samuel,9,27,"And as they were going down{H3381}{(H8802)} to the end{H7097} of the city{H5892}, Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8804)} to Saul{H7586}, Bid{H559}{(H8798)} the servant{H5288} pass on{H5674}{(H8799)} before{H6440} us,(and he passed on{H5674}{(H8798)},) but stand{H5975}{(H8798)} thou still a while{H3117}, that I may shew{H8085}{(H8686)} thee the word{H1697} of God{H430}."
1 Samuel,10,1,"Then Samuel{H8050} took{H3947}{(H8799)} a vial{H6378} of oil{H8081}, and poured{H3332}{(H8799)} it upon his head{H7218}, and kissed{H5401}{(H8799)} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is it not because the LORD{H3068} hath anointed{H4886}{(H8804)} thee to be captain{H5057} over his inheritance{H5159}?"
1 Samuel,10,2,"When thou art departed{H3212}{(H8800)} from me{H5978} to day{H3117}, then thou shalt find{H4672}{(H8804)} two{H8147} men{H582} by Rachel's{H7354} sepulchre{H6900} in the border{H1366} of Benjamin{H1144} at Zelzah{H6766}; and they will say{H559}{(H8804)} unto thee, The asses{H860} which thou wentest{H1980}{(H8804)} to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} are found{H4672}{(H8738)}: and, lo, thy father{H1} hath left{H5203}{(H8804)} the care{H1697} of the asses{H860}, and sorroweth{H1672}{(H8804)} for you, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, What shall I do{H6213}{(H8799)} for my son{H1121}?"
1 Samuel,10,3,"Then shalt thou go on{H2498}{(H8804)} forward{H1973} from thence, and thou shalt come{H935}{(H8804)} to the plain{H436} of Tabor{H8396}, and there shall meet{H4672}{(H8804)} thee three{H7969} men{H582} going up{H5927}{(H8802)} to God{H430} to Bethel{H1008}, one{H259} carrying{H5375}{(H8802)} three{H7969} kids{H1423}, and another{H259} carrying{H5375}{(H8802)} three{H7969} loaves{H3603} of bread{H3899}, and another{H259} carrying{H5375}{(H8802)} a bottle{H5035} of wine{H3196}:"
1 Samuel,10,4,"And they will{H7592}{(H8804)} salute{H7965} thee, and give{H5414}{(H8804)} thee two{H8147} loaves of bread{H3899}; which thou shalt receive{H3947}{(H8804)} of their hands{H3027}."
1 Samuel,10,5,"After{H310} that thou shalt come{H935}{(H8799)} to the hill{H1389} of God{H430}, where is the garrison{H5333} of the Philistines{H6430}: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither{H935}{(H8800)} to the city{H5892}, that thou shalt meet{H6293}{(H8804)} a company{H2256} of prophets{H5030} coming down{H3381}{(H8802)} from the high place{H1116} with a psaltery{H5035}, and a tabret{H8596}, and a pipe{H2485}, and a harp{H3658}, before{H6440} them; and they shall prophesy{H5012}{(H8693)}:"
1 Samuel,10,6,"And the Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} will come{H6743}{(H8804)} upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy{H5012}{(H8694)} with them, and shalt be turned{H2015}{(H8738)} into another{H312} man{H376}."
1 Samuel,10,7,"And let it be, when these signs{H226} are come{H935}{(H8799)} unto thee, that thou do{H6213}{(H8798)} as occasion{H4672}{(H8799)} serve{H3027} thee; for God{H430} is with thee."
1 Samuel,10,8,"And thou shalt go down{H3381}{(H8804)} before{H6440} me to Gilgal{H1537}; and, behold, I will come down{H3381}{(H8802)} unto thee, to offer{H5927}{(H8687)} burnt offerings{H5930}, and to sacrifice{H2076}{(H8800)} sacrifices{H2077} of peace offerings{H8002}: seven{H7651} days{H3117} shalt thou tarry{H3176}{(H8686)}, till I come{H935}{(H8800)} to thee, and shew{H3045}{(H8689)} thee what thou shalt do{H6213}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,10,9,"And it was so, that when he had turned{H6437}{(H8687)} his back{H7926} to go{H3212}{(H8800)} from Samuel{H8050}, God{H430} gave{H2015}{(H8799)} him another{H312} heart{H3820}: and all those signs{H226} came{H935}{(H8799)} to pass that day{H3117}."
1 Samuel,10,10,"And when they came{H935}{(H8799)} thither to the hill{H1389}, behold, a company{H2256} of prophets{H5030} met{H7125}{(H8800)} him; and the Spirit{H7307} of God{H430} came{H6743}{(H8799)} upon him, and he prophesied{H5012}{(H8691)} among{H8432} them."
1 Samuel,10,11,"And it came to pass, when all that knew{H3045}{(H8802)} him beforetime{H865}{H8032} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that, behold, he prophesied{H5012}{(H8738)} among the prophets{H5030}, then the people{H5971} said{H559}{(H8799)} one{H376} to another{H7453}, What is this that is come unto the son{H1121} of Kish{H7027}? Is Saul{H7586} also among the prophets{H5030}?"
1 Samuel,10,12,"And one{H376} of the same place answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, But who is their father{H1}? Therefore it became a proverb{H4912}, Is Saul{H7586} also among the prophets{H5030}?"
1 Samuel,10,13,"And when he had made an end{H3615}{(H8762)} of prophesying{H5012}{(H8692)}, he came{H935}{(H8799)} to the high place{H1116}."
1 Samuel,10,14,"And Saul's{H7586} uncle{H1730} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him and to his servant{H5288}, Whither{H575} went{H1980}{(H8804)} ye? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, To seek{H1245}{(H8763)} the asses{H860}: and when we saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that they were no where{H369}, we came{H935}{(H8799)} to Samuel{H8050}."
1 Samuel,10,15,"And Saul's{H7586} uncle{H1730} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Tell{H5046}{(H8685)} me, I pray thee, what Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8804)} unto you."
1 Samuel,10,16,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his uncle{H1730}, He told{H5046}{(H8689)} us plainly{H5046}{(H8687)} that the asses{H860} were found{H4672}{(H8738)}. But of the matter{H1697} of the kingdom{H4410}, whereof Samuel{H8050} spake{H559}{(H8804)}, he told{H5046}{(H8689)} him not."
1 Samuel,10,17,And Samuel{H8050} called{H6817}{(H8686)} the people{H5971} together unto the LORD{H3068} to Mizpeh{H4709};
1 Samuel,10,18,"And said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, I brought up{H5927}{(H8689)} Israel{H3478} out of Egypt{H4714}, and delivered{H5337}{(H8686)} you out of the hand{H3027} of the Egyptians{H4714}, and out of the hand{H3027} of all kingdoms{H4467}, and of them that oppressed{H3905}{(H8801)} you:"
1 Samuel,10,19,"And ye have this day{H3117} rejected{H3988}{(H8804)} your God{H430}, who himself saved{H3467}{(H8688)} you out of all your adversities{H7451} and your tribulations{H6869}; and ye have said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Nay, but set{H7760}{(H8799)} a king{H4428} over us. Now therefore present{H3320}{(H8690)} yourselves before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} by your tribes{H7626}, and by your thousands{H505}."
1 Samuel,10,20,"And when Samuel{H8050} had caused all the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478} to come near{H7126}{(H8686)}, the tribe{H7626} of Benjamin{H1144} was taken{H3920}{(H8735)}."
1 Samuel,10,21,"When he had caused the tribe{H7626} of Benjamin{H1144} to come near{H7126}{(H8686)} by their families{H4940}, the family{H4940} of Matri{H4309} was taken{H3920}{(H8735)}, and Saul{H7586} the son{H1121} of Kish{H7027} was taken{H3920}{(H8735)}: and when they sought{H1245}{(H8762)} him, he could not be found{H4672}{(H8738)}."
1 Samuel,10,22,"Therefore they enquired{H7592}{(H8799)} of the LORD{H3068} further, if the man{H376} should yet come{H935}{(H8804)} thither{H1988}. And the LORD{H3068} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, he hath hid{H2244}{(H8737)} himself among the stuff{H3627}."
1 Samuel,10,23,"And they ran{H7323}{(H8799)} and fetched{H3947}{(H8799)} him thence: and when he stood{H3320}{(H8691)} among{H8432} the people{H5971}, he was higher{H1361}{(H8799)} than any of the people{H5971} from his shoulders{H7926} and upward{H4605}."
1 Samuel,10,24,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)} to all the people{H5971}, See{H7200}{(H8804)} ye him whom the LORD{H3068} hath chosen{H977}{(H8804)}, that there is none like him among all the people{H5971}? And all the people{H5971} shouted{H7321}{(H8686)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, God save{H2421}{(H8799)} the king{H4428}."
1 Samuel,10,25,"Then Samuel{H8050} told{H1696}{(H8762)} the people{H5971} the manner{H4941} of the kingdom{H4410}, and wrote{H3789}{(H8799)} it in a book{H5612}, and laid it up{H3240}{(H8686)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}. And Samuel{H8050} sent{H7971} all the people{H5971} away{H7971}{(H8762)}, every man{H376} to his house{H1004}."
1 Samuel,10,26,"And Saul{H7586} also went{H1980}{(H8804)} home{H1004} to Gibeah{H1390}; and there went{H3212}{(H8799)} with him a band of men{H2428}, whose hearts{H3820} God{H430} had touched{H5060}{(H8804)}."
1 Samuel,10,27,"But the children{H1121} of Belial{H1100} said{H559}{(H8804)}, How shall this man save{H3467}{(H8686)} us? And they despised{H959}{(H8799)} him, and brought{H935}{(H8689)} him no presents{H4503}. But he held his peace{H2790}{(H8688)}."
1 Samuel,11,1,"Then Nahash{H5176} the Ammonite{H5984} came up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and encamped{H2583}{(H8799)} against Jabeshgilead{H3003}{H1568}: and all the men{H582} of Jabesh{H3003} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Nahash{H5176}, Make{H3772}{(H8798)} a covenant{H1285} with us, and we will serve{H5647}{(H8799)} thee."
1 Samuel,11,2,"And Nahash{H5176} the Ammonite{H5984} answered{H559}{(H8799)} them, On this{H2063} condition will I make{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant with you, that I may thrust out{H5365}{(H8800)} all your right{H3225} eyes{H5869}, and lay{H7760}{(H8804)} it for a reproach{H2781} upon all Israel{H3478}."
1 Samuel,11,3,"And the elders{H2205} of Jabesh{H3003} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Give us seven{H7651} days{H3117}' respite{H7503}{(H8685)}, that we may send{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} unto all the coasts{H1366} of Israel{H3478}: and then, if there be no man to save{H3467}{(H8688)} us, we will come out{H3318}{(H8804)} to thee."
1 Samuel,11,4,"Then came{H935}{(H8799)} the messengers{H4397} to Gibeah{H1390} of Saul{H7586}, and told{H1696}{(H8762)} the tidings{H1697} in the ears{H241} of the people{H5971}: and all the people{H5971} lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} their voices{H6963}, and wept{H1058}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,11,5,"And, behold, Saul{H7586} came{H935}{(H8804)} after{H310} the herd{H1241} out of the field{H7704}; and Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)}, What aileth the people{H5971} that they weep{H1058}{(H8799)}? And they told{H5608}{(H8762)} him the tidings{H1697} of the men{H582} of Jabesh{H3003}."
1 Samuel,11,6,"And the Spirit{H7307} of God{H430} came{H6743}{(H8799)} upon Saul{H7586} when he heard{H8085}{(H8800)} those tidings{H1697}, and his anger{H639} was kindled{H2734}{(H8799)} greatly{H3966}."
1 Samuel,11,7,"And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} a yoke{H6776} of oxen{H1241}, and hewed them in pieces{H5408}{(H8762)}, and sent{H7971}{(H8762)} them throughout all the coasts{H1366} of Israel{H3478} by the hands{H3027} of messengers{H4397}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Whosoever cometh not forth{H3318}{(H8802)} after{H310} Saul{H7586} and after{H310} Samuel{H8050}, so shall it be done{H6213}{(H8735)} unto his oxen{H1241}. And the fear{H6343} of the LORD{H3068} fell{H5307}{(H8799)} on the people{H5971}, and they came out{H3318}{(H8799)} with one{H259} consent{H376}."
1 Samuel,11,8,"And when he numbered{H6485}{(H8799)} them in Bezek{H966}, the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} were three{H7969} hundred{H3967} thousand{H505}, and the men{H376} of Judah{H3063} thirty{H7970} thousand{H505}."
1 Samuel,11,9,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the messengers{H4397} that came{H935}{(H8802)}, Thus shall ye say{H559}{(H8799)} unto the men{H376} of Jabeshgilead{H3003}{H1568}, To morrow{H4279}, by that time the sun{H8121} be hot{H2527}, ye shall have help{H8668}. And the messengers{H4397} came{H935}{(H8799)} and shewed{H5046}{(H8686)} it to the men{H582} of Jabesh{H3003}; and they were glad{H8055}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,11,10,"Therefore the men{H582} of Jabesh{H3003} said{H559}{(H8799)}, To morrow{H4279} we will come out{H3318}{(H8799)} unto you, and ye shall do{H6213}{(H8804)} with us all that seemeth{H5869} good{H2896} unto you."
1 Samuel,11,11,"And it was so on the morrow{H4283}, that Saul{H7586} put{H7760}{(H8799)} the people{H5971} in three{H7969} companies{H7218}; and they came{H935}{(H8799)} into the midst{H8432} of the host{H4264} in the morning{H1242} watch{H821}, and slew{H5221}{(H8686)} the Ammonites{H5983} until the heat{H2527} of the day{H3117}: and it came to pass, that they which remained{H7604}{(H8737)} were scattered{H6327}{(H8799)}, so that two{H8147} of them were not left{H7604}{(H8738)} together{H3162}."
1 Samuel,11,12,"And the people{H5971} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Samuel{H8050}, Who is he that said{H559}{(H8802)}, Shall Saul{H7586} reign{H4427}{(H8799)} over us? bring{H5414}{(H8798)} the men{H582}, that we may put them to death{H4191}{(H8686)}."
1 Samuel,11,13,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)}, There shall not a man{H376} be put to death{H4191}{(H8714)} this day{H3117}: for to day{H3117} the LORD{H3068} hath wrought{H6213}{(H8804)} salvation{H8668} in Israel{H3478}."
1 Samuel,11,14,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Samuel{H8050} to the people{H5971}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and let us go{H3212}{(H8799)} to Gilgal{H1537}, and renew{H2318}{(H8762)} the kingdom{H4410} there."
1 Samuel,11,15,And all the people{H5971} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Gilgal{H1537}; and there they made Saul{H7586} king{H4427}{(H8686)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} in Gilgal{H1537}; and there they sacrificed{H2076}{(H8799)} sacrifices{H2077} of peace offerings{H8002} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}; and there Saul{H7586} and all the men{H582} of Israel{H3478} rejoiced{H8055}{(H8799)} greatly{H3966}.
1 Samuel,12,1,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto all Israel{H3478}, Behold, I have hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} unto your voice{H6963} in all that ye said{H559}{(H8804)} unto me, and have made{H4427}{(H8686)} a king{H4428} over you."
1 Samuel,12,2,"And now, behold, the king{H4428} walketh{H1980}{(H8693)} before{H6440} you: and I am old{H2204}{(H8804)} and grayheaded{H7867}{(H8804)}; and, behold, my sons{H1121} are with you: and I have walked{H1980}{(H8694)} before{H6440} you from my childhood{H5271} unto this day{H3117}."
1 Samuel,12,3,"Behold, here I am: witness{H6030}{(H8798)} against me before the LORD{H3068}, and before his anointed{H4899}: whose ox{H7794} have I taken{H3947}{(H8804)}? or whose ass{H2543} have I taken{H3947}{(H8804)}? or whom have I defrauded{H6231}{(H8804)}? whom have I oppressed{H7533}{(H8804)}? or of whose hand{H3027} have I received any bribe{H3724} to blind{H5956}{(H8686)} mine eyes{H5869} therewith? and I will restore{H7725}{(H8686)} it you."
1 Samuel,12,4,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou hast not defrauded{H6231}{(H8804)} us, nor oppressed{H7533}{(H8804)} us, neither hast thou taken{H3947}{(H8804)} ought{H3972} of any man's{H376} hand{H3027}."
1 Samuel,12,5,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, The LORD{H3068} is witness{H5707} against you, and his anointed{H4899} is witness{H5707} this day{H3117}, that ye have not found{H4672}{(H8804)} ought{H3972} in my hand{H3027}. And they answered{H559}{(H8799)}, He is witness{H5707}."
1 Samuel,12,6,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the people{H5971}, It is the LORD{H3068} that advanced{H6213}{(H8804)} Moses{H4872} and Aaron{H175}, and that brought{H5927} your fathers{H1} up{H5927}{(H8689)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
1 Samuel,12,7,"Now therefore stand still{H3320}{(H8690)}, that I may reason{H8199}{(H8735)} with you before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} of all the righteous acts{H6666} of the LORD{H3068}, which he did{H6213}{(H8804)} to you and to your fathers{H1}."
1 Samuel,12,8,"When Jacob{H3290} was come{H935}{(H8804)} into Egypt{H4714}, and your fathers{H1} cried{H2199}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}, then the LORD{H3068} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Moses{H4872} and Aaron{H175}, which brought forth{H3318}{(H8686)} your fathers{H1} out of Egypt{H4714}, and made them dwell{H3427}{(H8686)} in this place{H4725}."
1 Samuel,12,9,"And when they forgat{H7911}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, he sold{H4376}{(H8799)} them into the hand{H3027} of Sisera{H5516}, captain{H8269} of the host{H6635} of Hazor{H2674}, and into the hand{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430}, and into the hand{H3027} of the king{H4428} of Moab{H4124}, and they fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against them."
1 Samuel,12,10,"And they cried{H2199}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, We have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}, because we have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, and have served{H5647}{(H8799)} Baalim{H1168} and Ashtaroth{H6252}: but now deliver{H5337}{(H8685)} us out of the hand{H3027} of our enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, and we will serve{H5647}{(H8799)} thee."
1 Samuel,12,11,"And the LORD{H3068} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Jerubbaal{H3378}, and Bedan{H917}, and Jephthah{H3316}, and Samuel{H8050}, and delivered{H5337}{(H8686)} you out of the hand{H3027} of your enemies{H341}{(H8802)} on every side{H5439}, and ye dwelled{H3427}{(H8799)} safe{H983}."
1 Samuel,12,12,"And when ye saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that Nahash{H5176} the king{H4428} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} came{H935}{(H8804)} against you, ye said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Nay; but a king{H4428} shall reign{H4427}{(H8799)} over us: when the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} was your king{H4428}."
1 Samuel,12,13,"Now therefore behold the king{H4428} whom ye have chosen{H977}{(H8804)}, and whom ye have desired{H7592}{(H8804)}! and, behold, the LORD{H3068} hath set{H5414}{(H8804)} a king{H4428} over you."
1 Samuel,12,14,"If ye will fear{H3372}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}, and serve{H5647}{(H8804)} him, and obey{H8085}{(H8804)} his voice{H6963}, and not rebel{H4784}{(H8686)} against the commandment{H6310} of the LORD{H3068}, then shall both ye and also the king{H4428} that reigneth{H4427}{(H8804)} over you continue following{H310} the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}:"
1 Samuel,12,15,"But if ye will not obey{H8085}{(H8799)} the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068}, but rebel{H4784}{(H8804)} against the commandment{H6310} of the LORD{H3068}, then shall the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068} be against you, as it was against your fathers{H1}."
1 Samuel,12,16,"Now therefore{H1571} stand{H3320}{(H8690)} and see{H7200}{(H8798)} this great{H1419} thing{H1697}, which the LORD{H3068} will do{H6213}{(H8802)} before your eyes{H5869}."
1 Samuel,12,17,"Is it not wheat{H2406} harvest{H7105} to day{H3117}? I will call{H7121}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}, and he shall send{H5414}{(H8799)} thunder{H6963} and rain{H4306}; that ye may perceive{H3045}{(H8798)} and see{H7200}{(H8798)} that your wickedness{H7451} is great{H7227}, which ye have done{H6213}{(H8804)} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, in asking{H7592}{(H8800)} you a king{H4428}."
1 Samuel,12,18,So Samuel{H8050} called{H7121}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}; and the LORD{H3068} sent{H5414}{(H8799)} thunder{H6963} and rain{H4306} that day{H3117}: and all the people{H5971} greatly{H3966} feared{H3372}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} and Samuel{H8050}.
1 Samuel,12,19,"And all the people{H5971} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Samuel{H8050}, Pray{H6419}{(H8690)} for thy servants{H5650} unto the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}, that we die{H4191}{(H8799)} not: for we have added{H3254}{(H8804)} unto all our sins{H2403} this evil{H7451}, to ask{H7592}{(H8800)} us a king{H4428}."
1 Samuel,12,20,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the people{H5971}, Fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not: ye have done{H6213}{(H8804)} all this wickedness{H7451}: yet turn not aside{H5493}{(H8799)} from following{H310} the LORD{H3068}, but serve{H5647}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} with all your heart{H3824};"
1 Samuel,12,21,"And turn ye not aside{H5493}{(H8799)}: for then should ye go after{H310} vain{H8414} things, which cannot profit{H3276}{(H8686)} nor deliver{H5337}{(H8686)}; for they are vain{H8414}."
1 Samuel,12,22,For the LORD{H3068} will not forsake{H5203}{(H8799)} his people{H5971} for his great{H1419} name's{H8034} sake: because it hath pleased{H2974}{(H8689)} the LORD{H3068} to make{H6213}{(H8800)} you his people{H5971}.
1 Samuel,12,23,"Moreover as for me{H595}, God forbid{H2486} that I should sin{H2398}{(H8800)} against the LORD{H3068} in ceasing{H2308}{(H8800)} to pray{H6419}{(H8692)} for you: but I will teach{H3384}{(H8689)} you the good{H2896} and the right{H3477} way{H1870}:"
1 Samuel,12,24,"Only fear{H3372}{(H8798)} the LORD{H3068}, and serve{H5647}{(H8804)} him in truth{H571} with all your heart{H3824}: for consider{H7200}{(H8798)} how great things he hath done{H1431}{(H8689)} for you."
1 Samuel,12,25,"But if ye shall still{H7489}{(H8687)} do wickedly{H7489}{(H8686)}, ye shall be consumed{H5595}{(H8735)}, both ye and your king{H4428}."
1 Samuel,13,1,"Saul{H7586} reigned{H4427}{(H8800)} one year{H1121}{H8141}; and when he had reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} two{H8147} years{H8141} over Israel{H3478},"
1 Samuel,13,2,"Saul{H7586} chose{H977}{(H8799)} him three{H7969} thousand{H505} men of Israel{H3478}; whereof two thousand{H505} were with Saul{H7586} in Michmash{H4363} and in mount{H2022} Bethel{H1008}, and a thousand{H505} were with Jonathan{H3129} in Gibeah{H1390} of Benjamin{H1144}: and the rest{H3499} of the people{H5971} he sent{H7971}{(H8765)} every man{H376} to his tent{H168}."
1 Samuel,13,3,"And Jonathan{H3129} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the garrison{H5333} of the Philistines{H6430} that was in Geba{H1387}, and the Philistines{H6430} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} of it. And Saul{H7586} blew{H8628}{(H8804)} the trumpet{H7782} throughout all the land{H776}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Let the Hebrews{H5680} hear{H8085}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,13,4,"And all Israel{H3478} heard{H8085}{(H8804)} say{H559}{(H8800)} that Saul{H7586} had smitten{H5221}{(H8689)} a garrison{H5333} of the Philistines{H6430}, and that Israel{H3478} also was had in abomination{H887}{(H8738)} with the Philistines{H6430}. And the people{H5971} were called together{H6817}{(H8735)} after{H310} Saul{H7586} to Gilgal{H1537}."
1 Samuel,13,5,"And the Philistines{H6430} gathered themselves together{H622}{(H8738)} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} with Israel{H3478}, thirty{H7970} thousand{H505} chariots{H7393}, and six{H8337} thousand{H505} horsemen{H6571}, and people{H5971} as the sand{H2344} which is on the sea{H3220} shore{H8193} in multitude{H7230}: and they came up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} in Michmash{H4363}, eastward{H6926} from Bethaven{H1007}."
1 Samuel,13,6,"When the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} saw{H7200}{(H8804)} that they were in a strait{H6887}{(H8804)},(for the people{H5971} were distressed{H5065}{(H8738)},) then the people{H5971} did hide{H2244}{(H8691)} themselves in caves{H4631}, and in thickets{H2337}, and in rocks{H5553}, and in high places{H6877}, and in pits{H953}."
1 Samuel,13,7,"And some of the Hebrews{H5680} went over{H5674}{(H8804)} Jordan{H3383} to the land{H776} of Gad{H1410} and Gilead{H1568}. As for Saul{H7586}, he was yet in Gilgal{H1537}, and all the people{H5971} followed{H310} him trembling{H2729}{(H8804)}."
1 Samuel,13,8,"And he tarried{H3176}{(H8686)}{(H8675)}{H3176}{(H8735)} seven{H7651} days{H3117}, according to the set time{H4150} that Samuel{H8050} had appointed: but Samuel{H8050} came{H935}{(H8804)} not to Gilgal{H1537}; and the people{H5971} were scattered{H6327}{(H8686)} from him."
1 Samuel,13,9,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Bring hither{H5066}{(H8685)} a burnt offering{H5930} to me, and peace offerings{H8002}. And he offered{H5927}{(H8686)} the burnt offering{H5930}."
1 Samuel,13,10,"And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end{H3615}{(H8763)} of offering{H5927}{(H8687)} the burnt offering{H5930}, behold, Samuel{H8050} came{H935}{(H8802)}; and Saul{H7586} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} him, that he might salute{H1288}{(H8800)} him."
1 Samuel,13,11,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)}, What hast thou done{H6213}{(H8804)}? And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Because I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} that the people{H5971} were scattered{H5310}{(H8804)} from me, and that thou camest{H935}{(H8804)} not within the days{H3117} appointed{H4150}, and that the Philistines{H6430} gathered themselves together{H622}{(H8737)} at Michmash{H4363};"
1 Samuel,13,12,"Therefore said{H559}{(H8799)} I, The Philistines{H6430} will come down{H3381}{(H8799)} now upon me to Gilgal{H1537}, and I have not made supplication{H2470}{(H8765)} unto{H6440} the LORD{H3068}: I forced{H662}{(H8691)} myself therefore, and offered{H5927}{(H8686)} a burnt offering{H5930}."
1 Samuel,13,13,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Saul{H7586}, Thou hast done foolishly{H5528}{(H8738)}: thou hast not kept{H8104}{(H8804)} the commandment{H4687} of the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}, which he commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} thee: for now would the LORD{H3068} have established{H3559}{(H8689)} thy kingdom{H4467} upon Israel{H3478} for{H5704} ever{H5769}."
1 Samuel,13,14,"But now thy kingdom{H4467} shall not continue{H6965}{(H8799)}: the LORD{H3068} hath sought{H1245}{(H8765)} him a man{H376} after his own heart{H3824}, and the LORD{H3068} hath commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} him to be captain{H5057} over his people{H5971}, because thou hast not kept{H8104}{(H8804)} that which the LORD{H3068} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} thee."
1 Samuel,13,15,"And Samuel{H8050} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and gat him up{H5927}{(H8799)} from Gilgal{H1537} unto Gibeah{H1390} of Benjamin{H1144}. And Saul{H7586} numbered{H6485}{(H8799)} the people{H5971} that were present{H4672}{(H8737)} with him, about six{H8337} hundred{H3967} men{H376}."
1 Samuel,13,16,"And Saul{H7586}, and Jonathan{H3129} his son{H1121}, and the people{H5971} that were present{H4672}{(H8737)} with them, abode{H3427}{(H8802)} in Gibeah{H1387} of Benjamin{H1144}: but the Philistines{H6430} encamped{H2583}{(H8804)} in Michmash{H4363}."
1 Samuel,13,17,"And the spoilers{H7843}{(H8688)} came out{H3318}{(H8799)} of the camp{H4264} of the Philistines{H6430} in three{H7969} companies{H7218}: one{H259} company{H7218} turned{H6437}{(H8799)} unto the way{H1870} that leadeth to Ophrah{H6084}, unto the land{H776} of Shual{H7777}:"
1 Samuel,13,18,And another{H259} company{H7218} turned{H6437}{(H8799)} the way{H1870} to Bethhoron{H1032}: and another{H259} company{H7218} turned{H6437}{(H8799)} to the way{H1870} of the border{H1366} that looketh{H8259}{(H8737)} to the valley{H1516} of Zeboim{H6650} toward the wilderness{H4057}.
1 Samuel,13,19,"Now there was no smith{H2796} found{H4672}{(H8735)} throughout all the land{H776} of Israel{H3478}: for the Philistines{H6430} said{H559}{(H8804)}, Lest the Hebrews{H5680} make{H6213}{(H8799)} them swords{H2719} or spears{H2595}:"
1 Samuel,13,20,"But all the Israelites{H3478} went down{H3381}{(H8799)} to the Philistines{H6430}, to sharpen{H3913}{(H8800)} every man{H376} his share{H4282}, and his coulter{H855}, and his axe{H7134}, and his mattock{H4281}."
1 Samuel,13,21,"Yet they had a file{H6477}{H6310} for the mattocks{H4281}, and for the coulters{H855}, and for the forks{H7969}{H7053}, and for the axes{H7134}, and to sharpen{H5324}{(H8687)} the goads{H1861}."
1 Samuel,13,22,"So it came to pass in the day{H3117} of battle{H4421}, that there was neither sword{H2719} nor spear{H2595} found{H4672}{(H8738)} in the hand{H3027} of any of the people{H5971} that were with Saul{H7586} and Jonathan{H3129}: but with Saul{H7586} and with Jonathan{H3129} his son{H1121} was there found{H4672}{(H8735)}."
1 Samuel,13,23,And the garrison{H4673} of the Philistines{H6430} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} to the passage{H4569} of Michmash{H4363}.
1 Samuel,14,1,"Now it came to pass upon a day{H3117}, that Jonathan{H3129} the son{H1121} of Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the young man{H5288} that bare{H5375}{(H8802)} his armour{H3627}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and let us go over{H5674}{(H8799)} to the Philistines{H6430}' garrison{H4673}, that is on the other side{H5676}{H1975}. But he told{H5046}{(H8689)} not his father{H1}."
1 Samuel,14,2,And Saul{H7586} tarried{H3427}{(H8802)} in the uttermost{H7097} part of Gibeah{H1390} under a pomegranate tree{H7416} which is in Migron{H4051}: and the people{H5971} that were with him were about six{H8337} hundred{H3967} men{H376};
1 Samuel,14,3,"And Ahiah{H281}, the son{H1121} of Ahitub{H285}, Ichabod's{H350} brother{H251}, the son{H1121} of Phinehas{H6372}, the son{H1121} of Eli{H5941}, the LORD'S{H3068} priest{H3548} in Shiloh{H7887}, wearing{H5375}{(H8802)} an ephod{H646}. And the people{H5971} knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not that Jonathan{H3129} was gone{H1980}{(H8804)}."
1 Samuel,14,4,"And between the passages{H4569}, by which Jonathan{H3129} sought{H1245}{(H8765)} to go over{H5674}{(H8800)} unto the Philistines{H6430}' garrison{H4673}, there was a sharp{H8127} rock{H5553} on the one side{H5676}, and a sharp{H8127} rock{H5553} on the other side{H5676}: and the name{H8034} of the one{H259} was Bozez{H949}, and the name{H8034} of the other{H259} Seneh{H5573}."
1 Samuel,14,5,"The forefront{H8127} of the one{H259} was situate{H4690} northward{H6828} over against{H4136} Michmash{H4363}, and the other{H259} southward{H5045} over against{H4136} Gibeah{H1387}."
1 Samuel,14,6,"And Jonathan{H3083} said{H559}{(H8799)} to the young man{H5288} that bare{H5375}{(H8802)} his armour{H3627}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and let us go over{H5674}{(H8799)} unto the garrison{H4673} of these uncircumcised{H6189}: it may be that the LORD{H3068} will work{H6213}{(H8799)} for us: for there is no restraint{H4622} to the LORD{H3068} to save{H3467}{(H8687)} by many{H7227} or by few{H4592}."
1 Samuel,14,7,"And his armourbearer{H5375}{(H8802)}{H3627} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Do{H6213}{(H8798)} all that is in thine heart{H3824}: turn{H5186}{(H8798)} thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart{H3824}."
1 Samuel,14,8,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Jonathan{H3083}, Behold, we will pass over{H5674}{(H8802)} unto these men{H582}, and we will discover{H1540}{(H8738)} ourselves unto them."
1 Samuel,14,9,"If they say{H559}{(H8799)} thus unto us, Tarry{H1826}{(H8798)} until we come{H5060}{(H8687)} to you; then we will stand still{H5975}{(H8804)} in our place, and will not go up{H5927}{(H8799)} unto them."
1 Samuel,14,10,"But if they say{H559}{(H8799)} thus, Come up{H5927}{(H8798)} unto us; then we will go up{H5927}{(H8804)}: for the LORD{H3068} hath delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} them into our hand{H3027}: and this shall be a sign{H226} unto us."
1 Samuel,14,11,"And both{H8147} of them discovered{H1540}{(H8735)} themselves unto the garrison{H4673} of the Philistines{H6430}: and the Philistines{H6430} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, the Hebrews{H5680} come forth{H3318}{(H8802)} out of the holes{H2356} where they had hid{H2244}{(H8694)} themselves."
1 Samuel,14,12,"And the men{H582} of the garrison{H4675} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Jonathan{H3129} and his armourbearer{H5375}{(H8802)}{H3627}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Come up{H5927}{(H8798)} to us, and we will shew{H3045}{(H8686)} you a thing{H1697}. And Jonathan{H3129} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his armourbearer{H5375}{(H8802)}{H3627}, Come up{H5927}{(H8798)} after{H310} me: for the LORD{H3068} hath delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} them into the hand{H3027} of Israel{H3478}."
1 Samuel,14,13,"And Jonathan{H3129} climbed up{H5927}{(H8799)} upon his hands{H3027} and upon his feet{H7272}, and his armourbearer{H5375}{(H8802)}{H3627} after{H310} him: and they fell{H5307}{(H8799)} before{H6440} Jonathan{H3129}; and his armourbearer{H5375}{(H8802)}{H3627} slew{H4191}{(H8789)} after{H310} him."
1 Samuel,14,14,"And that first{H7223} slaughter{H4347}, which Jonathan{H3129} and his armourbearer{H5375}{(H8802)}{H3627} made{H5221}{(H8689)}, was about twenty{H6242} men{H376}, within as it were an half{H2677} acre{H4618} of land{H7704}, which a yoke{H6776} of oxen might plow."
1 Samuel,14,15,"And there was trembling{H2731} in the host{H4264}, in the field{H7704}, and among all the people{H5971}: the garrison{H4673}, and the spoilers{H7843}{(H8688)}, they also trembled{H2729}{(H8804)}, and the earth{H776} quaked{H7264}{(H8799)}: so it was a very great{H430} trembling{H2731}."
1 Samuel,14,16,"And the watchmen{H6822}{(H8802)} of Saul{H7586} in Gibeah{H1390} of Benjamin{H1144} looked{H7200}{(H8799)}; and, behold, the multitude{H1995} melted away{H4127}{(H8738)}, and they went{H3212}{(H8799)} on beating down{H1986}{(H8800)} one another."
1 Samuel,14,17,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Saul{H7586} unto the people{H5971} that were with him, Number{H6485}{(H8798)} now, and see{H7200}{(H8798)} who is gone{H1980}{(H8804)} from us. And when they had numbered{H6485}{(H8799)}, behold, Jonathan{H3129} and his armourbearer{H5375}{(H8802)}{H3627} were not there."
1 Samuel,14,18,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Ahiah{H281}, Bring hither{H5066}{(H8685)} the ark{H727} of God{H430}. For the ark{H727} of God{H430} was at that time{H3117} with the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}."
1 Samuel,14,19,"And it came to pass, while Saul{H7586} talked{H1696}{(H8765)} unto the priest{H3548}, that the noise{H1995} that was in the host{H4264} of the Philistines{H6430} went{H3212}{(H8799)} on{H1980}{(H8800)} and increased{H7227}: and Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the priest{H3548}, Withdraw{H622}{(H8798)} thine hand{H3027}."
1 Samuel,14,20,"And Saul{H7586} and all the people{H5971} that were with him assembled{H2199}{(H8735)} themselves, and they came{H935}{(H8799)} to the battle{H4421}: and, behold, every man's{H376} sword{H2719} was against his fellow{H7453}, and there was a very{H3966} great{H1419} discomfiture{H4103}."
1 Samuel,14,21,"Moreover the Hebrews{H5680} that were with the Philistines{H6430} before{H865} that time{H8032}, which went up{H5927}{(H8804)} with them into the camp{H4264} from the country round about{H5439}, even they also turned to be with the Israelites{H3478} that were with Saul{H7586} and Jonathan{H3129}."
1 Samuel,14,22,"Likewise all the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} which had hid{H2244}{(H8693)} themselves in mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}, when they heard{H8085}{(H8804)} that the Philistines{H6430} fled{H5127}{(H8804)}, even they also followed hard{H1692}{(H8686)} after{H310} them in the battle{H4421}."
1 Samuel,14,23,So the LORD{H3068} saved{H3467}{(H8686)} Israel{H3478} that day{H3117}: and the battle{H4421} passed over{H5674}{(H8804)} unto Bethaven{H1007}.
1 Samuel,14,24,"And the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} were distressed{H5065}{(H8738)} that day{H3117}: for Saul{H7586} had adjured{H422}{(H8686)} the people{H5971}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Cursed{H779}{(H8803)} be the man{H376} that eateth{H398}{(H8799)} any food{H3899} until evening{H6153}, that I may be avenged{H5358}{(H8738)} on mine enemies{H341}{(H8802)}. So none of the people{H5971} tasted{H2938}{(H8804)} any food{H3899}."
1 Samuel,14,25,And all they of the land{H776} came{H935}{(H8804)} to a wood{H3293}; and there was honey{H1706} upon{H6440} the ground{H7704}.
1 Samuel,14,26,"And when the people{H5971} were come{H935}{(H8799)} into the wood{H3293}, behold, the honey{H1706} dropped{H1982}; but no man put{H5381}{(H8688)} his hand{H3027} to his mouth{H6310}: for the people{H5971} feared{H3372}{(H8804)} the oath{H7621}."
1 Samuel,14,27,"But Jonathan{H3129} heard{H8085}{(H8804)} not when his father{H1} charged{H7650} the people{H5971} with the oath{H7650}{(H8687)}: wherefore he put forth{H7971}{(H8799)} the end{H7097} of the rod{H4294} that was in his hand{H3027}, and dipped{H2881}{(H8799)} it in an honeycomb{H3295}{H1706}, and put{H7725}{(H8686)} his hand{H3027} to his mouth{H6310}; and his eyes{H5869} were enlightened{H215}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,14,28,"Then answered{H6030}{(H8799)} one{H376} of the people{H5971}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thy father{H1} straitly{H7650}{(H8687)} charged{H7650} the people{H5971} with an oath{H7650}{(H8689)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Cursed{H779}{(H8803)} be the man{H376} that eateth{H398}{(H8799)} any food{H3899} this day{H3117}. And the people{H5971} were faint{H5774}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,14,29,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Jonathan{H3129}, My father{H1} hath troubled{H5916}{(H8804)} the land{H776}: see{H7200}{(H8798)}, I pray you, how mine eyes{H5869} have been enlightened{H215}{(H8804)}, because I tasted{H2938}{(H8804)} a little{H4592} of this honey{H1706}."
1 Samuel,14,30,"How much more{H637}, if haply{H3863} the people{H5971} had eaten{H398}{(H8804)} freely{H398}{(H8800)} to day{H3117} of the spoil{H7998} of their enemies{H341}{(H8802)} which they found{H4672}{(H8804)}? for had there not been now a much greater{H7235}{(H8804)} slaughter{H4347} among the Philistines{H6430}?"
1 Samuel,14,31,And they smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the Philistines{H6430} that day{H3117} from Michmash{H4363} to Aijalon{H357}: and the people{H5971} were very{H3966} faint{H5774}{(H8799)}.
1 Samuel,14,32,"And the people{H5971} flew{H5860}{(H8799)}{H6213}{(H8799)} upon the spoil{H7998}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} sheep{H6629}, and oxen{H1241}, and calves{H1121}, and slew{H7819}{(H8799)} them on the ground{H776}: and the people{H5971} did eat{H398}{(H8799)} them with the blood{H1818}."
1 Samuel,14,33,"Then they told{H5046}{(H8686)} Saul{H7586}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, the people{H5971} sin{H2398}{(H8802)} against the LORD{H3068}, in that they eat{H398}{(H8800)} with the blood{H1818}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Ye have transgressed{H898}{(H8804)}: roll{H1556}{(H8798)} a great{H1419} stone{H68} unto me this day{H3117}."
1 Samuel,14,34,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Disperse{H6327}{(H8798)} yourselves among the people{H5971}, and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Bring me hither{H5066}{(H8685)} every man{H376} his ox{H7794}, and every man{H376} his sheep{H7716}, and slay{H7819}{(H8804)} them here, and eat{H398}{(H8804)}; and sin{H2398}{(H8799)} not against the LORD{H3068} in eating{H398}{(H8800)} with the blood{H1818}. And all the people{H5971} brought{H5066}{(H8686)} every man{H376} his ox{H7794} with him{H3027} that night{H3915}, and slew{H7819}{(H8799)} them there."
1 Samuel,14,35,And Saul{H7586} built{H1129}{(H8799)} an altar{H4196} unto the LORD{H3068}: the same was the first{H2490}{(H8689)} altar{H4196} that he built{H1129}{(H8800)} unto the LORD{H3068}.
1 Samuel,14,36,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let us go down{H3381}{(H8799)} after{H310} the Philistines{H6430} by night{H3915}, and spoil{H962}{(H8799)} them until the morning{H1242} light{H216}, and let us not leave{H7604}{(H8686)} a man{H376} of them. And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Do{H6213}{(H8798)} whatsoever seemeth{H5869} good{H2896} unto thee. Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the priest{H3548}, Let us draw near{H7126}{(H8799)} hither{H1988} unto God{H430}."
1 Samuel,14,37,"And Saul{H7586} asked{H7592}{(H8799)} counsel of God{H430}, Shall I go down{H3381}{(H8799)} after{H310} the Philistines{H6430}? wilt thou deliver{H5414}{(H8799)} them into the hand{H3027} of Israel{H3478}? But he answered{H6030}{(H8804)} him not that day{H3117}."
1 Samuel,14,38,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Draw ye near{H5066}{(H8798)} hither{H1988}, all the chief{H6438} of the people{H5971}: and know{H3045}{(H8798)} and see{H7200}{(H8798)} wherein{H4100} this sin{H2403} hath been this day{H3117}."
1 Samuel,14,39,"For, as the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, which saveth{H3467}{(H8688)} Israel{H3478}, though it be{H3426} in Jonathan{H3129} my son{H1121}, he shall surely{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}. But there was not a man among all the people{H5971} that answered{H6030}{(H8802)} him."
1 Samuel,14,40,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto all Israel{H3478}, Be ye on one{H259} side{H5676}, and I and Jonathan{H3129} my son{H1121} will be on the other{H259} side{H5676}. And the people{H5971} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Saul{H7586}, Do{H6213}{(H8798)} what seemeth{H5869} good{H2896} unto thee."
1 Samuel,14,41,"Therefore Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, Give{H3051}{(H8798)} a perfect{H8549} lot. And Saul{H7586} and Jonathan{H3129} were taken{H3920}{(H8735)}: but the people{H5971} escaped{H3318}{(H8804)}."
1 Samuel,14,42,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Cast{H5307}{(H8685)} lots between me and Jonathan{H3129} my son{H1121}. And Jonathan{H3129} was taken{H3920}{(H8735)}."
1 Samuel,14,43,"Then Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Jonathan{H3129}, Tell{H5046}{(H8685)} me what thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)}. And Jonathan{H3129} told{H5046}{(H8686)} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, I did but{H2938}{(H8800)} taste{H2938}{(H8804)} a little{H4592} honey{H1706} with the end{H7097} of the rod{H4294} that was in mine hand{H3027}, and, lo{H2009}, I must die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,14,44,"And Saul{H7586} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, God{H430} do so{H6213}{(H8799)} and more also{H3254}{(H8686)}: for thou shalt surely{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}, Jonathan{H3129}."
1 Samuel,14,45,"And the people{H5971} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Saul{H7586}, Shall Jonathan{H3129} die{H4191}{(H8799)}, who hath wrought{H6213}{(H8804)} this great{H1419} salvation{H3444} in Israel{H3478}? God forbid{H2486}: as the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, there shall not one hair{H8185} of his head{H7218} fall{H5307}{(H8799)} to the ground{H776}; for he hath wrought{H6213}{(H8804)} with God{H430} this day{H3117}. So the people{H5971} rescued{H6299}{(H8799)} Jonathan{H3129}, that he died{H4191}{(H8804)} not."
1 Samuel,14,46,Then Saul{H7586} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} from following{H310} the Philistines{H6430}: and the Philistines{H6430} went{H1980}{(H8804)} to their own place{H4725}.
1 Samuel,14,47,"So Saul{H7586} took{H3920}{(H8804)} the kingdom{H4410} over Israel{H3478}, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against all his enemies{H341}{(H8802)} on every side{H5439}, against Moab{H4124}, and against the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, and against Edom{H123}, and against the kings{H4428} of Zobah{H6678}, and against the Philistines{H6430}: and whithersoever he turned{H6437}{(H8799)} himself, he vexed{H7561}{(H8686)} them."
1 Samuel,14,48,"And he gathered{H6213}{(H8799)} an host{H2428}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the Amalekites{H6002}, and delivered{H5337}{(H8686)} Israel{H3478} out of the hands{H3027} of them that spoiled{H8154}{(H8802)} them."
1 Samuel,14,49,"Now the sons{H1121} of Saul{H7586} were Jonathan{H3129}, and Ishui{H3440}, and Melchishua{H4444}: and the names{H8034} of his two{H8147} daughters{H1323} were these; the name{H8034} of the firstborn{H1067} Merab{H4764}, and the name{H8034} of the younger{H6996} Michal{H4324}:"
1 Samuel,14,50,"And the name{H8034} of Saul's{H7586} wife{H802} was Ahinoam{H293}, the daughter{H1323} of Ahimaaz{H290}: and the name{H8034} of the captain{H8269} of his host{H6635} was Abner{H74}, the son{H1121} of Ner{H5369}, Saul's{H7586} uncle{H1730}."
1 Samuel,14,51,And Kish{H7027} was the father{H1} of Saul{H7586}; and Ner{H5369} the father{H1} of Abner{H74} was the son{H1121} of Abiel{H22}.
1 Samuel,14,52,"And there was sore{H2389} war{H4421} against the Philistines{H6430} all the days{H3117} of Saul{H7586}: and when Saul{H7586} saw{H7200}{(H8804)} any strong{H1368} man{H376}, or any valiant{H2428} man{H1121}, he took{H622}{(H8799)} him unto him."
1 Samuel,15,1,"Samuel{H8050} also said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Saul{H7586}, The LORD{H3068} sent{H7971}{(H8804)} me to anoint{H4886}{(H8800)} thee to be king{H4428} over his people{H5971}, over Israel{H3478}: now therefore hearken{H8085}{(H8798)} thou unto the voice{H6963} of the words{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,15,2,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, I remember{H6485}{(H8804)} that which Amalek{H6002} did{H6213}{(H8804)} to Israel{H3478}, how he laid{H7760}{(H8804)} wait for him in the way{H1870}, when he came up{H5927}{(H8800)} from Egypt{H4714}."
1 Samuel,15,3,"Now go{H3212}{(H8798)} and smite{H5221}{(H8689)} Amalek{H6002}, and utterly destroy{H2763}{(H8689)} all that they have, and spare{H2550}{(H8799)} them not; but slay{H4191}{(H8689)} both man{H376} and woman{H802}, infant{H5768} and suckling{H3243}{(H8802)}, ox{H7794} and sheep{H7716}, camel{H1581} and ass{H2543}."
1 Samuel,15,4,"And Saul{H7586} gathered{H8085} the people{H5971} together{H8085}{(H8762)}, and numbered{H6485}{(H8799)} them in Telaim{H2923}, two hundred{H3967} thousand{H505} footmen{H7273}, and ten{H6235} thousand{H505} men{H376} of Judah{H3063}."
1 Samuel,15,5,"And Saul{H7586} came{H935}{(H8799)} to a city{H5892} of Amalek{H6002}, and laid wait{H7378}{(H8799)}{H693}{(H8686)} in the valley{H5158}."
1 Samuel,15,6,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the Kenites{H7017}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, depart{H5493}{(H8798)}, get you down{H3381}{(H8798)} from among{H8432} the Amalekites{H6002}, lest I destroy{H622}{(H8799)} you with them: for ye shewed{H6213}{(H8804)} kindness{H2617} to all the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, when they came up{H5927}{(H8800)} out of Egypt{H4714}. So the Kenites{H7017} departed{H5493}{(H8799)} from among{H8432} the Amalekites{H6003}."
1 Samuel,15,7,"And Saul{H7586} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the Amalekites{H6002} from Havilah{H2341} until thou comest{H935}{(H8800)} to Shur{H7793}, that is over against{H6440} Egypt{H4714}."
1 Samuel,15,8,"And he took{H8610}{(H8799)} Agag{H90} the king{H4428} of the Amalekites{H6002} alive{H2416}, and utterly destroyed{H2763}{(H8689)} all the people{H5971} with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}."
1 Samuel,15,9,"But Saul{H7586} and the people{H5971} spared{H2550}{(H8799)} Agag{H90}, and the best{H4315} of the sheep{H6629}, and of the oxen{H1241}, and of the fatlings{H4932}, and the lambs{H3733}, and all that was good{H2896}, and would{H14}{(H8804)} not utterly destroy{H2763}{(H8687)} them: but every thing{H4399} that was vile{H5240} and refuse{H4549}{(H8738)}, that they destroyed utterly{H2763}{(H8689)}."
1 Samuel,15,10,"Then came the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} unto Samuel{H8050}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
1 Samuel,15,11,"It repenteth{H5162}{(H8738)} me that I have set up{H4427}{(H8689)} Saul{H7586} to be king{H4428}: for he is turned back{H7725}{(H8804)} from following{H310} me, and hath not performed{H6965}{(H8689)} my commandments{H1697}. And it grieved{H2734}{(H8799)} Samuel{H8050}; and he cried{H2199}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068} all night{H3915}."
1 Samuel,15,12,"And when Samuel{H8050} rose early{H7925}{(H8686)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} Saul{H7586} in the morning{H1242}, it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} Samuel{H8050}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Saul{H7586} came{H935}{(H8804)} to Carmel{H3760}, and, behold, he set him up{H5324}{(H8688)} a place{H3027}, and is gone about{H5437}{(H8735)}, and passed on{H5674}{(H8799)}, and gone down{H3381}{(H8799)} to Gilgal{H1537}."
1 Samuel,15,13,"And Samuel{H8050} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Saul{H7586}: and Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be thou of the LORD{H3068}: I have performed{H6965}{(H8689)} the commandment{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,15,14,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)}, What meaneth then this bleating{H6963} of the sheep{H6629} in mine ears{H241}, and the lowing{H6963} of the oxen{H1241} which I hear{H8085}{(H8802)}?"
1 Samuel,15,15,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)}, They have brought{H935}{(H8689)} them from the Amalekites{H6003}: for the people{H5971} spared{H2550}{(H8804)} the best{H4315} of the sheep{H6629} and of the oxen{H1241}, to sacrifice{H2076}{(H8800)} unto the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}; and the rest{H3498}{(H8802)} we have utterly destroyed{H2763}{(H8689)}."
1 Samuel,15,16,"Then Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Saul{H7586}, Stay{H7503}{(H8685)}, and I will tell{H5046}{(H8686)} thee what the LORD{H3068} hath said{H1696}{(H8765)} to me this night{H3915}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Say on{H1696}{(H8761)}."
1 Samuel,15,17,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)}, When thou wast little{H6996} in thine own sight{H5869}, wast thou not made the head{H7218} of the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}, and the LORD{H3068} anointed{H4886}{(H8799)} thee king{H4428} over Israel{H3478}?"
1 Samuel,15,18,"And the LORD{H3068} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} thee on a journey{H1870}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} and utterly destroy{H2763}{(H8689)} the sinners{H2400} the Amalekites{H6002}, and fight{H3898}{(H8738)} against them until they be consumed{H3615}{(H8763)}."
1 Samuel,15,19,"Wherefore then didst thou not obey{H8085}{(H8804)} the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068}, but didst fly{H5860}{(H8799)} upon the spoil{H7998}, and didst{H6213}{(H8799)} evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}?"
1 Samuel,15,20,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Samuel{H8050}, Yea, I have obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068}, and have gone{H3212}{(H8799)} the way{H1870} which the LORD{H3068} sent{H7971}{(H8804)} me, and have brought{H935}{(H8686)} Agag{H90} the king{H4428} of Amalek{H6002}, and have utterly destroyed{H2763}{(H8689)} the Amalekites{H6002}."
1 Samuel,15,21,"But the people{H5971} took{H3947}{(H8799)} of the spoil{H7998}, sheep{H6629} and oxen{H1241}, the chief{H7225} of the things which should have been utterly destroyed{H2764}, to sacrifice{H2076}{(H8800)} unto the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} in Gilgal{H1537}."
1 Samuel,15,22,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Hath the LORD{H3068} as great delight{H2656} in burnt offerings{H5930} and sacrifices{H2077}, as in obeying{H8085}{(H8800)} the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068}? Behold, to obey{H8085}{(H8800)} is better{H2896} than sacrifice{H2077}, and to hearken{H7181}{(H8687)} than the fat{H2459} of rams{H352}."
1 Samuel,15,23,"For rebellion{H4805} is as the sin{H2403} of witchcraft{H7081}, and stubbornness{H6484}{(H8687)} is as iniquity{H205} and idolatry{H8655}. Because thou hast rejected{H3988}{(H8804)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, he hath also rejected{H3988}{(H8799)} thee from being king{H4428}."
1 Samuel,15,24,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Samuel{H8050}, I have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}: for I have transgressed{H5674}{(H8804)} the commandment{H6310} of the LORD{H3068}, and thy words{H1697}: because I feared{H3372}{(H8804)} the people{H5971}, and obeyed{H8085}{(H8799)} their voice{H6963}."
1 Samuel,15,25,"Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon{H5375}{(H8798)} my sin{H2403}, and turn again{H7725}{(H8798)} with me, that I may worship{H7812}{(H8691)} the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,15,26,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Saul{H7586}, I will not return{H7725}{(H8799)} with thee: for thou hast rejected{H3988}{(H8804)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, and the LORD{H3068} hath rejected{H3988}{(H8799)} thee from being king{H4428} over Israel{H3478}."
1 Samuel,15,27,"And as Samuel{H8050} turned about{H5437}{(H8735)} to go away{H3212}{(H8800)}, he laid hold{H2388}{(H8686)} upon the skirt{H3671} of his mantle{H4598}, and it rent{H7167}{(H8735)}."
1 Samuel,15,28,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, The LORD{H3068} hath rent{H7167}{(H8804)} the kingdom{H4468} of Israel{H3478} from thee this day{H3117}, and hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} it to a neighbour{H7453} of thine, that is better{H2896} than thou."
1 Samuel,15,29,"And also the Strength{H5331} of Israel{H3478} will not lie{H8266}{(H8762)} nor repent{H5162}{(H8735)}: for he is not a man{H120}, that he should repent{H5162}{(H8736)}."
1 Samuel,15,30,"Then he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}: yet honour{H3513}{(H8761)} me now, I pray thee, before the elders{H2205} of my people{H5971}, and before Israel{H3478}, and turn again{H7725}{(H8798)} with me, that I may worship{H7812}{(H8694)} the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}."
1 Samuel,15,31,So Samuel{H8050} turned again{H7725}{(H8799)} after{H310} Saul{H7586}; and Saul{H7586} worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)} the LORD{H3068}.
1 Samuel,15,32,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Samuel{H8050}, Bring ye hither{H5066}{(H8685)} to me Agag{H90} the king{H4428} of the Amalekites{H6002}. And Agag{H90} came{H3212}{(H8799)} unto him delicately{H4574}. And Agag{H90} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Surely{H403} the bitterness{H4751} of death{H4194} is past{H5493}{(H8804)}."
1 Samuel,15,33,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)}, As thy sword{H2719} hath made women{H802} childless{H7921}{(H8765)}, so shall thy mother{H517} be childless{H7921}{(H8799)} among women{H802}. And Samuel{H8050} hewed{H8158} Agag{H90} in pieces{H8158}{(H8762)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} in Gilgal{H1537}."
1 Samuel,15,34,Then Samuel{H8050} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Ramah{H7414}; and Saul{H7586} went up{H5927}{(H8804)} to his house{H1004} to Gibeah{H1390} of Saul{H7586}.
1 Samuel,15,35,And Samuel{H8050} came no more{H3254}{(H8804)} to see{H7200}{(H8800)} Saul{H7586} until the day{H3117} of his death{H4194}: nevertheless{H3588} Samuel{H8050} mourned{H56}{(H8694)} for Saul{H7586}: and the LORD{H3068} repented{H5162}{(H8738)} that he had made Saul{H7586} king{H4427}{(H8689)} over Israel{H3478}.
1 Samuel,16,1,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Samuel{H8050}, How long wilt thou mourn{H56}{(H8693)} for Saul{H7586}, seeing I have rejected{H3988}{(H8804)} him from reigning{H4427}{(H8800)} over Israel{H3478}? fill{H4390}{(H8761)} thine horn{H7161} with oil{H8081}, and go{H3212}{(H8798)}, I will send{H7971}{(H8799)} thee to Jesse{H3448} the Bethlehemite{H1022}: for I have provided{H7200}{(H8804)} me a king{H4428} among his sons{H1121}."
1 Samuel,16,2,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)}, How can I go{H3212}{(H8799)}? if Saul{H7586} hear{H8085}{(H8804)} it, he will kill{H2026}{(H8804)} me. And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Take{H3947}{(H8799)} an heifer{H1241}{H5697} with thee{H3027}, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, I am come{H935}{(H8804)} to sacrifice{H2076}{(H8800)} to the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,16,3,"And call{H7121}{(H8804)} Jesse{H3448} to the sacrifice{H2077}, and I will shew{H3045}{(H8686)} thee what thou shalt do{H6213}{(H8799)}: and thou shalt anoint{H4886}{(H8804)} unto me him whom I name{H559}{(H8799)} unto thee."
1 Samuel,16,4,"And Samuel{H8050} did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which the LORD{H3068} spake{H1696}{(H8765)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Bethlehem{H1035}. And the elders{H2205} of the town{H5892} trembled{H2729}{(H8799)} at his coming{H7125}{(H8800)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Comest{H935}{(H8800)} thou peaceably{H7965}?"
1 Samuel,16,5,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Peaceably{H7965}: I am come{H935}{(H8804)} to sacrifice{H2076}{(H8800)} unto the LORD{H3068}: sanctify{H6942}{(H8690)} yourselves, and come{H935}{(H8804)} with me to the sacrifice{H2077}. And he sanctified{H6942}{(H8762)} Jesse{H3448} and his sons{H1121}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} them to the sacrifice{H2077}."
1 Samuel,16,6,"And it came to pass, when they were come{H935}{(H8800)}, that he looked{H7200}{(H8799)} on Eliab{H446}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Surely the LORD'S{H3068} anointed{H4899} is before him."
1 Samuel,16,7,"But the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Samuel{H8050}, Look{H5027}{(H8686)} not on his countenance{H4758}, or on the height{H1364} of his stature{H6967}; because I have refused{H3988}{(H8804)} him: for the LORD seeth not as man{H120} seeth{H7200}{(H8799)}; for man{H120} looketh{H7200}{(H8799)} on the outward appearance{H5869}, but the LORD{H3068} looketh{H7200}{(H8799)} on the heart{H3824}."
1 Samuel,16,8,"Then Jesse{H3448} called{H7121}{(H8799)} Abinadab{H41}, and made him pass{H5674}{(H8686)} before{H6440} Samuel{H8050}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Neither hath the LORD{H3068} chosen{H977}{(H8804)} this."
1 Samuel,16,9,"Then Jesse{H3448} made Shammah{H8048} to pass by{H5674}{(H8686)}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Neither hath the LORD{H3068} chosen{H977}{(H8804)} this."
1 Samuel,16,10,"Again, Jesse{H3448} made seven{H7651} of his sons{H1121} to pass{H5674}{(H8686)} before{H6440} Samuel{H8050}. And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jesse{H3448}, The LORD{H3068} hath not chosen{H977}{(H8804)} these."
1 Samuel,16,11,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jesse{H3448}, Are here all{H8552}{(H8804)} thy children{H5288}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, There remaineth{H7604}{(H8804)} yet the youngest{H6996}, and, behold, he keepeth{H7462}{(H8802)} the sheep{H6629}. And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jesse{H3448}, Send{H7971}{(H8798)} and fetch{H3947}{(H8798)} him: for we will not sit down{H5437}{(H8799)} till he come{H935}{(H8800)} hither{H6311}."
1 Samuel,16,12,"And he sent{H7971}{(H8799)}, and brought him in{H935}{(H8686)}. Now he was ruddy{H132}, and withal{H5973} of a beautiful{H3303} countenance{H5869}, and goodly{H2896} to look to{H7210}. And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, anoint{H4886}{(H8798)} him: for this is he."
1 Samuel,16,13,"Then Samuel{H8050} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the horn{H7161} of oil{H8081}, and anointed{H4886}{(H8799)} him in the midst{H7130} of his brethren{H251}: and the Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} came{H6743}{(H8799)} upon David{H1732} from that day{H3117} forward{H4605}. So Samuel{H8050} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Ramah{H7414}."
1 Samuel,16,14,"But the Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} departed{H5493}{(H8804)} from Saul{H7586}, and an evil{H7451} spirit{H7307} from the LORD{H3068} troubled{H1204}{(H8765)} him."
1 Samuel,16,15,"And Saul's{H7586} servants{H5650} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Behold now, an evil{H7451} spirit{H7307} from God{H430} troubleth{H1204}{(H8764)} thee."
1 Samuel,16,16,"Let our lord{H113} now command{H559}{(H8799)} thy servants{H5650}, which are before{H6440} thee, to seek out{H1245}{(H8762)} a man{H376}, who is a cunning{H3045}{(H8802)} player{H5059}{(H8764)} on an harp{H3658}: and it shall come to pass, when the evil{H7451} spirit{H7307} from God{H430} is upon thee, that he shall play{H5059}{(H8765)} with his hand{H3027}, and thou shalt be well{H2895}{(H8804)}."
1 Samuel,16,17,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his servants{H5650}, Provide{H7200}{(H8798)} me now a man{H376} that can play{H5059}{(H8763)} well{H3190}{(H8688)}, and bring{H935}{(H8689)} him to me."
1 Samuel,16,18,"Then answered{H6030}{(H8799)} one{H259} of the servants{H5288}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} a son{H1121} of Jesse{H3448} the Bethlehemite{H1022}, that is cunning{H3045}{(H8802)} in playing{H5059}{(H8763)}, and a mighty{H1368} valiant man{H2428}, and a man{H376} of war{H4421}, and prudent{H995}{(H8737)} in matters{H1697}, and a comely{H8389} person{H376}, and the LORD{H3068} is with him."
1 Samuel,16,19,"Wherefore Saul{H7586} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} unto Jesse{H3448}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Send{H7971}{(H8798)} me David{H1732} thy son{H1121}, which is with the sheep{H6629}."
1 Samuel,16,20,"And Jesse{H3448} took{H3947}{(H8799)} an ass{H2543} laden with bread{H3899}, and a bottle{H4997} of wine{H3196}, and a{H259} kid{H1423}{H5795}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} them by{H3027} David{H1732} his son{H1121} unto Saul{H7586}."
1 Samuel,16,21,"And David{H1732} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Saul{H7586}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him: and he loved{H157}{(H8799)} him greatly{H3966}; and he became his armourbearer{H5375}{(H8802)}{H3627}."
1 Samuel,16,22,"And Saul{H7586} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Jesse{H3448}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Let David{H1732}, I pray thee, stand{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} me; for he hath found{H4672}{(H8804)} favour{H2580} in my sight{H5869}."
1 Samuel,16,23,"And it came to pass, when the evil spirit{H7307} from God{H430} was upon Saul{H7586}, that David{H1732} took{H3947}{(H8804)} an harp{H3658}, and played{H5059}{(H8765)} with his hand{H3027}: so Saul{H7586} was refreshed{H7304}{(H8804)}, and was well{H2895}{(H8804)}, and the evil{H7451} spirit{H7307} departed{H5493}{(H8804)} from him."
1 Samuel,17,1,"Now the Philistines{H6430} gathered together{H622}{(H8799)} their armies{H4264} to battle{H4421}, and were gathered together{H622}{(H8735)} at Shochoh{H7755}, which belongeth to Judah{H3063}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} between Shochoh{H7755} and Azekah{H5825}, in Ephesdammim{H658}."
1 Samuel,17,2,"And Saul{H7586} and the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} were gathered together{H622}{(H8738)}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} by the valley{H6010} of Elah{H425}, and set the battle{H4421} in array{H6186}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} the Philistines{H6430}."
1 Samuel,17,3,"And the Philistines{H6430} stood{H5975}{(H8802)} on a mountain{H2022} on the one side, and Israel{H3478} stood{H5975}{(H8802)} on a mountain{H2022} on the other side: and there was a valley{H1516} between them."
1 Samuel,17,4,"And there went out{H3318}{(H8799)} a champion{H376}{H1143} out of the camp{H4264} of the Philistines{H6430}, named{H8034} Goliath{H1555}, of Gath{H1661}, whose height{H1363} was six{H8337} cubits{H520} and a span{H2239}."
1 Samuel,17,5,"And he had an helmet{H3553} of brass{H5178} upon his head{H7218}, and he was armed{H3847}{(H8803)} with a coat{H8302} of mail{H7193}; and the weight{H4948} of the coat{H8302} was five{H2568} thousand{H505} shekels{H8255} of brass{H5178}."
1 Samuel,17,6,"And he had greaves{H4697} of brass{H5178} upon his legs{H7272}, and a target{H3591} of brass{H5178} between his shoulders{H3802}."
1 Samuel,17,7,And the staff{H6086}{(H8675)}{H2671} of his spear{H2595} was like a weaver's{H707}{(H8802)} beam{H4500}; and his spear's{H2595} head{H3852} weighed six{H8337} hundred{H3967} shekels{H8255} of iron{H1270}: and one bearing{H5375}{(H8802)} a shield{H6793} went{H1980}{(H8802)} before{H6440} him.
1 Samuel,17,8,"And he stood{H5975}{(H8799)} and cried{H7121}{(H8799)} unto the armies{H4634} of Israel{H3478}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Why are ye come out{H3318}{(H8799)} to set your battle{H4421} in array{H6186}{(H8800)}? am not I a Philistine{H6430}, and ye servants{H5650} to Saul{H7586}? choose{H1262}{(H8798)} you a man{H376} for you, and let him come down{H3381}{(H8799)} to me."
1 Samuel,17,9,"If he be able{H3201}{(H8799)} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} with me, and to kill{H5221}{(H8689)} me, then will we be your servants{H5650}: but if I prevail{H3201}{(H8799)} against him, and kill{H5221}{(H8689)} him, then shall ye be our servants{H5650}, and serve{H5647}{(H8804)} us."
1 Samuel,17,10,"And the Philistine{H6430} said{H559}{(H8799)}, I defy{H2778}{(H8765)} the armies{H4634} of Israel{H3478} this day{H3117}; give{H5414}{(H8798)} me a man{H376}, that we may fight{H3898}{(H8735)} together{H3162}."
1 Samuel,17,11,"When Saul{H7586} and all Israel{H3478} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} those words{H1697} of the Philistine{H6430}, they were dismayed{H2865}{(H8735)}, and greatly{H3966} afraid{H3372}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,17,12,"Now David{H1732} was the son{H1121} of that Ephrathite{H376}{H673} of Bethlehemjudah{H1035}{H3063}, whose name{H8034} was Jesse{H3448}; and he had eight{H8083} sons{H1121}: and the man{H376} went{H935}{(H8804)} among men{H582} for an old man{H2204}{(H8804)} in the days{H3117} of Saul{H7586}."
1 Samuel,17,13,"And the three{H7969} eldest{H1419} sons{H1121} of Jesse{H3448} went{H3212}{(H8799)} and followed{H310} Saul{H7586} to the battle{H4421}: and the names{H8034} of his three{H7969} sons{H1121} that went{H1980}{(H8804)} to the battle{H4421} were Eliab{H446} the firstborn{H1060}, and next{H4932} unto him Abinadab{H41}, and the third{H7992} Shammah{H8048}."
1 Samuel,17,14,And David{H1732} was the youngest{H6996}: and the three{H7969} eldest{H1419} followed{H1980}{(H8804)}{H310} Saul{H7586}.
1 Samuel,17,15,But David{H1732} went{H1980}{(H8802)} and returned{H7725}{(H8802)} from Saul{H7586} to feed{H7462}{(H8800)} his father's{H1} sheep{H6629} at Bethlehem{H1035}.
1 Samuel,17,16,"And the Philistine{H6430} drew near{H5066}{(H8799)} morning{H7925}{(H8687)} and evening{H6150}{(H8687)}, and presented{H3320}{(H8691)} himself forty{H705} days{H3117}."
1 Samuel,17,17,"And Jesse{H3448} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732} his son{H1121}, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} now for thy brethren{H251} an ephah{H374} of this{H2088} parched{H7039} corn, and these ten{H6235} loaves{H3899}, and run{H7323}{(H8685)} to the camp{H4264} to thy brethren{H251};"
1 Samuel,17,18,"And carry{H935}{(H8686)} these ten{H6235} cheeses{H2461}{H2757} unto the captain{H8269} of their thousand{H505}, and look{H6485}{(H8799)} how thy brethren{H251} fare{H7965}, and take{H3947}{(H8799)} their pledge{H6161}."
1 Samuel,17,19,"Now Saul{H7586}, and they, and all the men{H376} of Israel{H3478}, were in the valley{H6010} of Elah{H425}, fighting{H3898}{(H8737)} with the Philistines{H6430}."
1 Samuel,17,20,"And David{H1732} rose up early{H7925}{(H8686)} in the morning{H1242}, and left{H5203}{(H8799)} the sheep{H6629} with a keeper{H8104}{(H8802)}, and took{H5375}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)}, as Jesse{H3448} had commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} him; and he came{H935}{(H8799)} to the trench{H4570}, as the host{H2428} was going forth{H3318}{(H8802)} to the fight{H4634}, and shouted{H7321}{(H8689)} for the battle{H4421}."
1 Samuel,17,21,"For Israel{H3478} and the Philistines{H6430} had put the battle in array{H6186}{(H8799)}, army{H4634} against{H7125}{(H8800)} army{H4634}."
1 Samuel,17,22,"And David{H1732} left{H5203}{(H8799)} his carriage{H3627} in the hand{H3027} of the keeper{H8104}{(H8802)} of the carriage{H3627}, and ran{H7323}{(H8799)} into the army{H4634}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} and saluted{H7592}{(H8799)}{H7965} his brethren{H251}."
1 Samuel,17,23,"And as he talked{H1696}{(H8764)} with them, behold, there came up{H5927}{(H8802)} the champion{H376}{H1143}, the Philistine{H6430} of Gath{H1661}, Goliath{H1555} by name{H8034}, out of the armies{H4634}{(H8675)}{H4630} of the Philistines{H6430}, and spake{H1696}{(H8762)} according to the same{H428} words{H1697}: and David{H1732} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} them."
1 Samuel,17,24,"And all the men{H376} of Israel{H3478}, when they saw{H7200}{(H8800)} the man{H376}, fled{H5127}{(H8799)} from him{H6440}, and were sore{H3966} afraid{H3372}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,17,25,"And the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Have ye seen{H7200}{(H8804)} this man{H376} that is come up{H5927}{(H8802)}? surely to defy{H2778}{(H8763)} Israel{H3478} is he come up{H5927}{(H8802)}: and it shall be, that the man{H376} who killeth{H5221}{(H8686)} him, the king{H4428} will enrich{H6238}{(H8686)} him with great{H1419} riches{H6239}, and will give{H5414}{(H8799)} him his daughter{H1323}, and make{H6213}{(H8799)} his father's{H1} house{H1004} free{H2670} in Israel{H3478}."
1 Samuel,17,26,"And David{H1732} spake{H559}{(H8799)} to the men{H582} that stood{H5975}{(H8802)} by him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, What shall be done{H6213}{(H8735)} to the man{H376} that killeth{H5221}{(H8686)} this{H1975} Philistine{H6430}, and taketh away{H5493}{(H8689)} the reproach{H2781} from Israel{H3478}? for who is this uncircumcised{H6189} Philistine{H6430}, that he should defy{H2778}{(H8765)} the armies{H4634} of the living{H2416} God{H430}?"
1 Samuel,17,27,"And the people{H5971} answered{H559}{(H8799)} him after this manner{H1697}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, So shall it be done{H6213}{(H8735)} to the man{H376} that killeth{H5221}{(H8686)} him."
1 Samuel,17,28,"And Eliab{H446} his eldest{H1419} brother{H251} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} when he spake{H1696}{(H8763)} unto the men{H582}; and Eliab's{H446} anger{H639} was kindled{H2734}{(H8799)} against David{H1732}, and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Why camest thou down{H3381}{(H8804)} hither? and with whom hast thou left{H5203}{(H8804)} those{H2007} few{H4592} sheep{H6629} in the wilderness{H4057}? I know{H3045}{(H8804)} thy pride{H2087}, and the naughtiness{H7455} of thine heart{H3824}; for thou art come down{H3381}{(H8804)} that thou mightest see{H7200}{(H8800)} the battle{H4421}."
1 Samuel,17,29,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)}, What have I now done{H6213}{(H8804)}? Is there not a cause{H1697}?"
1 Samuel,17,30,"And he turned{H5437}{(H8735)} from him{H681} toward{H4136} another{H312}, and spake{H559}{(H8799)} after the same manner{H1697}: and the people{H5971} answered{H1697} him again{H7725}{(H8686)} after the former{H7223} manner{H1697}."
1 Samuel,17,31,"And when the words{H1697} were heard{H8085}{(H8735)} which David{H1732} spake{H1696}{(H8765)}, they rehearsed{H5046}{(H8686)} them before{H6440} Saul{H7586}: and he sent{H3947}{(H8799)} for him."
1 Samuel,17,32,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Saul{H7586}, Let no man's{H120} heart{H3820} fail{H5307}{(H8799)} because of him; thy servant{H5650} will go{H3212}{(H8799)} and fight{H3898}{(H8738)} with this Philistine{H6430}."
1 Samuel,17,33,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} to David{H1732}, Thou art not able{H3201}{(H8799)} to go{H3212}{(H8800)} against this Philistine{H6430} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} with him: for thou art but a youth{H5288}, and he a man{H376} of war{H4421} from his youth{H5271}."
1 Samuel,17,34,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Saul{H7586}, Thy servant{H5650} kept{H7462}{(H8802)} his father's{H1} sheep{H6629}, and there came{H935}{(H8804)} a lion{H738}, and a bear{H1677}, and took{H5375}{(H8804)} a lamb{H7716}{(H8675)}{H2089} out of the flock{H5739}:"
1 Samuel,17,35,"And I went out{H3318}{(H8804)} after{H310} him, and smote{H5221}{(H8689)} him, and delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} it out of his mouth{H6310}: and when he arose{H6965}{(H8799)} against me, I caught{H2388}{(H8689)} him by his beard{H2206}, and smote{H5221}{(H8689)} him, and slew{H4191}{(H8689)} him."
1 Samuel,17,36,"Thy servant{H5650} slew{H5221}{(H8689)} both the lion{H738} and the bear{H1677}: and this uncircumcised{H6189} Philistine{H6430} shall be as one{H259} of them, seeing he hath defied{H2778}{(H8765)} the armies{H4634} of the living{H2416} God{H430}."
1 Samuel,17,37,"David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} moreover, The LORD{H3068} that delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} me out of the paw{H3027} of the lion{H738}, and out of the paw{H3027} of the bear{H1677}, he will deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} me out of the hand{H3027} of this Philistine{H6430}. And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, and the LORD{H3068} be with thee."
1 Samuel,17,38,"And Saul{H7586} armed{H3847}{(H8686)} David{H1732} with his armour{H4055}, and he put{H5414}{(H8804)} an helmet{H6959} of brass{H5178} upon his head{H7218}; also he armed{H3847}{(H8686)} him with a coat of mail{H8302}."
1 Samuel,17,39,"And David{H1732} girded{H2296}{(H8799)} his sword{H2719} upon his armour{H4055}, and he assayed{H2974}{(H8686)} to go{H3212}{(H8800)}; for he had not proved{H5254}{(H8765)} it. And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Saul{H7586}, I cannot{H3201}{(H8799)} go{H3212}{(H8800)} with these; for I have not proved{H5254}{(H8765)} them. And David{H1732} put{H5493}{(H8686)} them off him."
1 Samuel,17,40,"And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} his staff{H4731} in his hand{H3027}, and chose{H977}{(H8799)} him five{H2568} smooth{H2512} stones{H68} out of the brook{H5158}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} them in a shepherd's{H7462}{(H8802)} bag{H3627} which he had, even in a scrip{H3219}; and his sling{H7050} was in his hand{H3027}: and he drew near{H5066}{(H8799)} to the Philistine{H6430}."
1 Samuel,17,41,And the Philistine{H6430} came{H3212}{(H8799)} on{H1980}{(H8802)} and drew near{H7131} unto David{H1732}; and the man{H376} that bare{H5375}{(H8802)} the shield{H6793} went before{H6440} him.
1 Samuel,17,42,"And when the Philistine{H6430} looked about{H5027}{(H8686)}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} David{H1732}, he disdained{H959}{(H8799)} him: for he was but a youth{H5288}, and ruddy{H132}, and of a fair{H3303} countenance{H4758}."
1 Samuel,17,43,"And the Philistine{H6430} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, Am I a dog{H3611}, that thou comest{H935}{(H8802)} to me with staves{H4731}? And the Philistine{H6430} cursed{H7043}{(H8762)} David{H1732} by his gods{H430}."
1 Samuel,17,44,"And the Philistine{H6430} said{H559}{(H8799)} to David{H1732}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)} to me, and I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} thy flesh{H1320} unto the fowls{H5775} of the air{H8064}, and to the beasts{H929} of the field{H7704}."
1 Samuel,17,45,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} David{H1732} to the Philistine{H6430}, Thou comest{H935}{(H8802)} to me with a sword{H2719}, and with a spear{H2595}, and with a shield{H3591}: but I come{H935}{(H8802)} to thee in the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of the armies{H4634} of Israel{H3478}, whom thou hast defied{H2778}{(H8765)}."
1 Samuel,17,46,"This day{H3117} will the LORD{H3068} deliver{H5462}{(H8762)} thee into mine hand{H3027}; and I will smite{H5221}{(H8689)} thee, and take{H5493}{(H8689)} thine head{H7218} from thee; and I will give{H5414}{(H8804)} the carcases{H6297} of the host{H4264} of the Philistines{H6430} this day{H3117} unto the fowls{H5775} of the air{H8064}, and to the wild beasts{H2416} of the earth{H776}; that all the earth{H776} may know{H3045}{(H8799)} that there is{H3426} a God{H430} in Israel{H3478}."
1 Samuel,17,47,"And all this assembly{H6951} shall know{H3045}{(H8799)} that the LORD{H3068} saveth{H3467}{(H8686)} not with sword{H2719} and spear{H2595}: for the battle{H4421} is the LORD'S{H3068}, and he will give{H5414}{(H8804)} you into our hands{H3027}."
1 Samuel,17,48,"And it came to pass, when the Philistine{H6430} arose{H6965}{(H8804)}, and came{H3212}{(H8799)} and drew nigh{H7126}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} David{H1732}, that David{H1732} hasted{H4116}{(H8762)}, and ran{H7323}{(H8799)} toward the army{H4634} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} the Philistine{H6430}."
1 Samuel,17,49,"And David{H1732} put{H7971}{(H8799)} his hand{H3027} in his bag{H3627}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} thence a stone{H68}, and slang{H7049}{(H8762)} it, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the Philistine{H6430} in his forehead{H4696}, that the stone{H68} sunk{H2883}{(H8799)} into his forehead{H4696}; and he fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon his face{H6440} to the earth{H776}."
1 Samuel,17,50,"So David{H1732} prevailed{H2388}{(H8799)} over{H4480} the Philistine{H6430} with a sling{H7050} and with a stone{H68}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the Philistine{H6430}, and slew{H4191}{(H8686)} him; but there was no sword{H2719} in the hand{H3027} of David{H1732}."
1 Samuel,17,51,"Therefore David{H1732} ran{H7323}{(H8799)}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} upon the Philistine{H6430}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} his sword{H2719}, and drew{H8025}{(H8799)} it out of the sheath{H8593} thereof, and slew{H4191}{(H8787)} him, and cut off{H3772}{(H8799)} his head{H7218} therewith. And when the Philistines{H6430} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} their champion{H1368} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, they fled{H5127}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,17,52,"And the men{H582} of Israel{H3478} and of Judah{H3063} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and shouted{H7321}{(H8686)}, and pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} the Philistines{H6430}, until thou come{H935}{(H8800)} to the valley{H1516}, and to the gates{H8179} of Ekron{H6138}. And the wounded{H2491} of the Philistines{H6430} fell down{H5307}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870} to Shaaraim{H8189}, even unto Gath{H1661}, and unto Ekron{H6138}."
1 Samuel,17,53,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} from chasing{H1814}{(H8800)} after{H310} the Philistines{H6430}, and they spoiled{H8155}{(H8799)} their tents{H4264}."
1 Samuel,17,54,"And David{H1732} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the head{H7218} of the Philistine{H6430}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} it to Jerusalem{H3389}; but he put{H7760}{(H8804)} his armour{H3627} in his tent{H168}."
1 Samuel,17,55,"And when Saul{H7586} saw{H7200}{(H8800)} David{H1732} go forth{H3318}{(H8802)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} the Philistine{H6430}, he said{H559}{(H8804)} unto Abner{H74}, the captain{H8269} of the host{H6635}, Abner{H74}, whose son{H1121} is this youth{H5288}? And Abner{H74} said{H559}{(H8799)}, As thy soul{H5315} liveth{H2416}, O king{H4428}, I cannot{H518} tell{H3045}{(H8804)}."
1 Samuel,17,56,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Enquire{H7592}{(H8798)} thou whose son{H1121} the stripling{H5958} is."
1 Samuel,17,57,"And as David{H1732} returned{H7725}{(H8800)} from the slaughter{H5221}{(H8687)} of the Philistine{H6430}, Abner{H74} took{H3947}{(H8799)} him, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} him before{H6440} Saul{H7586} with the head{H7218} of the Philistine{H6430} in his hand{H3027}."
1 Samuel,17,58,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} to him, Whose son{H1121} art thou, thou young man{H5288}? And David{H1732} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, I am the son{H1121} of thy servant{H5650} Jesse{H3448} the Bethlehemite{H1022}."
1 Samuel,18,1,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end{H3615}{(H8763)} of speaking{H1696}{(H8763)} unto Saul{H7586}, that the soul{H5315} of Jonathan{H3083} was knit{H7194}{(H8738)} with the soul{H5315} of David{H1732}, and Jonathan{H3083} loved{H157}{(H8799)} him as his own soul{H5315}."
1 Samuel,18,2,"And Saul{H7586} took{H3947}{(H8799)} him that day{H3117}, and would let{H5414}{(H8804)} him go no more home{H7725}{(H8800)} to his father's{H1} house{H1004}."
1 Samuel,18,3,"Then Jonathan{H3083} and David{H1732} made{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285}, because he loved{H160} him as his own soul{H5315}."
1 Samuel,18,4,"And Jonathan{H3083} stripped{H6584}{(H8691)} himself of the robe{H4598} that was upon him, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} it to David{H1732}, and his garments{H4055}, even to his sword{H2719}, and to his bow{H7198}, and to his girdle{H2289}."
1 Samuel,18,5,"And David{H1732} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} whithersoever Saul{H7586} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} him, and behaved himself wisely{H7919}{(H8686)}: and Saul{H7586} set{H7760}{(H8799)} him over the men{H582} of war{H4421}, and he was accepted{H3190}{(H8799)} in the sight{H5869} of all the people{H5971}, and also in the sight{H5869} of Saul's{H7586} servants{H5650}."
1 Samuel,18,6,"And it came to pass as they came{H935}{(H8800)}, when David{H1732} was returned{H7725}{(H8800)} from the slaughter{H5221}{(H8687)} of the Philistine{H6430}, that the women{H802} came out{H3318}{(H8799)} of all cities{H5892} of Israel{H3478}, singing{H7891}{(H8800)} and dancing{H4246}, to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} king{H4428} Saul{H7586}, with tabrets{H8596}, with joy{H8057}, and with instruments of musick{H7991}."
1 Samuel,18,7,"And the women{H802} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} one another as they played{H7832}{(H8764)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Saul{H7586} hath slain{H5221}{(H8689)} his thousands{H505}, and David{H1732} his ten thousands{H7233}."
1 Samuel,18,8,"And Saul{H7586} was very{H3966} wroth{H2734}{(H8799)}, and the saying{H1697} displeased{H3415}{(H8799)}{H5869} him; and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, They have ascribed{H5414}{(H8804)} unto David{H1732} ten thousands{H7233}, and to me they have ascribed{H5414}{(H8804)} but thousands{H505}: and what can he have more but the kingdom{H4410}?"
1 Samuel,18,9,And Saul{H7586} eyed{H5770}{(H8802)} David{H1732} from that day{H3117} and forward{H1973}.
1 Samuel,18,10,"And it came to pass on the morrow{H4283}, that the evil{H7451} spirit{H7307} from God{H430} came{H6743}{(H8799)} upon Saul{H7586}, and he prophesied{H5012}{(H8691)} in the midst{H8432} of the house{H1004}: and David{H1732} played{H5059}{(H8764)} with his hand{H3027}, as at other times{H3117}: and there was a javelin{H2595} in Saul's{H7586} hand{H3027}."
1 Samuel,18,11,"And Saul{H7586} cast{H2904}{(H8686)} the javelin{H2595}; for he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will smite{H5221}{(H8686)} David{H1732} even to the wall{H7023} with it. And David{H1732} avoided out{H5437}{(H8735)} of his presence{H6440} twice{H6471}."
1 Samuel,18,12,"And Saul{H7586} was afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} of{H6440} David{H1732}, because the LORD{H3068} was with him, and was departed{H5493}{(H8804)} from Saul{H7586}."
1 Samuel,18,13,"Therefore Saul{H7586} removed{H5493}{(H8686)} him from him, and made{H7760}{(H8799)} him his captain{H8269} over a thousand{H505}; and he went out{H3318}{(H8799)} and came in{H935}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the people{H5971}."
1 Samuel,18,14,And David{H1732} behaved himself wisely{H7919}{(H8688)} in all his ways{H1870}; and the LORD{H3068} was with him.
1 Samuel,18,15,"Wherefore when Saul{H7586} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that he behaved{H7919} himself very{H3966} wisely{H7919}{(H8688)}, he was afraid{H1481}{(H8799)} of{H6440} him."
1 Samuel,18,16,"But all Israel{H3478} and Judah{H3063} loved{H157}{(H8802)} David{H1732}, because he went out{H3318}{(H8802)} and came in{H935}{(H8802)} before{H6440} them."
1 Samuel,18,17,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} to David{H1732}, Behold my elder{H1419} daughter{H1323} Merab{H4764}, her will I give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee to wife{H802}: only be thou valiant{H1121}{H2428} for me, and fight{H3898}{(H8734)} the LORD'S{H3068} battles{H4421}. For Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8804)}, Let not mine hand{H3027} be upon him, but let the hand{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430} be upon him."
1 Samuel,18,18,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Saul{H7586}, Who am I? and what is my life{H2416}, or my father's{H1} family{H4940} in Israel{H3478}, that I should be son in law{H2860} to the king{H4428}?"
1 Samuel,18,19,"But it came to pass at the time{H6256} when Merab{H4764} Saul's{H7586} daughter{H1323} should have been given{H5414}{(H8800)} to David{H1732}, that she was given{H5414}{(H8738)} unto Adriel{H5741} the Meholathite{H4259} to wife{H802}."
1 Samuel,18,20,"And Michal{H4324} Saul's{H7586} daughter{H1323} loved{H157}{(H8799)} David{H1732}: and they told{H5046}{(H8686)} Saul{H7586}, and the thing{H1697} pleased{H3474}{(H8799)}{H5869} him."
1 Samuel,18,21,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} him her, that she may be a snare{H4170} to him, and that the hand{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430} may be against him. Wherefore Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} to David{H1732}, Thou shalt this day{H3117} be my son in law{H2859}{(H8691)} in the one of the twain{H8147}."
1 Samuel,18,22,"And Saul{H7586} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} his servants{H5650}, saying, Commune{H1696}{(H8761)} with David{H1732} secretly{H3909}, and say{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, the king{H4428} hath delight{H2654}{(H8804)} in thee, and all his servants{H5650} love{H157}{(H8804)} thee: now therefore be the king's{H4428} son in law{H2859}{(H8690)}."
1 Samuel,18,23,"And Saul's{H7586} servants{H5650} spake{H1696}{(H8762)} those words{H1697} in the ears{H241} of David{H1732}. And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Seemeth{H5869} it to you a light{H7043}{(H8738)} thing to be a king's{H4428} son in law{H2859}{(H8692)}, seeing that I am a poor{H7326}{(H8802)} man{H376}, and lightly esteemed{H7034}{(H8737)}?"
1 Samuel,18,24,"And the servants{H5650} of Saul{H7586} told{H5046}{(H8686)} him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, On this manner{H1697} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} David{H1732}."
1 Samuel,18,25,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thus shall ye say{H559}{(H8799)} to David{H1732}, The king{H4428} desireth{H2656} not any dowry{H4119}, but an hundred{H3967} foreskins{H6190} of the Philistines{H6430}, to be avenged{H5358}{(H8736)} of the king's{H4428} enemies{H341}{(H8802)}. But Saul{H7586} thought{H2803}{(H8804)} to make David{H1732} fall{H5307}{(H8687)} by the hand{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430}."
1 Samuel,18,26,"And when his servants{H5650} told{H5046}{(H8686)} David{H1732} these words{H1697}, it pleased{H3474}{(H8799)}{H1697}{H5869} David{H1732} well to be the king's{H4428} son in law{H2859}{(H8692)}: and the days{H3117} were not expired{H4390}{(H8804)}."
1 Samuel,18,27,"Wherefore David{H1732} arose{H6965}{(H8799)} and went{H3212}{(H8799)}, he and his men{H582}, and slew{H5221}{(H8686)} of the Philistines{H6430} two hundred{H3967} men{H376}; and David{H1732} brought{H935}{(H8686)} their foreskins{H6190}, and they gave them in full tale{H4390}{(H8762)} to the king{H4428}, that he might be the king's{H4428} son in law{H2859}{(H8692)}. And Saul{H7586} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him Michal{H4324} his daughter{H1323} to wife{H802}."
1 Samuel,18,28,"And Saul{H7586} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} and knew{H3045}{(H8799)} that the LORD{H3068} was with David{H1732}, and that Michal{H4324} Saul's{H7586} daughter{H1323} loved{H157}{(H8804)} him."
1 Samuel,18,29,And Saul{H7586} was yet the more{H3254}{(H8686)} afraid{H3372}{(H8800)} of{H6440} David{H1732}; and Saul{H7586} became David's{H1732} enemy{H341}{(H8802)} continually{H3117}.
1 Samuel,18,30,"Then the princes{H8269} of the Philistines{H6430} went forth{H3318}{(H8799)}: and it came to pass, after{H1767} they went forth{H3318}{(H8800)}, that David{H1732} behaved himself more wisely{H7919}{(H8804)} than all the servants{H5650} of Saul{H7586}; so that his name{H8034} was much{H3966} set by{H3365}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,19,1,"And Saul{H7586} spake{H1696}{(H8762)} to Jonathan{H3129} his son{H1121}, and to all his servants{H5650}, that they should kill{H4191}{(H8687)} David{H1732}."
1 Samuel,19,2,"But Jonathan{H3083} Saul's{H7586} son{H1121} delighted{H2654}{(H8804)} much{H3966} in David{H1732}: and Jonathan{H3083} told{H5046}{(H8686)} David{H1732}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Saul{H7586} my father{H1} seeketh{H1245}{(H8764)} to kill{H4191}{(H8687)} thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed{H8104}{(H8734)} to thyself until the morning{H1242}, and abide{H3427}{(H8804)} in a secret{H5643} place, and hide{H2244}{(H8738)} thyself:"
1 Samuel,19,3,"And I will go out{H3318}{(H8799)} and stand{H5975}{(H8804)} beside{H3027} my father{H1} in the field{H7704} where thou art, and I will commune{H1696}{(H8762)} with my father{H1} of thee; and what{H4100} I see{H7200}{(H8804)}, that I will tell{H5046}{(H8689)} thee."
1 Samuel,19,4,"And Jonathan{H3083} spake{H1696}{(H8762)} good{H2896} of David{H1732} unto Saul{H7586} his father{H1}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Let not the king{H4428} sin{H2398}{(H8799)} against his servant{H5650}, against David{H1732}; because he hath not sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against thee, and because his works{H4639} have been to thee-ward very{H3966} good{H2896}:"
1 Samuel,19,5,"For he did put{H7760}{(H8799)} his life{H5315} in his hand{H3709}, and slew{H5221}{(H8686)} the Philistine{H6430}, and the LORD{H3068} wrought{H6213}{(H8799)} a great{H1419} salvation{H8668} for all Israel{H3478}: thou sawest{H7200}{(H8804)} it, and didst rejoice{H8055}{(H8799)}: wherefore then wilt thou sin{H2398}{(H8799)} against innocent{H5355} blood{H1818}, to slay{H4191}{(H8687)} David{H1732} without a cause{H2600}?"
1 Samuel,19,6,"And Saul{H7586} hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} unto the voice{H6963} of Jonathan{H3083}: and Saul{H7586} sware{H7650}{(H8735)}, As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, he shall not{H518} be slain{H4191}{(H8714)}."
1 Samuel,19,7,"And Jonathan{H3083} called{H7121}{(H8799)} David{H1732}, and Jonathan{H3083} shewed{H5046}{(H8686)} him all those things{H1697}. And Jonathan{H3083} brought{H935}{(H8686)} David{H1732} to Saul{H7586}, and he was in his presence{H6440}, as in times past{H865}{H8032}."
1 Samuel,19,8,"And there was war{H4421} again{H3254}{(H8686)}: and David{H1732} went out{H3318}{(H8799)}, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} with the Philistines{H6430}, and slew{H5221}{(H8686)} them with a great{H1419} slaughter{H4347}; and they fled{H5127}{(H8799)} from{H6440} him."
1 Samuel,19,9,"And the evil{H7451} spirit{H7307} from the LORD{H3068} was upon Saul{H7586}, as he sat{H3427}{(H8802)} in his house{H1004} with his javelin{H2595} in his hand{H3027}: and David{H1732} played{H5059}{(H8764)} with his hand{H3027}."
1 Samuel,19,10,"And Saul{H7586} sought{H1245}{(H8762)} to smite{H5221}{(H8687)} David{H1732} even to the wall{H7023} with the javelin{H2595}; but he slipped away{H6362}{(H8799)} out of Saul's{H7586} presence{H6440}, and he smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the javelin{H2595} into the wall{H7023}: and David{H1732} fled{H5127}{(H8804)}, and escaped{H4422}{(H8735)} that night{H3915}."
1 Samuel,19,11,"Saul{H7586} also sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} unto David's{H1732} house{H1004}, to watch{H8104}{(H8800)} him, and to slay{H4191}{(H8687)} him in the morning{H1242}: and Michal{H4324} David's{H1732} wife{H802} told{H5046}{(H8686)} him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, If thou save{H4422}{(H8764)} not thy life{H5315} to night{H3915}, to morrow{H4279} thou shalt be slain{H4191}{(H8716)}."
1 Samuel,19,12,"So Michal{H4324} let{H3381} David{H1732} down{H3381}{(H8686)} through a window{H2474}: and he went{H3212}{(H8799)}, and fled{H1272}{(H8799)}, and escaped{H4422}{(H8735)}."
1 Samuel,19,13,"And Michal{H4324} took{H3947}{(H8799)} an image{H8655}, and laid{H7760}{(H8799)} it in the bed{H4296}, and put{H7760}{(H8804)} a pillow{H3523} of goats{H5795}' hair for his bolster{H4763}, and covered{H3680}{(H8762)} it with a cloth{H899}."
1 Samuel,19,14,"And when Saul{H7586} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} to take{H3947}{(H8800)} David{H1732}, she said{H559}{(H8799)}, He is sick{H2470}{(H8802)}."
1 Samuel,19,15,"And Saul{H7586} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} the messengers{H4397} again to see{H7200}{(H8800)} David{H1732}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Bring him up{H5927}{(H8685)} to me in the bed{H4296}, that I may slay{H4191}{(H8687)} him."
1 Samuel,19,16,"And when the messengers{H4397} were come in{H935}{(H8799)}, behold, there was an image{H8655} in the bed{H4296}, with a pillow{H3523} of goats{H5795}' hair for his bolster{H4763}."
1 Samuel,19,17,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Michal{H4324}, Why hast thou deceived me so{H7411}{(H8765)}, and sent away{H7971}{(H8762)} mine enemy{H341}{(H8802)}, that he is escaped{H4422}{(H8735)}? And Michal{H4324} answered{H559}{(H8799)} Saul{H7586}, He said{H559}{(H8804)} unto me, Let me go{H7971}{(H8761)}; why should I kill{H4191}{(H8686)} thee?"
1 Samuel,19,18,"So David{H1732} fled{H1272}{(H8804)}, and escaped{H4422}{(H8735)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Samuel{H8050} to Ramah{H7414}, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} him all that Saul{H7586} had done{H6213}{(H8804)} to him. And he and Samuel{H8050} went{H3212}{(H8799)} and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in Naioth{H5121}."
1 Samuel,19,19,"And it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} Saul{H7586}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, David{H1732} is at Naioth{H5121} in Ramah{H7414}."
1 Samuel,19,20,"And Saul{H7586} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} to take{H3947}{(H8800)} David{H1732}: and when they saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the company{H3862} of the prophets{H5030} prophesying{H5012}{(H8737)}, and Samuel{H8050} standing{H5975}{(H8802)} as appointed{H5324}{(H8737)} over them, the Spirit{H7307} of God{H430} was upon the messengers{H4397} of Saul{H7586}, and they also prophesied{H5012}{(H8691)}."
1 Samuel,19,21,"And when it was told{H5046}{(H8686)} Saul{H7586}, he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} other{H312} messengers{H4397}, and they prophesied{H5012}{(H8691)} likewise. And Saul{H7586} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} again{H3254}{(H8686)} the third{H7992} time, and they prophesied{H5012}{(H8691)} also."
1 Samuel,19,22,"Then went{H3212}{(H8799)} he also to Ramah{H7414}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to a great{H1419} well{H953} that is in Sechu{H7906}: and he asked{H7592}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Where{H375} are Samuel{H8050} and David{H1732}? And one said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, they be at Naioth{H5121} in Ramah{H7414}."
1 Samuel,19,23,"And he went{H3212}{(H8799)} thither to Naioth{H5121} in Ramah{H7414}: and the Spirit{H7307} of God{H430} was upon him also, and he went{H3212}{(H8799)} on{H1980}{(H8800)}, and prophesied{H5012}{(H8691)}, until he came{H935}{(H8800)} to Naioth{H5121} in Ramah{H7414}."
1 Samuel,19,24,"And he stripped off{H6584}{(H8799)} his clothes{H899} also{H1571}, and prophesied{H5012}{(H8691)} before{H6440} Samuel{H8050} in like manner, and lay down{H5307}{(H8799)} naked{H6174} all that day{H3117} and all that night{H3915}. Wherefore they say{H559}{(H8799)}, Is Saul{H7586} also among the prophets{H5030}?"
1 Samuel,20,1,"And David{H1732} fled{H1272}{(H8799)} from Naioth{H5121} in Ramah{H7414}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} before{H6440} Jonathan{H3083}, What have I done{H6213}{(H8804)}? what is mine iniquity{H5771}? and what is my sin{H2403} before{H6440} thy father{H1}, that he seeketh{H1245}{(H8764)} my life{H5315}?"
1 Samuel,20,2,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, God forbid{H2486}; thou shalt not die{H4191}{(H8799)}: behold, my father{H1} will do{H6213}{(H8799)}{(H8675)}{H6213}{(H8804)} nothing{H1697} either great{H1419} or small{H6996}, but that he will shew{H1540}{(H8799)}{H241} it me: and why should my father{H1} hide{H5641}{(H8686)} this thing{H1697} from me? it is not so."
1 Samuel,20,3,"And David{H1732} sware{H7650}{(H8735)} moreover, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thy father{H1} certainly{H3045}{(H8800)} knoweth{H3045}{(H8804)} that I have found{H4672}{(H8804)} grace{H2580} in thine eyes{H5869}; and he saith{H559}{(H8799)}, Let not Jonathan{H3083} know{H3045}{(H8799)} this, lest he be grieved{H6087}{(H8735)}: but truly{H199} as the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, and as thy soul{H5315} liveth{H2416}, there is but a step{H6587} between me and death{H4194}."
1 Samuel,20,4,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Jonathan{H3083} unto David{H1732}, Whatsoever thy soul{H5315} desireth{H559}{(H8799)}, I will even do{H6213}{(H8799)} it for thee."
1 Samuel,20,5,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jonathan{H3083}, Behold, to morrow{H4279} is the new moon{H2320}, and I should not fail{H3427}{(H8800)} to sit{H3427}{(H8799)} with the king{H4428} at meat{H398}{(H8800)}: but let me go{H7971}{(H8765)}, that I may hide{H5641}{(H8738)} myself in the field{H7704} unto the third{H7992} day at even{H6153}."
1 Samuel,20,6,"If thy father{H1} at all{H6485}{(H8800)} miss{H6485}{(H8799)} me, then say{H559}{(H8804)}, David{H1732} earnestly{H7592}{(H8736)} asked{H7592}{(H8738)} leave of me that he might run{H7323}{(H8800)} to Bethlehem{H1035} his city{H5892}: for there is a yearly{H3117} sacrifice{H2077} there for all the family{H4940}."
1 Samuel,20,7,"If he say{H559}{(H8799)} thus, It is well{H2896}; thy servant{H5650} shall have peace{H7965}: but if he be very{H2734}{(H8800)} wroth{H2734}{(H8799)}, then be sure{H3045}{(H8798)} that evil{H7451} is determined{H3615}{(H8804)} by him."
1 Samuel,20,8,"Therefore thou shalt deal{H6213}{(H8804)} kindly{H2617} with thy servant{H5650}; for thou hast brought{H935}{(H8689)} thy servant{H5650} into a covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068} with thee: notwithstanding, if there be{H3426} in me iniquity{H5771}, slay{H4191}{(H8685)} me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring{H935}{(H8686)} me to thy father{H1}?"
1 Samuel,20,9,"And Jonathan{H3083} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Far be it from thee{H2486}: for if I knew{H3045}{(H8799)} certainly{H3045}{(H8800)} that evil{H7451} were determined{H3615}{(H8804)} by my father{H1} to come{H935}{(H8800)} upon thee, then would not I tell{H5046}{(H8686)} it thee?"
1 Samuel,20,10,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} David{H1732} to Jonathan{H3083}, Who shall tell{H5046}{(H8686)} me? or what if thy father{H1} answer{H6030}{(H8799)} thee roughly{H7186}?"
1 Samuel,20,11,"And Jonathan{H3083} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and let us go out{H3318}{(H8799)} into the field{H7704}. And they went out{H3318}{(H8799)} both{H8147} of them into the field{H7704}."
1 Samuel,20,12,"And Jonathan{H3083} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, O LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, when I have sounded{H2713}{(H8799)} my father{H1} about to morrow{H4279} any time{H6256}, or the third{H7992} day, and, behold, if there be good{H2895}{(H8804)} toward David{H1732}, and I then send{H7971}{(H8799)} not unto thee, and shew{H1540}{(H8804)}{H241} it thee;"
1 Samuel,20,13,"The LORD{H3068} do{H6213}{(H8799)} so{H3541} and much more{H3254}{(H8686)} to Jonathan{H3083}: but if it please{H3190}{(H8686)} my father{H1} to do thee evil{H7451}, then I will shew{H1540}{(H8804)}{H241} it thee, and send thee away{H7971}{(H8765)}, that thou mayest go{H1980}{(H8804)} in peace{H7965}: and the LORD{H3068} be with thee, as he hath been with my father{H1}."
1 Samuel,20,14,"And thou shalt not only while yet{H518} I live{H2416} shew{H6213}{(H8799)} me the kindness{H2617} of the LORD{H3068}, that I die{H4191}{(H8799)} not:"
1 Samuel,20,15,"But also thou shalt not cut off{H3772}{(H8686)} thy kindness{H2617} from my house{H1004} for{H5704} ever{H5769}: no, not when the LORD{H3068} hath cut off{H3772}{(H8687)} the enemies{H341}{(H8802)} of David{H1732} every one{H376} from the face{H6440} of the earth{H127}."
1 Samuel,20,16,"So Jonathan{H3083} made{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant with the house{H1004} of David{H1732}, saying, Let the LORD{H3068} even require{H1245}{(H8765)} it at the hand{H3027} of David's{H1732} enemies{H341}{(H8802)}."
1 Samuel,20,17,"And Jonathan{H3083} caused David{H1732} to swear{H7650}{(H8687)} again{H3254}{(H8686)}, because he loved{H160} him: for he loved{H157}{(H8804)} him as he loved{H160} his own soul{H5315}."
1 Samuel,20,18,"Then Jonathan{H3083} said{H559}{(H8799)} to David{H1732}, To morrow{H4279} is the new moon{H2320}: and thou shalt be missed{H6485}{(H8738)}, because thy seat{H4186} will be empty{H6485}{(H8735)}."
1 Samuel,20,19,"And when thou hast stayed three days{H8027}{(H8765)}, then thou shalt go down{H3381}{(H8799)} quickly{H3966}, and come{H935}{(H8804)} to the place{H4725} where thou didst hide{H5641}{(H8738)} thyself when{H3117} the business{H4639} was in hand, and shalt remain{H3427}{(H8804)} by{H681} the stone{H68} Ezel{H237}."
1 Samuel,20,20,"And I will shoot{H3384}{(H8686)} three{H7969} arrows{H2671} on the side{H6654} thereof, as though I shot{H7971}{(H8763)} at a mark{H4307}."
1 Samuel,20,21,"And, behold, I will send{H7971}{(H8799)} a lad{H5288}, saying, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, find out{H4672}{(H8798)} the arrows{H2671}. If I expressly{H559}{(H8800)} say{H559}{(H8799)} unto the lad{H5288}, Behold, the arrows{H2671} are on this side of thee, take{H3947}{(H8798)} them; then come{H935}{(H8798)} thou: for there is peace{H7965} to thee, and no hurt{H1697}; as the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}."
1 Samuel,20,22,"But if I say{H559}{(H8799)} thus unto the young man{H5958}, Behold, the arrows{H2671} are beyond{H1973} thee; go thy way{H3212}{(H8798)}: for the LORD{H3068} hath sent thee away{H7971}{(H8765)}."
1 Samuel,20,23,"And as touching the matter{H1697} which thou and I have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} of, behold, the LORD{H3068} be between thee and me for{H5704} ever{H5769}."
1 Samuel,20,24,"So David{H1732} hid{H5641}{(H8735)} himself in the field{H7704}: and when the new moon{H2320} was come, the king{H4428} sat him down{H3427}{(H8799)} to eat{H398}{(H8800)} meat{H3899}."
1 Samuel,20,25,"And the king{H4428} sat{H3427}{(H8799)} upon his seat{H4186}, as at other times{H6471}, even upon a seat{H4186} by the wall{H7023}: and Jonathan{H3083} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and Abner{H74} sat{H3427}{(H8799)} by Saul's{H7586} side{H6654}, and David's{H1732} place{H4725} was empty{H6485}{(H8735)}."
1 Samuel,20,26,"Nevertheless Saul{H7586} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} not any thing{H3972} that day{H3117}: for he thought{H559}{(H8804)}, Something hath befallen{H4745} him, he is not{H1115} clean{H2889}; surely he is not clean{H2889}."
1 Samuel,20,27,"And it came to pass on the morrow{H4283}, which was the second{H8145} day of the month{H2320}, that David's{H1732} place{H4725} was empty{H6485}{(H8735)}: and Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jonathan{H3083} his son{H1121}, Wherefore cometh{H935}{(H8804)} not the son{H1121} of Jesse{H3448} to meat{H3899}, neither yesterday{H8543}, nor to day{H3117}?"
1 Samuel,20,28,"And Jonathan{H3083} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Saul{H7586}, David{H1732} earnestly{H7592}{(H8736)} asked{H7592}{(H8738)} leave of me{H5978} to go to Bethlehem{H1035}:"
1 Samuel,20,29,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let me go{H7971}{(H8761)}, I pray thee; for our family{H4940} hath a sacrifice{H2077} in the city{H5892}; and my brother{H251}, he hath commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} me to be there: and now, if I have found{H4672}{(H8804)} favour{H2580} in thine eyes{H5869}, let me get away{H4422}{(H8735)}, I pray thee, and see{H7200}{(H8799)} my brethren{H251}. Therefore he cometh{H935}{(H8804)} not unto the king's{H4428} table{H7979}."
1 Samuel,20,30,"Then Saul's{H7586} anger{H639} was kindled{H2734}{(H8799)} against Jonathan{H3083}, and he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Thou son{H1121} of the perverse{H5753}{(H8737)} rebellious{H4780} woman, do not I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that thou hast chosen{H977}{(H8802)} the son{H1121} of Jesse{H3448} to thine own confusion{H1322}, and unto the confusion{H1322} of thy mother's{H517} nakedness{H6172}?"
1 Samuel,20,31,"For as long as{H3117} the son{H1121} of Jesse{H3448} liveth{H2425}{(H8804)} upon the ground{H127}, thou shalt not be established{H3559}{(H8735)}, nor thy kingdom{H4438}. Wherefore now send{H7971}{(H8798)} and fetch{H3947}{(H8798)} him unto me, for he shall surely die{H1121}{H4194}."
1 Samuel,20,32,"And Jonathan{H3083} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Saul{H7586} his father{H1}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain{H4191}{(H8714)}? what hath he done{H6213}{(H8804)}?"
1 Samuel,20,33,And Saul{H7586} cast{H2904}{(H8686)} a javelin{H2595} at him to smite{H5221}{(H8687)} him: whereby Jonathan{H3083} knew{H3045}{(H8799)} that it was determined{H3617} of his father{H1} to slay{H4191}{(H8687)} David{H1732}.
1 Samuel,20,34,"So Jonathan{H3083} arose{H6965}{(H8799)} from the table{H7979} in fierce{H2750} anger{H639}, and did eat{H398}{(H8804)} no meat{H3899} the second{H8145} day{H3117} of the month{H2320}: for he was grieved{H6087}{(H8738)} for David{H1732}, because his father{H1} had done him shame{H3637}{(H8689)}."
1 Samuel,20,35,"And it came to pass in the morning{H1242}, that Jonathan{H3083} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} into the field{H7704} at the time appointed{H4150} with David{H1732}, and a little{H6996} lad{H5288} with him."
1 Samuel,20,36,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his lad{H5288}, Run{H7323}{(H8798)}, find out{H4672}{(H8798)} now the arrows{H2671} which I shoot{H3384}{(H8688)}. And as the lad{H5288} ran{H7323}{(H8801)}, he shot{H3384}{(H8804)} an arrow{H2678} beyond{H5674}{(H8687)} him."
1 Samuel,20,37,"And when the lad{H5288} was come{H935}{(H8799)} to the place{H4725} of the arrow{H2678} which Jonathan{H3083} had shot{H3384}{(H8804)}, Jonathan{H3083} cried{H7121}{(H8799)} after{H310} the lad{H5288}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is not the arrow{H2678} beyond{H1973} thee?"
1 Samuel,20,38,"And Jonathan{H3083} cried{H7121}{(H8799)} after{H310} the lad{H5288}, Make speed{H4120}, haste{H2363}{(H8798)}, stay{H5975}{(H8799)} not. And Jonathan's{H3083} lad{H5288} gathered up{H3950}{(H8762)} the arrows{H2671}{(H8675)}{H2678}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to his master{H113}."
1 Samuel,20,39,But the lad{H5288} knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not any thing{H3972}: only Jonathan{H3083} and David{H1732} knew{H3045}{(H8804)} the matter{H1697}.
1 Samuel,20,40,"And Jonathan{H3083} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} his artillery{H3627} unto his lad{H5288}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, carry{H935}{(H8685)} them to the city{H5892}."
1 Samuel,20,41,"And as soon as the lad{H5288} was gone{H935}{(H8802)}, David{H1732} arose{H6965}{(H8804)} out of a place toward{H681} the south{H5045}, and fell{H5307}{(H8799)} on his face{H639} to the ground{H776}, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} himself three{H7969} times{H6471}: and they kissed{H5401}{(H8799)} one{H376} another{H7453}, and wept{H1058}{(H8799)} one{H376} with another{H7453}, until David{H1732} exceeded{H1431}{(H8689)}."
1 Samuel,20,42,"And Jonathan{H3083} said{H559}{(H8799)} to David{H1732}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} in peace{H7965}, forasmuch as we have sworn{H7650}{(H8738)} both{H8147} of us in the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The LORD{H3068} be between me and thee, and between my seed{H2233} and thy seed{H2233} for{H5704} ever{H5769}. And he arose{H6965}{(H8799)} and departed{H3212}{(H8799)}: and Jonathan{H3083} went{H935}{(H8802)} into the city{H5892}."
1 Samuel,21,1,"Then came{H935}{(H8799)} David{H1732} to Nob{H5011} to Ahimelech{H288} the priest{H3548}: and Ahimelech{H288} was afraid{H2729}{(H8799)} at the meeting{H7125}{(H8800)} of David{H1732}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man{H376} with thee?"
1 Samuel,21,2,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Ahimelech{H288} the priest{H3548}, The king{H4428} hath commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} me a business{H1697}, and hath said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Let no man{H376} know{H3045}{(H8799)} any thing{H3972} of the business{H1697} whereabout I send{H7971}{(H8802)} thee, and what I have commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} thee: and I have appointed{H3045}{(H8776)} my servants{H5288} to such{H6423} and such{H492} a place{H4725}."
1 Samuel,21,3,"Now therefore what is{H3426} under thine hand{H3027}? give{H5414}{(H8798)} me five{H2568} loaves of bread{H3899} in mine hand{H3027}, or what there is present{H4672}{(H8737)}."
1 Samuel,21,4,"And the priest{H3548} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} David{H1732}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, There is no common{H2455} bread{H3899} under mine hand{H3027}, but there is{H3426} hallowed{H6944} bread{H3899}; if the young men{H5288} have kept{H8104}{(H8738)} themselves at least{H389} from women{H802}."
1 Samuel,21,5,"And David{H1732} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the priest{H3548}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Of a truth{H518} women{H802} have been kept{H6113}{(H8803)} from us about these three{H8032} days{H8543}, since I came out{H3318}{(H8800)}, and the vessels{H3627} of the young men{H5288} are holy{H6944}, and the bread is in a manner{H1870} common{H2455}, yea, though it were sanctified{H6942}{(H8799)} this day{H3117} in the vessel{H3627}."
1 Samuel,21,6,"So the priest{H3548} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him hallowed{H6944} bread: for there was no bread{H3899} there but the shewbread{H3899}{H6440}, that was taken{H5493}{(H8716)} from before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, to put{H7760}{(H8800)} hot{H2527} bread{H3899} in the day{H3117} when it was taken away{H3947}{(H8736)}."
1 Samuel,21,7,"Now a certain man{H376} of the servants{H5650} of Saul{H7586} was there that day{H3117}, detained{H6113}{(H8737)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}; and his name{H8034} was Doeg{H1673}, an Edomite{H130}, the chiefest{H47} of the herdmen{H7462}{(H8802)} that belonged to Saul{H7586}."
1 Samuel,21,8,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Ahimelech{H288}, And is there{H3426} not{H371} here under thine hand{H3027} spear{H2595} or sword{H2719}? for I have neither brought{H3947}{(H8804)} my sword{H2719} nor my weapons{H3627} with me{H3027}, because the king's{H4428} business{H1697} required{H1961}{(H8804)} haste{H5169}{(H8803)}."
1 Samuel,21,9,"And the priest{H3548} said{H559}{(H8799)}, The sword{H2719} of Goliath{H1555} the Philistine{H6430}, whom thou slewest{H5221}{(H8689)} in the valley{H6010} of Elah{H425}, behold, it is here wrapped{H3874}{(H8803)} in a cloth{H8071} behind{H310} the ephod{H646}: if thou wilt take{H3947}{(H8799)} that, take{H3947}{(H8798)} it: for there is no other{H312} save{H2108} that here{H2088}. And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)}, There is none like that; give{H5414}{(H8798)} it me."
1 Samuel,21,10,"And David{H1732} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and fled{H1272}{(H8799)} that day{H3117} for fear{H6440} of Saul{H7586}, and went{H935}{(H8799)} to Achish{H397} the king{H4428} of Gath{H1661}."
1 Samuel,21,11,"And the servants{H5650} of Achish{H397} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Is not this David{H1732} the king{H4428} of the land{H776}? did they not sing{H6030}{(H8799)} one to another of him{H2088} in dances{H4246}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Saul{H7586} hath slain{H5221}{(H8689)} his thousands{H505}, and David{H1732} his ten thousands{H7233}?"
1 Samuel,21,12,"And David{H1732} laid up{H7760}{(H8799)} these words{H1697} in his heart{H3824}, and was sore{H3966} afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} of{H6440} Achish{H397} the king{H4428} of Gath{H1661}."
1 Samuel,21,13,"And he changed{H8138}{(H8762)} his behaviour{H2940} before{H5869} them, and feigned himself mad{H1984}{(H8704)} in their hands{H3027}, and scrabbled{H8427}{(H8762)} on the doors{H1817} of the gate{H8179}, and let his spittle{H7388} fall down{H3381}{(H8686)} upon his beard{H2206}."
1 Samuel,21,14,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Achish{H397} unto his servants{H5650}, Lo, ye see{H7200}{(H8799)} the man{H376} is mad{H7696}{(H8693)}: wherefore then have ye brought{H935}{(H8686)} him to me?"
1 Samuel,21,15,"Have I need{H2638} of mad men{H7696}{(H8794)}, that ye have brought{H935}{(H8689)} this fellow to play the mad man{H7696}{(H8692)} in my presence? shall this fellow come{H935}{(H8799)} into my house{H1004}?"
1 Samuel,22,1,"David{H1732} therefore departed{H3212}{(H8799)} thence, and escaped{H4422}{(H8735)} to the cave{H4631} Adullam{H5725}: and when his brethren{H251} and all his father's{H1} house{H1004} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} it, they went down{H3381}{(H8799)} thither to him."
1 Samuel,22,2,"And every one{H376} that was in distress{H4689}, and every one{H376} that was in debt{H5378}{(H8801)}, and every one{H376} that was discontented{H4751}{H5315}, gathered{H6908}{(H8691)} themselves unto him; and he became a captain{H8269} over them: and there were with him about four{H702} hundred{H3967} men{H376}."
1 Samuel,22,3,"And David{H1732} went{H3212}{(H8799)} thence to Mizpeh{H4708} of Moab{H4124}: and he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428} of Moab{H4124}, Let my father{H1} and my mother{H517}, I pray thee, come forth{H3318}{(H8799)}, and be with you, till I know{H3045}{(H8799)} what God{H430} will do{H6213}{(H8799)} for me."
1 Samuel,22,4,And he brought{H5148}{(H8686)} them before{H6440} the king{H4428} of Moab{H4124}: and they dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} with him all the while{H3117} that David{H1732} was in the hold{H4686}.
1 Samuel,22,5,"And the prophet{H5030} Gad{H1410} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, Abide{H3427}{(H8799)} not in the hold{H4686}; depart{H3212}{(H8798)}, and get{H935}{(H8804)} thee into the land{H776} of Judah{H3063}. Then David{H1732} departed{H3212}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} into the forest{H3293} of Hareth{H2802}."
1 Samuel,22,6,"When Saul{H7586} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that David{H1732} was discovered{H3045}{(H8738)}, and the men{H582} that were with him,(now Saul{H7586} abode{H3427}{(H8802)} in Gibeah{H1390} under a tree{H815} in Ramah{H7414}, having his spear{H2595} in his hand{H3027}, and all his servants{H5650} were standing{H5324}{(H8737)} about him;)"
1 Samuel,22,7,"Then Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his servants{H5650} that stood{H5324}{(H8737)} about him, Hear now{H8085}{(H8798)}, ye Benjamites{H1145}; will the son{H1121} of Jesse{H3448} give{H5414}{(H8799)} every one of you fields{H7704} and vineyards{H3754}, and make{H7760}{(H8799)} you all captains{H8269} of thousands{H505}, and captains{H8269} of hundreds{H3967};"
1 Samuel,22,8,"That all of you have conspired{H7194}{(H8804)} against me, and there is none that sheweth{H1540}{(H8802)}{H241} me that my son{H1121} hath made a league{H3772}{(H8800)} with the son{H1121} of Jesse{H3448}, and there is none of you that is sorry{H2470}{(H8802)} for me, or sheweth{H1540}{(H8802)}{H241} unto me that my son{H1121} hath stirred up{H6965}{(H8689)} my servant{H5650} against me, to lie in wait{H693}{(H8802)}, as at this day{H3117}?"
1 Samuel,22,9,"Then answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Doeg{H1673} the Edomite{H130}, which was set{H5324}{(H8737)} over the servants{H5650} of Saul{H7586}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} the son{H1121} of Jesse{H3448} coming{H935}{(H8802)} to Nob{H5011}, to Ahimelech{H288} the son{H1121} of Ahitub{H285}."
1 Samuel,22,10,"And he enquired{H7592}{(H8799)} of the LORD{H3068} for him, and gave{H5414}{(H8804)} him victuals{H6720}, and gave{H5414}{(H8804)} him the sword{H2719} of Goliath{H1555} the Philistine{H6430}."
1 Samuel,22,11,"Then the king{H4428} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to call{H7121}{(H8800)} Ahimelech{H288} the priest{H3548}, the son{H1121} of Ahitub{H285}, and all his father's{H1} house{H1004}, the priests{H3548} that were in Nob{H5011}: and they came{H935}{(H8799)} all of them to the king{H4428}."
1 Samuel,22,12,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} now, thou son{H1121} of Ahitub{H285}. And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Here I am, my lord{H113}."
1 Samuel,22,13,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Why have ye conspired{H7194}{(H8804)} against me, thou and the son{H1121} of Jesse{H3448}, in that thou hast given{H5414}{(H8800)} him bread{H3899}, and a sword{H2719}, and hast enquired{H7592}{(H8800)} of God{H430} for him, that he should rise{H6965}{(H8800)} against me, to lie in wait{H693}{(H8802)}, as at this day{H3117}?"
1 Samuel,22,14,"Then Ahimelech{H288} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the king{H4428}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, And who is so faithful{H539}{(H8737)} among all thy servants{H5650} as David{H1732}, which is the king's{H4428} son in law{H2860}, and goeth{H5493}{(H8804)} at thy bidding{H4928}, and is honourable{H3513}{(H8737)} in thine house{H1004}?"
1 Samuel,22,15,"Did I then{H3117} begin{H2490}{(H8689)} to enquire{H7592}{(H8800)} of God{H430} for him? be it far from me{H2486}: let not the king{H4428} impute{H7760}{(H8799)} any thing{H1697} unto his servant{H5650}, nor to all the house{H1004} of my father{H1}: for thy servant{H5650} knew{H3045}{(H8804)} nothing{H1697} of all this, less{H6996} or more{H1419}."
1 Samuel,22,16,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou shalt surely{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}, Ahimelech{H288}, thou, and all thy father's{H1} house{H1004}."
1 Samuel,22,17,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the footmen{H7323}{(H8801)} that stood{H5324}{(H8737)} about him, Turn{H5437}{(H8798)}, and slay{H4191}{(H8685)} the priests{H3548} of the LORD{H3068}; because their hand{H3027} also is with David{H1732}, and because they knew{H3045}{(H8804)} when he fled{H1272}{(H8802)}, and did not shew{H1540}{(H8804)}{H241} it to me. But the servants{H5650} of the king{H4428} would{H14}{(H8804)} not put forth{H7971}{(H8800)} their hand{H3027} to fall{H6293}{(H8800)} upon the priests{H3548} of the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,22,18,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Doeg{H1673}, Turn{H5437}{(H8798)} thou, and fall{H6293}{(H8798)} upon the priests{H3548}. And Doeg{H1673} the Edomite{H130} turned{H5437}{(H8735)}, and he fell{H6293}{(H8799)} upon the priests{H3548}, and slew{H4191}{(H8686)} on that day{H3117} fourscore{H8084} and five{H2568} persons{H376} that did wear{H5375}{(H8802)} a linen{H906} ephod{H646}."
1 Samuel,22,19,"And Nob{H5011}, the city{H5892} of the priests{H3548}, smote{H5221}{(H8689)} he with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}, both men{H376} and women{H802}, children{H5768} and sucklings{H3243}{(H8802)}, and oxen{H7794}, and asses{H2543}, and sheep{H7716}, with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}."
1 Samuel,22,20,"And one{H259} of the sons{H1121} of Ahimelech{H288} the son{H1121} of Ahitub{H285}, named{H8034} Abiathar{H54}, escaped{H4422}{(H8735)}, and fled{H1272}{(H8799)} after{H310} David{H1732}."
1 Samuel,22,21,And Abiathar{H54} shewed{H5046}{(H8686)} David{H1732} that Saul{H7586} had slain{H2026}{(H8804)} the LORD'S{H3068} priests{H3548}.
1 Samuel,22,22,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Abiathar{H54}, I knew{H3045}{(H8804)} it that day{H3117}, when Doeg{H1673} the Edomite{H130} was there, that he would surely{H5046}{(H8687)} tell{H5046}{(H8686)} Saul{H7586}: I have occasioned{H5437}{(H8804)} the death of all the persons{H5315} of thy father's{H1} house{H1004}."
1 Samuel,22,23,"Abide{H3427}{(H8798)} thou with me, fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not: for he that seeketh{H1245}{(H8762)} my life{H5315} seeketh{H1245}{(H8762)} thy life{H5315}: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard{H4931}."
1 Samuel,23,1,"Then they told{H5046}{(H8686)} David{H1732}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, the Philistines{H6430} fight{H3898}{(H8737)} against Keilah{H7084}, and they rob{H8154}{(H8802)} the threshingfloors{H1637}."
1 Samuel,23,2,"Therefore David{H1732} enquired{H7592}{(H8799)} of the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Shall I go{H3212}{(H8799)} and smite{H5221}{(H8689)} these Philistines{H6430}? And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, and smite{H5221}{(H8689)} the Philistines{H6430}, and save{H3467}{(H8689)} Keilah{H7084}."
1 Samuel,23,3,"And David's{H1732} men{H582} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Behold, we be afraid{H3373} here in Judah{H3063}: how much more then if we come{H3212}{(H8799)} to Keilah{H7084} against the armies{H4634} of the Philistines{H6430}?"
1 Samuel,23,4,"Then David{H1732} enquired{H7592}{(H8800)} of the LORD{H3068} yet again{H3254}{(H8686)}. And the LORD{H3068} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} him and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, go down{H3381}{(H8798)} to Keilah{H7084}; for I will deliver{H5414}{(H8802)} the Philistines{H6430} into thine hand{H3027}."
1 Samuel,23,5,"So David{H1732} and his men{H582} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Keilah{H7084}, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} with the Philistines{H6430}, and brought away{H5090}{(H8799)} their cattle{H4735}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them with a great{H1419} slaughter{H4347}. So David{H1732} saved{H3467}{(H8686)} the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Keilah{H7084}."
1 Samuel,23,6,"And it came to pass, when Abiathar{H54} the son{H1121} of Ahimelech{H288} fled{H1272}{(H8800)} to David{H1732} to Keilah{H7084}, that he came down{H3381}{(H8804)} with an ephod{H646} in his hand{H3027}."
1 Samuel,23,7,"And it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} Saul{H7586} that David{H1732} was come{H935}{(H8804)} to Keilah{H7084}. And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)}, God{H430} hath delivered{H5234}{(H8765)} him into mine hand{H3027}; for he is shut in{H5462}{(H8738)}, by entering{H935}{(H8800)} into a town{H5892} that hath gates{H1817} and bars{H1280}."
1 Samuel,23,8,"And Saul{H7586} called{H8085} all the people{H5971} together{H8085}{(H8762)} to war{H4421}, to go down{H3381}{(H8800)} to Keilah{H7084}, to besiege{H6696}{(H8800)} David{H1732} and his men{H582}."
1 Samuel,23,9,"And David{H1732} knew{H3045}{(H8799)} that Saul{H7586} secretly practised{H2790}{(H8688)} mischief{H7451} against him; and he said{H559}{(H8799)} to Abiathar{H54} the priest{H3548}, Bring hither{H5066}{(H8685)} the ephod{H646}."
1 Samuel,23,10,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} David{H1732}, O LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, thy servant{H5650} hath certainly{H8085}{(H8800)} heard{H8085}{(H8804)} that Saul{H7586} seeketh{H1245}{(H8764)} to come{H935}{(H8800)} to Keilah{H7084}, to destroy{H7843}{(H8763)} the city{H5892} for my sake."
1 Samuel,23,11,"Will the men{H1167} of Keilah{H7084} deliver me up{H5462}{(H8686)} into his hand{H3027}? will Saul{H7586} come down{H3381}{(H8799)}, as thy servant{H5650} hath heard{H8085}{(H8804)}? O LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, I beseech thee, tell{H5046}{(H8685)} thy servant{H5650}. And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)}, He will come down{H3381}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,23,12,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} David{H1732}, Will the men{H1167} of Keilah{H7084} deliver{H5462}{(H8686)} me and my men{H582} into the hand{H3027} of Saul{H7586}? And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)}, They will deliver thee up{H5462}{(H8686)}."
1 Samuel,23,13,"Then David{H1732} and his men{H582}, which were about six{H8337} hundred{H3967}{H376}, arose{H6965}{(H8799)} and departed{H3318}{(H8799)} out of Keilah{H7084}, and went{H1980}{(H8691)} whithersoever{H834} they could go{H1980}{(H8691)}. And it was told{H5046}{(H8717)} Saul{H7586} that David{H1732} was escaped{H4422}{(H8738)} from Keilah{H7084}; and he forbare{H2308}{(H8799)} to go forth{H3318}{(H8800)}."
1 Samuel,23,14,"And David{H1732} abode{H3427}{(H8799)} in the wilderness{H4057} in strong holds{H4679}, and remained{H3427}{(H8799)} in a mountain{H2022} in the wilderness{H4057} of Ziph{H2128}. And Saul{H7586} sought{H1245}{(H8762)} him every day{H3117}, but God{H430} delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} him not into his hand{H3027}."
1 Samuel,23,15,And David{H1732} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that Saul{H7586} was come out{H3318}{(H8804)} to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} his life{H5315}: and David{H1732} was in the wilderness{H4057} of Ziph{H2128} in a wood{H2793}.
1 Samuel,23,16,"And Jonathan{H3083} Saul's{H7586} son{H1121} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to David{H1732} into the wood{H2793}, and strengthened{H2388}{(H8762)} his hand{H3027} in God{H430}."
1 Samuel,23,17,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not: for the hand{H3027} of Saul{H7586} my father{H1} shall not find{H4672}{(H8799)} thee; and thou shalt be king{H4427}{(H8799)} over Israel{H3478}, and I shall be next{H4932} unto thee; and that also Saul{H7586} my father{H1} knoweth{H3045}{(H8802)}."
1 Samuel,23,18,"And they two{H8147} made{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}: and David{H1732} abode{H3427}{(H8799)} in the wood{H2793}, and Jonathan{H3083} went{H1980}{(H8804)} to his house{H1004}."
1 Samuel,23,19,"Then came up{H5927}{(H8799)} the Ziphites{H2130} to Saul{H7586} to Gibeah{H1390}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Doth not David{H1732} hide{H5641}{(H8693)} himself with us in strong holds{H4679} in the wood{H2793}, in the hill{H1389} of Hachilah{H2444}, which is on the south{H3225} of Jeshimon{H3452}?"
1 Samuel,23,20,"Now therefore, O king{H4428}, come down{H3381}{(H8798)} according to all the desire{H185} of thy soul{H5315} to come down{H3381}{(H8800)}; and our part shall be to deliver{H5462}{(H8687)} him into the king's{H4428} hand{H3027}."
1 Samuel,23,21,"And Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be ye of the LORD{H3068}; for ye have compassion{H2550}{(H8804)} on me."
1 Samuel,23,22,"Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, I pray you, prepare{H3559}{(H8685)} yet, and know{H3045}{(H8798)} and see{H7200}{(H8798)} his place{H4725} where his haunt{H7272} is, and who hath seen{H7200}{(H8804)} him there: for it is told{H559}{(H8804)} me that he dealeth very{H6191}{(H8800)} subtilly{H6191}{(H8686)}."
1 Samuel,23,23,"See{H7200}{(H8798)} therefore, and take knowledge{H3045}{(H8798)} of all the lurking places{H4224} where he hideth{H2244}{(H8691)} himself, and come ye again{H7725}{(H8804)} to me with the certainty{H3559}{(H8737)}, and I will go{H1980}{(H8804)} with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be{H3426} in the land{H776}, that I will search{H2664}{(H8765)} him out throughout all the thousands{H505} of Judah{H3063}."
1 Samuel,23,24,"And they arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Ziph{H2128} before{H6440} Saul{H7586}: but David{H1732} and his men{H582} were in the wilderness{H4057} of Maon{H4584}, in the plain{H6160} on the south{H3225} of Jeshimon{H3452}."
1 Samuel,23,25,"Saul{H7586} also and his men{H582} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} him. And they told{H5046}{(H8686)} David{H1732}: wherefore he came down{H3381}{(H8799)} into a rock{H5553}, and abode{H3427}{(H8799)} in the wilderness{H4057} of Maon{H4584}. And when Saul{H7586} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that, he pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} David{H1732} in the wilderness{H4057} of Maon{H4584}."
1 Samuel,23,26,"And Saul{H7586} went{H3212}{(H8799)} on this side{H6654} of the mountain{H2022}, and David{H1732} and his men{H582} on that side{H6654} of the mountain{H2022}: and David{H1732} made haste{H2648}{(H8737)} to get away{H3212}{(H8800)} for fear{H6440} of Saul{H7586}; for Saul{H7586} and his men{H582} compassed{H5849} David{H1732} and his men{H582} round about{H5849}{(H8802)} to take{H8610}{(H8800)} them."
1 Samuel,23,27,"But there came{H935}{(H8804)} a messenger{H4397} unto Saul{H7586}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Haste{H4116}{(H8761)} thee, and come{H3212}{(H8798)}; for the Philistines{H6430} have invaded{H6584}{(H8804)} the land{H776}."
1 Samuel,23,28,"Wherefore Saul{H7586} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} from pursuing{H7291}{(H8800)} after{H310} David{H1732}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} the Philistines{H6430}: therefore they called{H7121}{(H8804)} that place{H4725} Selahammahlekoth{H5555}."
1 Samuel,23,29,"And David{H1732} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} from thence, and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in strong holds{H4679} at Engedi{H5872}."
1 Samuel,24,1,"And it came to pass, when Saul{H7586} was returned{H7725}{(H8804)} from following{H310} the Philistines{H6430}, that it was told{H5046}{(H8686)} him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, David{H1732} is in the wilderness{H4057} of Engedi{H5872}."
1 Samuel,24,2,"Then Saul{H7586} took{H3947}{(H8799)} three{H7969} thousand{H505} chosen{H977}{(H8803)} men{H376} out of all Israel{H3478}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} David{H1732} and his men{H582} upon{H6440} the rocks{H6697} of the wild goats{H3277}."
1 Samuel,24,3,"And he came{H935}{(H8799)} to the sheepcotes{H1448}{H6629} by the way{H1870}, where was a cave{H4631}; and Saul{H7586} went in{H935}{(H8799)} to cover{H5526}{(H8687)} his feet{H7272}: and David{H1732} and his men{H582} remained{H3427}{(H8802)} in the sides{H3411} of the cave{H4631}."
1 Samuel,24,4,"And the men{H582} of David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Behold the day{H3117} of which the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8804)} unto thee, Behold, I will deliver{H5414}{(H8802)} thine enemy{H341}{(H8802)} into thine hand{H3027}, that thou mayest do{H6213}{(H8804)} to him as it shall seem good{H3190}{(H8799)} unto thee{H5869}. Then David{H1732} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and cut off{H3772}{(H8799)} the skirt{H3671} of Saul's{H7586} robe{H4598} privily{H3909}."
1 Samuel,24,5,"And it came to pass afterward{H310}, that David's{H1732} heart{H3820} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} him, because he had cut off{H3772}{(H8804)} Saul's{H7586} skirt{H3671}."
1 Samuel,24,6,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his men{H582}, The LORD{H3068} forbid{H2486} that I should do{H6213}{(H8799)} this thing{H1697} unto my master{H113}, the LORD'S{H3068} anointed{H4899}, to stretch forth{H7971}{(H8800)} mine hand{H3027} against him, seeing he is the anointed{H4899} of the LORD{H3068}."
1 Samuel,24,7,"So David{H1732} stayed{H8156}{(H8762)} his servants{H582} with these words{H1697}, and suffered{H5414}{(H8804)} them not to rise{H6965}{(H8800)} against Saul{H7586}. But Saul{H7586} rose up{H6965}{(H8804)} out of the cave{H4631}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} on his way{H1870}."
1 Samuel,24,8,"David{H1732} also arose{H6965}{(H8799)} afterward, and went out{H3318}{(H8799)} of the cave{H4631}, and cried{H7121}{(H8799)} after{H310} Saul{H7586}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, My lord{H113} the king{H4428}. And when Saul{H7586} looked{H5027}{(H8686)} behind{H310} him, David{H1732} stooped{H6915}{(H8799)} with his face{H639} to the earth{H776}, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} himself."
1 Samuel,24,9,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Saul{H7586}, Wherefore hearest{H8085}{(H8799)} thou men's{H120} words{H1697}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, David{H1732} seeketh{H1245}{(H8764)} thy hurt{H7451}?"
1 Samuel,24,10,"Behold, this day{H3117} thine eyes{H5869} have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} how that the LORD{H3068} had delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} thee to day{H3117} into mine hand{H3027} in the cave{H4631}: and some bade{H559}{(H8804)} me kill{H2026}{(H8800)} thee: but mine eye spared{H2347}{(H8799)} thee; and I said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will not put forth{H7971}{(H8799)} mine hand{H3027} against my lord{H113}; for he is the LORD'S{H3068} anointed{H4899}."
1 Samuel,24,11,"Moreover, my father{H1}, see{H7200}{(H8798)}, yea, see{H7200}{(H8798)} the skirt{H3671} of thy robe{H4598} in my hand{H3027}: for in that I cut off{H3772}{(H8800)} the skirt{H3671} of thy robe{H4598}, and killed{H2026}{(H8804)} thee not, know{H3045}{(H8798)} thou and see{H7200}{(H8798)} that there is neither evil{H7451} nor transgression{H6588} in mine hand{H3027}, and I have not sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against thee; yet thou huntest{H6658}{(H8802)} my soul{H5315} to take{H3947}{(H8800)} it."
1 Samuel,24,12,"The LORD{H3068} judge{H8199}{(H8799)} between me and thee, and the LORD{H3068} avenge{H5358}{(H8804)} me of thee: but mine hand{H3027} shall not be upon thee."
1 Samuel,24,13,"As saith{H559}{(H8799)} the proverb{H4912} of the ancients{H6931}, Wickedness{H7562} proceedeth{H3318}{(H8799)} from the wicked{H7563}: but mine hand{H3027} shall not be upon thee."
1 Samuel,24,14,"After{H310} whom is the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} come out{H3318}{(H8804)}? after{H310} whom dost thou pursue{H7291}{(H8802)}? after{H310} a dead{H4191}{(H8801)} dog{H3611}, after{H310} a{H259} flea{H6550}."
1 Samuel,24,15,"The LORD{H3068} therefore be judge{H1781}, and judge{H8199}{(H8804)} between me and thee, and see{H7200}{(H8799)}, and plead{H7378}{(H8799)} my cause{H7379}, and deliver{H8199}{(H8799)} me out of thine hand{H3027}."
1 Samuel,24,16,"And it came to pass, when David{H1732} had made an end{H3615}{(H8763)} of speaking{H1696}{(H8763)} these words{H1697} unto Saul{H7586}, that Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is this thy voice{H6963}, my son{H1121} David{H1732}? And Saul{H7586} lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} his voice{H6963}, and wept{H1058}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,24,17,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} to David{H1732}, Thou art more righteous{H6662} than I: for thou hast rewarded{H1580}{(H8804)} me good{H2896}, whereas I have rewarded{H1580}{(H8804)} thee evil{H7451}."
1 Samuel,24,18,"And thou hast shewed{H5046}{(H8689)} this day{H3117} how that thou hast dealt{H6213}{(H8804)} well{H2896} with me: forasmuch as when the LORD{H3068} had delivered{H5462}{(H8765)} me into thine hand{H3027}, thou killedst{H2026}{(H8804)} me not."
1 Samuel,24,19,"For if a man{H376} find{H4672}{(H8799)} his enemy{H341}{(H8802)}, will he let him go{H7971}{(H8765)} well{H2896} away{H1870}? wherefore the LORD{H3068} reward{H7999}{(H8762)} thee good{H2896} for that thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)} unto me this day{H3117}."
1 Samuel,24,20,"And now, behold, I know well{H3045}{(H8804)} that thou shalt surely{H4427}{(H8800)} be king{H4427}{(H8799)}, and that the kingdom{H4467} of Israel{H3478} shall be established{H6965}{(H8804)} in thine hand{H3027}."
1 Samuel,24,21,"Swear{H7650}{(H8734)} now therefore unto me by the LORD{H3068}, that thou wilt not{H518} cut off{H3772}{(H8686)} my seed{H2233} after{H310} me, and that thou wilt not destroy{H8045}{(H8686)} my name{H8034} out of my father's{H1} house{H1004}."
1 Samuel,24,22,And David{H1732} sware{H7650}{(H8735)} unto Saul{H7586}. And Saul{H7586} went{H3212}{(H8799)} home{H1004}; but David{H1732} and his men{H582} gat them up{H5927}{(H8804)} unto the hold{H4686}.
1 Samuel,25,1,"And Samuel{H8050} died{H4191}{(H8799)}; and all the Israelites{H3478} were gathered together{H6908}{(H8735)}, and lamented{H5594}{(H8799)} him, and buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him in his house{H1004} at Ramah{H7414}. And David{H1732} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went down{H3381}{(H8799)} to the wilderness{H4057} of Paran{H6290}."
1 Samuel,25,2,"And there was a man{H376} in Maon{H4584}, whose possessions{H4639} were in Carmel{H3760}; and the man{H376} was very{H3966} great{H1419}, and he had three{H7969} thousand{H505} sheep{H6629}, and a thousand{H505} goats{H5795}: and he was shearing{H1494}{(H8800)} his sheep{H6629} in Carmel{H3760}."
1 Samuel,25,3,"Now the name{H8034} of the man{H376} was Nabal{H5037}; and the name{H8034} of his wife{H802} Abigail{H26}: and she was a woman{H802} of good{H2896} understanding{H7922}, and of a beautiful{H3303} countenance{H8389}: but the man{H376} was churlish{H7186} and evil{H7451} in his doings{H4611}; and he was of the house of Caleb{H3614}."
1 Samuel,25,4,And David{H1732} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} in the wilderness{H4057} that Nabal{H5037} did shear{H1494}{(H8802)} his sheep{H6629}.
1 Samuel,25,5,"And David{H1732} sent out{H7971}{(H8799)} ten{H6235} young men{H5288}, and David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the young men{H5288}, Get you up{H5927}{(H8798)} to Carmel{H3760}, and go{H935}{(H8804)} to Nabal{H5037}, and greet{H7592}{(H8804)}{H7965} him in my name{H8034}:"
1 Samuel,25,6,"And thus shall ye say{H559}{(H8804)} to him that liveth{H2416} in prosperity, Peace{H7965} be both to thee, and peace{H7965} be to thine house{H1004}, and peace{H7965} be unto all that thou hast."
1 Samuel,25,7,"And now I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} that thou hast shearers{H1494}{(H8802)}: now thy shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)} which were with us, we hurt{H3637}{(H8689)} them not, neither was there ought{H3972} missing{H6485}{(H8738)} unto them, all the while{H3117} they were in Carmel{H3760}."
1 Samuel,25,8,"Ask{H7592}{(H8798)} thy young men{H5288}, and they will shew{H5046}{(H8686)} thee. Wherefore let the young men{H5288} find{H4672}{(H8799)} favour{H2580} in thine eyes{H5869}: for we come{H935}{(H8804)} in a good{H2896} day{H3117}: give{H5414}{(H8798)}, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh{H4672}{(H8799)} to thine hand{H3027} unto thy servants{H5650}, and to thy son{H1121} David{H1732}."
1 Samuel,25,9,"And when David's{H1732} young men{H5288} came{H935}{(H8799)}, they spake{H1696}{(H8762)} to Nabal{H5037} according to all those words{H1697} in the name{H8034} of David{H1732}, and ceased{H5117}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,25,10,"And Nabal{H5037} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} David's{H1732} servants{H5650}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who is David{H1732}? and who is the son{H1121} of Jesse{H3448}? there be many{H7231}{(H8804)} servants{H5650} now a days{H3117} that break away{H6555}{(H8693)} every man{H376} from{H6440} his master{H113}."
1 Samuel,25,11,"Shall I then take{H3947}{(H8804)} my bread{H3899}, and my water{H4325}, and my flesh{H2878} that I have killed{H2873}{(H8804)} for my shearers{H1494}{(H8802)}, and give{H5414}{(H8804)} it unto men{H582}, whom I know{H3045}{(H8804)} not whence they be?"
1 Samuel,25,12,"So David's{H1732} young men{H5288} turned{H2015}{(H8799)} their way{H1870}, and went again{H7725}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} and told{H5046}{(H8686)} him all those sayings{H1697}."
1 Samuel,25,13,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his men{H582}, Gird ye on{H2296}{(H8798)} every man{H376} his sword{H2719}. And they girded on{H2296}{(H8799)} every man{H376} his sword{H2719}; and David{H1732} also girded on{H2296}{(H8799)} his sword{H2719}: and there went up{H5927}{(H8799)} after{H310} David{H1732} about four{H702} hundred{H3967} men{H376}; and two hundred{H3967} abode{H3427}{(H8804)} by the stuff{H3627}."
1 Samuel,25,14,"But one{H259} of the young men{H5288} told{H5046}{(H8689)} Abigail{H26}, Nabal's{H5037} wife{H802}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, David{H1732} sent{H7971}{(H8804)} messengers{H4397} out of the wilderness{H4057} to salute{H1288}{(H8763)} our master{H113}; and he railed{H5860}{(H8799)} on them."
1 Samuel,25,15,"But the men{H582} were very{H3966} good{H2896} unto us, and we were not hurt{H3637}{(H8717)}, neither missed{H6485}{(H8804)} we any thing{H3972}, as long as{H3117} we were conversant{H1980}{(H8694)} with them, when we were in the fields{H7704}:"
1 Samuel,25,16,"They were a wall{H2346} unto us both by night{H3915} and day{H3119}, all the while{H3117} we were with them keeping{H7462}{(H8802)} the sheep{H6629}."
1 Samuel,25,17,"Now therefore know{H3045}{(H8798)} and consider{H7200}{(H8798)} what thou wilt do{H6213}{(H8799)}; for evil{H7451} is determined{H3615}{(H8804)} against our master{H113}, and against all his household{H1004}: for he is such a son{H1121} of Belial{H1100}, that a man cannot speak{H1696}{(H8763)} to him."
1 Samuel,25,18,"Then Abigail{H26} made haste{H4116}{(H8762)}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} two hundred{H3967} loaves{H3899}, and two{H8147} bottles{H5035} of wine{H3196}, and five{H2568} sheep{H6629} ready dressed{H6213}{(H8803)}, and five{H2568} measures{H5429} of parched{H7039} corn, and an hundred{H3967} clusters of raisins{H6778}, and two hundred{H3967} cakes{H1690} of figs, and laid{H7760}{(H8799)} them on asses{H2543}."
1 Samuel,25,19,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her servants{H5288}, Go on{H5674}{(H8798)} before{H6440} me; behold, I come{H935}{(H8802)} after{H310} you. But she told{H5046}{(H8689)} not her husband{H376} Nabal{H5037}."
1 Samuel,25,20,"And it was so, as she rode{H7392}{(H8802)} on the ass{H2543}, that she came down{H3381}{(H8802)} by the covert{H5643} of the hill{H2022}, and, behold, David{H1732} and his men{H582} came down{H3381}{(H8802)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} her; and she met{H6298}{(H8799)} them."
1 Samuel,25,21,"Now David{H1732} had said{H559}{(H8804)}, Surely in vain{H8267} have I kept{H8104}{(H8804)} all that this{H2088} fellow hath in the wilderness{H4057}, so that nothing{H3972} was missed{H6485}{(H8738)} of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited{H7725}{(H8686)} me evil{H7451} for good{H2896}."
1 Samuel,25,22,"So{H3541} and more{H3254}{(H8686)} also do{H6213}{(H8799)} God{H430} unto the enemies{H341}{(H8802)} of David{H1732}, if I leave{H7604}{(H8686)} of all that pertain to him by{H5704} the morning{H1242} light{H216} any that pisseth{H8366}{(H8688)} against the wall{H7023}."
1 Samuel,25,23,"And when Abigail{H26} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} David{H1732}, she hasted{H4116}{(H8762)}, and lighted off{H3381}{(H8799)} the ass{H2543}, and fell{H5307}{(H8799)} before{H639} David{H1732} on her face{H6440}, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} herself to the ground{H776},"
1 Samuel,25,24,"And fell{H5307}{(H8799)} at his feet{H7272}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Upon me, my lord{H113}, upon me let this iniquity{H5771} be: and let thine handmaid{H519}, I pray thee, speak{H1696}{(H8762)} in thine audience{H241}, and hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the words{H1697} of thine handmaid{H589}."
1 Samuel,25,25,"Let{H7760}{(H8799)} not my lord{H113}, I pray thee, regard{H3820} this man{H376} of Belial{H1100}, even Nabal{H5037}: for as his name{H8034} is, so is he; Nabal{H5037} is his name{H8034}, and folly{H5039} is with him: but I thine handmaid{H519} saw{H7200}{(H8804)} not the young men{H5288} of my lord{H113}, whom thou didst send{H7971}{(H8804)}."
1 Samuel,25,26,"Now therefore, my lord{H113}, as the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, and as thy soul{H5315} liveth{H2416}, seeing the LORD{H3068} hath withholden{H4513}{(H8804)} thee from coming{H935}{(H8800)} to shed blood{H1818}, and from avenging{H3467}{(H8687)} thyself with thine own hand{H3027}, now let thine enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, and they that seek{H1245}{(H8764)} evil{H7451} to my lord{H113}, be as Nabal{H5037}."
1 Samuel,25,27,"And now this blessing{H1293} which thine handmaid{H8198} hath brought{H935}{(H8689)} unto my lord{H113}, let it even be given{H5414}{(H8738)} unto the young men{H5288} that follow{H1980}{(H8693)}{H7272} my lord{H113}."
1 Samuel,25,28,"I pray thee, forgive{H5375}{(H8798)} the trespass{H6588} of thine handmaid{H519}: for the LORD{H3068} will certainly{H6213}{(H8800)} make{H6213}{(H8799)} my lord{H113} a sure{H539}{(H8737)} house{H1004}; because my lord{H113} fighteth{H3898}{(H8737)} the battles{H4421} of the LORD{H3068}, and evil{H7451} hath not been found{H4672}{(H8735)} in thee all thy days{H3117}."
1 Samuel,25,29,"Yet a man{H120} is risen{H6965}{(H8799)} to pursue{H7291}{(H8800)} thee, and to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} thy soul{H5315}: but the soul{H5315} of my lord{H113} shall be bound{H6887}{(H8803)} in the bundle{H6872} of life{H2416} with the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}; and the souls{H5315} of thine enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, them shall he sling out{H7049}{(H8762)}, as out of the middle{H8432}{H3709} of a sling{H7050}."
1 Samuel,25,30,"And it shall come to pass, when the LORD{H3068} shall have done{H6213}{(H8799)} to my lord{H113} according to all the good{H2896} that he hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} concerning thee, and shall have appointed{H6680}{(H8765)} thee ruler{H5057} over Israel{H3478};"
1 Samuel,25,31,"That this shall be no grief{H6330} unto thee, nor offence{H4383} of heart{H3820} unto my lord{H113}, either that thou hast shed{H8210}{(H8800)} blood{H1818} causeless{H2600}, or that my lord{H113} hath avenged{H3467}{(H8687)} himself: but when the LORD{H3068} shall have dealt well{H3190}{(H8689)} with my lord{H113}, then remember{H2142}{(H8804)} thine handmaid{H519}."
1 Samuel,25,32,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Abigail{H26}, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, which sent{H7971}{(H8804)} thee this day{H3117} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} me:"
1 Samuel,25,33,"And blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be thy advice{H2940}, and blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be thou, which hast kept{H3607}{(H8804)} me this day{H3117} from coming{H935}{(H8800)} to shed blood{H1818}, and from avenging{H3467}{(H8687)} myself with mine own hand{H3027}."
1 Samuel,25,34,"For in very deed{H199}, as the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} liveth{H2416}, which hath kept me back{H4513}{(H8804)} from hurting{H7489}{(H8687)} thee, except{H3884} thou hadst hasted{H4116}{(H8765)} and come{H935}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} me, surely there had not been left{H3498}{(H8738)} unto Nabal{H5037} by the morning{H1242} light{H216} any that pisseth{H8366}{(H8688)} against the wall{H7023}."
1 Samuel,25,35,"So David{H1732} received{H3947}{(H8799)} of her hand{H3027} that which she had brought{H935}{(H8689)} him, and said{H559}{(H8804)} unto her, Go up{H5927}{(H8798)} in peace{H7965} to thine house{H1004}; see{H7200}{(H8798)}, I have hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} to thy voice{H6963}, and have accepted{H5375}{(H8799)} thy person{H6440}."
1 Samuel,25,36,"And Abigail{H26} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Nabal{H5037}; and, behold, he held a feast{H4960} in his house{H1004}, like the feast{H4960} of a king{H4428}; and Nabal's{H5037} heart{H3820} was merry{H2896} within him, for he was very{H3966} drunken{H7910}: wherefore she told{H5046}{(H8689)} him nothing{H1697}, less{H6996} or more{H1419}, until the morning{H1242} light{H216}."
1 Samuel,25,37,"But it came to pass in the morning{H1242}, when the wine{H3196} was gone out{H3318}{(H8800)} of Nabal{H5037}, and his wife{H802} had told{H5046}{(H8686)} him these things{H1697}, that his heart{H3820} died{H4191}{(H8799)} within{H7130} him, and he became as a stone{H68}."
1 Samuel,25,38,"And it came to pass about ten{H6235} days{H3117} after, that the LORD{H3068} smote{H5062}{(H8799)} Nabal{H5037}, that he died{H4191}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,25,39,"And when David{H1732} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that Nabal{H5037} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be the LORD{H3068}, that hath pleaded{H7378}{(H8804)} the cause{H7379} of my reproach{H2781} from the hand{H3027} of Nabal{H5037}, and hath kept{H2820}{(H8804)} his servant{H5650} from evil{H7451}: for the LORD{H3068} hath returned{H7725}{(H8689)} the wickedness{H7451} of Nabal{H5037} upon his own head{H7218}. And David{H1732} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and communed{H1696}{(H8762)} with Abigail{H26}, to take{H3947}{(H8800)} her to him to wife{H802}."
1 Samuel,25,40,"And when the servants{H5650} of David{H1732} were come{H935}{(H8799)} to Abigail{H26} to Carmel{H3760}, they spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto her, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, David{H1732} sent{H7971}{(H8804)} us unto thee, to take{H3947}{(H8800)} thee to him to wife{H802}."
1 Samuel,25,41,"And she arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} herself on her face{H639} to the earth{H776}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, let thine handmaid{H519} be a servant{H8198} to wash{H7364}{(H8800)} the feet{H7272} of the servants{H5650} of my lord{H113}."
1 Samuel,25,42,"And Abigail{H26} hasted{H4116}{(H8762)}, and arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and rode{H7392}{(H8799)} upon an ass{H2543}, with five{H2568} damsels{H5291} of hers that went{H1980}{(H8802)} after{H7272} her; and she went{H3212}{(H8799)} after{H310} the messengers{H4397} of David{H1732}, and became his wife{H802}."
1 Samuel,25,43,David{H1732} also took{H3947}{(H8804)} Ahinoam{H293} of Jezreel{H3157}; and they were also both{H8147} of them his wives{H802}.
1 Samuel,25,44,"But Saul{H7586} had given{H5414}{(H8804)} Michal{H4324} his daughter{H1323}, David's{H1732} wife{H802}, to Phalti{H6406} the son{H1121} of Laish{H3919}, which was of Gallim{H1554}."
1 Samuel,26,1,"And the Ziphites{H2130} came{H935}{(H8799)} unto Saul{H7586} to Gibeah{H1390}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Doth not David{H1732} hide{H5641}{(H8693)} himself in the hill{H1389} of Hachilah{H2444}, which is before{H6440} Jeshimon{H3452}?"
1 Samuel,26,2,"Then Saul{H7586} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went down{H3381}{(H8799)} to the wilderness{H4057} of Ziph{H2128}, having three{H7969} thousand{H505} chosen{H977}{(H8803)} men{H376} of Israel{H3478} with him, to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} David{H1732} in the wilderness{H4057} of Ziph{H2128}."
1 Samuel,26,3,"And Saul{H7586} pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} in the hill{H1389} of Hachilah{H2444}, which is before{H6440} Jeshimon{H3452}, by the way{H1870}. But David{H1732} abode{H3427}{(H8802)} in the wilderness{H4057}, and he saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that Saul{H7586} came{H935}{(H8804)} after{H310} him into the wilderness{H4057}."
1 Samuel,26,4,"David{H1732} therefore sent out{H7971}{(H8799)} spies{H7270}{(H8764)}, and understood{H3045}{(H8799)} that Saul{H7586} was come{H935}{(H8804)} in very deed{H3559}{(H8737)}."
1 Samuel,26,5,"And David{H1732} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to the place{H4725} where Saul{H7586} had pitched{H2583}{(H8804)}: and David{H1732} beheld{H7200}{(H8799)} the place{H4725} where Saul{H7586} lay{H7901}{(H8804)}, and Abner{H74} the son{H1121} of Ner{H5369}, the captain{H8269} of his host{H6635}: and Saul{H7586} lay{H7901}{(H8802)} in the trench{H4570}, and the people{H5971} pitched{H2583}{(H8802)} round about{H5439} him."
1 Samuel,26,6,"Then answered{H6030}{(H8799)} David{H1732} and said{H559}{(H8799)} to Ahimelech{H288} the Hittite{H2850}, and to Abishai{H52} the son{H1121} of Zeruiah{H6870}, brother{H251} to Joab{H3097}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Who will go down{H3381}{(H8799)} with me to Saul{H7586} to the camp{H4264}? And Abishai{H52} said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will go down{H3381}{(H8799)} with thee."
1 Samuel,26,7,"So David{H1732} and Abishai{H52} came{H935}{(H8799)} to the people{H5971} by night{H3915}: and, behold, Saul{H7586} lay{H7901}{(H8802)} sleeping{H3463} within the trench{H4570}, and his spear{H2595} stuck{H4600}{(H8803)} in the ground{H776} at his bolster{H4763}: but Abner{H74} and the people{H5971} lay{H7901}{(H8802)} round about{H5439} him."
1 Samuel,26,8,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Abishai{H52} to David{H1732}, God{H430} hath delivered{H5462}{(H8765)} thine enemy{H341}{(H8802)} into thine hand{H3027} this day{H3117}: now therefore let me smite{H5221}{(H8686)} him, I pray thee, with the spear{H2595} even to the earth{H776} at once{H6471}{H259}, and I will not smite him the second time{H8138}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,26,9,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Abishai{H52}, Destroy{H7843}{(H8686)} him not: for who can stretch forth{H7971}{(H8804)} his hand{H3027} against the LORD'S{H3068} anointed{H4899}, and be guiltless{H5352}{(H8738)}?"
1 Samuel,26,10,"David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} furthermore, As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, the LORD{H3068} shall smite{H5062}{(H8799)} him; or his day{H3117} shall come{H935}{(H8799)} to die{H4191}{(H8804)}; or he shall descend{H3381}{(H8799)} into battle{H4421}, and perish{H5595}{(H8738)}."
1 Samuel,26,11,"The LORD{H3068} forbid{H2486} that I should stretch forth{H7971}{(H8800)} mine hand{H3027} against the LORD'S{H3068} anointed{H4899}: but, I pray thee, take{H3947}{(H8798)} thou now the spear{H2595} that is at his bolster{H4763}, and the cruse{H6835} of water{H4325}, and let us go{H3212}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,26,12,"So David{H1732} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the spear{H2595} and the cruse{H6835} of water{H4325} from Saul's{H7586} bolster{H7226}; and they gat them away{H3212}{(H8799)}, and no man saw{H7200}{(H8802)} it, nor knew{H3045}{(H8802)} it, neither awaked{H6974}{(H8688)}: for they were all asleep{H3463}; because a deep sleep{H8639} from the LORD{H3068} was fallen{H5307}{(H8804)} upon them."
1 Samuel,26,13,"Then David{H1732} went over{H5674}{(H8799)} to the other side{H5676}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} on the top{H7218} of an hill{H2022} afar off{H7350}; a great{H7227} space{H4725} being between them:"
1 Samuel,26,14,"And David{H1732} cried{H7121}{(H8799)} to the people{H5971}, and to Abner{H74} the son{H1121} of Ner{H5369}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Answerest{H6030}{(H8799)} thou not, Abner{H74}? Then Abner{H74} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who art thou that criest{H7121}{(H8804)} to the king{H4428}?"
1 Samuel,26,15,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Abner{H74}, Art not thou a valiant man{H376}? and who is like to thee in Israel{H3478}? wherefore then hast thou not kept{H8104}{(H8804)} thy lord{H113} the king{H4428}? for there came{H935}{(H8804)} one{H259} of the people{H5971} in to destroy{H7843}{(H8687)} the king{H4428} thy lord{H113}."
1 Samuel,26,16,"This thing{H1697} is not good{H2896} that thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)}. As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, ye are worthy{H1121} to die{H4194}, because ye have not kept{H8104}{(H8804)} your master{H113}, the LORD'S{H3068} anointed{H4899}. And now see{H7200}{(H8798)} where the king's{H4428} spear{H2595} is, and the cruse{H6835} of water{H4325} that was at his bolster{H4763}."
1 Samuel,26,17,"And Saul{H7586} knew{H5234}{(H8686)} David's{H1732} voice{H6963}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is this thy voice{H6963}, my son{H1121} David{H1732}? And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)}, It is my voice{H6963}, my lord{H113}, O king{H4428}."
1 Samuel,26,18,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Wherefore doth my lord{H113} thus pursue{H7291}{(H8802)} after{H310} his servant{H5650}? for what have I done{H6213}{(H8804)}? or what evil{H7451} is in mine hand{H3027}?"
1 Samuel,26,19,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord{H113} the king{H4428} hear{H8085}{(H8799)} the words{H1697} of his servant{H5650}. If the LORD{H3068} have stirred thee up{H5496}{(H8689)} against me, let him accept{H7306}{(H8686)} an offering{H4503}: but if they be the children{H1121} of men{H120}, cursed{H779}{(H8803)} be they before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}; for they have driven{H1644}{(H8765)} me out this day{H3117} from abiding{H5596}{(H8692)} in the inheritance{H5159} of the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, serve{H5647}{(H8798)} other{H312} gods{H430}."
1 Samuel,26,20,"Now therefore, let not my blood{H1818} fall{H5307}{(H8799)} to the earth{H776} before the face{H6440} of the LORD{H3068}: for the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} is come out{H3318}{(H8804)} to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} a{H259} flea{H6550}, as when one doth hunt{H7291}{(H8799)} a partridge{H7124} in the mountains{H2022}."
1 Samuel,26,21,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Saul{H7586}, I have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}: return{H7725}{(H8798)}, my son{H1121} David{H1732}: for I will no more do thee harm{H7489}{(H8686)}, because my soul{H5315} was precious{H3365}{(H8804)} in thine eyes{H5869} this day{H3117}: behold, I have played the fool{H5528}{(H8689)}, and have erred{H7686}{(H8799)} exceedingly{H7235}{(H8687)}{H3966}."
1 Samuel,26,22,"And David{H1732} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold the king's{H4428} spear{H2595}! and let one{H259} of the young men{H5288} come over{H5674}{(H8799)} and fetch{H3947}{(H8799)} it."
1 Samuel,26,23,"The LORD{H3068} render{H7725}{(H8686)} to every man{H376} his righteousness{H6666} and his faithfulness{H530}: for the LORD{H3068} delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} thee into my hand{H3027} to day{H3117}, but I would{H14}{(H8804)} not stretch forth{H7971}{(H8800)} mine hand{H3027} against the LORD'S{H3068} anointed{H4899}."
1 Samuel,26,24,"And, behold, as thy life{H5315} was much set by{H1431}{(H8804)} this day{H3117} in mine eyes{H5869}, so let my life{H5315} be much set by{H1431}{(H8799)} in the eyes{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, and let him deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} me out of all tribulation{H6869}."
1 Samuel,26,25,"Then Saul{H7586} said{H559}{(H8799)} to David{H1732}, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be thou, my son{H1121} David{H1732}: thou shalt both do{H6213}{(H8799)} great{H6213}{(H8800)} things, and also shalt still{H3201}{(H8800)} prevail{H3201}{(H8799)}. So David{H1732} went{H3212}{(H8799)} on his way{H1870}, and Saul{H7586} returned{H7725}{(H8804)} to his place{H4725}."
1 Samuel,27,1,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} in his heart{H3820}, I shall now perish{H5595}{(H8735)} one{H259} day{H3117} by the hand{H3027} of Saul{H7586}: there is nothing better{H2896} for me than that{H3588} I should speedily{H4422}{(H8736)} escape{H4422}{(H8735)} into the land{H776} of the Philistines{H6430}; and Saul{H7586} shall despair{H2976}{(H8738)} of me, to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} me any more in any coast{H1366} of Israel{H3478}: so shall I escape{H4422}{(H8738)} out of his hand{H3027}."
1 Samuel,27,2,"And David{H1732} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and he passed over{H5674}{(H8799)} with the six{H8337} hundred{H3967} men{H376} that were with him unto Achish{H397}, the son{H1121} of Maoch{H4582}, king{H4428} of Gath{H1661}."
1 Samuel,27,3,"And David{H1732} dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} with Achish{H397} at Gath{H1661}, he and his men{H582}, every man{H376} with his household{H1004}, even David{H1732} with his two{H8147} wives{H802}, Ahinoam{H293} the Jezreelitess{H3159}, and Abigail{H26} the Carmelitess{H3762}, Nabal's{H5037} wife{H802}."
1 Samuel,27,4,And it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} Saul{H7586} that David{H1732} was fled{H1272}{(H8804)} to Gath{H1661}: and he sought{H1245}{(H8763)} no more again{H3254}{(H8804)}{(H8675)}{H3254}{(H8686)} for him.
1 Samuel,27,5,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Achish{H397}, If I have now found{H4672}{(H8804)} grace{H2580} in thine eyes{H5869}, let them give{H5414}{(H8799)} me a place{H4725} in some{H259} town{H5892} in the country{H7704}, that I may dwell{H3427}{(H8799)} there: for why should thy servant{H5650} dwell{H3427}{(H8799)} in the royal{H4467} city{H5892} with thee?"
1 Samuel,27,6,Then Achish{H397} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him Ziklag{H6860} that day{H3117}: wherefore Ziklag{H6860} pertaineth unto the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063} unto this day{H3117}.
1 Samuel,27,7,And the time{H4557}{H3117} that David{H1732} dwelt{H3427}{(H8804)} in the country{H7704} of the Philistines{H6430} was a full year{H3117} and four{H702} months{H2320}.
1 Samuel,27,8,"And David{H1732} and his men{H582} went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and invaded{H6584}{(H8799)} the Geshurites{H1651}, and the Gezrites{H1511}, and the Amalekites{H6003}: for those{H2007} nations were of old{H5769} the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the land{H776}, as thou goest{H935}{(H8800)} to Shur{H7793}, even unto the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
1 Samuel,27,9,"And David{H1732} smote{H5221}{(H8689)} the land{H776}, and left neither man{H376} nor woman{H802} alive{H2421}{(H8762)}, and took away{H3947}{(H8804)} the sheep{H6629}, and the oxen{H1241}, and the asses{H2543}, and the camels{H1581}, and the apparel{H899}, and returned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Achish{H397}."
1 Samuel,27,10,"And Achish{H397} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Whither{H408} have ye made a road{H6584}{(H8804)} to day{H3117}? And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Against the south{H5045} of Judah{H3063}, and against the south{H5045} of the Jerahmeelites{H3397}, and against the south{H5045} of the Kenites{H7017}."
1 Samuel,27,11,"And David{H1732} saved{H2421}{(H8762)} neither man{H376} nor woman{H802} alive{H2421}{(H8762)}, to bring{H935}{(H8687)} tidings to Gath{H1661}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Lest they should tell{H5046}{(H8686)} on us, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, So did{H6213}{(H8804)} David{H1732}, and so will be his manner{H4941} all the while{H3117} he dwelleth{H3427}{(H8804)} in the country{H7704} of the Philistines{H6430}."
1 Samuel,27,12,"And Achish{H397} believed{H539}{(H8686)} David{H1732}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, He hath made his people{H5971} Israel{H3478} utterly{H887}{(H8687)} to abhor{H887}{(H8689)} him; therefore he shall be my servant{H5650} for ever{H5769}."
1 Samuel,28,1,"And it came to pass in those days{H3117}, that the Philistines{H6430} gathered{H6908} their armies{H4264} together{H6908}{(H8799)} for warfare{H6635}, to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} with Israel{H3478}. And Achish{H397} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, Know{H3045}{(H8799)} thou assuredly{H3045}{(H8800)}, that thou shalt go out{H3318}{(H8799)} with me to battle{H4264}, thou and thy men{H582}."
1 Samuel,28,2,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Achish{H397}, Surely{H3651} thou shalt know{H3045}{(H8799)} what thy servant{H5650} can do{H6213}{(H8799)}. And Achish{H397} said{H559}{(H8799)} to David{H1732}, Therefore will I make{H7760}{(H8799)} thee keeper{H8104}{(H8802)} of mine head{H7218} for ever{H3117}."
1 Samuel,28,3,"Now Samuel{H8050} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, and all Israel{H3478} had lamented{H5594}{(H8799)} him, and buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him in Ramah{H7414}, even in his own city{H5892}. And Saul{H7586} had put away{H5493}{(H8689)} those that had familiar spirits{H178}, and the wizards{H3049}, out of the land{H776}."
1 Samuel,28,4,"And the Philistines{H6430} gathered themselves together{H6908}{(H8735)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} in Shunem{H7766}: and Saul{H7586} gathered{H6908} all Israel{H3478} together{H6908}{(H8799)}, and they pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} in Gilboa{H1533}."
1 Samuel,28,5,"And when Saul{H7586} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the host{H4264} of the Philistines{H6430}, he was afraid{H3372}{(H8799)}, and his heart{H3820} greatly{H3966} trembled{H2729}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,28,6,"And when Saul{H7586} enquired{H7592}{(H8799)} of the LORD{H3068}, the LORD{H3068} answered{H6030}{(H8804)} him not, neither by dreams{H2472}, nor by Urim{H224}, nor by prophets{H5030}."
1 Samuel,28,7,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Saul{H7586} unto his servants{H5650}, Seek{H1245}{(H8761)} me a woman{H802} that hath{H1172} a familiar spirit{H178}, that I may go{H3212}{(H8799)} to her, and enquire{H1875}{(H8799)} of her. And his servants{H5650} said{H559}{(H8799)} to him, Behold, there is a woman{H802} that hath{H1172} a familiar spirit{H178} at Endor{H5874}."
1 Samuel,28,8,"And Saul{H7586} disguised{H2664}{(H8691)} himself, and put on{H3847}{(H8799)} other{H312} raiment{H899}, and he went{H3212}{(H8799)}, and two{H8147} men{H582} with him, and they came{H935}{(H8799)} to the woman{H802} by night{H3915}: and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I pray thee, divine{H7080}{(H8798)} unto me by the familiar spirit{H178}, and bring me him up{H5927}{(H8685)}, whom I shall name{H559}{(H8799)} unto thee."
1 Samuel,28,9,"And the woman{H802} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Behold, thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} what Saul{H7586} hath done{H6213}{(H8804)}, how he hath cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} those that have familiar spirits{H178}, and the wizards{H3049}, out of the land{H776}: wherefore then layest thou a snare{H5367}{(H8693)} for my life{H5315}, to cause me to die{H4191}{(H8687)}?"
1 Samuel,28,10,"And Saul{H7586} sware{H7650}{(H8735)} to her by the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, there shall{H518} no punishment{H5771} happen{H7136}{(H8799)} to thee for this thing{H1697}."
1 Samuel,28,11,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the woman{H802}, Whom shall I bring up{H5927}{(H8686)} unto thee? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Bring me up{H5927}{(H8685)} Samuel{H8050}."
1 Samuel,28,12,"And when the woman{H802} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} Samuel{H8050}, she cried{H2199}{(H8799)} with a loud{H1419} voice{H6963}: and the woman{H802} spake{H559}{(H8799)} to Saul{H7586}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Why hast thou deceived{H7411}{(H8765)} me? for thou art Saul{H7586}."
1 Samuel,28,13,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Be not afraid{H3372}{(H8799)}: for what sawest{H7200}{(H8804)} thou? And the woman{H802} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Saul{H7586}, I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} gods{H430} ascending{H5927}{(H8802)} out of the earth{H776}."
1 Samuel,28,14,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, What form{H8389} is he of? And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, An old{H2205} man{H376} cometh up{H5927}{(H8802)}; and he is covered{H5844}{(H8802)} with a mantle{H4598}. And Saul{H7586} perceived{H3045}{(H8799)} that it was Samuel{H8050}, and he stooped{H6915}{(H8799)} with his face{H639} to the ground{H776}, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} himself."
1 Samuel,28,15,"And Samuel{H8050} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Saul{H7586}, Why hast thou disquieted{H7264}{(H8689)} me, to bring me up{H5927}{(H8687)}? And Saul{H7586} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, I am sore{H3966} distressed{H6887}{(H8804)}; for the Philistines{H6430} make war{H3898}{(H8737)} against me, and God{H430} is departed{H5493}{(H8804)} from me, and answereth{H6030}{(H8804)} me no more, neither by{H3027} prophets{H5030}, nor by dreams{H2472}: therefore I have called{H7121}{(H8799)} thee, that thou mayest make known{H3045}{(H8687)} unto me what I shall do{H6213}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,28,16,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Samuel{H8050}, Wherefore then dost thou ask{H7592}{(H8799)} of me, seeing the LORD{H3068} is departed{H5493}{(H8804)} from thee, and is become thine enemy{H6145}?"
1 Samuel,28,17,"And the LORD{H3068} hath done{H6213}{(H8799)} to him, as he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} by me{H3027}: for the LORD{H3068} hath rent{H7167}{(H8799)} the kingdom{H4467} out of thine hand{H3027}, and given{H5414}{(H8799)} it to thy neighbour{H7453}, even to David{H1732}:"
1 Samuel,28,18,"Because{H834} thou obeyedst{H8085}{(H8804)} not the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068}, nor executedst{H6213}{(H8804)} his fierce{H2740} wrath{H639} upon Amalek{H6002}, therefore hath the LORD{H3068} done{H6213}{(H8804)} this thing{H1697} unto thee this day{H3117}."
1 Samuel,28,19,Moreover the LORD{H3068} will also deliver{H5414}{(H8799)} Israel{H3478} with thee into the hand{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430}: and to morrow{H4279} shalt thou and thy sons{H1121} be with me: the LORD{H3068} also shall deliver{H5414}{(H8799)} the host{H4264} of Israel{H3478} into the hand{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430}.
1 Samuel,28,20,"Then Saul{H7586} fell{H5307}{(H8799)} straightway{H4116}{(H8762)} all{H4393} along{H6967} on the earth{H776}, and was sore{H3966} afraid{H3372}{(H8799)}, because of the words{H1697} of Samuel{H8050}: and there was no strength{H3581} in him; for he had eaten{H398}{(H8804)} no bread{H3899} all the day{H3117}, nor all the night{H3915}."
1 Samuel,28,21,"And the woman{H802} came{H935}{(H8799)} unto Saul{H7586}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that he was sore{H3966} troubled{H926}{(H8738)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Behold, thine handmaid{H8198} hath obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} thy voice{H6963}, and I have put{H7760}{(H8799)} my life{H5315} in my hand{H3709}, and have hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} unto thy words{H1697} which thou spakest{H1696}{(H8765)} unto me."
1 Samuel,28,22,"Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken{H8085}{(H8798)} thou also unto the voice{H6963} of thine handmaid{H8198}, and let me set{H7760}{(H8799)} a morsel{H6595} of bread{H3899} before{H6440} thee; and eat{H398}{(H8798)}, that thou mayest have strength{H3581}, when thou goest{H3212}{(H8799)} on thy way{H1870}."
1 Samuel,28,23,"But he refused{H3985}{(H8762)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will not eat{H398}{(H8799)}. But his servants{H5650}, together with the woman{H802}, compelled{H6555}{(H8799)} him; and he hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} unto their voice{H6963}. So he arose{H6965}{(H8799)} from the earth{H776}, and sat{H3427}{(H8799)} upon the bed{H4296}."
1 Samuel,28,24,"And the woman{H802} had a fat{H4770} calf{H5695} in the house{H1004}; and she hasted{H4116}{(H8762)}, and killed{H2076}{(H8799)} it, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} flour{H7058}, and kneaded{H3888}{(H8799)} it, and did bake{H644}{(H8799)} unleavened bread{H4682} thereof:"
1 Samuel,28,25,"And she brought{H5066}{(H8686)} it before{H6440} Saul{H7586}, and before{H6440} his servants{H5650}; and they did eat{H398}{(H8799)}. Then they rose up{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went away{H3212}{(H8799)} that night{H3915}."
1 Samuel,29,1,Now the Philistines{H6430} gathered together{H6908}{(H8799)} all their armies{H4264} to Aphek{H663}: and the Israelites{H3478} pitched{H2583}{(H8802)} by a fountain{H5869} which is in Jezreel{H3157}.
1 Samuel,29,2,"And the lords{H5633} of the Philistines{H6430} passed on{H5674}{(H8802)} by hundreds{H3967}, and by thousands{H505}: but David{H1732} and his men{H582} passed on{H5674}{(H8802)} in the rereward{H314} with Achish{H397}."
1 Samuel,29,3,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the princes{H8269} of the Philistines{H6430}, What do these Hebrews{H5680} here? And Achish{H397} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the princes{H8269} of the Philistines{H6430}, Is not this David{H1732}, the servant{H5650} of Saul{H7586} the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, which hath been with me these days{H3117}, or these years{H8141}, and I have found{H4672}{(H8804)} no fault{H3972} in him since{H3117} he fell{H5307}{(H8800)} unto me unto this day{H3117}?"
1 Samuel,29,4,"And the princes{H8269} of the Philistines{H6430} were wroth{H7107}{(H8799)} with him; and the princes{H8269} of the Philistines{H6430} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Make{H7725} this fellow{H376} return{H7725}{(H8685)}, that he may go again{H7725}{(H8799)} to his place{H4725} which thou hast appointed{H6485}{(H8689)} him, and let him not go down{H3381}{(H8799)} with us to battle{H4421}, lest in the battle{H4421} he be an adversary{H7854} to us: for wherewith should he reconcile{H7521}{(H8691)} himself unto his master{H113}? should it not be with the heads{H7218} of these men{H582}?"
1 Samuel,29,5,"Is not this David{H1732}, of whom they sang{H6030}{(H8799)} one to another in dances{H4246}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Saul{H7586} slew{H5221}{(H8689)} his thousands{H505}, and David{H1732} his ten thousands{H7233}?"
1 Samuel,29,6,"Then Achish{H397} called{H7121}{(H8799)} David{H1732}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Surely, as the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, thou hast been upright{H3477}, and thy going out{H3318}{(H8800)} and thy coming in{H935}{(H8800)} with me in the host{H4264} is good{H2896} in my sight{H5869}: for I have not found{H4672}{(H8804)} evil{H7451} in thee since the day{H3117} of thy coming{H935}{(H8800)} unto me unto this day{H3117}: nevertheless the lords{H5633} favour{H2896} thee not{H5869}."
1 Samuel,29,7,"Wherefore now return{H7725}{(H8798)}, and go{H3212}{(H8798)} in peace{H7965}, that thou displease{H6213}{(H8799)}{H7451}{H5869} not the lords{H5633} of the Philistines{H6430}."
1 Samuel,29,8,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Achish{H397}, But what have I done{H6213}{(H8804)}? and what hast thou found{H4672}{(H8804)} in thy servant{H5650} so long as{H3117} I have been with thee{H6440} unto this day{H3117}, that I may not go{H935}{(H8799)} fight{H3898}{(H8738)} against the enemies{H341}{(H8802)} of my lord{H113} the king{H4428}?"
1 Samuel,29,9,"And Achish{H397} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} to David{H1732}, I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that thou art good{H2896} in my sight{H5869}, as an angel{H4397} of God{H430}: notwithstanding the princes{H8269} of the Philistines{H6430} have said{H559}{(H8804)}, He shall not go up{H5927}{(H8799)} with us to the battle{H4421}."
1 Samuel,29,10,"Wherefore now rise up early{H7925}{(H8685)} in the morning{H1242} with thy master's{H113} servants{H5650} that are come{H935}{(H8804)} with thee: and as soon as ye be up early{H7925}{(H8689)} in the morning{H1242}, and have light{H215}{(H8804)}, depart{H3212}{(H8798)}."
1 Samuel,29,11,"So David{H1732} and his men{H582} rose up early{H7925}{(H8686)} to depart{H3212}{(H8800)} in the morning{H1242}, to return{H7725}{(H8800)} into the land{H776} of the Philistines{H6430}. And the Philistines{H6430} went up{H5927}{(H8804)} to Jezreel{H3157}."
1 Samuel,30,1,"And it came to pass, when David{H1732} and his men{H582} were come{H935}{(H8800)} to Ziklag{H6860} on the third{H7992} day{H3117}, that the Amalekites{H6003} had invaded{H6584}{(H8804)} the south{H5045}, and Ziklag{H6860}, and smitten{H5221}{(H8686)} Ziklag{H6860}, and burned{H8313}{(H8799)} it with fire{H784};"
1 Samuel,30,2,"And had taken the women{H802} captives{H7617}{(H8799)}, that were therein: they slew{H4191}{(H8689)} not any{H376}, either great{H1419} or small{H6996}, but carried them away{H5090}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} on their way{H1870}."
1 Samuel,30,3,"So David{H1732} and his men{H582} came{H935}{(H8799)} to the city{H5892}, and, behold, it was burned{H8313}{(H8803)} with fire{H784}; and their wives{H802}, and their sons{H1121}, and their daughters{H1323}, were taken captives{H7617}{(H8738)}."
1 Samuel,30,4,"Then David{H1732} and the people{H5971} that were with him lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} their voice{H6963} and wept{H1058}{(H8799)}, until they had no more power{H3581} to weep{H1058}{(H8800)}."
1 Samuel,30,5,"And David's{H1732} two{H8147} wives{H802} were taken captives{H7617}{(H8738)}, Ahinoam{H293} the Jezreelitess{H3159}, and Abigail{H26} the wife{H802} of Nabal{H5037} the Carmelite{H3761}."
1 Samuel,30,6,"And David{H1732} was greatly{H3966} distressed{H3334}{(H8799)}; for the people{H5971} spake{H559}{(H8804)} of stoning{H5619}{(H8800)} him, because the soul{H5315} of all the people{H5971} was grieved{H4843}{(H8804)}, every man{H376} for his sons{H1121} and for his daughters{H1323}: but David{H1732} encouraged{H2388}{(H8691)} himself in the LORD{H3068} his God{H430}."
1 Samuel,30,7,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Abiathar{H54} the priest{H3548}, Ahimelech's{H288} son{H1121}, I pray thee, bring me hither{H5066}{(H8685)} the ephod{H646}. And Abiathar{H54} brought{H5066}{(H8686)} thither the ephod{H646} to David{H1732}."
1 Samuel,30,8,"And David{H1732} enquired{H7592}{(H8799)} at the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Shall I pursue{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} this troop{H1416}? shall I overtake{H5381}{(H8686)} them? And he answered{H559}{(H8799)} him, Pursue{H7291}{(H8798)}: for thou shalt surely{H5381}{(H8687)} overtake{H5381}{(H8686)} them, and without fail{H5337}{(H8687)} recover{H5337}{(H8686)} all."
1 Samuel,30,9,"So David{H1732} went{H3212}{(H8799)}, he and the six{H8337} hundred{H3967} men{H376} that were with him, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to the brook{H5158} Besor{H1308}, where those that were left behind{H3498}{(H8737)} stayed{H5975}{(H8804)}."
1 Samuel,30,10,"But David{H1732} pursued{H7291}{(H8799)}, he and four{H702} hundred{H3967} men{H376}: for two hundred{H3967} abode behind{H5975}{(H8799)}, which were so faint{H6296}{(H8765)} that they could not go over{H5674}{(H8800)} the brook{H5158} Besor{H1308}."
1 Samuel,30,11,"And they found{H4672}{(H8799)} an Egyptian{H376}{H4713} in the field{H7704}, and brought{H3947}{(H8799)} him to David{H1732}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him bread{H3899}, and he did eat{H398}{(H8799)}; and they made him drink{H8248}{(H8686)} water{H4325};"
1 Samuel,30,12,"And they gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him a piece{H6400} of a cake{H1690} of figs, and two{H8147} clusters of raisins{H6778}: and when he had eaten{H398}{(H8799)}, his spirit{H7307} came again{H7725}{(H8799)} to him: for he had eaten{H398}{(H8804)} no bread{H3899}, nor drunk{H8354}{(H8804)} any water{H4325}, three{H7969} days{H3117} and three{H7969} nights{H3915}."
1 Samuel,30,13,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I am a young man{H5288} of Egypt{H4713}, servant{H5650} to an Amalekite{H376}{H6003}; and my master{H113} left{H5800}{(H8799)} me, because three{H7969} days{H3117} agone I fell sick{H2470}{(H8804)}."
1 Samuel,30,14,"We made an invasion{H6584}{(H8804)} upon the south{H5045} of the Cherethites{H3774}, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah{H3063}, and upon the south{H5045} of Caleb{H3612}; and we burned{H8313}{(H8804)} Ziklag{H6860} with fire{H784}."
1 Samuel,30,15,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to him, Canst thou bring me down{H3381}{(H8686)} to this company{H1416}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Swear{H7650}{(H8734)} unto me by God{H430}, that thou wilt neither kill{H4191}{(H8686)} me, nor{H518} deliver{H5462}{(H8686)} me into the hands{H3027} of my master{H113}, and I will bring thee down{H3381}{(H8686)} to this company{H1416}."
1 Samuel,30,16,"And when he had brought him down{H3381}{(H8686)}, behold, they were spread abroad{H5203}{(H8803)} upon all{H6440} the earth{H776}, eating{H398}{(H8802)} and drinking{H8354}{(H8802)}, and dancing{H2287}{(H8802)}, because of all the great{H1419} spoil{H7998} that they had taken{H3947}{(H8804)} out of the land{H776} of the Philistines{H6430}, and out of the land{H776} of Judah{H3063}."
1 Samuel,30,17,"And David{H1732} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them from the twilight{H5399} even unto the evening{H6153} of the next day{H4283}: and there escaped{H4422}{(H8738)} not a man{H376} of them, save four{H702} hundred{H3967} young{H5288} men{H376}, which rode{H7392}{(H8804)} upon camels{H1581}, and fled{H5127}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,30,18,And David{H1732} recovered{H5337}{(H8686)} all that the Amalekites{H6002} had carried away{H3947}{(H8804)}: and David{H1732} rescued{H5337}{(H8689)} his two{H8147} wives{H802}.
1 Samuel,30,19,"And there was nothing lacking{H5737}{(H8738)} to them, neither{H4480} small{H6996} nor great{H1419}, neither sons{H1121} nor daughters{H1323}, neither spoil{H7998}, nor any thing that they had taken{H3947}{(H8804)} to them: David{H1732} recovered{H7725}{(H8689)} all."
1 Samuel,30,20,"And David{H1732} took{H3947}{(H8799)} all the flocks{H6629} and the herds{H1241}, which they drave{H5090}{(H8804)} before{H6440} those{H1931} other cattle{H4735}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, This is David's{H1732} spoil{H7998}."
1 Samuel,30,21,"And David{H1732} came{H935}{(H8799)} to the two hundred{H3967} men{H582}, which were so faint{H6296}{(H8765)} that they could not follow{H3212}{(H8800)}{H310} David{H1732}, whom they had made also to abide{H3427}{(H8686)} at the brook{H5158} Besor{H1308}: and they went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} David{H1732}, and to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} the people{H5971} that were with him: and when David{H1732} came near{H5066}{(H8799)} to the people{H5971}, he saluted{H7592}{(H8799)}{H7965} them."
1 Samuel,30,22,"Then answered{H6030}{(H8799)} all the wicked{H7451} men{H376} and men of Belial{H1100}, of those{H582} that went{H1980}{(H8804)} with David{H1732}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Because they went{H1980}{(H8804)} not with us, we will not give{H5414}{(H8799)} them ought of the spoil{H7998} that we have recovered{H5337}{(H8689)}, save to every man{H376} his wife{H802} and his children{H1121}, that they may lead them away{H5090}{(H8799)}, and depart{H3212}{(H8799)}."
1 Samuel,30,23,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} David{H1732}, Ye shall not do so{H6213}{(H8799)}, my brethren{H251}, with that which the LORD{H3068} hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} us, who hath preserved{H8104}{(H8799)} us, and delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} the company{H1416} that came{H935}{(H8802)} against us into our hand{H3027}."
1 Samuel,30,24,"For who will hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} unto you in this matter{H1697}? but as his part{H2506} is that goeth down{H3381}{(H8802)}{(H8675)}{H3381}{(H8717)} to the battle{H4421}, so shall his part{H2506} be that tarrieth{H3427}{(H8802)} by the stuff{H3627}: they shall part{H2505}{(H8799)} alike{H3162}."
1 Samuel,30,25,"And it was so from that day{H3117} forward{H4605}, that he made{H7760}{(H8799)} it a statute{H2706} and an ordinance{H4941} for Israel{H3478} unto this day{H3117}."
1 Samuel,30,26,"And when David{H1732} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Ziklag{H6860}, he sent{H7971}{(H8762)} of the spoil{H7998} unto the elders{H2205} of Judah{H3063}, even to his friends{H7453}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold a present{H1293} for you of the spoil{H7998} of the enemies{H341}{(H8802)} of the LORD{H3068};"
1 Samuel,30,27,"To them{H834} which were in Bethel{H1008}, and to them which were in south{H5045} Ramoth{H7418}, and to them which were in Jattir{H3492},"
1 Samuel,30,28,"And to them which were in Aroer{H6177}, and to them which were in Siphmoth{H8224}, and to them which were in Eshtemoa{H851},"
1 Samuel,30,29,"And to them which were in Rachal{H7403}, and to them which were in the cities{H5892} of the Jerahmeelites{H3397}, and to them which were in the cities{H5892} of the Kenites{H7017},"
1 Samuel,30,30,"And to them which were in Hormah{H2767}, and to them which were in Chorashan{H3565}, and to them which were in Athach{H6269},"
1 Samuel,30,31,"And to them which were in Hebron{H2275}, and to all the places{H4725} where David{H1732} himself and his men{H582} were wont to haunt{H1980}{(H8694)}."
1 Samuel,31,1,"Now the Philistines{H6430} fought{H3898}{(H8737)} against Israel{H3478}: and the men{H582} of Israel{H3478} fled{H5127}{(H8799)} from before{H6440} the Philistines{H6430}, and fell down{H5307}{(H8799)} slain{H2491} in mount{H2022} Gilboa{H1533}."
1 Samuel,31,2,"And the Philistines{H6430} followed hard{H1692}{(H8686)} upon Saul{H7586} and upon his sons{H1121}; and the Philistines{H6430} slew{H5221}{(H8686)} Jonathan{H3083}, and Abinadab{H41}, and Malchishua{H4444}, Saul's{H7586} sons{H1121}."
1 Samuel,31,3,"And the battle{H4421} went sore{H3513}{(H8799)} against Saul{H7586}, and the archers{H3384}{(H8688)}{H582}{H7198} hit{H4672}{(H8799)} him; and he was sore{H3966} wounded{H2342}{(H8799)} of the archers{H3384}{(H8688)}{H582}{H7198}."
1 Samuel,31,4,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Saul{H7586} unto his armourbearer{H5375}{(H8802)}{H3627}, Draw{H8025}{(H8798)} thy sword{H2719}, and thrust me through{H1856}{(H8798)} therewith; lest these uncircumcised{H6189} come{H935}{(H8799)} and thrust me through{H1856}{(H8804)}, and abuse{H5953}{(H8694)} me. But his armourbearer{H5375}{(H8802)}{H3627} would{H14}{(H8804)} not; for he was sore{H3966} afraid{H3372}{(H8804)}. Therefore Saul{H7586} took{H3947}{(H8799)} a sword{H2719}, and fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon it."
1 Samuel,31,5,"And when his armourbearer{H5375}{(H8802)}{H3627} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that Saul{H7586} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, he fell{H5307}{(H8799)} likewise upon his sword{H2719}, and died{H4191}{(H8799)} with him."
1 Samuel,31,6,"So Saul{H7586} died{H4191}{(H8799)}, and his three{H7969} sons{H1121}, and his armourbearer{H5375}{(H8802)}{H3627}, and all his men{H582}, that same day{H3117} together{H3162}."
1 Samuel,31,7,"And when the men{H582} of Israel{H3478} that were on the other side{H5676} of the valley{H6010}, and they that were on the other side{H5676} Jordan{H3383}, saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that the men{H582} of Israel{H3478} fled{H5127}{(H8804)}, and that Saul{H7586} and his sons{H1121} were dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, they forsook{H5800}{(H8799)} the cities{H5892}, and fled{H5127}{(H8799)}; and the Philistines{H6430} came{H935}{(H8799)} and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in them."
1 Samuel,31,8,"And it came to pass on the morrow{H4283}, when the Philistines{H6430} came{H935}{(H8799)} to strip{H6584}{(H8763)} the slain{H2491}, that they found{H4672}{(H8799)} Saul{H7586} and his three{H7969} sons{H1121} fallen{H5307}{(H8802)} in mount{H2022} Gilboa{H1533}."
1 Samuel,31,9,"And they cut off{H3772}{(H8799)} his head{H7218}, and stripped off{H6584}{(H8686)} his armour{H3627}, and sent{H7971}{(H8762)} into the land{H776} of the Philistines{H6430} round about{H5439}, to publish{H1319}{(H8763)} it in the house{H1004} of their idols{H6091}, and among the people{H5971}."
1 Samuel,31,10,And they put{H7760}{(H8799)} his armour{H3627} in the house{H1004} of Ashtaroth{H6252}{(H8677)}{H1045}: and they fastened{H8628}{(H8804)} his body{H1472} to the wall{H2346} of Bethshan{H1052}.
1 Samuel,31,11,And when the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jabeshgilead{H3003}{H1568} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} of that which the Philistines{H6430} had done{H6213}{(H8804)} to Saul{H7586};
1 Samuel,31,12,"All the valiant{H2428} men{H376}{(H8677)}{H381} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} all night{H3915}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} the body{H1472} of Saul{H7586} and the bodies{H1472} of his sons{H1121} from the wall{H2346} of Bethshan{H1052}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jabesh{H3003}, and burnt{H8313}{(H8799)} them there."
1 Samuel,31,13,"And they took{H3947}{(H8799)} their bones{H6106}, and buried{H6912}{(H8799)} them under a tree{H815} at Jabesh{H3003}, and fasted{H6684}{(H8799)} seven{H7651} days{H3117}."
2 Samuel,1,1,"Now it came to pass after{H310} the death{H4194} of Saul{H7586}, when David{H1732} was returned{H7725}{(H8804)} from the slaughter{H5221}{(H8687)} of the Amalekites{H6002}, and David{H1732} had abode{H3427}{(H8799)} two{H8147} days{H3117} in Ziklag{H6860};"
2 Samuel,1,2,"It came even to pass on the third{H7992} day{H3117}, that, behold, a man{H376} came{H935}{(H8802)} out of the camp{H4264} from Saul{H7586} with his clothes{H899} rent{H7167}{(H8803)}, and earth{H127} upon his head{H7218}: and so it was, when he came{H935}{(H8800)} to David{H1732}, that he fell{H5307}{(H8799)} to the earth{H776}, and did obeisance{H7812}{(H8691)}."
2 Samuel,1,3,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, From whence comest{H935}{(H8799)} thou? And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Out of the camp{H4264} of Israel{H3478} am I escaped{H4422}{(H8738)}."
2 Samuel,1,4,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, How{H4100} went the matter{H1697}? I pray thee, tell{H5046}{(H8685)} me. And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, That the people{H5971} are fled{H5127}{(H8804)} from the battle{H4421}, and many{H7235}{(H8687)} of the people{H5971} also are fallen{H5307}{(H8804)} and dead{H4191}{(H8799)}; and Saul{H7586} and Jonathan{H3083} his son{H1121} are dead{H4191}{(H8804)} also."
2 Samuel,1,5,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the young man{H5288} that told{H5046}{(H8688)} him, How knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} thou that Saul{H7586} and Jonathan{H3083} his son{H1121} be dead{H4191}{(H8804)}?"
2 Samuel,1,6,"And the young man{H5288} that told{H5046}{(H8688)} him said{H559}{(H8799)}, As I happened{H7136}{(H8738)} by chance{H7122}{(H8736)} upon mount{H2022} Gilboa{H1533}, behold, Saul{H7586} leaned{H8172}{(H8737)} upon his spear{H2595}; and, lo, the chariots{H7393} and horsemen{H1167}{H6571} followed hard{H1692}{(H8689)} after him."
2 Samuel,1,7,"And when he looked{H6437}{(H8799)} behind{H310} him, he saw{H7200}{(H8799)} me, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} unto me. And I answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Here am I."
2 Samuel,1,8,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Who art thou? And I answered{H559}{(H8799)} him, I am an Amalekite{H6003}."
2 Samuel,1,9,"He said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me again, Stand{H5975}{(H8798)}, I pray thee, upon me, and slay{H4191}{(H8786)} me: for anguish{H7661} is come{H270}{(H8804)} upon me, because my life{H5315} is yet whole in me."
2 Samuel,1,10,"So I stood{H5975}{(H8799)} upon him, and slew{H4191}{(H8787)} him, because I was sure{H3045}{(H8804)} that he could not live{H2421}{(H8799)} after{H310} that he was fallen{H5307}{(H8800)}: and I took{H3947}{(H8799)} the crown{H5145} that was upon his head{H7218}, and the bracelet{H685} that was on his arm{H2220}, and have brought{H935}{(H8686)} them hither unto my lord{H113}."
2 Samuel,1,11,"Then David{H1732} took hold{H2388}{(H8686)} on his clothes{H899}, and rent{H7167}{(H8799)} them; and likewise all the men{H582} that were with him:"
2 Samuel,1,12,"And they mourned{H5594}{(H8799)}, and wept{H1058}{(H8799)}, and fasted{H6684}{(H8799)} until even{H6153}, for Saul{H7586}, and for Jonathan{H3083} his son{H1121}, and for the people{H5971} of the LORD{H3068}, and for the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}; because they were fallen{H5307}{(H8804)} by the sword{H2719}."
2 Samuel,1,13,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the young man{H5288} that told{H5046}{(H8688)} him, Whence art thou? And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, I am the son{H1121} of a stranger{H376}{H1616}, an Amalekite{H6003}."
2 Samuel,1,14,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, How wast thou not afraid{H3372}{(H8804)} to stretch forth{H7971}{(H8800)} thine hand{H3027} to destroy{H7843}{(H8763)} the LORD'S{H3068} anointed{H4899}?"
2 Samuel,1,15,"And David{H1732} called{H7121}{(H8799)} one{H259} of the young men{H5288}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go near{H5066}{(H8798)}, and fall{H6293}{(H8798)} upon him. And he smote{H5221}{(H8686)} him that he died{H4191}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,1,16,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Thy blood{H1818} be upon thy head{H7218}; for thy mouth{H6310} hath testified{H6030}{(H8804)} against thee, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I have slain{H4191}{(H8790)} the LORD'S{H3068} anointed{H4899}."
2 Samuel,1,17,And David{H1732} lamented{H6969}{(H8787)} with this lamentation{H7015} over Saul{H7586} and over Jonathan{H3083} his son{H1121}:
2 Samuel,1,18,"(Also he bade{H559}{(H8799)} them teach{H3925}{(H8763)} the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} the use of the bow{H7198}: behold, it is written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of Jasher{H3477}.)"
2 Samuel,1,19,The beauty{H6643} of Israel{H3478} is slain{H2491} upon thy high places{H1116}: how are the mighty{H1368} fallen{H5307}{(H8804)}!
2 Samuel,1,20,"Tell{H5046}{(H8686)} it not in Gath{H1661}, publish{H1319}{(H8762)} it not in the streets{H2351} of Askelon{H831}; lest the daughters{H1323} of the Philistines{H6430} rejoice{H8055}{(H8799)}, lest the daughters{H1323} of the uncircumcised{H6189} triumph{H5937}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,1,21,"Ye mountains{H2022} of Gilboa{H1533}, let there be no dew{H2919}, neither let there be rain{H4306}, upon you, nor fields{H7704} of offerings{H8641}: for there the shield{H4043} of the mighty{H1368} is vilely cast away{H1602}{(H8738)}, the shield{H4043} of Saul{H7586}, as though he had not been anointed{H4899} with oil{H8081}."
2 Samuel,1,22,"From the blood{H1818} of the slain{H2491}, from the fat{H2459} of the mighty{H1368}, the bow{H7198} of Jonathan{H3083} turned{H7734}{(H8738)} not back{H268}, and the sword{H2719} of Saul{H7586} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} not empty{H7387}."
2 Samuel,1,23,"Saul{H7586} and Jonathan{H3083} were lovely{H157}{(H8737)} and pleasant{H5273} in their lives{H2416}, and in their death{H4194} they were not divided{H6504}{(H8738)}: they were swifter{H7043}{(H8804)} than eagles{H5404}, they were stronger{H1396}{(H8804)} than lions{H738}."
2 Samuel,1,24,"Ye daughters{H1323} of Israel{H3478}, weep over{H1058}{(H8798)} Saul{H7586}, who clothed{H3847}{(H8688)} you in scarlet{H8144}, with other delights{H5730}, who put{H5927}{(H8688)} on ornaments{H5716} of gold{H2091} upon your apparel{H3830}."
2 Samuel,1,25,"How are the mighty{H1368} fallen{H5307}{(H8804)} in the midst{H8432} of the battle{H4421}! O Jonathan{H3083}, thou wast slain{H2491} in thine high places{H1116}."
2 Samuel,1,26,"I am distressed{H6887}{(H8804)} for thee, my brother{H251} Jonathan{H3083}: very{H3966} pleasant{H5276}{(H8804)} hast thou been unto me: thy love{H160} to me was wonderful{H6381}{(H8738)}, passing the love{H160} of women{H802}."
2 Samuel,1,27,"How are the mighty{H1368} fallen{H5307}{(H8804)}, and the weapons{H3627} of war{H4421} perished{H6}{(H8799)}!"
2 Samuel,2,1,"And it came to pass after this{H310}, that David{H1732} enquired{H7592}{(H8799)} of the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Shall I go up{H5927}{(H8799)} into any{H259} of the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}? And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Go up{H5927}{(H8798)}. And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Whither shall I go up{H5927}{(H8799)}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Unto Hebron{H2275}."
2 Samuel,2,2,"So David{H1732} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} thither, and his two{H8147} wives{H802} also, Ahinoam{H293} the Jezreelitess{H3159}, and Abigail{H26} Nabal's{H5037} wife{H802} the Carmelite{H3761}."
2 Samuel,2,3,"And his men{H582} that were with him did David{H1732} bring up{H5927}{(H8689)}, every man{H376} with his household{H1004}: and they dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in the cities{H5892} of Hebron{H2275}."
2 Samuel,2,4,"And the men{H582} of Judah{H3063} came{H935}{(H8799)}, and there they anointed{H4886}{(H8799)} David{H1732} king{H4428} over the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}. And they told{H5046}{(H8686)} David{H1732}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, That the men{H582} of Jabeshgilead{H3003}{H1568} were they that buried{H6912}{(H8804)} Saul{H7586}."
2 Samuel,2,5,"And David{H1732} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} unto the men{H582} of Jabeshgilead{H3003}{H1568}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be ye of the LORD{H3068}, that ye have shewed{H6213}{(H8804)} this kindness{H2617} unto your lord{H113}, even unto Saul{H7586}, and have buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him."
2 Samuel,2,6,"And now the LORD{H3068} shew{H6213}{(H8799)} kindness{H2617} and truth{H571} unto you: and I also will requite{H6213}{(H8799)} you this kindness{H2896}, because ye have done{H6213}{(H8804)} this thing{H1697}."
2 Samuel,2,7,"Therefore now let your hands{H3027} be strengthened{H2388}{(H8799)}, and be ye valiant{H1121}{H2428}: for your master{H113} Saul{H7586} is dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, and also the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063} have anointed{H4886}{(H8804)} me king{H4428} over them."
2 Samuel,2,8,"But Abner{H74} the son{H1121} of Ner{H5369}, captain{H8269} of Saul's{H7586} host{H6635}, took{H3947}{(H8804)} Ishbosheth{H378} the son{H1121} of Saul{H7586}, and brought him over{H5674}{(H8686)} to Mahanaim{H4266};"
2 Samuel,2,9,"And made him king{H4427}{(H8686)} over Gilead{H1568}, and over the Ashurites{H805}, and over Jezreel{H3157}, and over Ephraim{H669}, and over Benjamin{H1144}, and over all Israel{H3478}."
2 Samuel,2,10,"Ishbosheth{H378} Saul's{H7586} son{H1121} was forty{H705} years{H8141} old{H1121} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)} over Israel{H3478}, and reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} two{H8147} years{H8141}. But the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063} followed{H310} David{H1732}."
2 Samuel,2,11,And the time{H4557}{H3117} that David{H1732} was king{H4428} in Hebron{H2275} over the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063} was seven{H7651} years{H8141} and six{H8337} months{H2320}.
2 Samuel,2,12,"And Abner{H74} the son{H1121} of Ner{H5369}, and the servants{H5650} of Ishbosheth{H378} the son{H1121} of Saul{H7586}, went out{H3318}{(H8799)} from Mahanaim{H4266} to Gibeon{H1391}."
2 Samuel,2,13,"And Joab{H3097} the son{H1121} of Zeruiah{H6870}, and the servants{H5650} of David{H1732}, went out{H3318}{(H8804)}, and met{H6298}{(H8799)} together{H3162} by the pool{H1295} of Gibeon{H1391}: and they sat down{H3427}{(H8799)}, the one on the one side of the pool{H1295}, and the other on the other side of the pool{H1295}."
2 Samuel,2,14,"And Abner{H74} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Joab{H3097}, Let the young men{H5288} now arise{H6965}{(H8799)}, and play{H7832}{(H8762)} before{H6440} us. And Joab{H3097} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let them arise{H6965}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,2,15,"Then there arose{H6965}{(H8799)} and went over{H5674}{(H8799)} by number{H4557} twelve{H8147}{H6240} of Benjamin{H1144}, which pertained to Ishbosheth{H378} the son{H1121} of Saul{H7586}, and twelve{H8147}{H6240} of the servants{H5650} of David{H1732}."
2 Samuel,2,16,"And they caught{H2388}{(H8686)} every one{H376} his fellow{H7453} by the head{H7218}, and thrust his sword{H2719} in his fellow's{H7453} side{H6654}; so they fell down{H5307}{(H8799)} together{H3162}: wherefore that place{H4725} was called{H7121}{(H8799)} Helkathhazzurim{H2521}, which is in Gibeon{H1391}."
2 Samuel,2,17,"And there was a very{H3966} sore{H7186} battle{H4421} that day{H3117}; and Abner{H74} was beaten{H5062}{(H8735)}, and the men{H582} of Israel{H3478}, before{H6440} the servants{H5650} of David{H1732}."
2 Samuel,2,18,"And there were three{H7969} sons{H1121} of Zeruiah{H6870} there, Joab{H3097}, and Abishai{H52}, and Asahel{H6214}: and Asahel{H6214} was as light{H7031} of foot{H7272} as a{H259} wild{H7704} roe{H6643}."
2 Samuel,2,19,And Asahel{H6214} pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} Abner{H74}; and in going{H3212}{(H8800)} he turned{H5186}{(H8804)} not to the right hand{H3225} nor to the left{H8040} from following{H310} Abner{H74}.
2 Samuel,2,20,"Then Abner{H74} looked{H6437}{(H8799)} behind{H310} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Art thou Asahel{H6214}? And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, I am."
2 Samuel,2,21,"And Abner{H74} said{H559}{(H8799)} to him, Turn thee aside{H5186}{(H8798)} to thy right hand{H3225} or to thy left{H8040}, and lay thee hold{H270}{(H8798)} on one{H259} of the young men{H5288}, and take{H3947}{(H8798)} thee his armour{H2488}. But Asahel{H6214} would{H14}{(H8804)} not turn aside{H5493}{(H8800)} from following{H310} of him."
2 Samuel,2,22,"And Abner{H74} said{H559}{(H8800)} again{H3254}{(H8686)} to Asahel{H6214}, Turn thee aside{H5493}{(H8798)} from following{H310} me: wherefore should I smite{H5221}{(H8686)} thee to the ground{H776}? how then should I hold up{H5375}{(H8799)} my face{H6440} to Joab{H3097} thy brother{H251}?"
2 Samuel,2,23,"Howbeit he refused{H3985}{(H8762)} to turn aside{H5493}{(H8800)}: wherefore Abner{H74} with the hinder end{H310} of the spear{H2595} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} him under{H413} the fifth{H2570} rib, that the spear{H2595} came out{H3318}{(H8799)} behind{H310} him; and he fell down{H5307}{(H8799)} there, and died{H4191}{(H8799)} in the same place{H8478}: and it came to pass, that as many as came{H935}{(H8802)} to the place{H4725} where Asahel{H6214} fell down{H5307}{(H8804)} and died{H4191}{(H8799)} stood still{H5975}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,2,24,"Joab{H3097} also and Abishai{H52} pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} Abner{H74}: and the sun{H8121} went down{H935}{(H8804)} when they were come{H935}{(H8804)} to the hill{H1389} of Ammah{H522}, that lieth before{H6440} Giah{H1520} by the way{H1870} of the wilderness{H4057} of Gibeon{H1391}."
2 Samuel,2,25,"And the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144} gathered themselves together{H6908}{(H8691)} after{H310} Abner{H74}, and became one{H259} troop{H92}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} on the top{H7218} of an hill{H1389}."
2 Samuel,2,26,"Then Abner{H74} called{H7121}{(H8799)} to Joab{H3097}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Shall the sword{H2719} devour{H398}{(H8799)} for ever{H5331}? knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} thou not that it will be bitterness{H4751} in the latter end{H314}? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid{H559}{(H8799)} the people{H5971} return{H7725}{(H8800)} from following{H310} their brethren{H251}?"
2 Samuel,2,27,"And Joab{H3097} said{H559}{(H8799)}, As God{H430} liveth{H2416}, unless{H3884} thou hadst spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}, surely then in the morning{H1242} the people{H5971} had gone up{H5927}{(H8738)} every one{H376} from following{H310} his brother{H251}."
2 Samuel,2,28,"So Joab{H3097} blew{H8628}{(H8799)} a trumpet{H7782}, and all the people{H5971} stood still{H5975}{(H8799)}, and pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} Israel{H3478} no more, neither fought{H3898}{(H8736)} they any more{H3254}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,2,29,"And Abner{H74} and his men{H582} walked{H1980}{(H8804)} all that night{H3915} through the plain{H6160}, and passed over{H5674}{(H8799)} Jordan{H3383}, and went through{H3212}{(H8799)} all Bithron{H1338}, and they came{H935}{(H8799)} to Mahanaim{H4266}."
2 Samuel,2,30,"And Joab{H3097} returned{H7725}{(H8804)} from following{H310} Abner{H74}: and when he had gathered{H6908} all the people{H5971} together{H6908}{(H8799)}, there lacked{H6485}{(H8735)} of David's{H1732} servants{H5650} nineteen{H8672}{H6240} men{H376} and Asahel{H6214}."
2 Samuel,2,31,"But the servants{H5650} of David{H1732} had smitten{H5221}{(H8689)} of Benjamin{H1144}, and of Abner's{H74} men{H582}, so that three{H7969} hundred{H3967} and threescore{H8346} men{H376} died{H4191}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,2,32,"And they took up{H5375}{(H8799)} Asahel{H6214}, and buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him in the sepulchre{H6913} of his father{H1}, which was in Bethlehem{H1035}. And Joab{H3097} and his men{H582} went{H3212}{(H8799)} all night{H3915}, and they came to Hebron{H2275} at break of day{H215}{(H8735)}."
2 Samuel,3,1,"Now there was long{H752} war{H4421} between the house{H1004} of Saul{H7586} and the house{H1004} of David{H1732}: but David{H1732} waxed{H1980}{(H8802)} stronger{H2390} and stronger{H2390}, and the house{H1004} of Saul{H7586} waxed{H1980}{(H8802)} weaker{H1800} and weaker{H1800}."
2 Samuel,3,2,"And unto David{H1732} were sons{H1121} born{H3205}{(H8735)}{(H8675)}{H3205}{(H8795)} in Hebron{H2275}: and his firstborn{H1060} was Amnon{H550}, of Ahinoam{H293} the Jezreelitess{H3159};"
2 Samuel,3,3,"And his second{H4932}, Chileab{H3609}, of Abigail{H26} the wife{H802} of Nabal{H5037} the Carmelite{H3761}; and the third{H7992}, Absalom{H53} the son{H1121} of Maacah{H4601} the daughter{H1323} of Talmai{H8526} king{H4428} of Geshur{H1650};"
2 Samuel,3,4,"And the fourth{H7243}, Adonijah{H138} the son{H1121} of Haggith{H2294}; and the fifth{H2549}, Shephatiah{H8203} the son{H1121} of Abital{H37};"
2 Samuel,3,5,"And the sixth{H8345}, Ithream{H3507}, by Eglah{H5698} David's{H1732} wife{H802}. These were born{H3205}{(H8795)} to David{H1732} in Hebron{H2275}."
2 Samuel,3,6,"And it came to pass, while there was war{H4421} between the house{H1004} of Saul{H7586} and the house{H1004} of David{H1732}, that Abner{H74} made himself strong{H2388}{(H8693)} for the house{H1004} of Saul{H7586}."
2 Samuel,3,7,"And Saul{H7586} had a concubine{H6370}, whose name{H8034} was Rizpah{H7532}, the daughter{H1323} of Aiah{H345}: and Ishbosheth said{H559}{(H8799)} to Abner{H74}, Wherefore hast thou gone in{H935}{(H8804)} unto my father's{H1} concubine{H6370}?"
2 Samuel,3,8,"Then was Abner{H74} very{H3966} wroth{H2734}{(H8799)} for the words{H1697} of Ishbosheth{H378}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Am I a dog's{H3611} head{H7218}, which against Judah{H3063} do shew{H6213}{(H8799)} kindness{H2617} this day{H3117} unto the house{H1004} of Saul{H7586} thy father{H1}, to his brethren{H251}, and to his friends{H4828}, and have not delivered{H4672}{(H8689)} thee into the hand{H3027} of David{H1732}, that thou chargest{H6485}{(H8799)} me to day{H3117} with a fault{H5771} concerning this woman{H802}?"
2 Samuel,3,9,"So do{H6213}{(H8799)} God{H430} to Abner{H74}, and more also{H3254}{(H8686)}, except, as the LORD{H3068} hath sworn{H7650}{(H8738)} to David{H1732}, even so I do{H6213}{(H8799)} to him;"
2 Samuel,3,10,"To translate{H5674}{(H8687)} the kingdom{H4467} from the house{H1004} of Saul{H7586}, and to set up{H6965}{(H8687)} the throne{H3678} of David{H1732} over Israel{H3478} and over Judah{H3063}, from Dan{H1835} even to Beersheba{H884}."
2 Samuel,3,11,"And he could{H3201}{(H8804)} not answer{H7725}{(H8687)} Abner{H74} a word{H1697} again, because he feared{H3372}{(H8800)} him."
2 Samuel,3,12,"And Abner{H74} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} to David{H1732} on his behalf, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Whose is the land{H776}? saying{H559}{(H8800)} also, Make{H3772}{(H8798)} thy league{H1285} with me, and, behold, my hand{H3027} shall be with thee, to bring about{H5437}{(H8687)} all Israel{H3478} unto thee."
2 Samuel,3,13,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Well{H2896}; I will make{H3772}{(H8799)} a league{H1285} with thee: but one{H259} thing{H1697} I require{H7592}{(H8802)} of thee, that is{H559}{(H8800)}, Thou shalt not see{H7200}{(H8799)} my face{H6440}, except thou first{H6440} bring{H935}{(H8687)} Michal{H4324} Saul's{H7586} daughter{H1323}, when thou comest{H935}{(H8800)} to see{H7200}{(H8800)} my face{H6440}."
2 Samuel,3,14,"And David{H1732} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} to Ishbosheth{H378} Saul's{H7586} son{H1121}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Deliver{H5414}{(H8798)} me my wife{H802} Michal{H4324}, which I espoused{H781}{(H8765)} to me for an hundred{H3967} foreskins{H6190} of the Philistines{H6430}."
2 Samuel,3,15,"And Ishbosheth{H378} sent{H7971}{(H8799)}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} her from her husband{H376}, even from Phaltiel{H6409} the son{H1121} of Laish{H3889}{(H8675)}{H3919}."
2 Samuel,3,16,"And her husband{H376} went{H3212}{(H8799)} with her along weeping{H1980}{(H8800)}{H1058}{(H8800)} behind{H310} her to Bahurim{H980}. Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Abner{H74} unto him, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, return{H7725}{(H8798)}. And he returned{H7725}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,3,17,"And Abner{H74} had communication{H1961}{(H8804)}{H1697} with the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Ye sought{H1245}{(H8764)} for David{H1732} in times{H8543} past{H8032} to be king{H4428} over you:"
2 Samuel,3,18,"Now then do{H6213}{(H8798)} it: for the LORD{H3068} hath spoken{H559}{(H8804)} of David{H1732}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, By the hand{H3027} of my servant{H5650} David{H1732} I will save{H3467}{(H8687)} my people{H5971} Israel{H3478} out of the hand{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430}, and out of the hand{H3027} of all their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}."
2 Samuel,3,19,"And Abner{H74} also spake{H1696}{(H8762)} in the ears{H241} of Benjamin{H1144}: and Abner{H74} went{H3212}{(H8799)} also to speak{H1696}{(H8763)} in the ears{H241} of David{H1732} in Hebron{H2275} all that seemed{H5869} good{H2896} to Israel{H3478}, and that seemed good{H5869} to the whole house{H1004} of Benjamin{H1144}."
2 Samuel,3,20,"So Abner{H74} came{H935}{(H8799)} to David{H1732} to Hebron{H2275}, and twenty{H6242} men{H582} with him. And David{H1732} made{H6213}{(H8799)} Abner{H74} and the men{H582} that were with him a feast{H4960}."
2 Samuel,3,21,"And Abner{H74} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, I will arise{H6965}{(H8799)} and go{H3212}{(H8799)}, and will gather{H6908}{(H8799)} all Israel{H3478} unto my lord{H113} the king{H4428}, that they may make{H3772}{(H8799)} a league{H1285} with thee, and that thou mayest reign{H4427}{(H8804)} over all that thine heart{H5315} desireth{H183}{(H8762)}. And David{H1732} sent{H7971} Abner{H74} away{H7971}{(H8762)}; and he went{H3212}{(H8799)} in peace{H7965}."
2 Samuel,3,22,"And, behold, the servants{H5650} of David{H1732} and Joab{H3097} came{H935}{(H8802)} from pursuing a troop{H1416}, and brought in{H935}{(H8689)} a great{H7227} spoil{H7998} with them: but Abner{H74} was not with David{H1732} in Hebron{H2275}; for he had sent him away{H7971}{(H8765)}, and he was gone{H3212}{(H8799)} in peace{H7965}."
2 Samuel,3,23,"When Joab{H3097} and all the host{H6635} that was with him were come{H935}{(H8804)}, they told{H5046}{(H8686)} Joab{H3097}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Abner{H74} the son{H1121} of Ner{H5369} came{H935}{(H8804)} to the king{H4428}, and he hath sent him away{H7971}{(H8762)}, and he is gone{H3212}{(H8799)} in peace{H7965}."
2 Samuel,3,24,"Then Joab{H3097} came{H935}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, What hast thou done{H6213}{(H8804)}? behold, Abner{H74} came{H935}{(H8802)} unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away{H7971}{(H8765)}, and he is quite{H1980}{(H8800)} gone{H3212}{(H8799)}?"
2 Samuel,3,25,"Thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} Abner{H74} the son{H1121} of Ner{H5369}, that he came{H935}{(H8804)} to deceive{H6601}{(H8763)} thee, and to know{H3045}{(H8800)} thy going out{H4161} and thy coming in{H4126}{(H8675)}{H3996}, and to know{H3045}{(H8800)} all that thou doest{H6213}{(H8802)}."
2 Samuel,3,26,"And when Joab{H3097} was come out{H3318}{(H8799)} from David{H1732}, he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} after{H310} Abner{H74}, which brought him again{H7725}{(H8686)} from the well{H953} of Sirah{H5626}: but David{H1732} knew{H3045}{(H8804)} it not."
2 Samuel,3,27,"And when Abner{H74} was returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to Hebron{H2275}, Joab{H3097} took him aside{H5186}{(H8686)} in{H413}{H8432} the gate{H8179} to speak{H1696}{(H8763)} with him quietly{H7987}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} him there under the fifth{H2570} rib, that he died{H4191}{(H8799)}, for the blood{H1818} of Asahel{H6214} his brother{H251}."
2 Samuel,3,28,"And afterward{H310} when David{H1732} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} it, he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I and my kingdom{H4467} are guiltless{H5355} before the LORD{H3068} for{H5704} ever{H5769} from the blood{H1818} of Abner{H74} the son{H1121} of Ner{H5369}:"
2 Samuel,3,29,"Let it rest{H2342}{(H8799)} on the head{H7218} of Joab{H3097}, and on all his father's{H1} house{H1004}; and let there not fail{H3772}{(H8735)} from the house{H1004} of Joab{H3097} one that hath an issue{H2100}{(H8802)}, or that is a leper{H6879}{(H8794)}, or that leaneth{H2388}{(H8688)} on a staff{H6418}, or that falleth{H5307}{(H8802)} on the sword{H2719}, or that lacketh{H2638} bread{H3899}."
2 Samuel,3,30,"So Joab{H3097} and Abishai{H52} his brother{H251} slew{H2026}{(H8804)} Abner{H74}, because he had slain{H4191}{(H8689)} their brother{H251} Asahel{H6214} at Gibeon{H1391} in the battle{H4421}."
2 Samuel,3,31,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Joab{H3097}, and to all the people{H5971} that were with him, Rend{H7167}{(H8798)} your clothes{H899}, and gird{H2296}{(H8798)} you with sackcloth{H8242}, and mourn{H5594}{(H8798)} before{H6440} Abner{H74}. And king{H4428} David{H1732} himself followed{H1980}{(H8802)}{H310} the bier{H4296}."
2 Samuel,3,32,"And they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} Abner{H74} in Hebron{H2275}: and the king{H4428} lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} his voice{H6963}, and wept{H1058}{(H8799)} at the grave{H6913} of Abner{H74}; and all the people{H5971} wept{H1058}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,3,33,"And the king{H4428} lamented{H6969}{(H8787)} over Abner{H74}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Died{H4191}{(H8799)} Abner{H74} as a fool{H5036} dieth{H4194}?"
2 Samuel,3,34,"Thy hands{H3027} were not bound{H631}{(H8803)}, nor thy feet{H7272} put{H5066}{(H8717)} into fetters{H5178}: as a man falleth{H5307}{(H8800)} before{H6440} wicked{H5766} men{H1121}, so fellest{H5307}{(H8804)} thou. And all the people{H5971} wept{H1058}{(H8800)} again{H3254}{(H8686)} over him."
2 Samuel,3,35,"And when all{H3605} the people{H5971} came{H935}{(H8799)} to cause{H1262} David{H1732} to eat{H1262}{(H8687)} meat{H3899} while it was yet{H5750} day{H3117}, David{H1732} sware{H7650}{(H8735)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, So do{H6213}{(H8799)} God{H430} to me, and more also{H3254}{(H8686)}, if I taste{H2938}{(H8799)} bread{H3899}, or ought{H3972} else, till{H6440} the sun{H8121} be down{H935}{(H8800)}."
2 Samuel,3,36,"And all the people{H5971} took notice{H5234}{(H8689)} of it, and it pleased{H3190}{(H8799)}{H5869} them: as whatsoever the king{H4428} did{H6213}{(H8804)} pleased{H5869}{H2896} all the people{H5971}."
2 Samuel,3,37,For all the people{H5971} and all Israel{H3478} understood{H3045}{(H8799)} that day{H3117} that it was not of the king{H4428} to slay{H4191}{(H8687)} Abner{H74} the son{H1121} of Ner{H5369}.
2 Samuel,3,38,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his servants{H5650}, Know{H3045}{(H8799)} ye not that there is a prince{H8269} and a great man{H1419} fallen{H5307}{(H8804)} this day{H3117} in Israel{H3478}?"
2 Samuel,3,39,"And I am this day{H3117} weak{H7390}, though anointed{H4886}{(H8803)} king{H4428}; and these men{H582} the sons{H1121} of Zeruiah{H6870} be too hard{H7186} for me: the LORD{H3068} shall reward{H7999}{(H8762)} the doer of evil{H6213}{(H8802)} according to his wickedness{H7451}."
2 Samuel,4,1,"And when Saul's{H7586} son{H1121} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that Abner{H74} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)} in Hebron{H2275}, his hands{H3027} were feeble{H7503}{(H8799)}, and all the Israelites{H3478} were troubled{H926}{(H8738)}."
2 Samuel,4,2,"And Saul's{H7586} son{H1121} had{H1961}{(H8804)} two{H8147} men{H582} that were captains{H8269} of bands{H1416}: the name{H8034} of the one{H259} was Baanah{H1196}, and the name{H8034} of the other{H8145} Rechab{H7394}, the sons{H1121} of Rimmon{H7417} a Beerothite{H886}, of the children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144}:(for Beeroth{H881} also was reckoned{H2803}{(H8735)} to Benjamin{H1144}:"
2 Samuel,4,3,"And the Beerothites{H886} fled{H1272}{(H8799)} to Gittaim{H1664}, and were sojourners{H1481}{(H8802)} there until this day{H3117}.)"
2 Samuel,4,4,"And Jonathan{H3083}, Saul's{H7586} son{H1121}, had a son{H1121} that was lame{H5223} of his feet{H7272}. He was five{H2568} years{H8141} old{H1121} when the tidings{H8052} came{H935}{(H8800)} of Saul{H7586} and Jonathan{H3083} out of Jezreel{H3157}, and his nurse{H539}{(H8802)} took him up{H5375}{(H8799)}, and fled{H5127}{(H8799)}: and it came to pass, as she made haste{H2648}{(H8800)} to flee{H5127}{(H8800)}, that he fell{H5307}{(H8799)}, and became lame{H6452}{(H8735)}. And his name{H8034} was Mephibosheth{H4648}."
2 Samuel,4,5,"And the sons{H1121} of Rimmon{H7417} the Beerothite{H886}, Rechab{H7394} and Baanah{H1196}, went{H3212}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} about the heat{H2527} of the day{H3117} to the house{H1004} of Ishbosheth{H378}, who lay{H7901}{(H8802)} on a bed{H4904} at noon{H6672}."
2 Samuel,4,6,"And they came thither{H935}{(H8804)} into the midst{H8432} of the house{H1004}, as though they would have fetched{H3947}{(H8802)} wheat{H2406}; and they smote{H5221}{(H8686)} him under the fifth{H2570} rib: and Rechab{H7394} and Baanah{H1196} his brother{H251} escaped{H4422}{(H8738)}."
2 Samuel,4,7,"For when they came{H935}{(H8799)} into the house{H1004}, he lay{H7901}{(H8802)} on his bed{H4296} in his bedchamber{H2315}{H4904}, and they smote{H5221}{(H8686)} him, and slew{H4191}{(H8686)} him, and beheaded{H5493}{(H8686)} him, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} his head{H7218}, and gat them away{H3212}{(H8799)} through{H1870} the plain{H6160} all night{H3915}."
2 Samuel,4,8,"And they brought{H935}{(H8686)} the head{H7218} of Ishbosheth{H378} unto David{H1732} to Hebron{H2275}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428}, Behold the head{H7218} of Ishbosheth{H378} the son{H1121} of Saul{H7586} thine enemy{H341}{(H8802)}, which sought{H1245}{(H8765)} thy life{H5315}; and the LORD{H3068} hath{H5414}{(H8799)} avenged{H5360} my lord{H113} the king{H4428} this day{H3117} of Saul{H7586}, and of his seed{H2233}."
2 Samuel,4,9,"And David{H1732} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Rechab{H7394} and Baanah{H1196} his brother{H251}, the sons{H1121} of Rimmon{H7417} the Beerothite{H886}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, who hath redeemed{H6299}{(H8804)} my soul{H5315} out of all adversity{H6869},"
2 Samuel,4,10,"When one told{H5046}{(H8688)} me, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, Saul{H7586} is dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, thinking to have brought{H5869} good tidings{H1319}{(H8764)}, I took hold{H270}{(H8799)} of him, and slew{H2026}{(H8799)} him in Ziklag{H6860}, who thought that I would have given{H5414}{(H8800)} him a reward for his tidings{H1309}:"
2 Samuel,4,11,"How much more, when wicked{H7563} men{H582} have slain{H2026}{(H8804)} a righteous{H6662} person{H376} in his own house{H1004} upon his bed{H4904}? shall I not therefore now require{H1245}{(H8762)} his blood{H1818} of your hand{H3027}, and take you away{H1197}{(H8765)} from the earth{H776}?"
2 Samuel,4,12,"And David{H1732} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} his young men{H5288}, and they slew{H2026}{(H8799)} them, and cut off{H7112}{(H8762)} their hands{H3027} and their feet{H7272}, and hanged them up{H8518}{(H8799)} over the pool{H1295} in Hebron{H2275}. But they took{H3947}{(H8804)} the head{H7218} of Ishbosheth{H378}, and buried{H6912}{(H8799)} it in the sepulchre{H6913} of Abner{H74} in Hebron{H2275}."
2 Samuel,5,1,"Then came{H935}{(H8799)} all the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478} to David{H1732} unto Hebron{H2275}, and spake{H559}{(H8799)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, we are thy bone{H6106} and thy flesh{H1320}."
2 Samuel,5,2,"Also in time past{H865}{H8032}, when Saul{H7586} was king{H4428} over us, thou wast he that leddest out{H3318}{(H8688)} and broughtest in{H935}{(H8688)} Israel{H3478}: and the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} to thee, Thou shalt feed{H7462}{(H8799)} my people{H5971} Israel{H3478}, and thou shalt be a captain{H5057} over Israel{H3478}."
2 Samuel,5,3,So all the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478} came{H935}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} to Hebron{H2275}; and king{H4428} David{H1732} made{H3772}{(H8799)} a league{H1285} with them in Hebron{H2275} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}: and they anointed{H4886}{(H8799)} David{H1732} king{H4428} over Israel{H3478}.
2 Samuel,5,4,"David{H1732} was thirty{H7970} years{H8141} old{H1121} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} forty{H705} years{H8141}."
2 Samuel,5,5,In Hebron{H2275} he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} over Judah{H3063} seven{H7651} years{H8141} and six{H8337} months{H2320}: and in Jerusalem{H3389} he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} thirty{H7970} and three{H7969} years{H8141} over all Israel{H3478} and Judah{H3063}.
2 Samuel,5,6,"And the king{H4428} and his men{H582} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389} unto the Jebusites{H2983}, the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the land{H776}: which spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Except thou take away{H5493}{(H8687)} the blind{H5787} and the lame{H6455}, thou shalt not come in{H935}{(H8799)} hither: thinking{H559}{(H8800)}, David{H1732} cannot come in{H935}{(H8799)} hither."
2 Samuel,5,7,Nevertheless David{H1732} took{H3920}{(H8799)} the strong hold{H4686} of Zion{H6726}: the same is the city{H5892} of David{H1732}.
2 Samuel,5,8,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} on that day{H3117}, Whosoever getteth up{H5060}{(H8799)} to the gutter{H6794}, and smiteth{H5221}{(H8688)} the Jebusites{H2983}, and the lame{H6455} and the blind{H5787}, that are hated{H8130}{(H8803)} of David's{H1732} soul{H5315}, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said{H559}{(H8799)}, The blind{H5787} and the lame{H6455} shall not come{H935}{(H8799)} into the house{H1004}."
2 Samuel,5,9,"So David{H1732} dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in the fort{H4686}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} it the city{H5892} of David{H1732}. And David{H1732} built{H1129}{(H8799)} round about{H5439} from Millo{H4407} and inward{H1004}."
2 Samuel,5,10,"And David{H1732} went{H3212}{(H8799)} on{H1980}{(H8800)}, and grew great{H1419}, and the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of hosts{H6635} was with him."
2 Samuel,5,11,"And Hiram{H2438} king{H4428} of Tyre{H6865} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} to David{H1732}, and cedar{H730} trees{H6086}, and carpenters{H2796}, and masons{H7023}{H68}: and they built{H1129}{(H8799)} David{H1732} an house{H1004}."
2 Samuel,5,12,"And David{H1732} perceived{H3045}{(H8799)} that the LORD{H3068} had established{H3559}{(H8689)} him king{H4428} over Israel{H3478}, and that he had exalted{H5375}{(H8765)} his kingdom{H4467} for his people{H5971} Israel's{H3478} sake."
2 Samuel,5,13,"And David{H1732} took{H3947}{(H8799)} him more concubines{H6370} and wives{H802} out of Jerusalem{H3389}, after{H310} he was come{H935}{(H8800)} from Hebron{H2275}: and there were yet sons{H1121} and daughters{H1323} born{H3205}{(H8735)} to David{H1732}."
2 Samuel,5,14,"And these be the names{H8034} of those that were born{H3209} unto him in Jerusalem{H3389}; Shammua{H8051}, and Shobab{H7727}, and Nathan{H5416}, and Solomon{H8010},"
2 Samuel,5,15,"Ibhar{H2984} also, and Elishua{H474}, and Nepheg{H5298}, and Japhia{H3309},"
2 Samuel,5,16,"And Elishama{H476}, and Eliada{H450}, and Eliphalet{H467}."
2 Samuel,5,17,"But when the Philistines{H6430} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that they had anointed{H4886}{(H8804)} David{H1732} king{H4428} over Israel{H3478}, all the Philistines{H6430} came up{H5927}{(H8799)} to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} David{H1732}; and David{H1732} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} of it, and went down{H3381}{(H8799)} to the hold{H4686}."
2 Samuel,5,18,The Philistines{H6430} also came{H935}{(H8804)} and spread{H5203}{(H8735)} themselves in the valley{H6010} of Rephaim{H7497}.
2 Samuel,5,19,"And David{H1732} enquired{H7592}{(H8799)} of the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Shall I go up{H5927}{(H8799)} to the Philistines{H6430}? wilt thou deliver{H5414}{(H8799)} them into mine hand{H3027}? And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, Go up{H5927}{(H8798)}: for I will doubtless{H5414}{(H8800)} deliver{H5414}{(H8799)} the Philistines{H6430} into thine hand{H3027}."
2 Samuel,5,20,"And David{H1732} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Baalperazim{H1188}, and David{H1732} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them there, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, The LORD{H3068} hath broken forth{H6555}{(H8804)} upon mine enemies{H341}{(H8802)} before{H6440} me, as the breach{H6556} of waters{H4325}. Therefore he called{H7121}{(H8804)} the name{H8034} of that place{H4725} Baalperazim{H1188}."
2 Samuel,5,21,"And there they left{H5800}{(H8799)} their images{H6091}, and David{H1732} and his men{H582} burned{H5375}{(H8799)} them."
2 Samuel,5,22,"And the Philistines{H6430} came up{H5927}{(H8800)} yet again{H3254}{(H8686)}, and spread{H5203}{(H8735)} themselves in the valley{H6010} of Rephaim{H7497}."
2 Samuel,5,23,"And when David{H1732} enquired{H7592}{(H8799)} of the LORD{H3068}, he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou shalt not go up{H5927}{(H8799)}; but fetch a compass{H5437}{(H8685)} behind{H310} them, and come{H935}{(H8804)} upon them over against{H4136} the mulberry trees{H1057}."
2 Samuel,5,24,"And let it be, when thou hearest{H8085}{(H8800)} the sound{H6963} of a going{H6807} in the tops{H7218} of the mulberry trees{H1057}, that then thou shalt bestir{H2782}{(H8799)} thyself: for then shall the LORD{H3068} go out{H3318}{(H8804)} before{H6440} thee, to smite{H5221}{(H8687)} the host{H4264} of the Philistines{H6430}."
2 Samuel,5,25,"And David{H1732} did so{H6213}{(H8799)}, as the LORD{H3068} had commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} him; and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the Philistines{H6430} from Geba{H1387} until thou come{H935}{(H8800)} to Gazer{H1507}."
2 Samuel,6,1,"Again, David{H1732} gathered together{H622}{(H8799)}{(H8676)}{H3254}{(H8686)} all the chosen{H977}{(H8803)} men of Israel{H3478}, thirty{H7970} thousand{H505}."
2 Samuel,6,2,"And David{H1732} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} with all the people{H5971} that were with him from Baale of Judah{H1184}, to bring up{H5927}{(H8687)} from thence the ark{H727} of God{H430}, whose name{H8034} is called{H7121}{(H8738)} by the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} that dwelleth{H3427}{(H8802)} between the cherubims{H3742}."
2 Samuel,6,3,"And they set{H7392}{(H8686)} the ark{H727} of God{H430} upon a new{H2319} cart{H5699}, and brought{H5375}{(H8799)} it out of the house{H1004} of Abinadab{H41} that was in Gibeah{H1390}: and Uzzah{H5798} and Ahio{H283}, the sons{H1121} of Abinadab{H41}, drave{H5090}{(H8802)} the new{H2319} cart{H5699}."
2 Samuel,6,4,"And they brought{H5375}{(H8799)} it out of the house{H1004} of Abinadab{H41} which was at Gibeah{H1390}, accompanying{H5973} the ark{H727} of God{H430}: and Ahio{H283} went{H1980}{(H8802)} before{H6440} the ark{H727}."
2 Samuel,6,5,"And David{H1732} and all the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} played{H7832}{(H8764)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} on all manner of instruments made of fir{H1265} wood{H6086}, even on harps{H3658}, and on psalteries{H5035}, and on timbrels{H8596}, and on cornets{H4517}, and on cymbals{H6767}."
2 Samuel,6,6,"And when they came{H935}{(H8799)} to Nachon's{H5225} threshingfloor{H1637}, Uzzah{H5798} put forth{H7971}{(H8799)} his hand to the ark{H727} of God{H430}, and took hold{H270}{(H8799)} of it; for the oxen{H1241} shook{H8058}{(H8804)} it."
2 Samuel,6,7,And the anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} was kindled{H2734}{(H8799)} against Uzzah{H5798}; and God{H430} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} him there for his error{H7944}; and there he died{H4191}{(H8799)} by the ark{H727} of God{H430}.
2 Samuel,6,8,"And David{H1732} was displeased{H2734}{(H8799)}, because the LORD{H3068} had made{H6555}{(H8804)} a breach{H6556} upon Uzzah{H5798}: and he called{H7121}{(H8799)} the name of the place{H4725} Perezuzzah{H6560} to this day{H3117}."
2 Samuel,6,9,"And David{H1732} was afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} of the LORD{H3068} that day{H3117}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, How shall the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068} come{H935}{(H8799)} to me?"
2 Samuel,6,10,So David{H1732} would{H14}{(H8804)} not remove{H5493}{(H8687)} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068} unto him into the city{H5892} of David{H1732}: but David{H1732} carried it aside{H5186}{(H8686)} into the house{H1004} of Obededom{H5654} the Gittite{H1663}.
2 Samuel,6,11,"And the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068} continued{H3427}{(H8799)} in the house{H1004} of Obededom{H5654} the Gittite{H1663} three{H7969} months{H2320}: and the LORD{H3068} blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} Obededom{H5654}, and all his household{H1004}."
2 Samuel,6,12,"And it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} king{H4428} David{H1732}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The LORD{H3068} hath blessed{H1288}{(H8765)} the house{H1004} of Obededom{H5654}, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark{H727} of God{H430}. So David{H1732} went{H3212}{(H8799)} and brought up{H5927}{(H8686)} the ark{H727} of God{H430} from the house{H1004} of Obededom{H5654} into the city{H5892} of David{H1732} with gladness{H8057}."
2 Samuel,6,13,"And it was so, that when they that bare{H5375}{(H8802)} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068} had gone{H6805}{(H8804)} six{H8337} paces{H6806}, he sacrificed{H2076}{(H8799)} oxen{H7794} and fatlings{H4806}."
2 Samuel,6,14,And David{H1732} danced{H3769}{(H8772)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} with all his might{H5797}; and David{H1732} was girded{H2296}{(H8803)} with a linen{H906} ephod{H646}.
2 Samuel,6,15,"So David{H1732} and all the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} brought up{H5927}{(H8688)} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068} with shouting{H8643}, and with the sound{H6963} of the trumpet{H7782}."
2 Samuel,6,16,"And as the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068} came{H935}{(H8802)} into the city{H5892} of David{H1732}, Michal{H4324} Saul's{H7586} daughter{H1323} looked{H8259}{(H8738)} through a window{H2474}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} king{H4428} David{H1732} leaping{H6339}{(H8764)} and dancing{H3769}{(H8772)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}; and she despised{H959}{(H8799)} him in her heart{H3820}."
2 Samuel,6,17,"And they brought{H935}{(H8686)} in the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}, and set{H3322}{(H8686)} it in his place{H4725}, in the midst{H8432} of the tabernacle{H168} that David{H1732} had pitched{H5186}{(H8804)} for it: and David{H1732} offered{H5927}{(H8686)} burnt offerings{H5930} and peace offerings{H8002} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}."
2 Samuel,6,18,"And as soon as David{H1732} had made an end{H3615}{(H8762)} of offering{H5927}{(H8687)} burnt offerings{H5930} and peace offerings{H8002}, he blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} the people{H5971} in the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
2 Samuel,6,19,"And he dealt{H2505}{(H8762)} among all the people{H5971}, even among the whole multitude{H1995} of Israel{H3478}, as well to the women{H802} as men{H376}, to every one{H376} a{H259} cake{H2471} of bread{H3899}, and a good piece{H829} of flesh, and a flagon{H809} of wine. So all the people{H5971} departed{H3212}{(H8799)} every one{H376} to his house{H1004}."
2 Samuel,6,20,"Then David{H1732} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to bless{H1288}{(H8763)} his household{H1004}. And Michal{H4324} the daughter{H1323} of Saul{H7586} came out{H3318}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} David{H1732}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, How glorious{H3513}{(H8738)} was the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} to day{H3117}, who uncovered{H1540}{(H8738)} himself to day{H3117} in the eyes{H5869} of the handmaids{H519} of his servants{H5650}, as one{H259} of the vain fellows{H7386} shamelessly{H1540}{(H8736)} uncovereth{H1540}{(H8736)} himself!"
2 Samuel,6,21,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Michal{H4324}, It was before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, which chose{H977}{(H8804)} me before thy father{H1}, and before all his house{H1004}, to appoint{H6680}{(H8763)} me ruler{H5057} over the people{H5971} of the LORD{H3068}, over Israel{H3478}: therefore will I play{H7832}{(H8765)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}."
2 Samuel,6,22,"And I will yet be more vile{H7043}{(H8738)} than thus{H2063}, and will be base{H8217} in mine own sight{H5869}: and of the maidservants{H519} which thou hast spoken{H559}{(H8804)} of, of them shall I be had in honour{H3513}{(H8735)}."
2 Samuel,6,23,Therefore Michal{H4324} the daughter{H1323} of Saul{H7586} had no child{H2056}{(H8675)}{H3206} unto the day{H3117} of her death{H4194}.
2 Samuel,7,1,"And it came to pass, when the king{H4428} sat{H3427}{(H8804)} in his house{H1004}, and the LORD{H3068} had given him rest{H5117}{(H8689)} round about{H5439} from all his enemies{H341}{(H8802)};"
2 Samuel,7,2,"That the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Nathan{H5416} the prophet{H5030}, See{H7200}{(H8798)} now, I dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} in an house{H1004} of cedar{H730}, but the ark{H727} of God{H430} dwelleth{H3427}{(H8802)} within{H8432} curtains{H3407}."
2 Samuel,7,3,"And Nathan{H5416} said{H559}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, do{H6213}{(H8798)} all that is in thine heart{H3824}; for the LORD{H3068} is with thee."
2 Samuel,7,4,"And it came to pass that night{H3915}, that the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto Nathan{H5416}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
2 Samuel,7,5,"Go{H3212}{(H8798)} and tell{H559}{(H8804)} my servant{H5650} David{H1732}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Shalt thou build{H1129}{(H8799)} me an house{H1004} for me to dwell in{H3427}{(H8800)}?"
2 Samuel,7,6,"Whereas I have not dwelt{H3427}{(H8804)} in any house{H1004} since the time{H3117} that I brought up{H5927}{(H8687)} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} out of Egypt{H4714}, even to this day{H3117}, but have walked{H1980}{(H8693)} in a tent{H168} and in a tabernacle{H4908}."
2 Samuel,7,7,"In all the places wherein I have walked{H1980}{(H8694)} with all the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} I a word{H1697} with any{H259} of the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}, whom I commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} to feed{H7462}{(H8800)} my people{H5971} Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Why build{H1129}{(H8804)} ye not me an house{H1004} of cedar{H730}?"
2 Samuel,7,8,"Now therefore so shalt thou say{H559}{(H8799)} unto my servant{H5650} David{H1732}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, I took{H3947}{(H8804)} thee from the sheepcote{H5116}, from following{H310} the sheep{H6629}, to be ruler{H5057} over my people{H5971}, over Israel{H3478}:"
2 Samuel,7,9,"And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest{H1980}{(H8804)}, and have cut off{H3772}{(H8686)} all thine enemies{H341}{(H8802)} out of thy sight{H6440}, and have made{H6213}{(H8804)} thee a great{H1419} name{H8034}, like unto the name{H8034} of the great{H1419} men that are in the earth{H776}."
2 Samuel,7,10,"Moreover I will appoint{H7760}{(H8804)} a place{H4725} for my people{H5971} Israel{H3478}, and will plant{H5193}{(H8804)} them, that they may dwell{H7931}{(H8804)} in a place of their own, and move{H7264}{(H8799)} no more; neither shall the children{H1121} of wickedness{H5766} afflict{H6031}{(H8763)} them any more{H3254}{(H8686)}, as beforetime{H7223},"
2 Samuel,7,11,"And as since the time{H3117} that I commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} judges{H8199}{(H8802)} to be over my people{H5971} Israel{H3478}, and have caused thee to rest{H5117}{(H8689)} from all thine enemies{H341}{(H8802)}. Also the LORD{H3068} telleth{H5046}{(H8689)} thee that he will make{H6213}{(H8799)} thee an house{H1004}."
2 Samuel,7,12,"And when thy days{H3117} be fulfilled{H4390}{(H8799)}, and thou shalt sleep{H7901}{(H8804)} with thy fathers{H1}, I will set up{H6965}{(H8689)} thy seed{H2233} after{H310} thee, which shall proceed{H3318}{(H8799)} out of thy bowels{H4578}, and I will establish{H3559}{(H8689)} his kingdom{H4467}."
2 Samuel,7,13,"He shall build{H1129}{(H8799)} an house{H1004} for my name{H8034}, and I will stablish{H3559}{(H8790)} the throne{H3678} of his kingdom{H4467} for{H5704} ever{H5769}."
2 Samuel,7,14,"I will be his father{H1}, and he shall be my son{H1121}. If he commit iniquity{H5753}{(H8687)}, I will chasten{H3198}{(H8689)} him with the rod{H7626} of men{H582}, and with the stripes{H5061} of the children{H1121} of men{H120}:"
2 Samuel,7,15,"But my mercy{H2617} shall not depart away{H5493}{(H8799)} from him, as I took{H5493}{(H8689)} it from Saul{H7586}, whom I put away{H5493}{(H8689)} before{H6440} thee."
2 Samuel,7,16,And thine house{H1004} and thy kingdom{H4467} shall be established{H539}{(H8738)} for{H5704} ever{H5769} before{H6440} thee: thy throne{H3678} shall be established{H3559}{(H8737)} for{H5704} ever{H5769}.
2 Samuel,7,17,"According to all these words{H1697}, and according to all this vision{H2384}, so did Nathan{H5416} speak{H1696}{(H8765)} unto David{H1732}."
2 Samuel,7,18,"Then went{H935}{(H8799)} king{H4428} David{H1732} in, and sat{H3427}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who am I, O Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}? and what is my house{H1004}, that thou hast brought{H935}{(H8689)} me hitherto{H1988}?"
2 Samuel,7,19,"And this was yet a small thing{H6994}{(H8799)} in thy sight{H5869}, O Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; but thou hast spoken{H1696}{(H8762)} also of thy servant's{H5650} house{H1004} for a great while to come{H7350}. And is this the manner{H8452} of man{H120}, O Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}?"
2 Samuel,7,20,"And what can{H3254} David{H1732} say{H1696}{(H8763)} more{H3254}{(H8686)} unto thee? for thou, Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} thy servant{H5650}."
2 Samuel,7,21,"For thy word's{H1697} sake, and according to thine own heart{H3820}, hast thou done{H6213}{(H8804)} all these great things{H1420}, to make thy servant{H5650} know{H3045}{(H8687)} them."
2 Samuel,7,22,"Wherefore thou art great{H1431}{(H8804)}, O LORD{H3068} God{H430}: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God{H430} beside{H2108} thee, according to all that we have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} with our ears{H241}."
2 Samuel,7,23,"And what one{H259} nation{H1471} in the earth{H776} is like thy people{H5971}, even like Israel{H3478}, whom God{H430} went{H1980}{(H8804)} to redeem{H6299}{(H8800)} for a people{H5971} to himself, and to make{H7760}{(H8800)} him a name{H8034}, and to do{H6213}{(H8800)} for you great things{H1420} and terrible{H3372}{(H8737)}, for thy land{H776}, before{H6440} thy people{H5971}, which thou redeemedst{H6299}{(H8804)} to thee from Egypt{H4714}, from the nations{H1471} and their gods{H430}?"
2 Samuel,7,24,"For thou hast confirmed{H3559}{(H8787)} to thyself thy people{H5971} Israel{H3478} to be a people{H5971} unto thee for{H5704} ever{H5769}: and thou, LORD{H3068}, art become{H1961}{(H8804)} their God{H430}."
2 Samuel,7,25,"And now, O LORD{H3068} God{H430}, the word{H1697} that thou hast spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} concerning thy servant{H5650}, and concerning his house{H1004}, establish{H6965}{(H8685)} it for{H5704} ever{H5769}, and do{H6213}{(H8798)} as thou hast said{H1696}{(H8765)}."
2 Samuel,7,26,"And let thy name{H8034} be magnified{H1431}{(H8799)} for{H5704} ever{H5769}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} is the God{H430} over Israel{H3478}: and let the house{H1004} of thy servant{H5650} David{H1732} be established{H3559}{(H8737)} before{H6440} thee."
2 Samuel,7,27,"For thou, O LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, hast revealed{H1540}{(H8804)}{H241} to thy servant{H5650}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I will build{H1129}{(H8799)} thee an house{H1004}: therefore hath thy servant{H5650} found{H4672}{(H8804)} in his heart{H3820} to pray{H6419}{(H8692)} this prayer{H8605} unto thee."
2 Samuel,7,28,"And now, O Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, thou art that God{H430}, and thy words{H1697} be true{H571}, and thou hast promised{H1696}{(H8762)} this goodness{H2896} unto thy servant{H5650}:"
2 Samuel,7,29,"Therefore now let it please{H2974}{(H8685)} thee to bless{H1288}{(H8761)} the house{H1004} of thy servant{H5650}, that it may continue for ever{H5769} before{H6440} thee: for thou, O Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, hast spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} it: and with thy blessing{H1293} let the house{H1004} of thy servant{H5650} be blessed{H1288}{(H8792)} for ever{H5769}."
2 Samuel,8,1,"And after{H310} this it came to pass, that David{H1732} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the Philistines{H6430}, and subdued{H3665}{(H8686)} them: and David{H1732} took{H3947}{(H8799)} Methegammah{H4965} out of the hand{H3027} of the Philistines{H6430}."
2 Samuel,8,2,"And he smote{H5221}{(H8686)} Moab{H4124}, and measured{H4058}{(H8762)} them with a line{H2256}, casting them down{H7901}{(H8687)} to the ground{H776}; even with two{H8147} lines{H2256} measured{H4058}{(H8762)} he to put to death{H4191}{(H8687)}, and with one full{H4393} line{H2256} to keep alive{H2421}{(H8687)}. And so the Moabites{H4124} became David's{H1732} servants{H5650}, and brought{H5375}{(H8802)} gifts{H4503}."
2 Samuel,8,3,"David{H1732} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} also Hadadezer{H1909}, the son{H1121} of Rehob{H7340}, king{H4428} of Zobah{H6678}, as he went{H3212}{(H8800)} to recover{H7725}{(H8687)} his border{H3027} at the river{H5104} Euphrates{H6578}."
2 Samuel,8,4,"And David{H1732} took{H3920}{(H8799)} from him a thousand{H505} chariots, and seven{H7651} hundred{H3967} horsemen{H6571}, and twenty{H6242} thousand{H505} footmen{H376}{H7273}: and David{H1732} houghed{H6131}{(H8762)} all the chariot{H7393} horses, but reserved{H3498}{(H8686)} of them for an hundred{H3967} chariots{H7393}."
2 Samuel,8,5,"And when the Syrians{H758} of Damascus{H1834} came{H935}{(H8799)} to succour{H5826}{(H8800)} Hadadezer{H1909} king{H4428} of Zobah{H6678}, David{H1732} slew{H5221}{(H8686)} of the Syrians{H758} two{H8147} and twenty{H6242} thousand{H505} men{H376}."
2 Samuel,8,6,"Then David{H1732} put{H7760}{(H8799)} garrisons{H5333} in Syria{H758} of Damascus{H1834}: and the Syrians{H758} became servants{H5650} to David{H1732}, and brought{H5375}{(H8802)} gifts{H4503}. And the LORD{H3068} preserved{H3467}{(H8686)} David{H1732} whithersoever he went{H1980}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,8,7,"And David{H1732} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the shields{H7982} of gold{H2091} that were on the servants{H5650} of Hadadezer{H1909}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} them to Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Samuel,8,8,"And from Betah{H984}, and from Berothai{H1268}, cities{H5892} of Hadadezer{H1909}, king{H4428} David{H1732} took{H3947}{(H8804)} exceeding{H3966} much{H7235}{(H8687)} brass{H5178}."
2 Samuel,8,9,"When Toi{H8583} king{H4428} of Hamath{H2574} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that David{H1732} had smitten{H5221}{(H8689)} all the host{H2428} of Hadadezer{H1909},"
2 Samuel,8,10,"Then Toi{H8583} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Joram{H3141} his son{H1121} unto king{H4428} David{H1732}, to salute{H7592}{(H8800)}{H7965} him, and to bless{H1288}{(H8763)} him, because he had fought{H3898}{(H8738)} against Hadadezer{H1909}, and smitten{H5221}{(H8686)} him: for Hadadezer{H1909} had wars{H376}{H4421} with Toi{H8583}. And Joram brought with him{H3027} vessels{H3627} of silver{H3701}, and vessels{H3627} of gold{H2091}, and vessels{H3627} of brass{H5178}:"
2 Samuel,8,11,"Which also king{H4428} David{H1732} did dedicate{H6942}{(H8689)} unto the LORD{H3068}, with the silver{H3701} and gold{H2091} that he had dedicated{H6942}{(H8689)} of all nations{H1471} which he subdued{H3533}{(H8765)};"
2 Samuel,8,12,"Of Syria{H758}, and of Moab{H4124}, and of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, and of the Philistines{H6430}, and of Amalek{H6002}, and of the spoil{H7998} of Hadadezer{H1909}, son{H1121} of Rehob{H7340}, king{H4428} of Zobah{H6678}."
2 Samuel,8,13,"And David{H1732} gat{H6213}{(H8799)} him a name{H8034} when he returned{H7725}{(H8800)} from smiting{H5221}{(H8687)} of the Syrians{H758} in the valley{H1516} of salt{H4417}, being eighteen{H8083}{H6240} thousand{H505} men."
2 Samuel,8,14,"And he put{H7760}{(H8799)} garrisons{H5333} in Edom{H123}; throughout all Edom{H123} put{H7760}{(H8804)} he garrisons{H5333}, and all they of Edom{H123} became David's{H1732} servants{H5650}. And the LORD{H3068} preserved{H3467}{(H8686)} David{H1732} whithersoever he went{H1980}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,8,15,And David{H1732} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} over all Israel{H3478}; and David{H1732} executed{H6213}{(H8802)} judgment{H4941} and justice{H6666} unto all his people{H5971}.
2 Samuel,8,16,And Joab{H3097} the son{H1121} of Zeruiah{H6870} was over the host{H6635}; and Jehoshaphat{H3092} the son{H1121} of Ahilud{H286} was recorder{H2142}{(H8688)};
2 Samuel,8,17,"And Zadok{H6659} the son{H1121} of Ahitub{H285}, and Ahimelech{H288} the son{H1121} of Abiathar{H54}, were the priests{H3548}; and Seraiah{H8304} was the scribe{H5608}{(H8802)};"
2 Samuel,8,18,And Benaiah{H1141} the son{H1121} of Jehoiada{H3077} was over both the Cherethites{H3774} and the Pelethites{H6432}; and David's{H1732} sons{H1121} were chief rulers{H3548}.
2 Samuel,9,1,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is there yet{H3426} any that is left{H3498}{(H8738)} of the house{H1004} of Saul{H7586}, that I may shew{H6213}{(H8799)} him kindness{H2617} for Jonathan's{H3083} sake?"
2 Samuel,9,2,"And there was of the house{H1004} of Saul{H7586} a servant{H5650} whose name{H8034} was Ziba{H6717}. And when they had called{H7121}{(H8799)} him unto David{H1732}, the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Art thou Ziba{H6717}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thy servant{H5650} is he."
2 Samuel,9,3,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is there not{H657} yet any{H376} of the house{H1004} of Saul{H7586}, that I may shew{H6213}{(H8799)} the kindness{H2617} of God{H430} unto him? And Ziba{H6717} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, Jonathan{H3083} hath yet a son{H1121}, which is lame{H5223} on his feet{H7272}."
2 Samuel,9,4,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Where{H375} is he? And Ziba{H6717} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, Behold, he is in the house{H1004} of Machir{H4353}, the son{H1121} of Ammiel{H5988}, in Lodebar{H3810}."
2 Samuel,9,5,"Then king{H4428} David{H1732} sent{H7971}{(H8799)}, and fetched{H3947}{(H8799)} him out of the house{H1004} of Machir{H4353}, the son{H1121} of Ammiel{H5988}, from Lodebar{H3810}."
2 Samuel,9,6,"Now when Mephibosheth{H4648}, the son{H1121} of Jonathan{H3083}, the son{H1121} of Saul{H7586}, was come{H935}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, he fell{H5307}{(H8799)} on his face{H6440}, and did reverence{H7812}{(H8691)}. And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Mephibosheth{H4648}. And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold thy servant{H5650}!"
2 Samuel,9,7,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not: for I will surely{H6213}{(H8800)} shew{H6213}{(H8799)} thee kindness{H2617} for Jonathan{H3083} thy father's{H1} sake, and will restore{H7725}{(H8689)} thee all the land{H7704} of Saul{H7586} thy father{H1}; and thou shalt eat{H398}{(H8799)} bread{H3899} at my table{H7979} continually{H8548}."
2 Samuel,9,8,"And he bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} himself, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, What is thy servant{H5650}, that thou shouldest look{H6437}{(H8804)} upon such a dead{H4191}{(H8801)} dog{H3611} as I am?"
2 Samuel,9,9,"Then the king{H4428} called{H7121}{(H8799)} to Ziba{H6717}, Saul's{H7586} servant{H5288}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} unto thy master's{H113} son{H1121} all that pertained{H1961}{(H8804)} to Saul{H7586} and to all his house{H1004}."
2 Samuel,9,10,"Thou therefore, and thy sons{H1121}, and thy servants{H5650}, shall till{H5647}{(H8804)} the land{H127} for him, and thou shalt bring{H935}{(H8689)} in the fruits, that thy master's{H113} son{H1121} may have food{H3899} to eat{H398}{(H8804)}: but Mephibosheth{H4648} thy master's{H113} son{H1121} shall eat{H398}{(H8799)} bread{H3899} alway{H8548} at my table{H7979}. Now Ziba{H6717} had fifteen{H2568}{H6240} sons{H1121} and twenty{H6242} servants{H5650}."
2 Samuel,9,11,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Ziba{H6717} unto the king{H4428}, According to all that my lord{H113} the king{H4428} hath commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} his servant{H5650}, so shall thy servant{H5650} do{H6213}{(H8799)}. As for Mephibosheth{H4648}, said the king, he shall eat{H398}{(H8802)} at my table{H7979}, as one{H259} of the king's{H4428} sons{H1121}."
2 Samuel,9,12,"And Mephibosheth{H4648} had a young{H6996} son{H1121}, whose name{H8034} was Micha{H4316}. And all that dwelt{H4186} in the house{H1004} of Ziba{H6717} were servants{H5650} unto Mephibosheth{H4648}."
2 Samuel,9,13,So Mephibosheth{H4648} dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} in Jerusalem{H3389}: for he did eat{H398}{(H8802)} continually{H8548} at the king's{H4428} table{H7979}; and was lame{H6455} on both{H8147} his feet{H7272}.
2 Samuel,10,1,"And it came to pass after this{H310}, that the king{H4428} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} died{H4191}{(H8799)}, and Hanun{H2586} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead."
2 Samuel,10,2,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} David{H1732}, I will shew{H6213}{(H8799)} kindness{H2617} unto Hanun{H2586} the son{H1121} of Nahash{H5176}, as his father{H1} shewed{H6213}{(H8804)} kindness{H2617} unto me. And David{H1732} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to comfort{H5162}{(H8763)} him by the hand{H3027} of his servants{H5650} for his father{H1}. And David's{H1732} servants{H5650} came{H935}{(H8799)} into the land{H776} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}."
2 Samuel,10,3,"And the princes{H8269} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Hanun{H2586} their lord{H113}, Thinkest{H5869} thou that David{H1732} doth honour{H3513}{(H8764)} thy father{H1}, that he hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} comforters{H5162}{(H8764)} unto thee? hath not David{H1732} rather sent{H7971}{(H8804)} his servants{H5650} unto thee, to{H5668} search{H2713}{(H8800)} the city{H5892}, and to spy it out{H7270}{(H8763)}, and to overthrow{H2015}{(H8800)} it?"
2 Samuel,10,4,"Wherefore Hanun{H2586} took{H3947}{(H8799)} David's{H1732} servants{H5650}, and shaved off{H1548}{(H8762)} the one half{H2677} of their beards{H2206}, and cut off{H3772}{(H8799)} their garments{H4063} in the middle{H2677}, even to their buttocks{H8357}, and sent them away{H7971}{(H8762)}."
2 Samuel,10,5,"When they told{H5046}{(H8686)} it unto David{H1732}, he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} them, because the men{H582} were greatly{H3966} ashamed{H3637}{(H8737)}: and the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Tarry{H3427}{(H8798)} at Jericho{H3405} until your beards{H2206} be grown{H6779}{(H8762)}, and then return{H7725}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,10,6,"And when the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that they stank{H887}{(H8738)} before David{H1732}, the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and hired{H7936}{(H8799)} the Syrians{H758} of Bethrehob{H1050}, and the Syrians{H758} of Zoba{H6678}, twenty{H6242} thousand{H505} footmen{H7273}, and of king{H4428} Maacah{H4601} a thousand{H505} men{H376}, and of Ishtob{H382} twelve{H6240}{H8147} thousand{H505} men{H376}."
2 Samuel,10,7,"And when David{H1732} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} of it, he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Joab{H3097}, and all the host{H6635} of the mighty men{H1368}."
2 Samuel,10,8,"And the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} came out{H3318}{(H8799)}, and put the battle{H4421} in array{H6186}{(H8799)} at the entering in{H6607} of the gate{H8179}: and the Syrians{H758} of Zoba{H6678}, and of Rehob{H7340}, and Ishtob{H382}, and Maacah{H4601}, were by themselves{H905} in the field{H7704}."
2 Samuel,10,9,"When Joab{H3097} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that the front{H6440} of the battle{H4421} was against him before{H6440} and behind{H268}, he chose{H977}{(H8799)} of all the choice{H977}{(H8803)} men of Israel{H3478}, and put them in array{H6186}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} the Syrians{H758}:"
2 Samuel,10,10,"And the rest{H3499} of the people{H5971} he delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} into the hand{H3027} of Abishai{H52} his brother{H251}, that he might put them in array{H6186}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}."
2 Samuel,10,11,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, If the Syrians{H758} be too strong{H2388}{(H8799)} for me, then thou shalt help{H3444} me: but if the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} be too strong{H2388}{(H8799)} for thee, then I will come{H1980}{(H8804)} and help{H3467}{(H8687)} thee."
2 Samuel,10,12,"Be of good courage{H2388}{(H8798)}, and let us play the men{H2388}{(H8691)} for our people{H5971}, and for the cities{H5892} of our God{H430}: and the LORD{H3068} do{H6213}{(H8799)} that which seemeth{H5869} him good{H2896}."
2 Samuel,10,13,"And Joab{H3097} drew nigh{H5066}{(H8799)}, and the people{H5971} that were with him, unto the battle{H4421} against the Syrians{H758}: and they fled{H5127}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him."
2 Samuel,10,14,"And when the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} saw{H7200}{(H8804)} that the Syrians{H758} were fled{H5127}{(H8804)}, then fled{H5127}{(H8799)} they also before{H6440} Abishai{H52}, and entered{H935}{(H8799)} into the city{H5892}. So Joab{H3097} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} from the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Samuel,10,15,"And when the Syrians{H758} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that they were smitten{H5062}{(H8738)} before{H6440} Israel{H3478}, they gathered{H622}{(H8735)} themselves together{H3162}."
2 Samuel,10,16,"And Hadarezer{H1928} sent{H7971}{(H8799)}, and brought out{H3318}{(H8686)} the Syrians{H758} that were beyond{H5676} the river{H5104}: and they came{H935}{(H8799)} to Helam{H2431}; and Shobach{H7731} the captain{H8269} of the host{H6635} of Hadarezer{H1928} went before{H6440} them."
2 Samuel,10,17,"And when it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} David{H1732}, he gathered{H622} all Israel{H3478} together{H622}{(H8799)}, and passed over{H5674}{(H8799)} Jordan{H3383}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Helam{H2431}. And the Syrians{H758} set themselves in array{H6186}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} David{H1732}, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} with him."
2 Samuel,10,18,"And the Syrians{H758} fled{H5127}{(H8799)} before{H6440} Israel{H3478}; and David{H1732} slew{H2026}{(H8799)} the men of seven{H7651} hundred{H3967} chariots{H7393} of the Syrians{H758}, and forty{H705} thousand{H505} horsemen{H6571}, and smote{H5221}{(H8689)} Shobach{H7731} the captain{H8269} of their host{H6635}, who died{H4191}{(H8799)} there."
2 Samuel,10,19,"And when all the kings{H4428} that were servants{H5650} to Hadarezer{H1928} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that they were smitten{H5062}{(H8738)} before{H6440} Israel{H3478}, they made peace{H7999}{(H8686)} with Israel{H3478}, and served{H5647}{(H8799)} them. So the Syrians{H758} feared{H3372}{(H8799)} to help{H3467}{(H8687)} the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} any more."
2 Samuel,11,1,"And it came to pass, after the year{H8141} was expired{H8666}, at the time{H6256} when kings{H4428}{(H8675)}{H4397} go forth{H3318}{(H8800)} to battle, that David{H1732} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Joab{H3097}, and his servants{H5650} with him, and all Israel{H3478}; and they destroyed{H7843}{(H8686)} the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, and besieged{H6696}{(H8799)} Rabbah{H7237}. But David{H1732} tarried still{H3427}{(H8802)} at Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Samuel,11,2,"And it came to pass in an eveningtide{H6153}{H6256}, that David{H1732} arose{H6965}{(H8799)} from off his bed{H4904}, and walked{H1980}{(H8691)} upon the roof{H1406} of the king's{H4428} house{H1004}: and from the roof{H1406} he saw{H7200}{(H8799)} a woman{H802} washing{H7364}{(H8801)} herself; and the woman{H802} was very{H3966} beautiful{H2896} to look upon{H4758}."
2 Samuel,11,3,"And David{H1732} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and enquired{H1875}{(H8799)} after the woman{H802}. And one said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is not this Bathsheba{H1339}, the daughter{H1323} of Eliam{H463}, the wife{H802} of Uriah{H223} the Hittite{H2850}?"
2 Samuel,11,4,"And David{H1732} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} her; and she came in{H935}{(H8799)} unto him, and he lay{H7901}{(H8799)} with her; for she was purified{H6942}{(H8693)} from her uncleanness{H2932}: and she returned{H7725}{(H8799)} unto her house{H1004}."
2 Samuel,11,5,"And the woman{H802} conceived{H2029}{(H8799)}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and told{H5046}{(H8686)} David{H1732}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, I am with child{H2030}."
2 Samuel,11,6,"And David{H1732} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Joab{H3097}, saying, Send{H7971}{(H8798)} me Uriah{H223} the Hittite{H2850}. And Joab{H3097} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Uriah{H223} to David{H1732}."
2 Samuel,11,7,"And when Uriah{H223} was come{H935}{(H8799)} unto him, David{H1732} demanded{H7592}{(H8799)} of him how Joab{H3097} did{H7965}, and how the people{H5971} did{H7965}, and how the war{H4421} prospered{H7965}."
2 Samuel,11,8,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Uriah{H223}, Go down{H3381}{(H8798)} to thy house{H1004}, and wash{H7364}{(H8798)} thy feet{H7272}. And Uriah{H223} departed out{H3318}{(H8799)} of the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, and there followed{H310} him a mess{H4864} of meat from the king{H4428}."
2 Samuel,11,9,"But Uriah{H223} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} at the door{H6607} of the king's{H4428} house{H1004} with all the servants{H5650} of his lord{H113}, and went not down{H3381}{(H8804)} to his house{H1004}."
2 Samuel,11,10,"And when they had told{H5046}{(H8686)} David{H1732}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Uriah{H223} went not down{H3381}{(H8804)} unto his house{H1004}, David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Uriah{H223}, Camest{H935}{(H8802)} thou not from thy journey{H1870}? why then didst thou not go down{H3381}{(H8804)} unto thine house{H1004}?"
2 Samuel,11,11,"And Uriah{H223} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, The ark{H727}, and Israel{H3478}, and Judah{H3063}, abide{H3427}{(H8802)} in tents{H5521}; and my lord{H113} Joab{H3097}, and the servants{H5650} of my lord{H113}, are encamped{H2583}{(H8802)} in the open{H6440} fields{H7704}; shall I{H589} then go{H935}{(H8799)} into mine house{H1004}, to eat{H398}{(H8800)} and to drink{H8354}{(H8800)}, and to lie{H7901}{(H8800)} with my wife{H802}? as thou livest{H2416}, and as thy soul{H5315} liveth{H2416}, I will not do{H6213}{(H8799)} this thing{H1697}."
2 Samuel,11,12,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Uriah{H223}, Tarry{H3427}{(H8798)} here to day{H3117} also, and to morrow{H4279} I will let thee depart{H7971}{(H8762)}. So Uriah{H223} abode{H3427}{(H8799)} in Jerusalem{H3389} that day{H3117}, and the morrow{H4283}."
2 Samuel,11,13,"And when David{H1732} had called{H7121}{(H8799)} him, he did eat{H398}{(H8799)} and drink{H8354}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him; and he made him drunk{H7937}{(H8762)}: and at even{H6153} he went out{H3318}{(H8799)} to lie{H7901}{(H8800)} on his bed{H4904} with the servants{H5650} of his lord{H113}, but went not down{H3381}{(H8804)} to his house{H1004}."
2 Samuel,11,14,"And it came to pass in the morning{H1242}, that David{H1732} wrote{H3789}{(H8799)} a letter{H5612} to Joab{H3097}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} it by the hand{H3027} of Uriah{H223}."
2 Samuel,11,15,"And he wrote{H3789}{(H8799)} in the letter{H5612}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Set{H3051}{(H8798)} ye Uriah{H223} in the forefront{H6440}{H4136} of the hottest{H2389} battle{H4421}, and retire{H7725}{(H8804)} ye from him{H310}, that he may be smitten{H5221}{(H8738)}, and die{H4191}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,11,16,"And it came to pass, when Joab{H3097} observed{H8104}{(H8800)} the city{H5892}, that he assigned{H5414}{(H8799)} Uriah{H223} unto a place{H4725} where he knew{H3045}{(H8804)} that valiant{H2428} men{H582} were."
2 Samuel,11,17,"And the men{H582} of the city{H5892} went out{H3318}{(H8799)}, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} with Joab{H3097}: and there fell{H5307}{(H8799)} some of the people{H5971} of the servants{H5650} of David{H1732}; and Uriah{H223} the Hittite{H2850} died{H4191}{(H8799)} also."
2 Samuel,11,18,Then Joab{H3097} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and told{H5046}{(H8686)} David{H1732} all the things{H1697} concerning the war{H4421};
2 Samuel,11,19,"And charged{H6680}{(H8762)} the messenger{H4397}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, When thou hast made an end{H3615}{(H8763)} of telling{H1696}{(H8763)} the matters{H1697} of the war{H4421} unto the king{H4428},"
2 Samuel,11,20,"And if so be that the king's{H4428} wrath{H2534} arise{H5927}{(H8799)}, and he say{H559}{(H8804)} unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh{H5066}{(H8738)} unto the city{H5892} when ye did fight{H3898}{(H8736)}? knew{H3045}{(H8804)} ye not that they would shoot{H3384}{(H8686)} from the wall{H2346}?"
2 Samuel,11,21,"Who smote{H5221}{(H8689)} Abimelech{H40} the son{H1121} of Jerubbesheth{H3380}? did not a woman{H802} cast{H7993}{(H8689)} a piece{H6400} of a millstone{H7393} upon him from the wall{H2346}, that he died{H4191}{(H8799)} in Thebez{H8405}? why went ye nigh{H5066}{(H8738)} the wall{H2346}? then say{H559}{(H8804)} thou, Thy servant{H5650} Uriah{H223} the Hittite{H2850} is dead{H4191}{(H8804)} also."
2 Samuel,11,22,"So the messenger{H4397} went{H3212}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} and shewed{H5046}{(H8686)} David{H1732} all that Joab{H3097} had sent{H7971}{(H8804)} him for."
2 Samuel,11,23,"And the messenger{H4397} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, Surely the men{H582} prevailed{H1396}{(H8804)} against us, and came out{H3318}{(H8799)} unto us into the field{H7704}, and we were upon them even unto the entering{H6607} of the gate{H8179}."
2 Samuel,11,24,"And the shooters{H3384}{(H8688)} shot{H3384}{(H8686)} from off the wall{H2346} upon thy servants{H5650}; and some of the king's{H4428} servants{H5650} be dead{H4191}{(H8799)}, and thy servant{H5650} Uriah{H223} the Hittite{H2850} is dead{H4191}{(H8804)} also."
2 Samuel,11,25,"Then David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the messenger{H4397}, Thus shalt thou say{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joab{H3097}, Let not this thing{H1697} displease{H3415}{(H8799)}{H5869} thee, for the sword{H2719} devoureth{H398}{(H8799)} one as well as another{H2090}: make thy battle{H4421} more strong{H2388}{(H8685)} against the city{H5892}, and overthrow{H2040}{(H8798)} it: and encourage{H2388}{(H8761)} thou him."
2 Samuel,11,26,"And when the wife{H802} of Uriah{H223} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that Uriah{H223} her husband{H376} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, she mourned{H5594}{(H8799)} for her husband{H1167}."
2 Samuel,11,27,"And when the mourning{H60} was past{H5674}{(H8799)}, David{H1732} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and fetched{H622}{(H8799)} her to his house{H1004}, and she became his wife{H802}, and bare{H3205}{(H8799)} him a son{H1121}. But the thing{H1697} that David{H1732} had done{H6213}{(H8804)} displeased{H3415}{(H8799)}{H5869} the LORD{H3068}."
2 Samuel,12,1,"And the LORD{H3068} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Nathan{H5416} unto David{H1732}. And he came{H935}{(H8799)} unto him, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, There were two{H8147} men{H582} in one{H259} city{H5892}; the one{H259} rich{H6223}, and the other{H259} poor{H7326}{(H8802)}."
2 Samuel,12,2,The rich{H6223} man had exceeding{H3966} many{H7235}{(H8687)} flocks{H6629} and herds{H1241}:
2 Samuel,12,3,"But the poor{H7326}{(H8802)} man had nothing, save one{H259} little{H6996} ewe lamb{H3535}, which he had bought{H7069}{(H8804)} and nourished up{H2421}{(H8762)}: and it grew up{H1431}{(H8799)} together{H3162} with him, and with his children{H1121}; it did eat{H398}{(H8799)} of his own meat{H6595}, and drank{H8354}{(H8799)} of his own cup{H3563}, and lay{H7901}{(H8799)} in his bosom{H2436}, and was unto him as a daughter{H1323}."
2 Samuel,12,4,"And there came{H935}{(H8799)} a traveller{H1982} unto the rich{H6223} man{H376}, and he spared{H2550}{(H8799)} to take{H3947}{(H8800)} of his own flock{H6629} and of his own herd{H1241}, to dress{H6213}{(H8800)} for the wayfaring man{H732}{(H8802)} that was come{H935}{(H8802)} unto him; but took{H3947}{(H8799)} the poor{H7326}{(H8802)} man's{H376} lamb{H3535}, and dressed{H6213}{(H8799)} it for the man{H376} that was come{H935}{(H8802)} to him."
2 Samuel,12,5,"And David's{H1732} anger{H639} was greatly{H3966} kindled{H2734}{(H8799)} against the man{H376}; and he said{H559}{(H8799)} to Nathan{H5416}, As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, the man{H376} that hath done{H6213}{(H8802)} this thing shall surely{H1121} die{H4194}:"
2 Samuel,12,6,"And he shall restore{H7999}{(H8762)} the lamb{H3535} fourfold{H706}, because{H6118} he did{H6213}{(H8804)} this thing{H1697}, and because{H834} he had no pity{H2550}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,12,7,"And Nathan{H5416} said{H559}{(H8799)} to David{H1732}, Thou art the man{H376}. Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, I anointed{H4886}{(H8804)} thee king{H4428} over Israel{H3478}, and I delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} thee out of the hand{H3027} of Saul{H7586};"
2 Samuel,12,8,"And I gave{H5414}{(H8799)} thee thy master's{H113} house{H1004}, and thy master's{H113} wives{H802} into thy bosom{H2436}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} thee the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} and of Judah{H3063}; and if that had been too little{H4592}, I would moreover have given{H3254}{(H8686)} unto thee such{H2007} and such things{H2007}."
2 Samuel,12,9,"Wherefore hast thou despised{H959}{(H8804)} the commandment{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, to do{H6213}{(H8800)} evil{H7451} in his sight{H5869}? thou hast killed{H5221}{(H8689)} Uriah{H223} the Hittite{H2850} with the sword{H2719}, and hast taken{H3947}{(H8804)} his wife{H802} to be thy wife{H802}, and hast slain{H2026}{(H8804)} him with the sword{H2719} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}."
2 Samuel,12,10,"Now therefore the sword{H2719} shall never{H5704}{H5769} depart{H5493}{(H8799)} from thine house{H1004}; because{H6118} thou hast despised{H959}{(H8804)} me, and hast taken{H3947}{(H8799)} the wife{H802} of Uriah{H223} the Hittite{H2850} to be thy wife{H802}."
2 Samuel,12,11,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Behold, I will raise up{H6965}{(H8688)} evil{H7451} against thee out of thine own house{H1004}, and I will take{H3947}{(H8804)} thy wives{H802} before thine eyes{H5869}, and give{H5414}{(H8804)} them unto thy neighbour{H7453}, and he shall lie{H7901}{(H8804)} with thy wives{H802} in the sight{H5869} of this sun{H8121}."
2 Samuel,12,12,"For thou didst{H6213}{(H8804)} it secretly{H5643}: but I will do{H6213}{(H8799)} this thing{H1697} before all Israel{H3478}, and before the sun{H8121}."
2 Samuel,12,13,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Nathan{H5416}, I have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against the LORD{H3068}. And Nathan{H5416} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, The LORD{H3068} also hath put away{H5674}{(H8689)} thy sin{H2403}; thou shalt not die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,12,14,"Howbeit{H657}, because by this deed{H1697} thou hast given{H5006} great occasion{H5006}{(H8763)} to the enemies{H341}{(H8802)} of the LORD{H3068} to blaspheme{H5006}{(H8765)}, the child{H1121} also that is born{H3209} unto thee shall surely{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,12,15,"And Nathan{H5416} departed{H3212}{(H8799)} unto his house{H1004}. And the LORD{H3068} struck{H5062}{(H8799)} the child{H3206} that Uriah's{H223} wife{H802} bare{H3205}{(H8804)} unto David{H1732}, and it was very sick{H605}{(H8735)}."
2 Samuel,12,16,"David{H1732} therefore besought{H1245}{(H8762)} God{H430} for the child{H5288}; and David{H1732} fasted{H6684}{(H8799)}{H6685}, and went in{H935}{(H8804)}, and lay{H7901}{(H8804)} all night{H3885}{(H8804)} upon the earth{H776}."
2 Samuel,12,17,"And the elders{H2205} of his house{H1004} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went to him, to raise him up{H6965}{(H8687)} from the earth{H776}: but he would{H14}{(H8804)} not, neither did he eat{H1262}{(H8804)} bread{H3899} with them."
2 Samuel,12,18,"And it came to pass on the seventh{H7637} day{H3117}, that the child{H3206} died{H4191}{(H8799)}. And the servants{H5650} of David{H1732} feared{H3372}{(H8799)} to tell{H5046}{(H8687)} him that the child{H3206} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}: for they said{H559}{(H8804)}, Behold, while the child{H3206} was yet alive{H2416}, we spake{H1696}{(H8765)} unto him, and he would not hearken{H8085}{(H8804)} unto our voice{H6963}: how will he then{H6213} vex{H7451} himself{H6213}{(H8804)}, if we tell{H559}{(H8799)} him that the child{H3206} is dead{H4191}{(H8804)}?"
2 Samuel,12,19,"But when David{H1732} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that his servants{H5650} whispered{H3907}{(H8693)}, David{H1732} perceived{H995}{(H8799)} that the child{H3206} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}: therefore David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his servants{H5650}, Is the child{H3206} dead{H4191}{(H8804)}? And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, He is dead{H4191}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,12,20,"Then David{H1732} arose{H6965}{(H8799)} from the earth{H776}, and washed{H7364}{(H8799)}, and anointed{H5480}{(H8686)} himself, and changed{H2498}{(H8762)} his apparel{H8071}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)}: then he came{H935}{(H8799)} to his own house{H1004}; and when he required{H7592}{(H8799)}, they set{H7760}{(H8799)} bread{H3899} before him, and he did eat{H398}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,12,21,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} his servants{H5650} unto him, What thing{H1697} is this that thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)}? thou didst fast{H6684}{(H8804)} and weep{H1058}{(H8799)} for the child{H3206}, while it was alive{H2416}; but when the child{H3206} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, thou didst rise{H6965}{(H8804)} and eat{H398}{(H8799)} bread{H3899}."
2 Samuel,12,22,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, While the child{H3206} was yet alive{H2416}, I fasted{H6684}{(H8804)} and wept{H1058}{(H8799)}: for I said{H559}{(H8804)}, Who can tell{H3045}{(H8802)} whether GOD{H3068} will be gracious{H2603}{(H8804)}{(H8675)}{H2603}{(H8762)} to me, that the child{H3206} may live{H2416}?"
2 Samuel,12,23,"But now he is dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, wherefore should I fast{H6684}{(H8802)}? can{H3201}{(H8799)} I bring him back again{H7725}{(H8687)}? I shall go{H1980}{(H8802)} to him, but he shall not return{H7725}{(H8799)} to me."
2 Samuel,12,24,"And David{H1732} comforted{H5162}{(H8762)} Bathsheba{H1339} his wife{H802}, and went in{H935}{(H8799)} unto her, and lay{H7901}{(H8799)} with her: and she bare{H3205}{(H8799)} a son{H1121}, and he called{H7121}{(H8799)} his name{H8034} Solomon{H8010}: and the LORD{H3068} loved{H157}{(H8804)} him."
2 Samuel,12,25,"And he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} by the hand{H3027} of Nathan{H5416} the prophet{H5030}; and he called{H7121}{(H8799)} his name{H8034} Jedidiah{H3041}, because of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Samuel,12,26,"And Joab{H3097} fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against Rabbah{H7237} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, and took{H3920}{(H8799)} the royal{H4410} city{H5892}."
2 Samuel,12,27,"And Joab{H3097} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} to David{H1732}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, I have fought{H3898}{(H8738)} against Rabbah{H7237}, and have taken{H3920}{(H8804)} the city{H5892} of waters{H4325}."
2 Samuel,12,28,"Now therefore gather{H622} the rest{H3499} of the people{H5971} together{H622}{(H8798)}, and encamp{H2583}{(H8798)} against the city{H5892}, and take{H3920}{(H8798)} it: lest I take{H3920}{(H8799)} the city{H5892}, and it be called{H7121}{(H8738)} after my name{H8034}."
2 Samuel,12,29,"And David{H1732} gathered{H622} all the people{H5971} together{H622}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Rabbah{H7237}, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against it, and took{H3920}{(H8799)} it."
2 Samuel,12,30,"And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} their king's{H4428} crown{H5850} from off his head{H7218}, the weight{H4948} whereof was a talent{H3603} of gold{H2091} with the precious{H3368} stones{H68}: and it was set on David's{H1732} head{H7218}. And he brought forth{H3318}{(H8689)} the spoil{H7998} of the city{H5892} in great{H3966} abundance{H7235}{(H8687)}."
2 Samuel,12,31,"And he brought forth{H3318}{(H8689)} the people{H5971} that were therein, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} them under saws{H4050}, and under harrows{H2757} of iron{H1270}, and under axes{H4037} of iron{H1270}, and made them pass{H5674}{(H8689)} through the brickkiln{H4404}: and thus did{H6213}{(H8799)} he unto all the cities{H5892} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}. So David{H1732} and all the people{H5971} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} unto Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Samuel,13,1,"And it came to pass after{H310} this, that Absalom{H53} the son{H1121} of David{H1732} had a fair{H3303} sister{H269}, whose name{H8034} was Tamar{H8559}; and Amnon{H550} the son{H1121} of David{H1732} loved{H157}{(H8799)} her."
2 Samuel,13,2,"And Amnon{H550} was so vexed{H3334}{(H8799)}, that he fell sick{H2470}{(H8692)} for his sister{H269} Tamar{H8559}; for she was a virgin{H1330}; and Amnon{H550} thought{H5869} it hard{H6381}{(H8735)} for him to do{H6213}{(H8800)} any thing{H3972} to her."
2 Samuel,13,3,"But Amnon{H550} had a friend{H7453}, whose name{H8034} was Jonadab{H3122}, the son{H1121} of Shimeah{H8093} David's{H1732} brother{H251}: and Jonadab{H3122} was a very{H3966} subtil{H2450} man{H376}."
2 Samuel,13,4,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Why art thou, being the king's{H4428} son{H1121}, lean{H1800} from day{H1242} to day{H1242}? wilt thou not tell{H5046}{(H8686)} me? And Amnon{H550} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, I love{H157}{(H8802)} Tamar{H8559}, my brother{H251} Absalom's{H53} sister{H269}."
2 Samuel,13,5,"And Jonadab{H3082} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Lay thee down{H7901}{(H8798)} on thy bed{H4904}, and make thyself sick{H2470}{(H8690)}: and when thy father{H1} cometh{H935}{(H8804)} to see{H7200}{(H8800)} thee, say{H559}{(H8804)} unto him, I pray thee, let my sister{H269} Tamar{H8559} come{H935}{(H8799)}, and give{H1262}{(H8686)} me meat{H3899}, and dress{H6213}{(H8804)} the meat{H1279} in my sight{H5869}, that I may see{H7200}{(H8799)} it, and eat{H398}{(H8804)} it at her hand{H3027}."
2 Samuel,13,6,"So Amnon{H550} lay down{H7901}{(H8799)}, and made himself sick{H2470}{(H8691)}: and when the king{H4428} was come{H935}{(H8799)} to see{H7200}{(H8800)} him, Amnon{H550} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, I pray thee, let Tamar{H8559} my sister{H269} come{H935}{(H8799)}, and make{H3823}{(H8762)} me a couple{H8147} of cakes{H3834} in my sight{H5869}, that I may eat{H1262}{(H8799)} at her hand{H3027}."
2 Samuel,13,7,"Then David{H1732} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} home{H1004} to Tamar{H8559}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} now to thy brother{H251} Amnon's{H550} house{H1004}, and dress{H6213}{(H8798)} him meat{H1279}."
2 Samuel,13,8,"So Tamar{H8559} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to her brother{H251} Amnon's{H550} house{H1004}; and he was laid down{H7901}{(H8802)}. And she took{H3947}{(H8799)} flour{H1217}, and kneaded{H3888}{(H8799)} it, and made cakes{H3823}{(H8762)} in his sight{H5869}, and did bake{H1310}{(H8762)} the cakes{H3834}."
2 Samuel,13,9,"And she took{H3947}{(H8799)} a pan{H4958}, and poured them out{H3332}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him; but he refused{H3985}{(H8762)} to eat{H398}{(H8800)}. And Amnon{H550} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Have out{H3318}{(H8685)} all men{H376} from me. And they went out{H3318}{(H8799)} every man{H376} from him."
2 Samuel,13,10,"And Amnon{H550} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Tamar{H8559}, Bring{H935}{(H8685)} the meat{H1279} into the chamber{H2315}, that I may eat{H1262}{(H8799)} of thine hand{H3027}. And Tamar{H8559} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the cakes{H3834} which she had made{H6213}{(H8804)}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} them into the chamber{H2315} to Amnon{H550} her brother{H251}."
2 Samuel,13,11,"And when she had brought{H5066}{(H8686)} them unto him to eat{H398}{(H8800)}, he took hold{H2388}{(H8686)} of her, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Come{H935}{(H8798)} lie{H7901}{(H8798)} with me, my sister{H269}."
2 Samuel,13,12,"And she answered{H559}{(H8799)} him, Nay, my brother{H251}, do not force{H6031}{(H8762)} me; for no such thing ought{H3651} to be done{H6213}{(H8735)} in Israel{H3478}: do{H6213}{(H8799)} not thou this folly{H5039}."
2 Samuel,13,13,"And I, whither shall I cause my shame{H2781} to go{H3212}{(H8686)}? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one{H259} of the fools{H5036} in Israel{H3478}. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak{H1696}{(H8761)} unto the king{H4428}; for he will not withhold{H4513}{(H8799)} me from thee."
2 Samuel,13,14,"Howbeit he would{H14}{(H8804)} not hearken{H8085}{(H8800)} unto her voice{H6963}: but, being stronger{H2388}{(H8799)} than she, forced{H6031}{(H8762)} her, and lay{H7901}{(H8799)} with her."
2 Samuel,13,15,"Then Amnon{H550} hated{H8130}{(H8799)} her exceedingly{H3966}{H1419}; so that the hatred{H8135} wherewith he hated{H8130}{(H8804)} her was greater{H1419} than the love{H160} wherewith he had loved{H157}{(H8804)} her. And Amnon{H550} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, be gone{H3212}{(H8798)}."
2 Samuel,13,16,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, There is no cause{H182}: this evil{H7451} in sending me away{H7971}{(H8763)} is greater{H1419} than the other{H312} that thou didst{H6213}{(H8804)} unto me. But he would{H14}{(H8804)} not hearken{H8085}{(H8800)} unto her."
2 Samuel,13,17,"Then he called{H7121}{(H8799)} his servant{H5288} that ministered{H8334}{(H8764)} unto him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Put{H7971}{(H8798)} now this woman out{H2351} from me, and bolt{H5274}{(H8798)} the door{H1817} after{H310} her."
2 Samuel,13,18,"And she had a garment{H3801} of divers colours{H6446} upon her: for with such robes{H4598} were the king's{H4428} daughters{H1323} that were virgins{H1330} apparelled{H3847}{(H8799)}. Then his servant{H8334}{(H8764)} brought{H3318}{(H8686)} her out{H2351}, and bolted{H5274}{(H8804)} the door{H1817} after{H310} her."
2 Samuel,13,19,"And Tamar{H8559} put{H3947}{(H8799)} ashes{H665} on her head{H7218}, and rent{H7167}{(H8804)} her garment{H3801} of divers colours{H6446} that was on her, and laid{H7760}{(H8799)} her hand{H3027} on her head{H7218}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} on{H1980}{(H8800)} crying{H2199}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,13,20,"And Absalom{H53} her brother{H251} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Hath Amnon{H550} thy brother{H251} been with thee? but hold now thy peace{H2790}{(H8685)}, my sister{H269}: he is thy brother{H251}; regard{H7896}{(H8799)}{H3820} not this thing{H1697}. So Tamar{H8559} remained{H3427}{(H8799)} desolate{H8074}{(H8802)} in her brother{H251} Absalom's{H53} house{H1004}."
2 Samuel,13,21,"But when king{H4428} David{H1732} heard{H8085}{(H8804)} of all these things{H1697}, he was very{H3966} wroth{H2734}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,13,22,"And Absalom{H53} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} unto his brother Amnon{H550} neither good{H2896} nor bad{H7451}: for Absalom{H53} hated{H8130}{(H8804)} Amnon{H550}, because{H1697} he had forced{H6031}{(H8765)} his sister{H269} Tamar{H8559}."
2 Samuel,13,23,"And it came to pass after two full{H3117} years{H8141}, that Absalom{H53} had sheepshearers{H1494}{(H8802)} in Baalhazor{H1178}, which is beside Ephraim{H669}: and Absalom{H53} invited{H7121}{(H8799)} all the king's{H4428} sons{H1121}."
2 Samuel,13,24,"And Absalom{H53} came{H935}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold now, thy servant{H5650} hath sheepshearers{H1494}{(H8802)}; let{H3212} the king{H4428}, I beseech thee, and his servants{H5650} go{H3212}{(H8799)} with thy servant{H5650}."
2 Samuel,13,25,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Absalom{H53}, Nay, my son{H1121}, let us not all now go{H3212}{(H8799)}, lest we be chargeable{H3513}{(H8799)} unto thee. And he pressed{H6555}{(H8799)} him: howbeit he would{H14}{(H8804)} not go{H3212}{(H8800)}, but blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} him."
2 Samuel,13,26,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Absalom{H53}, If not, I pray thee, let my brother{H251} Amnon{H550} go{H3212}{(H8799)} with us. And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Why should he go{H3212}{(H8799)} with thee?"
2 Samuel,13,27,"But Absalom{H53} pressed{H6555}{(H8799)} him, that he let Amnon{H550} and all the king's{H4428} sons{H1121} go{H7971}{(H8799)} with him."
2 Samuel,13,28,"Now Absalom{H53} had commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} his servants{H5288}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Mark{H7200}{(H8798)} ye now when Amnon's{H550} heart{H3820} is merry{H2896} with wine{H3196}, and when I say{H559}{(H8804)} unto you, Smite{H5221}{(H8685)} Amnon{H550}; then kill{H4191}{(H8689)} him, fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not: have not I commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} you? be courageous{H2388}{(H8798)}, and be valiant{H1121}{H2428}."
2 Samuel,13,29,"And the servants{H5288} of Absalom{H53} did{H6213}{(H8799)} unto Amnon{H550} as Absalom{H53} had commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}. Then all the king's{H4428} sons{H1121} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and every man{H376} gat him up{H7392}{(H8799)} upon his mule{H6505}, and fled{H5127}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,13,30,"And it came to pass, while they were in the way{H1870}, that tidings{H8052} came{H935}{(H8804)} to David{H1732}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Absalom{H53} hath slain{H5221}{(H8689)} all the king's{H4428} sons{H1121}, and there is not one{H259} of them left{H3498}{(H8738)}."
2 Samuel,13,31,"Then the king{H4428} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and tare{H7167}{(H8799)} his garments{H899}, and lay{H7901}{(H8799)} on the earth{H776}; and all his servants{H5650} stood{H5324}{(H8737)} by with their clothes{H899} rent{H7167}{(H8803)}."
2 Samuel,13,32,"And Jonadab{H3122}, the son{H1121} of Shimeah{H8093} David's{H1732} brother{H251}, answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let not my lord{H113} suppose{H559}{(H8799)} that they have slain{H4191}{(H8689)} all the young men{H5288} the king's{H4428} sons{H1121}; for Amnon{H550} only is dead{H4191}{(H8804)}: for by the appointment{H6310} of Absalom{H53} this hath been determined{H7760}{(H8803)} from the day{H3117} that he forced{H6031}{(H8763)} his sister{H269} Tamar{H8559}."
2 Samuel,13,33,"Now therefore let not my lord{H113} the king{H4428} take{H7760}{(H8799)} the thing{H1697} to his heart{H3820}, to think{H559}{(H8800)} that all the king's{H4428} sons{H1121} are dead{H4191}{(H8804)}: for Amnon{H550} only is dead{H4191}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,13,34,"But Absalom{H53} fled{H1272}{(H8799)}. And the young man{H5288} that kept the watch{H6822}{(H8802)} lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} his eyes{H5869}, and looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, behold, there came{H1980}{(H8802)} much{H7227} people{H5971} by the way{H1870} of the hill{H2022} side{H6654} behind{H310} him."
2 Samuel,13,35,"And Jonadab{H3122} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, Behold, the king's{H4428} sons{H1121} come{H935}{(H8804)}: as thy servant{H5650} said{H1697}, so it is."
2 Samuel,13,36,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end{H3615}{(H8763)} of speaking{H1696}{(H8763)}, that, behold, the king's{H4428} sons{H1121} came{H935}{(H8804)}, and lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} their voice{H6963} and wept{H1058}{(H8799)}: and the king{H4428} also and all his servants{H5650} wept{H1058}{(H8804)} very{H3966} sore{H1065}{H1419}."
2 Samuel,13,37,"But Absalom{H53} fled{H1272}{(H8804)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Talmai{H8526}, the son{H1121} of Ammihud{H5991}{(H8675)}{H5989}, king{H4428} of Geshur{H1650}. And David mourned{H56}{(H8691)} for his son{H1121} every day{H3117}."
2 Samuel,13,38,"So Absalom{H53} fled{H1272}{(H8804)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Geshur{H1650}, and was there three{H7969} years{H8141}."
2 Samuel,13,39,"And the soul of king{H4428} David{H1732} longed{H3615}{(H8762)} to go forth{H3318}{(H8800)} unto Absalom{H53}: for he was comforted{H5162}{(H8738)} concerning Amnon{H550}, seeing he was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,14,1,Now Joab{H3097} the son{H1121} of Zeruiah{H6870} perceived{H3045}{(H8799)} that the king's{H4428} heart{H3820} was toward Absalom{H53}.
2 Samuel,14,2,"And Joab{H3097} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Tekoah{H8620}, and fetched{H3947}{(H8799)} thence a wise{H2450} woman{H802}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner{H56}{(H8693)}, and put on{H3847}{(H8798)} now mourning{H60} apparel{H899}, and anoint{H5480}{(H8799)} not thyself with oil{H8081}, but be as a woman{H802} that had a long{H7227} time{H3117} mourned{H56}{(H8690)} for the dead{H4191}{(H8801)}:"
2 Samuel,14,3,"And come{H935}{(H8804)} to the king{H4428}, and speak{H1696}{(H8765)} on this manner{H1697} unto him. So Joab{H3097} put{H7760}{(H8799)} the words{H1697} in her mouth{H6310}."
2 Samuel,14,4,"And when the woman{H802} of Tekoah{H8621} spake{H559}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428}, she fell{H5307}{(H8799)} on her face{H639} to the ground{H776}, and did obeisance{H7812}{(H8691)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Help{H3467}{(H8685)}, O king{H4428}."
2 Samuel,14,5,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered{H559}{(H8799)}, I am indeed{H61} a widow{H490} woman{H802}, and mine husband{H376} is dead{H4191}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,14,6,"And thy handmaid{H8198} had two{H8147} sons{H1121}, and they two{H8147} strove together{H5327}{(H8735)} in the field{H7704}, and there was none to part{H5337}{(H8688)} them, but the one{H259} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the other{H259}, and slew{H4191}{(H8686)} him."
2 Samuel,14,7,"And, behold, the whole family{H4940} is risen{H6965}{(H8804)} against thine handmaid{H8198}, and they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Deliver{H5414}{(H8798)} him that smote{H5221}{(H8688)} his brother{H251}, that we may kill{H4191}{(H8686)} him, for the life{H5315} of his brother{H251} whom he slew{H2026}{(H8804)}; and we will destroy{H8045}{(H8686)} the heir{H3423}{(H8802)} also: and so they shall quench{H3518}{(H8765)} my coal{H1513} which is left{H7760}{(H8800)}, and shall not leave{H7604}{(H8738)} to my husband{H376} neither name{H8034} nor remainder{H7611} upon{H6440} the earth{H127}."
2 Samuel,14,8,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the woman{H802}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} to thine house{H1004}, and I will give charge{H6680}{(H8762)} concerning thee."
2 Samuel,14,9,"And the woman{H802} of Tekoah{H8621} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, My lord{H113}, O king{H4428}, the iniquity{H5771} be on me, and on my father's{H1} house{H1004}: and the king{H4428} and his throne{H3678} be guiltless{H5355}."
2 Samuel,14,10,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Whosoever saith{H1696}{(H8764)} ought unto thee, bring{H935}{(H8689)} him to me, and he shall not touch{H5060}{(H8800)} thee any more{H3254}{(H8686)}."
2 Samuel,14,11,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} she, I pray thee, let the king{H4428} remember{H2142}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers{H1350}{(H8802)} of blood{H1818} to destroy{H7843}{(H8763)} any more{H7235}{(H8687)}, lest they destroy{H8045}{(H8686)} my son{H1121}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, there shall not one hair{H8185} of thy son{H1121} fall{H5307}{(H8799)} to the earth{H776}."
2 Samuel,14,12,"Then the woman{H802} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let thine handmaid{H8198}, I pray thee, speak{H1696}{(H8762)} one word{H1697} unto my lord{H113} the king{H4428}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Say on{H1696}{(H8761)}."
2 Samuel,14,13,"And the woman{H802} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Wherefore then hast thou thought{H2803}{(H8804)} such a thing against the people{H5971} of God{H430}? for the king{H4428} doth speak{H1696}{(H8693)} this thing{H1697} as one which is faulty{H818}, in that the king{H4428} doth not fetch home again{H7725}{(H8687)} his banished{H5080}{(H8737)}."
2 Samuel,14,14,"For we must needs{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}, and are as water{H4325} spilt{H5064}{(H8737)} on the ground{H776}, which cannot be gathered up again{H622}{(H8735)}; neither doth God{H430} respect{H5375}{(H8799)} any person{H5315}: yet doth he devise{H2803}{(H8804)} means{H4284}, that his banished{H5080}{(H8737)} be not expelled{H5080}{(H8799)} from him."
2 Samuel,14,15,"Now therefore that I am come{H935}{(H8804)} to speak{H1696}{(H8763)} of this thing{H1697} unto my lord{H113} the king{H4428}, it is because the people{H5971} have made me afraid{H3372}{(H8765)}: and thy handmaid{H8198} said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will now speak{H1696}{(H8762)} unto the king{H4428}; it may be that the king{H4428} will perform{H6213}{(H8799)} the request{H1697} of his handmaid{H519}."
2 Samuel,14,16,"For the king{H4428} will hear{H8085}{(H8799)}, to deliver{H5337}{(H8687)} his handmaid{H519} out of the hand{H3709} of the man{H376} that would destroy{H8045}{(H8687)} me and my son{H1121} together{H3162} out of the inheritance{H5159} of God{H430}."
2 Samuel,14,17,"Then thine handmaid{H8198} said{H559}{(H8799)}, The word{H1697} of my lord{H113} the king{H4428} shall now be comfortable{H4496}: for as an angel{H4397} of God{H430}, so is my lord{H113} the king{H4428} to discern{H8085}{(H8800)} good{H2896} and bad{H7451}: therefore the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} will be with thee."
2 Samuel,14,18,"Then the king{H4428} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the woman{H802}, Hide{H3582}{(H8762)} not from me, I pray thee, the thing{H1697} that I shall ask{H7592}{(H8802)} thee. And the woman{H802} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let my lord{H113} the king{H4428} now speak{H1696}{(H8762)}."
2 Samuel,14,19,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is not the hand{H3027} of Joab{H3097} with thee in all this? And the woman{H802} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, As thy soul{H5315} liveth{H2416}, my lord{H113} the king{H4428}, none{H376} can{H786} turn to the right hand{H3231}{(H8687)} or to the left{H8041}{(H8687)} from ought that my lord{H113} the king{H4428} hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}: for thy servant{H5650} Joab{H3097}, he bade{H6680}{(H8765)} me, and he put{H7760}{(H8804)} all these words{H1697} in the mouth{H6310} of thine handmaid{H8198}:"
2 Samuel,14,20,"To{H5668} fetch about{H5437}{(H8763)} this form{H6440} of speech{H1697} hath thy servant{H5650} Joab{H3097} done{H6213}{(H8804)} this thing{H1697}: and my lord{H113} is wise{H2450}, according to the wisdom{H2451} of an angel{H4397} of God{H430}, to know{H3045}{(H8800)} all things that are in the earth{H776}."
2 Samuel,14,21,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joab{H3097}, Behold now, I have done{H6213}{(H8804)} this thing{H1697}: go{H3212}{(H8798)} therefore, bring{H7725} the young man{H5288} Absalom{H53} again{H7725}{(H8685)}."
2 Samuel,14,22,"And Joab{H3097} fell{H5307}{(H8799)} to the ground{H776} on his face{H6440}, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} himself, and thanked{H1288}{(H8762)} the king{H4428}: and Joab{H3097} said{H559}{(H8799)}, To day{H3117} thy servant{H5650} knoweth{H3045}{(H8804)} that I have found{H4672}{(H8804)} grace{H2580} in thy sight{H5869}, my lord{H113}, O king{H4428}, in that the king{H4428} hath fulfilled{H6213}{(H8804)} the request{H1697} of his servant{H5650}."
2 Samuel,14,23,"So Joab{H3097} arose{H6965}{(H8799)} and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Geshur{H1650}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} Absalom{H53} to Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Samuel,14,24,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let him turn{H5437}{(H8735)} to his own house{H1004}, and let him not see{H7200}{(H8799)} my face{H6440}. So Absalom{H53} returned{H5437}{(H8735)} to his own house{H1004}, and saw{H7200}{(H8804)} not the king's{H4428} face{H6440}."
2 Samuel,14,25,But in all Israel{H3478} there was none{H376} to be so much{H3966} praised{H1984}{(H8763)} as Absalom{H53} for his beauty{H3303}: from the sole{H3709} of his foot{H7272} even to the crown of his head{H6936} there was no blemish{H3971} in him.
2 Samuel,14,26,"And when he polled{H1548}{(H8763)} his head{H7218},(for it was at every year's{H3117}{H3117} end{H7093} that he polled{H1548}{(H8762)} it: because the hair was heavy{H3513}{(H8804)} on him, therefore he polled{H1548}{(H8765)} it:) he weighed{H8254}{(H8804)} the hair{H8181} of his head{H7218} at two hundred{H3967} shekels{H8255} after the king's{H4428} weight{H68}."
2 Samuel,14,27,"And unto Absalom{H53} there were born{H3205}{(H8735)} three{H7969} sons{H1121}, and one{H259} daughter{H1323}, whose name{H8034} was Tamar{H8559}: she was a woman{H802} of a fair{H3303} countenance{H4758}."
2 Samuel,14,28,"So Absalom{H53} dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} two full{H3117} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}, and saw{H7200}{(H8804)} not the king's{H4428} face{H6440}."
2 Samuel,14,29,"Therefore Absalom{H53} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} for Joab{H3097}, to have sent{H7971}{(H8800)} him to the king{H4428}; but he would{H14}{(H8804)} not come{H935}{(H8800)} to him: and when he sent again{H7971}{(H8799)} the second time{H8145}, he would{H14}{(H8804)} not come{H935}{(H8800)}."
2 Samuel,14,30,"Therefore he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his servants{H5650}, See{H7200}{(H8798)}, Joab's{H3097} field{H2513} is near{H413} mine{H3027}, and he hath barley{H8184} there; go{H3212}{(H8798)} and set{H3341}{(H8685)} it on fire{H784}. And Absalom's{H53} servants{H5650} set{H3341}{(H8686)} the field{H2513} on fire{H784}."
2 Samuel,14,31,"Then Joab{H3097} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Absalom{H53} unto his house{H1004}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Wherefore have thy servants{H5650} set{H3341}{(H8689)} my field{H2513} on fire{H784}?"
2 Samuel,14,32,"And Absalom{H53} answered{H559}{(H8799)} Joab{H3097}, Behold, I sent{H7971}{(H8804)} unto thee, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Come{H935}{(H8798)} hither, that I may send{H7971}{(H8799)} thee to the king{H4428}, to say{H559}{(H8800)}, Wherefore am I come{H935}{(H8804)} from Geshur{H1650}? it had been good{H2896} for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see{H7200}{(H8799)} the king's{H4428} face{H6440}; and if there be{H3426} any iniquity{H5771} in me, let him kill{H4191}{(H8689)} me."
2 Samuel,14,33,"So Joab{H3097} came{H935}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428}, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} him: and when he had called{H7121}{(H8799)} for Absalom{H53}, he came{H935}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428}, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} himself on his face{H639} to the ground{H776} before{H6440} the king{H4428}: and the king{H4428} kissed{H5401}{(H8799)} Absalom{H53}."
2 Samuel,15,1,"And it came to pass after this{H310}, that Absalom{H53} prepared{H6213}{(H8799)} him chariots{H4818} and horses{H5483}, and fifty{H2572} men{H376} to run{H7323}{(H8801)} before{H6440} him."
2 Samuel,15,2,"And Absalom{H53} rose up early{H7925}{(H8689)}, and stood{H5975}{(H8804)} beside{H3027} the way{H1870} of the gate{H8179}: and it was so, that when any man{H376} that had a controversy{H7379} came{H935}{(H8800)} to the king{H4428} for judgment{H4941}, then Absalom{H53} called{H7121}{(H8799)} unto him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Of what{H335} city{H5892} art thou? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thy servant{H5650} is of one{H259} of the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Samuel,15,3,"And Absalom{H53} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, See{H7200}{(H8798)}, thy matters{H1697} are good{H2896} and right{H5228}; but there is no man deputed of the king{H4428} to hear{H8085}{(H8802)} thee."
2 Samuel,15,4,"Absalom{H53} said{H559}{(H8799)} moreover, Oh that I were made{H7760}{(H8799)} judge{H8199}{(H8802)} in the land{H776}, that every man{H376} which hath any suit{H7379} or cause{H4941} might come{H935}{(H8799)} unto me, and I would do him justice{H6663}{(H8689)}!"
2 Samuel,15,5,"And it was so, that when any man{H376} came nigh{H7126}{(H8800)} to him to do him obeisance{H7812}{(H8692)}, he put forth{H7971}{(H8804)} his hand{H3027}, and took{H2388}{(H8689)} him, and kissed{H5401}{(H8804)} him."
2 Samuel,15,6,And on this manner{H1697} did{H6213}{(H8799)} Absalom{H53} to all Israel{H3478} that came{H935}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} for judgment{H4941}: so Absalom{H53} stole{H1589}{(H8762)} the hearts{H3820} of the men{H582} of Israel{H3478}.
2 Samuel,15,7,"And it came to pass after{H7093} forty{H705} years{H8141}, that Absalom{H53} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, I pray thee, let me go{H3212}{(H8799)} and pay{H7999}{(H8762)} my vow{H5088}, which I have vowed{H5087}{(H8804)} unto the LORD{H3068}, in Hebron{H2275}."
2 Samuel,15,8,"For thy servant{H5650} vowed{H5087}{(H8804)} a vow{H5088} while I abode{H3427}{(H8800)} at Geshur{H1650} in Syria{H758}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, If the LORD{H3068} shall bring me again{H7725}{(H8799)}{(H8676)}{H7725}{(H8686)} indeed to Jerusalem{H3389}, then I will serve{H5647}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}."
2 Samuel,15,9,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} in peace{H7965}. So he arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Hebron{H2275}."
2 Samuel,15,10,"But Absalom{H53} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} spies{H7270}{(H8764)} throughout all the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, As soon as ye hear{H8085}{(H8800)} the sound{H6963} of the trumpet{H7782}, then ye shall say{H559}{(H8804)}, Absalom{H53} reigneth{H4427}{(H8804)} in Hebron{H2275}."
2 Samuel,15,11,"And with Absalom{H53} went{H1980}{(H8804)} two hundred{H3967} men{H376} out of Jerusalem{H3389}, that were called{H7121}{(H8803)}; and they went{H1980}{(H8802)} in their simplicity{H8537}, and they knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not any thing{H1697}."
2 Samuel,15,12,"And Absalom{H53} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} for Ahithophel{H302} the Gilonite{H1526}, David's{H1732} counsellor{H3289}{(H8802)}, from his city{H5892}, even from Giloh{H1542}, while he offered{H2076}{(H8800)} sacrifices{H2077}. And the conspiracy{H7195} was strong{H533}; for the people{H5971} increased{H7227} continually{H1980}{(H8802)} with Absalom{H53}."
2 Samuel,15,13,"And there came{H935}{(H8799)} a messenger{H5046}{(H8688)} to David{H1732}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The hearts{H3820} of the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} are after{H310} Absalom{H53}."
2 Samuel,15,14,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto all his servants{H5650} that were with him at Jerusalem{H3389}, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, and let us flee{H1272}{(H8799)}; for we shall not else escape{H6413} from{H6440} Absalom{H53}: make speed{H4116}{(H8761)} to depart{H3212}{(H8800)}, lest he overtake{H5381}{(H8689)} us suddenly{H4116}{(H8762)}, and bring{H5080}{(H8689)} evil{H7451} upon us, and smite{H5221}{(H8689)} the city{H5892} with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}."
2 Samuel,15,15,"And the king's{H4428} servants{H5650} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, Behold, thy servants{H5650} are ready to do whatsoever my lord{H113} the king{H4428} shall appoint{H977}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,15,16,"And the king{H4428} went forth{H3318}{(H8799)}, and all his household{H1004} after{H7272} him. And the king{H4428} left{H5800}{(H8799)} ten{H6235} women{H802}, which were concubines{H6370}, to keep{H8104}{(H8800)} the house{H1004}."
2 Samuel,15,17,"And the king{H4428} went forth{H3318}{(H8799)}, and all the people{H5971} after{H7272} him, and tarried{H5975}{(H8799)} in a place{H1004} that was far off{H4801}{(H8677)}{H1023}."
2 Samuel,15,18,"And all his servants{H5650} passed on{H5674}{(H8802)} beside{H3027} him; and all the Cherethites{H3774}, and all the Pelethites{H6432}, and all the Gittites{H1663}, six{H8337} hundred{H3967} men{H376} which came{H935}{(H8804)} after{H7272} him from Gath{H1661}, passed on{H5674}{(H8802)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}."
2 Samuel,15,19,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the king{H4428} to Ittai{H863} the Gittite{H1663}, Wherefore goest{H3212}{(H8799)} thou also with us? return{H7725}{(H8798)} to thy place{H4725}, and abide{H3427}{(H8798)} with the king{H4428}: for thou art a stranger{H5237}, and also an exile{H1540}{(H8802)}."
2 Samuel,15,20,"Whereas thou camest{H935}{(H8800)} but yesterday{H8543}, should I this day{H3117} make thee go{H3212}{(H8800)} up and down{H5128}{(H8686)}{(H8675)}{H5128}{(H8799)} with us? seeing I go{H1980}{(H8802)} whither I may, return{H7725}{(H8798)} thou, and take back{H7725}{(H8685)} thy brethren{H251}: mercy{H2617} and truth{H571} be with thee."
2 Samuel,15,21,"And Ittai{H863} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the king{H4428}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, and as my lord{H113} the king{H4428} liveth{H2416}, surely in what place{H4725} my lord{H113} the king{H4428} shall be, whether in death{H4194} or life{H2416}, even there also will thy servant{H5650} be."
2 Samuel,15,22,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Ittai{H863}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} and pass over{H5674}{(H8798)}. And Ittai{H863} the Gittite{H1663} passed over{H5674}{(H8799)}, and all his men{H582}, and all the little ones{H2945} that were with him."
2 Samuel,15,23,"And all the country{H776} wept{H1058}{(H8802)} with a loud{H1419} voice{H6963}, and all the people{H5971} passed over{H5674}{(H8802)}: the king{H4428} also himself passed over{H5674}{(H8802)} the brook{H5158} Kidron{H6939}, and all the people{H5971} passed over{H5674}{(H8802)}, toward{H6440} the way{H1870} of the wilderness{H4057}."
2 Samuel,15,24,"And lo Zadok{H6659} also, and all the Levites{H3881} were with him, bearing{H5375}{(H8802)} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of God{H430}: and they set down{H3332}{(H8686)} the ark{H727} of God{H430}; and Abiathar{H54} went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, until all the people{H5971} had done{H8552}{(H8800)} passing{H5674}{(H8800)} out of the city{H5892}."
2 Samuel,15,25,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Zadok{H6659}, Carry back{H7725}{(H8685)} the ark{H727} of God{H430} into the city{H5892}: if I shall find{H4672}{(H8799)} favour{H2580} in the eyes{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, he will bring me again{H7725}{(H8689)}, and shew{H7200}{(H8689)} me both it, and his habitation{H5116}:"
2 Samuel,15,26,"But if he thus say{H559}{(H8799)}, I have no delight{H2654}{(H8804)} in thee; behold, here am I, let him do{H6213}{(H8799)} to me as seemeth{H5869} good{H2896} unto him."
2 Samuel,15,27,"The king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} also unto Zadok{H6659} the priest{H3548}, Art not thou a seer{H7200}{(H8802)}? return{H7725}{(H8798)} into the city{H5892} in peace{H7965}, and your two{H8147} sons{H1121} with you, Ahimaaz{H290} thy son{H1121}, and Jonathan{H3083} the son{H1121} of Abiathar{H54}."
2 Samuel,15,28,"See{H7200}{(H8798)}, I will tarry{H4102}{(H8700)} in the plain{H6160}{(H8675)}{H5679} of the wilderness{H4057}, until there come{H935}{(H8800)} word{H1697} from you to certify{H5046}{(H8687)} me."
2 Samuel,15,29,Zadok{H6659} therefore and Abiathar{H54} carried{H7725} the ark{H727} of God{H430} again{H7725}{(H8686)} to Jerusalem{H3389}: and they tarried{H3427}{(H8799)} there.
2 Samuel,15,30,"And David{H1732} went up{H5927}{(H8802)} by the ascent{H4608} of mount Olivet{H2132}, and wept{H1058}{(H8802)} as he went up{H5927}{(H8802)}, and had his head{H7218} covered{H2645}{(H8802)}, and he went{H1980}{(H8802)} barefoot{H3182}: and all the people{H5971} that was with him covered{H2645}{(H8804)} every man{H376} his head{H7218}, and they went up{H5927}{(H8804)}, weeping{H1058}{(H8800)} as they went up{H5927}{(H8800)}."
2 Samuel,15,31,"And one told{H5046}{(H8689)} David{H1732}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Ahithophel{H302} is among the conspirators{H7194}{(H8802)} with Absalom{H53}. And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)}, O LORD{H3068}, I pray thee, turn the counsel{H6098} of Ahithophel{H302} into foolishness{H5528}{(H8761)}."
2 Samuel,15,32,"And it came to pass, that when David{H1732} was come{H935}{(H8804)} to the top{H7218} of the mount, where he worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)} God{H430}, behold, Hushai{H2365} the Archite{H757} came to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} him with his coat{H3801} rent{H7167}{(H8803)}, and earth{H127} upon his head{H7218}:"
2 Samuel,15,33,"Unto whom David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)}, If thou passest on{H5674}{(H8804)} with me, then thou shalt be a burden{H4853} unto me:"
2 Samuel,15,34,"But if thou return{H7725}{(H8799)} to the city{H5892}, and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto Absalom{H53}, I will be thy servant{H5650}, O king{H4428}; as I have been thy father's{H1} servant{H5650} hitherto{H227}, so will I now also be thy servant{H5650}: then mayest thou for me defeat{H6565}{(H8689)} the counsel{H6098} of Ahithophel{H302}."
2 Samuel,15,35,"And hast thou not there with thee Zadok{H6659} and Abiathar{H54} the priests{H3548}? therefore it shall be, that what thing{H1697} soever thou shalt hear{H8085}{(H8799)} out of the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, thou shalt tell{H5046}{(H8686)} it to Zadok{H6659} and Abiathar{H54} the priests{H3548}."
2 Samuel,15,36,"Behold, they have there with them their two{H8147} sons{H1121}, Ahimaaz{H290} Zadok's{H6659} son, and Jonathan{H3083} Abiathar's{H54} son; and by them{H3027} ye shall send{H7971}{(H8804)} unto me every thing{H1697} that ye can hear{H8085}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,15,37,"So Hushai{H2365} David's{H1732} friend{H7463} came{H935}{(H8799)} into the city{H5892}, and Absalom{H53} came{H935}{(H8799)} into Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Samuel,16,1,"And when David{H1732} was a little{H4592} past{H5674}{(H8804)} the top{H7218} of the hill, behold, Ziba{H6717} the servant{H5288} of Mephibosheth{H4648} met{H7125}{(H8800)} him, with a couple{H6776} of asses{H2543} saddled{H2280}{(H8803)}, and upon them two hundred{H3967} loaves of bread{H3899}, and an hundred{H3967} bunches of raisins{H6778}, and an hundred{H3967} of summer fruits{H7019}, and a bottle{H5035} of wine{H3196}."
2 Samuel,16,2,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Ziba{H6717}, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba{H6717} said{H559}{(H8799)}, The asses{H2543} be for the king's{H4428} household{H1004} to ride on{H7392}{(H8800)}; and the bread{H3899} and summer fruit{H7019} for the young men{H5288} to eat{H398}{(H8800)}; and the wine{H3196}, that such as be faint{H3287} in the wilderness{H4057} may drink{H8354}{(H8800)}."
2 Samuel,16,3,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, And where is thy master's{H113} son{H1121}? And Ziba{H6717} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, Behold, he abideth{H3427}{(H8802)} at Jerusalem{H3389}: for he said{H559}{(H8804)}, To day{H3117} shall the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} restore{H7725}{(H8686)} me the kingdom{H4468} of my father{H1}."
2 Samuel,16,4,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the king{H4428} to Ziba{H6717}, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth{H4648}. And Ziba{H6717} said{H559}{(H8799)}, I humbly{H7812}{(H8694)} beseech thee that I may find{H4672}{(H8799)} grace{H2580} in thy sight{H5869}, my lord{H113}, O king{H4428}."
2 Samuel,16,5,"And when king{H4428} David{H1732} came{H935}{(H8804)} to Bahurim{H980}, behold, thence came out{H3318}{(H8802)} a man{H376} of the family{H4940} of the house{H1004} of Saul{H7586}, whose name{H8034} was Shimei{H8096}, the son{H1121} of Gera{H1617}: he came forth{H3318}{(H8802)}, and cursed{H7043}{(H8764)} still as he came{H3318}{(H8800)}."
2 Samuel,16,6,"And he cast{H5619}{(H8762)} stones{H68} at David{H1732}, and at all the servants{H5650} of king{H4428} David{H1732}: and all the people{H5971} and all the mighty men{H1368} were on his right hand{H3225} and on his left{H8040}."
2 Samuel,16,7,"And thus said{H559}{(H8804)} Shimei{H8096} when he cursed{H7043}{(H8763)}, Come out{H3318}{(H8798)}, come out{H3318}{(H8798)}, thou bloody{H1818} man{H376}, and thou man{H376} of Belial{H1100}:"
2 Samuel,16,8,"The LORD{H3068} hath returned{H7725}{(H8689)} upon thee all the blood{H1818} of the house{H1004} of Saul{H7586}, in whose stead thou hast reigned{H4427}{(H8804)}; and the LORD{H3068} hath delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} the kingdom{H4410} into the hand{H3027} of Absalom{H53} thy son{H1121}: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief{H7451}, because thou art a bloody{H1818} man{H376}."
2 Samuel,16,9,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Abishai{H52} the son{H1121} of Zeruiah{H6870} unto the king{H4428}, Why should this dead{H4191}{(H8801)} dog{H3611} curse{H7043}{(H8762)} my lord{H113} the king{H4428}? let me go over{H5674}{(H8799)}, I pray thee, and take off{H5493}{(H8686)} his head{H7218}."
2 Samuel,16,10,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, What have I to do with you, ye sons{H1121} of Zeruiah{H6870}? so let him curse{H7043}{(H8762)}, because the LORD{H3068} hath said{H559}{(H8804)} unto him, Curse{H7043}{(H8761)} David{H1732}. Who shall then say{H559}{(H8799)}, Wherefore hast thou done so{H6213}{(H8804)}?"
2 Samuel,16,11,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Abishai{H52}, and to all his servants{H5650}, Behold, my son{H1121}, which came forth{H3318}{(H8804)} of my bowels{H4578}, seeketh{H1245}{(H8764)} my life{H5315}: how much more now may this Benjamite{H1145} do it? let him alone{H3240}{(H8685)}, and let him curse{H7043}{(H8762)}; for the LORD{H3068} hath bidden{H559}{(H8804)} him."
2 Samuel,16,12,"It may be that the LORD{H3068} will look{H7200}{(H8799)} on mine affliction{H5869}{(H8675)}{H6040}, and that the LORD{H3068} will requite{H7725}{(H8689)} me good{H2896} for his cursing{H7045} this day{H3117}."
2 Samuel,16,13,"And as David{H1732} and his men{H582} went{H3212}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870}, Shimei{H8096} went along{H1980}{(H8802)} on the hill's{H2022} side{H6763} over against{H5980} him, and cursed{H7043}{(H8762)} as he went{H1980}{(H8800)}, and threw{H5619}{(H8762)} stones{H68} at{H5980} him, and cast{H6080}{(H8765)} dust{H6083}."
2 Samuel,16,14,"And the king{H4428}, and all the people{H5971} that were with him, came{H935}{(H8799)} weary{H5889}, and refreshed{H5314}{(H8735)} themselves there."
2 Samuel,16,15,"And Absalom{H53}, and all the people{H5971} the men{H376} of Israel{H3478}, came{H935}{(H8804)} to Jerusalem{H3389}, and Ahithophel{H302} with him."
2 Samuel,16,16,"And it came to pass, when Hushai{H2365} the Archite{H757}, David's{H1732} friend{H7463}, was come{H935}{(H8804)} unto Absalom{H53}, that Hushai{H2365} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Absalom{H53}, God save{H2421}{(H8799)} the king{H4428}, God save{H2421}{(H8799)} the king{H4428}."
2 Samuel,16,17,"And Absalom{H53} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Hushai{H2365}, Is this thy kindness{H2617} to thy friend{H7453}? why wentest{H1980}{(H8804)} thou not with thy friend{H7453}?"
2 Samuel,16,18,"And Hushai{H2365} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Absalom{H53}, Nay; but whom the LORD{H3068}, and this people{H5971}, and all the men{H376} of Israel{H3478}, choose{H977}{(H8804)}, his will I be, and with him will I abide{H3427}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,16,19,"And again{H8145}, whom should I serve{H5647}{(H8799)}? should I not serve in the presence{H6440} of his son{H1121}? as I have served{H5647}{(H8804)} in thy father's{H1} presence{H6440}, so will I be in thy presence{H6440}."
2 Samuel,16,20,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Absalom{H53} to Ahithophel{H302}, Give{H3051}{(H8798)} counsel{H6098} among you what we shall do{H6213}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,16,21,"And Ahithophel{H302} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Absalom{H53}, Go in{H935}{(H8798)} unto thy father's{H1} concubines{H6370}, which he hath left{H3240}{(H8689)} to keep{H8104}{(H8800)} the house{H1004}; and all Israel{H3478} shall hear{H8085}{(H8804)} that thou art abhorred{H887}{(H8738)} of thy father{H1}: then shall the hands{H3027} of all that are with thee be strong{H2388}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,16,22,So they spread{H5186}{(H8686)} Absalom{H53} a tent{H168} upon the top of the house{H1406}; and Absalom{H53} went in{H935}{(H8799)} unto his father's{H1} concubines{H6370} in the sight{H5869} of all Israel{H3478}.
2 Samuel,16,23,"And the counsel{H6098} of Ahithophel{H302}, which he counselled{H3289}{(H8804)} in those days{H3117}, was as if a man{H376} had enquired{H7592}{(H8799)} at the oracle{H1697} of God{H430}: so was all the counsel{H6098} of Ahithophel{H302} both with David{H1732} and with Absalom{H53}."
2 Samuel,17,1,"Moreover Ahithophel{H302} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Absalom{H53}, Let me now choose out{H977}{(H8799)} twelve{H8147}{H6240} thousand{H505} men{H376}, and I will arise{H6965}{(H8799)} and pursue{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} David{H1732} this night{H3915}:"
2 Samuel,17,2,"And I will come{H935}{(H8799)} upon him while he is weary{H3023} and weak{H7504} handed{H3027}, and will make him afraid{H2729}{(H8689)}: and all the people{H5971} that are with him shall flee{H5127}{(H8804)}; and I will smite{H5221}{(H8689)} the king{H4428} only:"
2 Samuel,17,3,And I will bring back{H7725}{(H8686)} all the people{H5971} unto thee: the man{H376} whom thou seekest{H1245}{(H8764)} is as if all returned{H7725}{(H8800)}: so all the people{H5971} shall be in peace{H7965}.
2 Samuel,17,4,"And the saying{H1697} pleased{H3474}{(H8799)} Absalom{H53} well{H5869}, and all the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Samuel,17,5,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Absalom{H53}, Call{H7121}{(H8798)} now Hushai{H2365} the Archite{H757} also, and let us hear{H8085}{(H8799)} likewise what he saith{H6310}."
2 Samuel,17,6,"And when Hushai{H2365} was come{H935}{(H8799)} to Absalom{H53}, Absalom{H53} spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Ahithophel{H302} hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} after this manner{H1697}: shall we do{H6213}{(H8799)} after his saying{H1697}? if not; speak{H1696}{(H8761)} thou."
2 Samuel,17,7,"And Hushai{H2365} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Absalom{H53}, The counsel{H6098} that Ahithophel{H302} hath given{H3289}{(H8804)} is not good{H2896} at this time{H6471}."
2 Samuel,17,8,"For, said{H559}{(H8799)} Hushai{H2365}, thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} thy father{H1} and his men{H582}, that they be mighty men{H1368}, and they be chafed{H4751} in their minds{H5315}, as a bear{H1677} robbed{H7909} of her whelps in the field{H7704}: and thy father{H1} is a man{H376} of war{H4421}, and will not lodge{H3885}{(H8799)} with the people{H5971}."
2 Samuel,17,9,"Behold, he is hid{H2244}{(H8737)} now in some{H259} pit{H6354}, or in some{H259} other place{H4725}: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown{H5307}{(H8800)} at the first{H8462}, that whosoever{H8085}{(H8802)} heareth{H8085}{(H8804)} it will say{H559}{(H8804)}, There is a slaughter{H4046} among the people{H5971} that follow{H310} Absalom{H53}."
2 Samuel,17,10,"And he also that is valiant{H1121}{H2428}, whose heart{H3820} is as the heart{H3820} of a lion{H738}, shall utterly{H4549}{(H8736)} melt{H4549}{(H8735)}: for all Israel{H3478} knoweth{H3045}{(H8802)} that thy father{H1} is a mighty man{H1368}, and they which be with him are valiant{H2428} men{H1121}."
2 Samuel,17,11,"Therefore I counsel{H3289}{(H8804)} that all Israel{H3478} be generally{H622}{(H8736)} gathered{H622}{(H8735)} unto thee, from Dan{H1835} even to Beersheba{H884}, as the sand{H2344} that is by the sea{H3220} for multitude{H7230}; and that thou go{H1980}{(H8802)} to battle{H7128} in thine own person{H6440}."
2 Samuel,17,12,"So shall we come{H935}{(H8804)} upon him in some{H259} place{H4725} where he shall be found{H4672}{(H8738)}, and we will light{H5168} upon him as the dew{H2919} falleth{H5307}{(H8799)} on the ground{H127}: and of him and of all the men{H582} that are with him there shall not be left{H3498}{(H8738)} so much as{H1571} one{H259}."
2 Samuel,17,13,"Moreover, if{H518} he be gotten{H622}{(H8735)} into a city{H5892}, then shall all Israel{H3478} bring{H5375}{(H8689)} ropes{H2256} to that city{H5892}, and we will draw{H5498}{(H8804)} it into the river{H5158}, until there be not one{H1571} small stone{H6872} found{H4672}{(H8738)} there."
2 Samuel,17,14,"And Absalom{H53} and all the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)}, The counsel{H6098} of Hushai{H2365} the Archite{H757} is better{H2896} than the counsel{H6098} of Ahithophel{H302}. For the LORD{H3068} had appointed{H6680}{(H8765)} to defeat{H6565}{(H8687)} the good{H2896} counsel{H6098} of Ahithophel{H302}, to the intent{H5668} that the LORD{H3068} might bring{H935}{(H8687)} evil{H7451} upon Absalom{H53}."
2 Samuel,17,15,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Hushai{H2365} unto Zadok{H6659} and to Abiathar{H54} the priests{H3548}, Thus and thus did Ahithophel{H302} counsel{H3289}{(H8804)} Absalom{H53} and the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478}; and thus and thus have I counselled{H3289}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,17,16,"Now therefore send{H7971}{(H8798)} quickly{H4120}, and tell{H5046}{(H8685)} David{H1732}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Lodge{H3885}{(H8799)} not this night{H3915} in the plains{H6160}{(H8675)}{H5679} of the wilderness{H4057}, but speedily{H5674}{(H8800)} pass over{H5674}{(H8799)}; lest the king{H4428} be swallowed up{H1104}{(H8792)}, and all the people{H5971} that are with him."
2 Samuel,17,17,Now Jonathan{H3083} and Ahimaaz{H290} stayed{H5975}{(H8802)} by Enrogel{H5883}; for they might{H3201}{(H8799)} not be seen{H7200}{(H8736)} to come{H935}{(H8800)} into the city{H5892}: and a wench{H8198} went{H1980}{(H8804)} and told{H5046}{(H8689)} them; and they went{H3212}{(H8799)} and told{H5046}{(H8689)} king{H4428} David{H1732}.
2 Samuel,17,18,"Nevertheless a lad{H5288} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} them, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} Absalom{H53}: but they went{H3212}{(H8799)} both{H8147} of them away quickly{H4120}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to a man's{H376} house{H1004} in Bahurim{H980}, which had a well{H875} in his court{H2691}; whither{H8033} they went down{H3381}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,17,19,"And the woman{H802} took{H3947}{(H8799)} and spread{H6566}{(H8799)} a covering{H4539} over the well's{H875} mouth{H6440}, and spread{H7849}{(H8799)} ground corn{H7383} thereon; and the thing{H1697} was not known{H3045}{(H8738)}."
2 Samuel,17,20,"And when Absalom's{H53} servants{H5650} came{H935}{(H8799)} to the woman{H802} to the house{H1004}, they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Where is Ahimaaz{H290} and Jonathan{H3083}? And the woman{H802} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, They be gone over{H5674}{(H8804)} the brook{H4323} of water{H4325}. And when they had sought{H1245}{(H8762)} and could not find{H4672}{(H8804)} them, they returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Samuel,17,21,"And it came to pass, after{H310} they were departed{H3212}{(H8800)}, that they came up{H5927}{(H8799)} out of the well{H875}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} and told{H5046}{(H8686)} king{H4428} David{H1732}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, and pass quickly{H4120} over{H5674}{(H8798)} the water{H4325}: for thus hath Ahithophel{H302} counselled{H3289}{(H8804)} against you."
2 Samuel,17,22,"Then David{H1732} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and all the people{H5971} that were with him, and they passed over{H5674}{(H8799)} Jordan{H3383}: by the morning{H1242} light{H216} there lacked{H5737}{(H8738)} not one{H259} of them that was not gone over{H5674}{(H8804)} Jordan{H3383}."
2 Samuel,17,23,"And when Ahithophel{H302} saw{H7200}{(H8804)} that his counsel{H6098} was not followed{H6213}{(H8738)}, he saddled{H2280}{(H8799)} his ass{H2543}, and arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and gat him home{H3212}{(H8799)} to his house{H1004}, to his city{H5892}, and put his household{H1004} in order{H6680}{(H8762)}, and hanged{H2614}{(H8735)} himself, and died{H4191}{(H8799)}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} in the sepulchre{H6913} of his father{H1}."
2 Samuel,17,24,"Then David{H1732} came{H935}{(H8804)} to Mahanaim{H4266}. And Absalom{H53} passed over{H5674}{(H8804)} Jordan{H3383}, he and all the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} with him."
2 Samuel,17,25,"And Absalom{H53} made{H7760}{(H8804)} Amasa{H6021} captain of the host{H6635} instead of Joab{H3097}: which Amasa{H6021} was a man's{H376} son{H1121}, whose name{H8034} was Ithra{H3501} an Israelite{H3481}, that went in{H935}{(H8804)} to Abigail{H26} the daughter{H1323} of Nahash{H5176}, sister{H269} to Zeruiah{H6870} Joab's{H3097} mother{H517}."
2 Samuel,17,26,So Israel{H3478} and Absalom{H53} pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} in the land{H776} of Gilead{H1568}.
2 Samuel,17,27,"And it came to pass, when David{H1732} was come{H935}{(H8800)} to Mahanaim{H4266}, that Shobi{H7629} the son{H1121} of Nahash{H5176} of Rabbah{H7237} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, and Machir{H4353} the son{H1121} of Ammiel{H5988} of Lodebar{H3810}, and Barzillai{H1271} the Gileadite{H1569} of Rogelim{H7274},"
2 Samuel,17,28,"Brought{H5066}{(H8689)} beds{H4904}, and basons{H5592}, and earthen{H3335}{(H8802)} vessels{H3627}, and wheat{H2406}, and barley{H8184}, and flour{H7058}, and parched{H7039} corn, and beans{H6321}, and lentiles{H5742}, and parched{H7039} pulse,"
2 Samuel,17,29,"And honey{H1706}, and butter{H2529}, and sheep{H6629}, and cheese{H8194} of kine{H1241}, for David{H1732}, and for the people{H5971} that were with him, to eat{H398}{(H8800)}: for they said{H559}{(H8804)}, The people{H5971} is hungry{H7457}, and weary{H5889}, and thirsty{H6771}, in the wilderness{H4057}."
2 Samuel,18,1,"And David{H1732} numbered{H6485}{(H8799)} the people{H5971} that were with him, and set{H7760}{(H8799)} captains{H8269} of thousands{H505} and captains{H8269} of hundreds{H3967} over them."
2 Samuel,18,2,"And David{H1732} sent forth{H7971}{(H8762)} a third part{H7992} of the people{H5971} under the hand{H3027} of Joab{H3097}, and a third part{H7992} under the hand{H3027} of Abishai{H52} the son{H1121} of Zeruiah{H6870}, Joab's{H3097} brother{H251}, and a third part{H7992} under the hand{H3027} of Ittai{H863} the Gittite{H1663}. And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the people{H5971}, I will surely{H3318}{(H8800)} go forth{H3318}{(H8799)} with you myself{H589} also."
2 Samuel,18,3,"But the people{H5971} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou shalt not go forth{H3318}{(H8799)}: for if we flee{H5127}{(H8799)} away{H5127}{(H8800)}, they will not care{H7760}{(H8799)}{H3820} for us; neither if half{H2677} of us die{H4191}{(H8799)}, will they care{H7760}{(H8799)}{H3820} for us: but now thou art worth{H3644} ten{H6235} thousand{H505} of us: therefore now it is better{H2896} that thou succour{H5826}{(H8800)}{(H8675)}{H5826}{(H8687)} us out of the city{H5892}."
2 Samuel,18,4,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, What seemeth{H5869} you best{H3190}{(H8799)} I will do{H6213}{(H8799)}. And the king{H4428} stood{H5975}{(H8799)} by the gate{H8179} side{H3027}, and all the people{H5971} came out{H3318}{(H8804)} by hundreds{H3967} and by thousands{H505}."
2 Samuel,18,5,"And the king{H4428} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} Joab{H3097} and Abishai{H52} and Ittai{H863}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Deal gently{H328} for my sake with the young man{H5288}, even with Absalom{H53}. And all the people{H5971} heard{H8085}{(H8804)} when the king{H4428} gave all the captains{H8269} charge{H6680}{(H8763)} concerning{H1697} Absalom{H53}."
2 Samuel,18,6,So the people{H5971} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} into the field{H7704} against{H7125}{(H8800)} Israel{H3478}: and the battle{H4421} was in the wood{H3293} of Ephraim{H669};
2 Samuel,18,7,"Where the people{H5971} of Israel{H3478} were slain{H5062}{(H8735)} before{H6440} the servants{H5650} of David{H1732}, and there was there a great{H1419} slaughter{H4046} that day{H3117} of twenty{H6242} thousand{H505} men."
2 Samuel,18,8,For the battle{H4421} was there scattered{H6327}{(H8737)} over the face{H6440} of all the country{H776}: and the wood{H3293} devoured{H398}{(H8800)} more{H7235}{(H8686)} people{H5971} that day{H3117} than the sword{H2719} devoured{H398}{(H8804)}.
2 Samuel,18,9,"And Absalom{H53} met{H7122}{(H8735)} the servants{H6440}{H5650} of David{H1732}. And Absalom{H53} rode{H7392}{(H8802)} upon a mule{H6505}, and the mule{H6505} went{H935}{(H8799)} under the thick boughs{H7730} of a great{H1419} oak{H424}, and his head{H7218} caught hold{H2388}{(H8799)} of the oak{H424}, and he was taken up{H5414}{(H8714)} between the heaven{H8064} and the earth{H776}; and the mule{H6505} that was under him went away{H5674}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,18,10,"And a certain{H259} man{H376} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} it, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} Joab{H3097}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} Absalom{H53} hanged{H8518}{(H8803)} in an oak{H424}."
2 Samuel,18,11,"And Joab{H3097} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the man{H376} that told{H5046}{(H8688)} him, And, behold, thou sawest{H7200}{(H8804)} him, and why didst thou not smite{H5221}{(H8689)} him there to the ground{H776}? and I would have given{H5414}{(H8800)} thee ten{H6235} shekels of silver{H3701}, and a{H259} girdle{H2290}."
2 Samuel,18,12,"And the man{H376} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joab{H3097}, Though{H3863} I should receive{H8254}{(H8802)} a thousand{H505} shekels of silver{H3701} in mine hand{H3709}, yet would I not put forth{H7971}{(H8799)} mine hand{H3027} against the king's{H4428} son{H1121}: for in our hearing{H241} the king{H4428} charged{H6680}{(H8765)} thee and Abishai{H52} and Ittai{H863}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Beware{H8104}{(H8798)} that none touch the young man{H5288} Absalom{H53}."
2 Samuel,18,13,"Otherwise{H176} I should have wrought{H6213}{(H8804)} falsehood{H8267} against mine own life{H5315}: for there is no matter{H1697} hid{H3582}{(H8735)} from the king{H4428}, and thou thyself wouldest have set{H3320}{(H8691)} thyself against me."
2 Samuel,18,14,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Joab{H3097}, I may not tarry{H3176}{(H8686)} thus with thee{H6440}. And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} three{H7969} darts{H7626} in his hand{H3709}, and thrust{H8628}{(H8799)} them through the heart{H3820} of Absalom{H53}, while he was yet alive{H2416} in the midst of the oak{H424}."
2 Samuel,18,15,"And ten{H6235} young men{H5288} that bare{H5375}{(H8802)} Joab's{H3097} armour{H3627} compassed about{H5437}{(H8799)} and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} Absalom{H53}, and slew{H4191}{(H8686)} him."
2 Samuel,18,16,"And Joab{H3097} blew{H8628}{(H8799)} the trumpet{H7782}, and the people{H5971} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} from pursuing{H7291}{(H8800)} after{H310} Israel{H3478}: for Joab{H3097} held back{H2820}{(H8804)} the people{H5971}."
2 Samuel,18,17,"And they took{H3947}{(H8799)} Absalom{H53}, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} him into a great{H1419} pit{H6354} in the wood{H3293}, and laid{H5324}{(H8686)} a very{H3966} great{H1419} heap{H1530} of stones{H68} upon him: and all Israel{H3478} fled{H5127}{(H8804)} every one{H376} to his tent{H168}."
2 Samuel,18,18,"Now Absalom{H53} in his lifetime{H2416} had taken{H3947}{(H8804)} and reared up{H5324}{(H8686)} for himself a pillar{H4678}, which is in the king's{H4428} dale{H6010}: for he said{H559}{(H8804)}, I have no son{H1121} to keep my name{H8034} in remembrance{H2142}{(H8687)}: and he called{H7121}{(H8799)} the pillar{H4678} after his own name{H8034}: and it is called{H7121}{(H8735)} unto this day{H3117}, Absalom's{H53} place{H3027}."
2 Samuel,18,19,"Then said{H559}{(H8804)} Ahimaaz{H290} the son{H1121} of Zadok{H6659}, Let me now run{H7323}{(H8799)}, and bear{H1319} the king{H4428} tidings{H1319}{(H8762)}, how that the LORD{H3068} hath avenged{H8199}{(H8804)} him of his enemies{H3027}{H341}{(H8802)}."
2 Samuel,18,20,"And Joab{H3097} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Thou{H376} shalt not bear tidings{H1309} this day{H3117}, but thou shalt bear tidings{H1319}{(H8765)} another{H312} day{H3117}: but this day{H3117} thou shalt bear no tidings{H1319}{(H8762)}, because the king's{H4428} son{H1121} is dead{H4191}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,18,21,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Joab{H3097} to Cushi{H3569}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} tell{H5046}{(H8685)} the king{H4428} what thou hast seen{H7200}{(H8804)}. And Cushi{H3569} bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} himself unto Joab{H3097}, and ran{H7323}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,18,22,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Ahimaaz{H290} the son{H1121} of Zadok{H6659} yet again{H3254}{(H8686)} to Joab{H3097}, But howsoever{H4100}, let me, I pray thee, also run{H7323}{(H8799)} after{H310} Cushi{H3569}. And Joab{H3097} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Wherefore wilt thou run{H7323}{(H8801)}, my son{H1121}, seeing that thou hast no tidings{H1309} ready{H4672}{(H8802)}?"
2 Samuel,18,23,"But howsoever, said he, let me run{H7323}{(H8799)}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Run{H7323}{(H8798)}. Then Ahimaaz{H290} ran{H7323}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870} of the plain{H3603}, and overran{H5674}{(H8799)} Cushi{H3569}."
2 Samuel,18,24,"And David{H1732} sat{H3427}{(H8802)} between the two{H8147} gates{H8179}: and the watchman{H6822}{(H8802)} went up{H3212}{(H8799)} to the roof{H1406} over the gate{H8179} unto the wall{H2346}, and lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} his eyes{H5869}, and looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and behold a man{H376} running{H7323}{(H8801)} alone."
2 Samuel,18,25,"And the watchman{H6822}{(H8802)} cried{H7121}{(H8799)}, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} the king{H4428}. And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, If he be alone, there is tidings{H1309} in his mouth{H6310}. And he came{H3212}{(H8799)} apace{H1980}{(H8800)}, and drew near{H7131}."
2 Samuel,18,26,"And the watchman{H6822}{(H8802)} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} another{H312} man{H376} running{H7323}{(H8801)}: and the watchman{H6822}{(H8802)} called{H7121}{(H8799)} unto the porter{H7778}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold another man{H376} running{H7323}{(H8801)} alone. And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, He also bringeth tidings{H1319}{(H8764)}."
2 Samuel,18,27,"And the watchman{H6822}{(H8802)} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Me thinketh{H7200}{(H8802)} the running{H4794} of the foremost{H7223} is like the running{H4794} of Ahimaaz{H290} the son{H1121} of Zadok{H6659}. And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, He is a good{H2896} man{H376}, and cometh{H935}{(H8799)} with good{H2896} tidings{H1309}."
2 Samuel,18,28,"And Ahimaaz{H290} called{H7121}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, All is well{H7965}. And he fell down{H7812}{(H8691)} to the earth{H776} upon his face{H639} before the king{H4428}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}, which hath delivered up{H5462}{(H8765)} the men{H582} that lifted up{H5375}{(H8804)} their hand{H3027} against my lord{H113} the king{H4428}."
2 Samuel,18,29,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is the young man{H5288} Absalom{H53} safe{H7965}? And Ahimaaz{H290} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, When Joab{H3097} sent{H7971}{(H8800)} the king's{H4428} servant{H5650}, and me thy servant{H5650}, I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} a great{H1419} tumult{H1995}, but I knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not what it was."
2 Samuel,18,30,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Turn aside{H5437}{(H8798)}, and stand{H3320}{(H8690)} here{H3541}. And he turned aside{H5437}{(H8735)}, and stood still{H5975}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,18,31,"And, behold, Cushi{H3569} came{H935}{(H8802)}; and Cushi{H3569} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Tidings{H1319}{(H8691)}, my lord{H113} the king{H4428}: for the LORD{H3068} hath avenged{H8199}{(H8804)} thee this day{H3117} of all them{H3027} that rose up{H6965}{(H8801)} against thee."
2 Samuel,18,32,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Cushi{H3569}, Is the young man{H5288} Absalom{H53} safe{H7965}? And Cushi{H3569} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, The enemies{H341}{(H8802)} of my lord{H113} the king{H4428}, and all that rise{H6965}{(H8804)} against thee to do thee hurt{H7451}, be as that young man{H5288} is."
2 Samuel,18,33,"And the king{H4428} was much moved{H7264}{(H8799)}, and went up{H5927}{(H8799)} to the chamber{H5944} over the gate{H8179}, and wept{H1058}{(H8799)}: and as he went{H3212}{(H8800)}, thus he said{H559}{(H8804)}, O my son{H1121} Absalom{H53}, my son{H1121}, my son{H1121} Absalom{H53}! would God I had died{H4191}{(H8800)} for thee{H5414}{(H8799)}, O Absalom{H53}, my son{H1121}, my son{H1121}!"
2 Samuel,19,1,"And it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} Joab{H3097}, Behold, the king{H4428} weepeth{H1058}{(H8802)} and mourneth{H56}{(H8691)} for Absalom{H53}."
2 Samuel,19,2,And the victory{H8668} that day{H3117} was turned into mourning{H60} unto all the people{H5971}: for the people{H5971} heard{H8085}{(H8804)} say{H559}{(H8800)} that day{H3117} how the king{H4428} was grieved{H6087}{(H8738)} for his son{H1121}.
2 Samuel,19,3,"And the people{H5971} gat{H935}{(H8800)} them by stealth{H1589}{(H8691)} that day{H3117} into the city{H5892}, as people{H5971} being ashamed{H3637}{(H8737)} steal away{H1589}{(H8691)} when they flee{H5127}{(H8800)} in battle{H4421}."
2 Samuel,19,4,"But the king{H4428} covered{H3813}{(H8804)} his face{H6440}, and the king{H4428} cried{H2199}{(H8799)} with a loud{H1419} voice{H6963}, O my son{H1121} Absalom{H53}, O Absalom{H53}, my son{H1121}, my son{H1121}!"
2 Samuel,19,5,"And Joab{H3097} came{H935}{(H8799)} into the house{H1004} to the king{H4428}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou hast shamed{H3001}{(H8689)} this day{H3117} the faces{H6440} of all thy servants{H5650}, which this day{H3117} have saved{H4422}{(H8764)} thy life{H5315}, and the lives{H5315} of thy sons{H1121} and of thy daughters{H1323}, and the lives{H5315} of thy wives{H802}, and the lives{H5315} of thy concubines{H6370};"
2 Samuel,19,6,"In that thou lovest{H157}{(H8800)} thine enemies{H8130}{(H8802)}, and hatest{H8130}{(H8800)} thy friends{H157}{(H8802)}. For thou hast declared{H5046}{(H8689)} this day{H3117}, that thou regardest neither princes{H8269} nor servants{H5650}: for this day{H3117} I perceive{H3045}{(H8804)}, that if{H3863} Absalom{H53} had lived{H2416}, and all we had died{H4191}{(H8801)} this day{H3117}, then it had pleased thee well{H3477}{H5869}."
2 Samuel,19,7,"Now therefore arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, go forth{H3318}{(H8798)}, and speak{H1696}{(H8761)} comfortably{H3820} unto thy servants{H5650}: for I swear{H7650}{(H8738)} by the LORD{H3068}, if thou go not forth{H3318}{(H8802)}, there will not tarry{H3885}{(H8799)} one{H376} with thee this night{H3915}: and that will be worse{H7489}{(H8804)} unto thee than all the evil{H7451} that befell{H935}{(H8804)} thee from thy youth{H5271} until now."
2 Samuel,19,8,"Then the king{H4428} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and sat{H3427}{(H8799)} in the gate{H8179}. And they told{H5046}{(H8689)} unto all the people{H5971}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, the king{H4428} doth sit{H3427}{(H8802)} in the gate{H8179}. And all the people{H5971} came{H935}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}: for Israel{H3478} had fled{H5127}{(H8804)} every man{H376} to his tent{H168}."
2 Samuel,19,9,"And all the people{H5971} were at strife{H1777}{(H8737)} throughout all the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The king{H4428} saved{H5337}{(H8689)} us out of the hand{H3709} of our enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, and he delivered{H4422}{(H8765)} us out of the hand{H3709} of the Philistines{H6430}; and now he is fled{H1272}{(H8804)} out of the land{H776} for Absalom{H53}."
2 Samuel,19,10,"And Absalom{H53}, whom we anointed{H4886}{(H8804)} over us, is dead{H4191}{(H8804)} in battle{H4421}. Now therefore why speak{H2790}{(H8688)} ye not a word of bringing{H7725} the king{H4428} back{H7725}{(H8687)}?"
2 Samuel,19,11,"And king{H4428} David{H1732} sent{H7971}{(H8804)} to Zadok{H6659} and to Abiathar{H54} the priests{H3548}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Speak{H1696}{(H8761)} unto the elders{H2205} of Judah{H3063}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Why are ye the last{H314} to bring{H7725} the king{H4428} back{H7725}{(H8687)} to his house{H1004}? seeing the speech{H1697} of all Israel{H3478} is come{H935}{(H8804)} to the king{H4428}, even to his house{H1004}."
2 Samuel,19,12,"Ye are my brethren{H251}, ye are my bones{H6106} and my flesh{H1320}: wherefore then are ye the last{H314} to bring back{H7725}{(H8687)} the king{H4428}?"
2 Samuel,19,13,"And say{H559}{(H8799)} ye to Amasa{H6021}, Art thou not of my bone{H6106}, and of my flesh{H1320}? God{H430} do{H6213}{(H8799)} so to me, and more{H3254}{(H8686)} also, if thou be not captain{H8269} of the host{H6635} before{H6440} me continually{H3117} in the room{H8478} of Joab{H3097}."
2 Samuel,19,14,"And he bowed{H5186}{(H8686)} the heart{H3824} of all the men{H376} of Judah{H3063}, even as the heart of one{H259} man{H376}; so that they sent{H7971}{(H8799)} this word unto the king{H4428}, Return{H7725}{(H8798)} thou, and all thy servants{H5650}."
2 Samuel,19,15,"So the king{H4428} returned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jordan{H3383}. And Judah{H3063} came{H935}{(H8804)} to Gilgal{H1537}, to go{H3212}{(H8800)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} the king{H4428}, to conduct{H5674} the king{H4428} over{H5674}{(H8687)} Jordan{H3383}."
2 Samuel,19,16,"And Shimei{H8096} the son{H1121} of Gera{H1617}, a Benjamite{H1145}, which was of Bahurim{H980}, hasted{H4116}{(H8762)} and came down{H3381}{(H8799)} with the men{H376} of Judah{H3063} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} king{H4428} David{H1732}."
2 Samuel,19,17,"And there were a thousand{H505} men{H376} of Benjamin{H1145} with him, and Ziba{H6717} the servant{H5288} of the house{H1004} of Saul{H7586}, and his fifteen{H2568}{H6240} sons{H1121} and his twenty{H6242} servants{H5650} with him; and they went over{H6743}{(H8804)} Jordan{H3383} before{H6440} the king{H4428}."
2 Samuel,19,18,"And there went over{H5674}{(H8804)} a ferry boat{H5679} to carry over{H5674}{(H8687)} the king's{H4428} household{H1004}, and to do{H6213}{(H8800)} what he thought{H5869} good{H2896}. And Shimei{H8096} the son{H1121} of Gera{H1617} fell down{H5307}{(H8804)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}, as he was come over{H5674}{(H8800)} Jordan{H3383};"
2 Samuel,19,19,"And said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, Let not my lord{H113} impute{H2803}{(H8799)} iniquity{H5771} unto me, neither do thou remember{H2142}{(H8799)} that which thy servant{H5650} did perversely{H5753}{(H8689)} the day{H3117} that my lord{H113} the king{H4428} went out{H3318}{(H8804)} of Jerusalem{H3389}, that the king{H4428} should take{H7760}{(H8800)} it to his heart{H3820}."
2 Samuel,19,20,"For thy servant{H5650} doth know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}: therefore, behold, I am come{H935}{(H8804)} the first{H7223} this day{H3117} of all the house{H1004} of Joseph{H3130} to go down{H3381}{(H8800)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} my lord{H113} the king{H4428}."
2 Samuel,19,21,"But Abishai{H52} the son{H1121} of Zeruiah{H6870} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Shall not Shimei{H8096} be put to death{H4191}{(H8714)} for this, because he cursed{H7043}{(H8765)} the LORD'S{H3068} anointed{H4899}?"
2 Samuel,19,22,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)}, What have I to do with you, ye sons{H1121} of Zeruiah{H6870}, that ye should this day{H3117} be adversaries{H7854} unto me? shall there any man{H376} be put to death{H4191}{(H8714)} this day{H3117} in Israel{H3478}? for do not I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am this day{H3117} king{H4428} over Israel{H3478}?"
2 Samuel,19,23,"Therefore the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Shimei{H8096}, Thou shalt not die{H4191}{(H8799)}. And the king{H4428} sware{H7650}{(H8735)} unto him."
2 Samuel,19,24,"And Mephibosheth{H4648} the son{H1121} of Saul{H7586} came down{H3381}{(H8804)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} the king{H4428}, and had neither{H3808} dressed{H6213}{(H8804)} his feet{H7272}, nor trimmed{H6213}{(H8804)} his beard{H8222}, nor washed{H3526}{(H8765)} his clothes{H899}, from the day{H3117} the king{H4428} departed{H3212}{(H8800)} until the day{H3117} he came{H935}{(H8804)} again in peace{H7965}."
2 Samuel,19,25,"And it came to pass, when he was come{H935}{(H8804)} to Jerusalem{H3389} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} the king{H4428}, that the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Wherefore wentest{H1980}{(H8804)} not thou with me, Mephibosheth{H4648}?"
2 Samuel,19,26,"And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, My lord{H113}, O king{H4428}, my servant{H5650} deceived{H7411}{(H8765)} me: for thy servant{H5650} said{H559}{(H8804)}, I will saddle{H2280}{(H8799)} me an ass{H2543}, that I may ride{H7392}{(H8799)} thereon, and go{H3212}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428}; because thy servant{H5650} is lame{H6455}."
2 Samuel,19,27,And he hath slandered{H7270}{(H8762)} thy servant{H5650} unto my lord{H113} the king{H4428}; but my lord{H113} the king{H4428} is as an angel{H4397} of God{H430}: do{H6213}{(H8798)} therefore what is good{H2896} in thine eyes{H5869}.
2 Samuel,19,28,For all of my father's{H1} house{H1004} were but{H3808} dead{H4194} men{H582} before my lord{H113} the king{H4428}: yet didst thou set{H7896}{(H8799)} thy servant{H5650} among them that did eat{H398}{(H8802)} at thine own table{H7979}. What right{H6666} therefore have{H3426} I yet to cry{H2199}{(H8800)} any more unto the king{H4428}?
2 Samuel,19,29,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Why speakest{H1696}{(H8762)} thou any more of thy matters{H1697}? I have said{H559}{(H8804)}, Thou and Ziba{H6717} divide{H2505}{(H8799)} the land{H7704}."
2 Samuel,19,30,"And Mephibosheth{H4648} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, Yea, let him take{H3947}{(H8799)} all, forasmuch{H310} as{H834} my lord{H113} the king{H4428} is come again{H935}{(H8804)} in peace{H7965} unto his own house{H1004}."
2 Samuel,19,31,"And Barzillai{H1271} the Gileadite{H1569} came down{H3381}{(H8804)} from Rogelim{H7274}, and went over{H5674}{(H8799)} Jordan{H3383} with the king{H4428}, to conduct{H7971}{(H8763)} him over Jordan{H3383}."
2 Samuel,19,32,"Now Barzillai{H1271} was a very{H3966} aged{H2204}{(H8804)} man, even fourscore{H8084} years{H8141} old{H1121}: and he had provided the king{H4428} of sustenance{H3557}{(H8773)} while he lay{H7871} at Mahanaim{H4266}; for he was a very{H3966} great{H1419} man{H376}."
2 Samuel,19,33,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Barzillai{H1271}, Come thou over{H5674}{(H8798)} with me, and I will feed{H3557}{(H8773)} thee with me in Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Samuel,19,34,"And Barzillai{H1271} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, How long{H3117} have I to live{H8141}{H2416}, that I should go up{H5927}{(H8799)} with the king{H4428} unto Jerusalem{H3389}?"
2 Samuel,19,35,I am this day{H3117} fourscore{H8084} years{H8141} old{H1121}: and can I discern{H3045}{(H8799)} between good{H2896} and evil{H7451}? can thy servant{H5650} taste{H2938}{(H8799)} what{H834} I eat{H398}{(H8799)} or what{H834} I drink{H8354}{(H8799)}? can I hear{H8085}{(H8799)} any more the voice{H6963} of singing men{H7891}{(H8802)} and singing women{H7891}{(H8802)}? wherefore then should thy servant{H5650} be yet a burden{H4853} unto my lord{H113} the king{H4428}?
2 Samuel,19,36,Thy servant{H5650} will go{H5674} a little way{H4592} over{H5674}{(H8799)} Jordan{H3383} with the king{H4428}: and why should the king{H4428} recompense{H1580}{(H8799)} it me with such a reward{H1578}?
2 Samuel,19,37,"Let thy servant{H5650}, I pray thee, turn back again{H7725}{(H8799)}, that I may die{H4191}{(H8799)} in mine own city{H5892}, and be buried by the grave{H6913} of my father{H1} and of my mother{H517}. But behold thy servant{H5650} Chimham{H3643}; let him go over{H5674}{(H8799)} with my lord{H113} the king{H4428}; and do{H6213}{(H8798)} to him what shall seem good{H2896}{H5869} unto thee."
2 Samuel,19,38,"And the king{H4428} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Chimham{H3643} shall go{H5674}{(H8799)} over with me, and I will do{H6213}{(H8799)} to him that which shall seem good{H2896}{H5869} unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require{H977}{(H8799)} of me, that will I do{H6213}{(H8799)} for thee."
2 Samuel,19,39,"And all the people{H5971} went over{H5674}{(H8799)} Jordan{H3383}. And when the king{H4428} was come over{H5674}{(H8804)}, the king{H4428} kissed{H5401}{(H8799)} Barzillai{H1271}, and blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} him; and he returned{H7725}{(H8799)} unto his own place{H4725}."
2 Samuel,19,40,"Then the king{H4428} went on{H5674}{(H8799)} to Gilgal{H1537}, and Chimham{H3643} went on{H5674}{(H8804)} with him: and all the people{H5971} of Judah{H3063} conducted{H5674}{(H8689)}{(H8675)}{H5674}{(H8686)} the king{H4428}, and also half{H2677} the people{H5971} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Samuel,19,41,"And, behold, all the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} came{H935}{(H8802)} to the king{H4428}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, Why have our brethren{H251} the men{H376} of Judah{H3063} stolen thee away{H1589}{(H8804)}, and have brought{H5674}{(H8686)} the king{H4428}, and his household{H1004}, and all David's{H1732} men{H582} with him, over Jordan{H3383}?"
2 Samuel,19,42,"And all the men{H376} of Judah{H3063} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the men{H376} of Israel{H3478}, Because the king{H4428} is near of kin{H7138} to us: wherefore then be ye angry{H2734}{(H8804)} for this matter{H1697}? have we eaten{H398}{(H8804)} at all{H398}{(H8800)} of the king's{H4428} cost? or hath he given{H5375}{(H8765)} us any gift{H5379}?"
2 Samuel,19,43,"And the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the men{H376} of Judah{H3063}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, We have ten{H6235} parts{H3027} in the king{H4428}, and we{H589} have also more right in David{H1732} than ye: why then did ye despise{H7043}{(H8689)} us, that our advice{H1697} should not be first{H7223} had in bringing back{H7725}{(H8687)} our king{H4428}? And the words{H1697} of the men{H376} of Judah{H3063} were fiercer{H7185}{(H8799)} than the words{H1697} of the men{H376} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Samuel,20,1,"And there happened{H7122}{(H8738)} to be there a man{H376} of Belial{H1100}, whose name{H8034} was Sheba{H7652}, the son{H1121} of Bichri{H1075}, a Benjamite{H1145}: and he blew{H8628}{(H8799)} a trumpet{H7782}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, We have no part{H2506} in David{H1732}, neither have we inheritance{H5159} in the son{H1121} of Jesse{H3448}: every{H376} man{H376} to his tents{H168}, O Israel{H3478}."
2 Samuel,20,2,"So every man{H376} of Israel{H3478} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} from after{H310} David{H1732}, and followed{H310} Sheba{H7652} the son{H1121} of Bichri{H1075}: but the men{H376} of Judah{H3063} clave{H1692}{(H8804)} unto their king{H4428}, from Jordan{H3383} even to Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Samuel,20,3,"And David{H1732} came{H935}{(H8799)} to his house{H1004} at Jerusalem{H3389}; and the king{H4428} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the ten{H6235} women{H802} his concubines{H6370}, whom he had left{H3240}{(H8689)} to keep{H8104}{(H8800)} the house{H1004}, and put{H5414}{(H8799)} them in ward{H4931}, and fed{H3557}{(H8770)} them, but went not in{H935}{(H8804)} unto them. So they were shut up{H6887}{(H8803)} unto the day{H3117} of their death{H4191}{(H8800)}, living{H2424} in widowhood{H491}."
2 Samuel,20,4,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the king{H4428} to Amasa{H6021}, Assemble{H2199}{(H8685)} me the men{H376} of Judah{H3063} within three{H7969} days{H3117}, and be thou here present{H5975}{(H8798)}."
2 Samuel,20,5,So Amasa{H6021} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to assemble{H2199}{(H8687)} the men of Judah{H3063}: but he tarried longer{H309}{(H8799)}{(H8675)}{H3186}{(H8799)} than the set time{H4150} which he had appointed{H3259}{(H8804)} him.
2 Samuel,20,6,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Abishai{H52}, Now shall Sheba{H7652} the son{H1121} of Bichri{H1075} do us more harm{H3415}{(H8799)} than did Absalom{H53}: take{H3947}{(H8798)} thou thy lord's{H113} servants{H5650}, and pursue{H7291}{(H8798)} after{H310} him, lest he get{H4672}{(H8804)} him fenced{H1219}{(H8803)} cities{H5892}, and escape{H5337}{(H8689)} us{H5869}."
2 Samuel,20,7,"And there went out{H3318}{(H8799)} after{H310} him Joab's{H3097} men{H582}, and the Cherethites{H3774}, and the Pelethites{H6432}, and all the mighty men{H1368}: and they went out{H3318}{(H8799)} of Jerusalem{H3389}, to pursue{H7291}{(H8800)} after{H310} Sheba{H7652} the son{H1121} of Bichri{H1075}."
2 Samuel,20,8,"When they were at the great{H1419} stone{H68} which is in Gibeon{H1391}, Amasa{H6021} went{H935}{(H8804)} before{H6440} them. And Joab's{H3097} garment{H4055} that he had put on{H3830} was girded{H2296}{(H8803)} unto him, and upon it a girdle{H2289} with a sword{H2719} fastened{H6775}{(H8794)} upon his loins{H4975} in the sheath{H8593} thereof; and as he went forth{H3318}{(H8804)} it fell out{H5307}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,20,9,"And Joab{H3097} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Amasa{H6021}, Art thou in health{H7965}, my brother{H251}? And Joab{H3097} took{H270}{(H8799)} Amasa{H6021} by the beard{H2206} with the right{H3225} hand{H3027} to kiss{H5401}{(H8800)} him."
2 Samuel,20,10,"But Amasa{H6021} took no heed{H8104}{(H8738)} to the sword{H2719} that was in Joab's{H3097} hand{H3027}: so he smote{H5221}{(H8686)} him therewith in the fifth{H2570} rib, and shed out{H8210}{(H8799)} his bowels{H4578} to the ground{H776}, and struck him not again{H8138}{(H8804)}; and he died{H4191}{(H8799)}. So Joab{H3097} and Abishai{H52} his brother{H251} pursued{H7291}{(H8804)} after{H310} Sheba{H7652} the son{H1121} of Bichri{H1075}."
2 Samuel,20,11,"And one{H376} of Joab's{H3097} men{H5288} stood{H5975}{(H8804)} by him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, He{H4310} that favoureth{H2654}{(H8804)} Joab{H3097}, and he that is for David{H1732}, let him go after{H310} Joab{H3097}."
2 Samuel,20,12,"And Amasa{H6021} wallowed{H1556}{(H8706)} in blood{H1818} in the midst{H8432} of the highway{H4546}. And when the man{H376} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that all the people{H5971} stood still{H5975}{(H8804)}, he removed{H5437}{(H8686)} Amasa{H6021} out of the highway{H4546} into the field{H7704}, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} a cloth{H899} upon him, when he saw{H7200}{(H8804)} that every one that came{H935}{(H8802)} by him stood still{H5975}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,20,13,"When he was removed{H3014}{(H8689)} out of the highway{H4546}, all the people{H376} went on{H5674}{(H8804)} after{H310} Joab{H3097}, to pursue{H7291}{(H8800)} after{H310} Sheba{H7652} the son{H1121} of Bichri{H1075}."
2 Samuel,20,14,"And he went{H5674}{(H8799)} through all the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478} unto Abel{H59}, and to Bethmaachah{H1038}, and all the Berites{H1276}: and they were gathered together{H6950}{(H8735)}{(H8675)}{H7035}{(H8735)}, and went{H935}{(H8799)} also after{H310} him."
2 Samuel,20,15,"And they came{H935}{(H8799)} and besieged{H6696}{(H8799)} him in Abel{H59} of Bethmaachah{H1038}, and they cast up{H8210}{(H8799)} a bank{H5550} against the city{H5892}, and it stood{H5975}{(H8799)} in the trench{H2426}: and all the people{H5971} that were with Joab{H3097} battered{H7843}{(H8688)} the wall{H2346}, to throw it down{H5307}{(H8687)}."
2 Samuel,20,16,"Then cried{H7121}{(H8799)} a wise{H2450} woman{H802} out of the city{H5892}, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)}, hear{H8085}{(H8798)}; say{H559}{(H8798)}, I pray you, unto Joab{H3097}, Come near{H7126}{(H8798)} hither, that I may speak{H1696}{(H8762)} with thee."
2 Samuel,20,17,"And when he was come near{H7126}{(H8799)} unto her, the woman{H802} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Art thou Joab{H3097}? And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, I am he. Then she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the words{H1697} of thine handmaid{H519}. And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, I do hear{H8085}{(H8802)}."
2 Samuel,20,18,"Then she spake{H559}{(H8799)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, They were wont{H1696}{(H8763)} to speak{H1696}{(H8762)} in old time{H7223}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, They shall surely{H7592}{(H8800)} ask{H7592}{(H8762)} counsel at Abel{H59}: and so they ended{H8552}{(H8689)} the matter."
2 Samuel,20,19,I am one of them that are peaceable{H7999}{(H8803)} and faithful{H539}{(H8803)} in Israel{H3478}: thou seekest{H1245}{(H8764)} to destroy{H4191}{(H8687)} a city{H5892} and a mother{H517} in Israel{H3478}: why wilt thou swallow up{H1104}{(H8762)} the inheritance{H5159} of the LORD{H3068}?
2 Samuel,20,20,"And Joab{H3097} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Far be it{H2486}, far be it{H2486} from me, that I should swallow up{H1104}{(H8762)} or destroy{H7843}{(H8686)}."
2 Samuel,20,21,"The matter{H1697} is not so: but a man{H376} of mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}, Sheba{H7652} the son{H1121} of Bichri{H1075} by name{H8034}, hath lifted up{H5375}{(H8804)} his hand{H3027} against the king{H4428}, even against David{H1732}: deliver{H5414}{(H8798)} him only, and I will depart{H3212}{(H8799)} from the city{H5892}. And the woman{H802} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joab{H3097}, Behold, his head{H7218} shall be thrown{H7993}{(H8716)} to thee over{H1157} the wall{H2346}."
2 Samuel,20,22,"Then the woman{H802} went{H935}{(H8799)} unto all the people{H5971} in her wisdom{H2451}. And they cut off{H3772}{(H8799)} the head{H7218} of Sheba{H7652} the son{H1121} of Bichri{H1075}, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} it out to Joab{H3097}. And he blew{H8628}{(H8799)} a trumpet{H7782}, and they retired{H6327}{(H8799)} from the city{H5892}, every man{H376} to his tent{H168}. And Joab{H3097} returned{H7725}{(H8804)} to Jerusalem{H3389} unto the king{H4428}."
2 Samuel,20,23,Now Joab{H3097} was over all the host{H6635} of Israel{H3478}: and Benaiah{H1141} the son{H1121} of Jehoiada{H3077} was over the Cherethites{H3774}{(H8675)}{H3746} and over the Pelethites{H6432}:
2 Samuel,20,24,And Adoram{H151} was over the tribute{H4522}: and Jehoshaphat{H3092} the son{H1121} of Ahilud{H286} was recorder{H2142}{(H8688)}:
2 Samuel,20,25,And Sheva{H7864}{(H8675)}{H7724} was scribe{H5608}{(H8802)}: and Zadok{H6659} and Abiathar{H54} were the priests{H3548}:
2 Samuel,20,26,And Ira{H5896} also the Jairite{H2972} was a chief ruler{H3548} about David{H1732}.
2 Samuel,21,1,"Then there was a famine{H7458} in the days{H3117} of David{H1732} three{H7969} years{H8141}, year{H8141} after{H310} year{H8141}; and David{H1732} enquired{H1245}{(H8762)} of{H6440} the LORD{H3068}. And the LORD{H3068} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, It is for Saul{H7586}, and for his bloody{H1818} house{H1004}, because he slew{H4191}{(H8689)} the Gibeonites{H1393}."
2 Samuel,21,2,"And the king{H4428} called{H7121}{(H8799)} the Gibeonites{H1393}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them;(now the Gibeonites{H1393} were not of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, but of the remnant{H3499} of the Amorites{H567}; and the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} had sworn{H7650}{(H8738)} unto them: and Saul{H7586} sought{H1245}{(H8762)} to slay{H5221}{(H8687)} them in his zeal{H7065}{(H8763)} to the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} and Judah{H3063}.)"
2 Samuel,21,3,"Wherefore David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the Gibeonites{H1393}, What shall I do{H6213}{(H8799)} for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement{H3722}{(H8762)}, that ye may bless{H1288}{(H8761)} the inheritance{H5159} of the LORD{H3068}?"
2 Samuel,21,4,"And the Gibeonites{H1393} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, We will have no silver{H3701} nor gold{H2091} of{H5973} Saul{H7586}, nor of his house{H1004}; neither for us shalt thou kill{H4191}{(H8687)} any man{H376} in Israel{H3478}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, What ye shall say{H559}{(H8802)}, that will I do{H6213}{(H8799)} for you."
2 Samuel,21,5,"And they answered{H559}{(H8799)} the king{H4428}, The man{H376} that consumed{H3615}{(H8765)} us, and that devised{H1819}{(H8765)} against us that we should be destroyed{H8045}{(H8738)} from remaining{H3320}{(H8692)} in any of the coasts{H1366} of Israel{H3478},"
2 Samuel,21,6,"Let seven{H7651} men{H582} of his sons{H1121} be delivered{H5414}{(H8714)} unto us, and we will hang them up{H3363}{(H8689)} unto the LORD{H3068} in Gibeah{H1390} of Saul{H7586}, whom the LORD{H3068} did choose{H972}. And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} them."
2 Samuel,21,7,"But the king{H4428} spared{H2550}{(H8799)} Mephibosheth{H4648}, the son{H1121} of Jonathan{H3083} the son{H1121} of Saul{H7586}, because of the LORD'S{H3068} oath{H7621} that was between them, between David{H1732} and Jonathan{H3083} the son{H1121} of Saul{H7586}."
2 Samuel,21,8,"But the king{H4428} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the two{H8147} sons{H1121} of Rizpah{H7532} the daughter{H1323} of Aiah{H345}, whom she bare{H3205}{(H8804)} unto Saul{H7586}, Armoni{H764} and Mephibosheth{H4648}; and the five{H2568} sons{H1121} of Michal{H4324} the daughter{H1323} of Saul{H7586}, whom she brought up{H3205}{(H8804)} for Adriel{H5741} the son{H1121} of Barzillai{H1271} the Meholathite{H4259}:"
2 Samuel,21,9,"And he delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} them into the hands{H3027} of the Gibeonites{H1393}, and they hanged{H3363}{(H8686)} them in the hill{H2022} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}: and they fell{H5307}{(H8799)} all seven{H7651}{(H8675)}{H7659} together{H3162}, and were put to death{H4191}{(H8717)} in the days{H3117} of harvest{H7105}, in the first{H7223} days, in the beginning{H8462} of barley{H8184} harvest{H7105}."
2 Samuel,21,10,"And Rizpah{H7532} the daughter{H1323} of Aiah{H345} took{H3947}{(H8799)} sackcloth{H8242}, and spread{H5186}{(H8686)} it for her upon the rock{H6697}, from the beginning{H8462} of harvest{H7105} until water{H4325} dropped{H5413}{(H8738)} upon them out of heaven{H8064}, and suffered{H5414}{(H8804)} neither the birds{H5775} of the air{H8064} to rest{H5117}{(H8800)} on them by day{H3119}, nor the beasts{H2416} of the field{H7704} by night{H3915}."
2 Samuel,21,11,"And it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} David{H1732} what Rizpah{H7532} the daughter{H1323} of Aiah{H345}, the concubine{H6370} of Saul{H7586}, had done{H6213}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,21,12,"And David{H1732} went{H3212}{(H8799)} and took{H3947}{(H8799)} the bones{H6106} of Saul{H7586} and the bones{H6106} of Jonathan{H3083} his son{H1121} from the men{H1167} of Jabeshgilead{H3003}{H1568}, which had stolen{H1589}{(H8804)} them from the street{H7339} of Bethshan{H1052}, where the Philistines{H6430} had hanged{H8511}{(H8804)}{(H8675)}{H8518}{(H8804)} them, when{H3117} the Philistines{H6430} had slain{H5221}{(H8687)} Saul{H7586} in Gilboa{H1533}:"
2 Samuel,21,13,And he brought up{H5927}{(H8686)} from thence the bones{H6106} of Saul{H7586} and the bones{H6106} of Jonathan{H3083} his son{H1121}; and they gathered{H622}{(H8799)} the bones{H6106} of them that were hanged{H3363}{(H8716)}.
2 Samuel,21,14,"And the bones{H6106} of Saul{H7586} and Jonathan{H3083} his son{H1121} buried{H6912}{(H8799)} they in the country{H776} of Benjamin{H1144} in Zelah{H6762}, in the sepulchre{H6913} of Kish{H7027} his father{H1}: and they performed{H6213}{(H8799)} all that the king{H4428} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}. And after{H310} that God{H430} was intreated{H6279}{(H8735)} for the land{H776}."
2 Samuel,21,15,"Moreover the Philistines{H6430} had yet war{H4421} again with Israel{H3478}; and David{H1732} went down{H3381}{(H8799)}, and his servants{H5650} with him, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against the Philistines{H6430}: and David{H1732} waxed faint{H5774}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,21,16,"And Ishbibenob{H3430}, which was of the sons{H3211} of the giant{H7497}, the weight{H4948} of whose spear{H7013} weighed three{H7969} hundred{H3967} shekels of brass{H5178} in weight{H4948}, he being girded{H2296}{(H8803)} with a new{H2319} sword, thought{H559}{(H8799)} to have slain{H5221}{(H8687)} David{H1732}."
2 Samuel,21,17,"But Abishai{H52} the son{H1121} of Zeruiah{H6870} succoured{H5826}{(H8799)} him, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the Philistine{H6430}, and killed{H4191}{(H8686)} him. Then the men{H582} of David{H1732} sware{H7650}{(H8738)} unto him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thou shalt go{H3318}{(H8799)} no more out with us to battle{H4421}, that thou quench{H3518}{(H8762)} not the light{H5216} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Samuel,21,18,"And it came to pass after this{H310}, that there was again a battle{H4421} with the Philistines{H6430} at Gob{H1359}: then Sibbechai{H5444} the Hushathite{H2843} slew{H5221}{(H8689)} Saph{H5593}, which was of the sons{H3211} of the giant{H7497}."
2 Samuel,21,19,"And there was again a battle{H4421} in Gob{H1359} with the Philistines{H6430}, where Elhanan{H445} the son{H1121} of Jaareoregim{H3296}, a Bethlehemite{H1022}, slew{H5221}{(H8686)} the brother of Goliath{H1555} the Gittite{H1663}, the staff{H6086} of whose spear{H2595} was like a weaver's{H707}{(H8802)} beam{H4500}."
2 Samuel,21,20,"And there was yet a battle{H4421} in Gath{H1661}, where was a man{H376} of great stature{H4067}{(H8675)}{H4055}, that had on every hand{H3027} six{H8337} fingers{H676}, and on every foot{H7272} six{H8337} toes{H676}, four{H702} and twenty{H6242} in number{H4557}; and he also was born{H3205}{(H8795)} to the giant{H7497}."
2 Samuel,21,21,"And when he defied{H2778}{(H8762)} Israel{H3478}, Jonathan{H3083} the son{H1121} of Shimea{H8092} the brother{H251} of David{H1732} slew{H5221}{(H8686)} him."
2 Samuel,21,22,"These four{H702} were born{H3205}{(H8795)} to the giant{H7497} in Gath{H1661}, and fell{H5307}{(H8799)} by the hand{H3027} of David{H1732}, and by the hand{H3027} of his servants{H5650}."
2 Samuel,22,1,"And David{H1732} spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto the LORD{H3068} the words{H1697} of this song{H7892} in the day{H3117} that the LORD{H3068} had delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} him out of the hand{H3709} of all his enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, and out of the hand{H3709} of Saul{H7586}:"
2 Samuel,22,2,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, The LORD{H3068} is my rock{H5553}, and my fortress{H4686}, and my deliverer{H6403}{(H8764)};"
2 Samuel,22,3,"The God{H430} of my rock{H6697}; in him will I trust{H2620}{(H8799)}: he is my shield{H4043}, and the horn{H7161} of my salvation{H3468}, my high tower{H4869}, and my refuge{H4498}, my saviour{H3467}{(H8688)}; thou savest{H3467}{(H8686)} me from violence{H2555}."
2 Samuel,22,4,"I will call{H7121}{(H8799)} on the LORD{H3068}, who is worthy to be praised{H1984}{(H8794)}: so shall I be saved{H3467}{(H8735)} from mine enemies{H341}{(H8802)}."
2 Samuel,22,5,"When the waves{H4867} of death{H4194} compassed{H661}{(H8804)} me, the floods{H5158} of ungodly men{H1100} made me afraid{H1204}{(H8762)};"
2 Samuel,22,6,The sorrows{H2256} of hell{H7585} compassed me about{H5437}{(H8804)}; the snares{H4170} of death{H4194} prevented{H6923}{(H8765)} me;
2 Samuel,22,7,"In my distress{H6862} I called{H7121}{(H8799)} upon the LORD{H3068}, and cried{H7121}{(H8799)} to my God{H430}: and he did hear{H8085}{(H8799)} my voice{H6963} out of his temple{H1964}, and my cry{H7775} did enter into his ears{H241}."
2 Samuel,22,8,"Then the earth{H776} shook{H1607}{(H8691)}{(H8675)}{H1607}{(H8799)} and trembled{H7493}{(H8799)}; the foundations{H4146} of heaven{H8064} moved{H7264}{(H8799)} and shook{H1607}{(H8691)}, because he was wroth{H2734}{(H8804)}."
2 Samuel,22,9,"There went up{H5927}{(H8804)} a smoke{H6227} out of his nostrils{H639}, and fire{H784} out of his mouth{H6310} devoured{H398}{(H8799)}: coals{H1513} were kindled{H1197}{(H8804)} by it."
2 Samuel,22,10,"He bowed{H5186}{(H8799)} the heavens{H8064} also, and came down{H3381}{(H8799)}; and darkness{H6205} was under his feet{H7272}."
2 Samuel,22,11,"And he rode{H7392}{(H8799)} upon a cherub{H3742}, and did fly{H5774}{(H8799)}: and he was seen{H7200}{(H8735)} upon the wings{H3671} of the wind{H7307}."
2 Samuel,22,12,"And he made{H7896}{(H8799)} darkness{H2822} pavilions{H5521} round about{H5439} him, dark{H2841} waters{H4325}, and thick clouds{H5645} of the skies{H7834}."
2 Samuel,22,13,Through the brightness{H5051} before him were coals{H1513} of fire{H784} kindled{H1197}{(H8804)}.
2 Samuel,22,14,"The LORD{H3068} thundered{H7481}{(H8686)} from heaven{H8064}, and the most High{H5945} uttered{H5414}{(H8799)} his voice{H6963}."
2 Samuel,22,15,"And he sent out{H7971}{(H8799)} arrows{H2671}, and scattered{H6327}{(H8686)} them; lightning{H1300}, and discomfited{H2000}{(H8799)} them."
2 Samuel,22,16,"And the channels{H650} of the sea{H3220} appeared{H7200}{(H8735)}, the foundations{H4146} of the world{H8398} were discovered{H1540}{(H8735)}, at the rebuking{H1606} of the LORD{H3068}, at the blast{H5397} of the breath{H7307} of his nostrils{H639}."
2 Samuel,22,17,"He sent{H7971}{(H8799)} from above{H4791}, he took{H3947}{(H8799)} me; he drew{H4871}{(H8686)} me out of many{H7227} waters{H4325};"
2 Samuel,22,18,"He delivered{H5337}{(H8686)} me from my strong{H5794} enemy{H341}{(H8802)}, and from them that hated{H8130}{(H8802)} me: for they were too strong{H553}{(H8804)} for me."
2 Samuel,22,19,They prevented{H6923}{(H8762)} me in the day{H3117} of my calamity{H343}: but the LORD{H3068} was my stay{H4937}.
2 Samuel,22,20,"He brought me forth{H3318}{(H8686)} also into a large place{H4800}: he delivered{H2502}{(H8762)} me, because he delighted{H2654}{(H8804)} in me."
2 Samuel,22,21,The LORD{H3068} rewarded{H1580}{(H8799)} me according to my righteousness{H6666}: according to the cleanness{H1252} of my hands{H3027} hath he recompensed{H7725}{(H8686)} me.
2 Samuel,22,22,"For I have kept{H8104}{(H8804)} the ways{H1870} of the LORD{H3068}, and have not wickedly departed{H7561}{(H8804)} from my God{H430}."
2 Samuel,22,23,"For all his judgments{H4941} were before me: and as for his statutes{H2708}, I did not depart{H5493}{(H8799)} from them."
2 Samuel,22,24,"I was also upright{H8549} before him, and have kept{H8104}{(H8691)} myself from mine iniquity{H5771}."
2 Samuel,22,25,Therefore the LORD{H3068} hath recompensed{H7725}{(H8686)} me according to my righteousness{H6666}; according to my cleanness{H1252} in his eye sight{H5048}{H5869}.
2 Samuel,22,26,"With the merciful{H2623} thou wilt shew thyself merciful{H2616}{(H8691)}, and with the upright{H8549} man{H1368} thou wilt shew thyself upright{H8552}{(H8691)}."
2 Samuel,22,27,With the pure{H1305}{(H8737)} thou wilt shew thyself pure{H1305}{(H8691)}; and with the froward{H6141} thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury{H6617}{(H8691)}.
2 Samuel,22,28,"And the afflicted{H6041} people{H5971} thou wilt save{H3467}{(H8686)}: but thine eyes{H5869} are upon the haughty{H7311}{(H8802)}, that thou mayest bring them down{H8213}{(H8686)}."
2 Samuel,22,29,"For thou art my lamp{H5216}, O LORD{H3068}: and the LORD{H3068} will lighten{H5050}{(H8686)} my darkness{H2822}."
2 Samuel,22,30,For by thee I have run{H7323}{(H8799)} through a troop{H1416}: by my God{H430} have I leaped over{H1801}{(H8762)} a wall{H7791}.
2 Samuel,22,31,"As for God{H410}, his way{H1870} is perfect{H8549}; the word{H565} of the LORD{H3068} is tried{H6884}{(H8803)}: he is a buckler{H4043} to all them that trust{H2620}{(H8802)} in him."
2 Samuel,22,32,"For who is God{H410}, save{H1107} the LORD{H3068}? and who is a rock{H6697}, save{H1107} our God{H430}?"
2 Samuel,22,33,God{H410} is my strength{H4581} and power{H2428}: and he maketh{H5425}{(H8686)} my way{H1870} perfect{H8549}.
2 Samuel,22,34,He maketh{H7737} my feet{H7272} like{H7737}{(H8764)} hinds{H355}' feet: and setteth{H5975}{(H8686)} me upon my high places{H1116}.
2 Samuel,22,35,He teacheth{H3925}{(H8764)} my hands{H3027} to war{H4421}; so that a bow{H7198} of steel{H5154} is broken{H5181}{(H8765)} by mine arms{H2220}.
2 Samuel,22,36,Thou hast also given{H5414}{(H8799)} me the shield{H4043} of thy salvation{H3468}: and thy gentleness{H6031}{(H8800)}{(H8676)}{H6038} hath made me great{H7235}{(H8686)}.
2 Samuel,22,37,Thou hast enlarged{H7337}{(H8686)} my steps{H6806} under me; so that my feet{H7166} did not slip{H4571}{(H8804)}.
2 Samuel,22,38,"I have pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} mine enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, and destroyed{H8045}{(H8686)} them; and turned not again{H7725}{(H8799)} until I had consumed{H3615}{(H8763)} them."
2 Samuel,22,39,"And I have consumed{H3615}{(H8762)} them, and wounded{H4272}{(H8799)} them, that they could not arise{H6965}{(H8799)}: yea, they are fallen{H5307}{(H8799)} under my feet{H7272}."
2 Samuel,22,40,For thou hast girded{H247}{(H8762)} me with strength{H2428} to battle{H4421}: them that rose up{H6965}{(H8801)} against me hast thou subdued{H3766}{(H8686)} under me.
2 Samuel,22,41,"Thou hast also given{H5414}{(H8804)} me the necks{H6203} of mine enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, that I might destroy{H6789}{(H8686)} them that hate{H8130}{(H8764)} me."
2 Samuel,22,42,"They looked{H8159}{(H8799)}, but there was none to save{H3467}{(H8688)}; even unto the LORD{H3068}, but he answered{H6030}{(H8804)} them not."
2 Samuel,22,43,"Then did I beat{H7833}{(H8799)} them as small as the dust{H6083} of the earth{H776}, I did stamp{H1854}{(H8686)} them as the mire{H2916} of the street{H2351}, and did spread them abroad{H7554}{(H8799)}."
2 Samuel,22,44,"Thou also hast delivered{H6403}{(H8762)} me from the strivings{H7379} of my people{H5971}, thou hast kept{H8104}{(H8799)} me to be head{H7218} of the heathen{H1471}: a people{H5971} which I knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not shall serve{H5647}{(H8799)} me."
2 Samuel,22,45,"Strangers{H1121}{H5236} shall submit{H3584}{(H8691)} themselves unto me: as soon as they hear{H8085}{(H8800)}{H241}, they shall be obedient{H8085}{(H8735)} unto me."
2 Samuel,22,46,"Strangers{H1121}{H5236} shall fade away{H5034}{(H8799)}, and they shall be afraid{H2296}{(H8799)} out of their close places{H4526}."
2 Samuel,22,47,The LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}; and blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be my rock{H6697}; and exalted{H7311}{(H8799)} be the God{H430} of the rock{H6697} of my salvation{H3468}.
2 Samuel,22,48,"It is God{H410} that avengeth{H5414}{(H8802)}{H5360} me, and that bringeth down{H3381}{(H8688)} the people{H5971} under me,"
2 Samuel,22,49,And that bringeth me forth{H3318}{(H8688)} from mine enemies{H341}{(H8802)}: thou also hast lifted me up on high{H7311}{(H8787)} above them that rose up{H6965}{(H8801)} against me: thou hast delivered{H5337}{(H8686)} me from the violent{H2555} man{H376}.
2 Samuel,22,50,"Therefore I will give thanks{H3034}{(H8686)} unto thee, O LORD{H3068}, among the heathen{H1471}, and I will sing praises{H2167}{(H8762)} unto thy name{H8034}."
2 Samuel,22,51,"He is the tower{H4024}{(H8675)}{H1431}{(H8688)} of salvation{H3444} for his king{H4428}: and sheweth{H6213}{(H8802)} mercy{H2617} to his anointed{H4899}, unto David{H1732}, and to his seed{H2233} for{H5704} evermore{H5769}."
2 Samuel,23,1,"Now these be the last{H314} words{H1697} of David{H1732}. David{H1732} the son{H1121} of Jesse{H3448} said{H5002}{(H8803)}, and the man{H1397} who was raised up{H6965}{(H8717)} on high{H5920}, the anointed{H4899} of the God{H430} of Jacob{H3290}, and the sweet{H5273} psalmist{H2158} of Israel{H3478}, said{H5002}{(H8803)},"
2 Samuel,23,2,"The Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} by me, and his word{H4405} was in my tongue{H3956}."
2 Samuel,23,3,"The God{H430} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8804)}, the Rock{H6697} of Israel{H3478} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} to me, He that ruleth{H4910}{(H8802)} over men{H120} must be just{H6662}, ruling{H4910}{(H8802)} in the fear{H3374} of God{H430}."
2 Samuel,23,4,"And he shall be as the light{H216} of the morning{H1242}, when the sun{H8121} riseth{H2224}{(H8799)}, even a morning{H1242} without{H3808} clouds{H5645}; as the tender grass{H1877} springing out of the earth{H776} by clear shining{H5051} after rain{H4306}."
2 Samuel,23,5,"Although my house{H1004} be not so with God{H410}; yet he hath made{H7760}{(H8804)} with me an everlasting{H5769} covenant{H1285}, ordered{H6186}{(H8803)} in all things, and sure{H8104}{(H8803)}: for this is all my salvation{H3468}, and all my desire{H2656}, although he make it not to grow{H6779}{(H8686)}."
2 Samuel,23,6,"But the sons of Belial{H1100} shall be all of them as thorns{H6975} thrust away{H5074}{(H8716)}, because they cannot be taken{H3947}{(H8799)} with hands{H3027}:"
2 Samuel,23,7,But the man{H376} that shall touch{H5060}{(H8799)} them must be fenced{H4390}{(H8735)} with iron{H1270} and the staff{H6086} of a spear{H2595}; and they shall be utterly{H8313}{(H8800)} burned{H8313}{(H8735)} with fire{H784} in the same place{H7675}{(H8800)}.
2 Samuel,23,8,"These be the names{H8034} of the mighty men{H1368} whom David{H1732} had: The Tachmonite{H8461} that sat{H3427}{(H8802)} in the seat{H7675}{(H8800)}{(H8677)}{H3429}, chief{H7218} among the captains{H7991}; the same was Adino{H5722} the Eznite{H6112}: he lift up his spear against eight{H8083} hundred{H3967}, whom he slew{H2491} at one{H259} time{H6471}."
2 Samuel,23,9,"And after{H310} him was Eleazar{H499} the son{H1121} of Dodo{H1734} the Ahohite{H266}, one of the three{H7969} mighty men{H1368} with David{H1732}, when they defied{H2778}{(H8763)} the Philistines{H6430} that were there gathered together{H622}{(H8738)} to battle{H4421}, and the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} were gone away{H5927}{(H8799)}:"
2 Samuel,23,10,"He arose{H6965}{(H8804)}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the Philistines{H6430} until{H3588} his hand{H3027} was weary{H3021}{(H8804)}, and his hand{H3027} clave{H1692}{(H8799)} unto the sword{H2719}: and the LORD{H3068} wrought{H6213}{(H8799)} a great{H1419} victory{H8668} that day{H3117}; and the people{H5971} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} after{H310} him only to spoil{H6584}{(H8763)}."
2 Samuel,23,11,"And after{H310} him was Shammah{H8048} the son{H1121} of Agee{H89} the Hararite{H2043}.

2 Samuel,23,12,"But he stood{H3320}{(H8691)} in the midst{H8432} of the ground{H2513}, and defended{H5337}{(H8686)} it, and slew{H5221}{(H8686)} the Philistines{H6430}: and the LORD{H3068} wrought{H6213}{(H8799)} a great{H1419} victory{H8668}."
2 Samuel,23,13,"And three{H7969}{(H8675)}{H7970} of the thirty{H7970} chief{H7218} went down{H3381}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to David{H1732} in the harvest time{H7105} unto the cave{H4631} of Adullam{H5725}: and the troop{H2416} of the Philistines{H6430} pitched{H2583}{(H8802)} in the valley{H6010} of Rephaim{H7497}."
2 Samuel,23,14,"And David{H1732} was then in an hold{H4686}, and the garrison{H4673} of the Philistines{H6430} was then in Bethlehem{H1035}."
2 Samuel,23,15,"And David{H1732} longed{H183}{(H8691)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Oh that one would give me drink{H8248}{(H8686)} of the water{H4325} of the well{H953} of Bethlehem{H1035}, which is by the gate{H8179}!"
2 Samuel,23,16,"And the three{H7969} mighty men{H1368} brake through{H1234}{(H8799)} the host{H4264} of the Philistines{H6430}, and drew{H7579}{(H8799)} water{H4325} out of the well{H953} of Bethlehem{H1035}, that was by the gate{H8179}, and took{H5375}{(H8799)} it, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} it to David{H1732}: nevertheless he would{H14}{(H8804)} not drink{H8354}{(H8800)} thereof, but poured it out{H5258}{(H8686)} unto the LORD{H3068}."
2 Samuel,23,17,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Be it far{H2486} from me, O LORD{H3068}, that I should do{H6213}{(H8800)} this: is not this the blood{H1818} of the men{H582} that went{H1980}{(H8802)} in jeopardy of their lives{H5315}? therefore he would{H14}{(H8804)} not drink{H8354}{(H8800)} it.

2 Samuel,23,19,Was he not most honourable{H3513}{(H8737)} of three{H7969}? therefore he was their captain{H8269}: howbeit he attained{H935}{(H8804)} not unto the first three{H7969}.

2 Samuel,24,13,"So Gad{H1410} came{H935}{(H8799)} to David{H1732}, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Shall seven{H7651} years{H8141} of famine{H7458} come{H935}{(H8799)} unto thee in thy land{H776}? or wilt thou flee{H5127}{(H8800)} three{H7969} months{H2320} before{H6440} thine enemies{H6862}, while they pursue{H7291}{(H8802)} thee? or that there be three{H7969} days{H3117}' pestilence{H1698} in thy land{H776}? now advise{H3045}{(H8798)}, and see{H7200}{(H8798)} what answer{H1697} I shall return{H7725}{(H8686)} to him that sent{H7971}{(H8802)} me."
2 Samuel,24,14,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Gad{H1410}, I am in a great{H3966} strait{H6887}{(H8804)}: let us fall{H5307}{(H8799)} now into the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068}; for his mercies{H7356} are great{H7227}: and let me not fall{H5307}{(H8799)} into the hand{H3027} of man{H120}."
2 Samuel,24,15,So the LORD{H3068} sent{H5414}{(H8799)} a pestilence{H1698} upon Israel{H3478} from the morning{H1242} even to the time{H6256} appointed{H4150}: and there died{H4191}{(H8799)} of the people{H5971} from Dan{H1835} even to Beersheba{H884} seventy{H7657} thousand{H505} men{H376}.

2 Samuel,24,23,"All these things did Araunah{H728}, as a king{H4428}, give{H5414}{(H8804)} unto the king{H4428}. And Araunah{H728} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, The LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} accept{H7521}{(H8799)} thee."
2 Samuel,24,24,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Araunah{H728}, Nay; but I will surely{H7069}{(H8800)} buy{H7069}{(H8799)} it of thee at a price{H4242}: neither will I offer{H5927}{(H8686)} burnt offerings{H5930} unto the LORD{H3068} my God{H430} of that which doth cost me nothing{H2600}. So David{H1732} bought{H7069}{(H8799)} the threshingfloor{H1637} and the oxen{H1241} for fifty{H2572} shekels{H8255} of silver{H3701}."
2 Samuel,24,25,"And David{H1732} built{H1129}{(H8799)} there an altar{H4196} unto the LORD{H3068}, and offered{H5927}{(H8686)} burnt offerings{H5930} and peace offerings{H8002}. So the LORD{H3068} was intreated{H6279}{(H8735)} for the land{H776}, and the plague{H4046} was stayed{H6113}{(H8735)} from Israel{H3478}."
1 Kings,1,1,"Now king{H4428} David{H1732} was old{H2204}{(H8804)} and stricken{H935}{(H8804)} in years{H3117}; and they covered{H3680}{(H8762)} him with clothes{H899}, but he gat no heat{H3179}{(H8799)}."
1 Kings,1,2,"Wherefore his servants{H5650} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Let there be sought{H1245}{(H8762)} for my lord{H113} the king{H4428} a young{H5291} virgin{H1330}: and let her stand{H5975}{(H8804)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}, and let her cherish{H5532}{(H8802)} him, and let her lie{H7901}{(H8804)} in thy bosom{H2436}, that my lord{H113} the king{H4428} may get heat{H2552}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,1,3,"So they sought{H1245}{(H8762)} for a fair{H3303} damsel{H5291} throughout all the coasts{H1366} of Israel{H3478}, and found{H4672}{(H8799)} Abishag{H49} a Shunammite{H7767}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} her to the king{H4428}."
1 Kings,1,4,"And the damsel{H5291} was very{H3966} fair{H3303}, and cherished{H5532}{(H8802)} the king{H4428}, and ministered{H8334}{(H8762)} to him: but the king{H4428} knew{H3045}{(H8804)} her not."
1 Kings,1,5,"Then Adonijah{H138} the son{H1121} of Haggith{H2294} exalted{H4984}{(H8693)} himself, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I will be king{H4427}{(H8799)}: and he prepared{H6213}{(H8799)} him chariots{H7393} and horsemen{H6571}, and fifty{H2572} men{H376} to run{H7323}{(H8801)} before{H6440} him."
1 Kings,1,6,"And his father{H1} had not displeased{H6087}{(H8804)} him at any time{H3117} in saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Why hast thou done so{H6213}{(H8804)}? and he also was a very{H3966} goodly{H2896}{H8389} man; and his mother bare{H3205}{(H8804)} him after{H310} Absalom{H53}."
1 Kings,1,7,"And he conferred{H1697} with Joab{H3097} the son{H1121} of Zeruiah{H6870}, and with Abiathar{H54} the priest{H3548}: and they following{H310} Adonijah{H138} helped{H5826}{(H8799)} him."
1 Kings,1,8,"But Zadok{H6659} the priest{H3548}, and Benaiah{H1141} the son{H1121} of Jehoiada{H3077}, and Nathan{H5416} the prophet{H5030}, and Shimei{H8096}, and Rei{H7472}, and the mighty men{H1368} which belonged to David{H1732}, were not with Adonijah{H138}."
1 Kings,1,9,"And Adonijah{H138} slew{H2076}{(H8799)} sheep{H6629} and oxen{H1241} and fat cattle{H4806} by the stone{H68} of Zoheleth{H2120}, which is by{H681} Enrogel{H5883}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} all his brethren{H251} the king's{H4428} sons{H1121}, and all the men{H582} of Judah{H3063} the king's{H4428} servants{H5650}:"
1 Kings,1,10,"But Nathan{H5416} the prophet{H5030}, and Benaiah{H1141}, and the mighty men{H1368}, and Solomon{H8010} his brother{H251}, he called{H7121}{(H8804)} not."
1 Kings,1,11,"Wherefore Nathan{H5416} spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto Bathsheba{H1339} the mother{H517} of Solomon{H8010}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Hast thou not heard{H8085}{(H8804)} that Adonijah{H138} the son{H1121} of Haggith{H2294} doth reign{H4427}{(H8804)}, and David{H1732} our lord{H113} knoweth{H3045}{(H8804)} it not?"
1 Kings,1,12,"Now therefore come{H3212}{(H8798)}, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel{H3289}{(H8799)}{H6098}, that thou mayest save{H4422}{(H8761)} thine own life{H5315}, and the life{H5315} of thy son{H1121} Solomon{H8010}."
1 Kings,1,13,"Go{H3212}{(H8798)} and get thee in{H935}{(H8798)} unto king{H4428} David{H1732}, and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto him, Didst not thou, my lord{H113}, O king{H4428}, swear{H7650}{(H8738)} unto thine handmaid{H519}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Assuredly{H3588} Solomon{H8010} thy son{H1121} shall reign{H4427}{(H8799)} after{H310} me, and he shall sit{H3427}{(H8799)} upon my throne{H3678}? why then doth Adonijah{H138} reign{H4427}{(H8804)}?"
1 Kings,1,14,"Behold, while thou yet talkest{H1696}{(H8764)} there with the king{H4428}, I also will come in{H935}{(H8799)} after{H310} thee, and confirm{H4390}{(H8765)} thy words{H1697}."
1 Kings,1,15,And Bathsheba{H1339} went in{H935}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428} into the chamber{H2315}: and the king{H4428} was very{H3966} old{H2204}{(H8804)}; and Abishag{H49} the Shunammite{H7767} ministered{H8334}{(H8764)} unto the king{H4428}.
1 Kings,1,16,"And Bathsheba{H1339} bowed{H6915}{(H8799)}, and did obeisance{H7812}{(H8691)} unto the king{H4428}. And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, What wouldest thou?"
1 Kings,1,17,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, My lord{H113}, thou swarest{H7650}{(H8738)} by the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} unto thine handmaid{H519}, saying, Assuredly Solomon{H8010} thy son{H1121} shall reign{H4427}{(H8799)} after{H310} me, and he shall sit{H3427}{(H8799)} upon my throne{H3678}."
1 Kings,1,18,"And now, behold, Adonijah{H138} reigneth{H4427}{(H8804)}; and now, my lord{H113} the king{H4428}, thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} it not:"
1 Kings,1,19,"And he hath slain{H2076}{(H8799)} oxen{H7794} and fat cattle{H4806} and sheep{H6629} in abundance{H7230}, and hath called{H7121}{(H8799)} all the sons{H1121} of the king{H4428}, and Abiathar{H54} the priest{H3548}, and Joab{H3097} the captain{H8269} of the host{H6635}: but Solomon{H8010} thy servant{H5650} hath he not called{H7121}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,1,20,"And thou, my lord{H113}, O king{H4428}, the eyes{H5869} of all Israel{H3478} are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell{H5046}{(H8687)} them who shall sit{H3427}{(H8799)} on the throne{H3678} of my lord{H113} the king{H4428} after{H310} him."
1 Kings,1,21,"Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord{H113} the king{H4428} shall sleep{H7901}{(H8800)} with his fathers{H1}, that I and my son{H1121} Solomon{H8010} shall be counted offenders{H2400}."
1 Kings,1,22,"And, lo, while she yet talked{H1696}{(H8764)} with the king{H4428}, Nathan{H5416} the prophet{H5030} also came in{H935}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,1,23,"And they told{H5046}{(H8686)} the king{H4428}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold Nathan{H5416} the prophet{H5030}. And when he was come in{H935}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}, he bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} himself before the king{H4428} with his face{H639} to the ground{H776}."
1 Kings,1,24,"And Nathan{H5416} said{H559}{(H8799)}, My lord{H113}, O king{H4428}, hast thou said{H559}{(H8804)}, Adonijah{H138} shall reign{H4427}{(H8799)} after{H310} me, and he shall sit{H3427}{(H8799)} upon my throne{H3678}?"
1 Kings,1,25,"For he is gone down{H3381}{(H8804)} this day{H3117}, and hath slain{H2076}{(H8799)} oxen{H7794} and fat cattle{H4806} and sheep{H6629} in abundance{H7230}, and hath called{H7121}{(H8799)} all the king's{H4428} sons{H1121}, and the captains{H8269} of the host{H6635}, and Abiathar{H54} the priest{H3548}; and, behold, they eat{H398}{(H8802)} and drink{H8354}{(H8802)} before{H6440} him, and say{H559}{(H8799)}, God save{H2421}{(H8799)} king{H4428} Adonijah{H138}."
1 Kings,1,26,"But me, even me thy servant{H5650}, and Zadok{H6659} the priest{H3548}, and Benaiah{H1141} the son{H1121} of Jehoiada{H3077}, and thy servant{H5650} Solomon{H8010}, hath he not called{H7121}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,1,27,"Is this thing{H1697} done{H1961}{(H8738)} by my lord{H113} the king{H4428}, and thou hast not shewed{H3045}{(H8689)} it unto thy servant{H5650}, who should sit{H3427}{(H8799)} on the throne{H3678} of my lord{H113} the king{H4428} after{H310} him?"
1 Kings,1,28,"Then king{H4428} David{H1732} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Call{H7121}{(H8798)} me Bathsheba{H1339}. And she came{H935}{(H8799)} into the king's{H4428} presence{H6440}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}."
1 Kings,1,29,"And the king{H4428} sware{H7650}{(H8735)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, that hath redeemed{H6299}{(H8804)} my soul{H5315} out of all distress{H6869},"
1 Kings,1,30,"Even as I sware{H7650}{(H8738)} unto thee by the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Assuredly Solomon{H8010} thy son{H1121} shall reign{H4427}{(H8799)} after{H310} me, and he shall sit{H3427}{(H8799)} upon my throne{H3678} in my stead; even so will I certainly do{H6213}{(H8799)} this day{H3117}."
1 Kings,1,31,"Then Bathsheba{H1339} bowed{H6915}{(H8799)} with her face{H639} to the earth{H776}, and did reverence{H7812}{(H8691)} to the king{H4428}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let my lord{H113} king{H4428} David{H1732} live{H2421}{(H8799)} for ever{H5769}."
1 Kings,1,32,"And king{H4428} David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Call{H7121}{(H8798)} me Zadok{H6659} the priest{H3548}, and Nathan{H5416} the prophet{H5030}, and Benaiah{H1141} the son{H1121} of Jehoiada{H3077}. And they came{H935}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}."
1 Kings,1,33,"The king{H4428} also said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} with you the servants{H5650} of your lord{H113}, and cause Solomon{H8010} my son{H1121} to ride{H7392}{(H8689)} upon mine own mule{H6506}, and bring him down{H3381}{(H8689)} to Gihon{H1521}:"
1 Kings,1,34,"And let Zadok{H6659} the priest{H3548} and Nathan{H5416} the prophet{H5030} anoint{H4886}{(H8804)} him there king{H4428} over Israel{H3478}: and blow{H8628}{(H8804)} ye with the trumpet{H7782}, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, God save{H2421}{(H8799)} king{H4428} Solomon{H8010}."
1 Kings,1,35,"Then ye shall come up{H5927}{(H8804)} after{H310} him, that he may come{H935}{(H8804)} and sit{H3427}{(H8804)} upon my throne{H3678}; for he shall be king{H4427}{(H8799)} in my stead: and I have appointed{H6680}{(H8765)} him to be ruler{H5057} over Israel{H3478} and over Judah{H3063}."
1 Kings,1,36,"And Benaiah{H1141} the son{H1121} of Jehoiada{H3077} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the king{H4428}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Amen{H543}: the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of my lord{H113} the king{H4428} say{H559}{(H8799)} so too."
1 Kings,1,37,"As the LORD{H3068} hath been with my lord{H113} the king{H4428}, even so be he with Solomon{H8010}, and make{H1431} his throne{H3678} greater{H1431}{(H8762)} than the throne{H3678} of my lord{H113} king{H4428} David{H1732}."
1 Kings,1,38,"So Zadok{H6659} the priest{H3548}, and Nathan{H5416} the prophet{H5030}, and Benaiah{H1141} the son{H1121} of Jehoiada{H3077}, and the Cherethites{H3774}, and the Pelethites{H6432}, went down{H3381}{(H8799)}, and caused Solomon{H8010} to ride{H7392}{(H8686)} upon king{H4428} David's{H1732} mule{H6506}, and brought{H3212}{(H8686)} him to Gihon{H1521}."
1 Kings,1,39,"And Zadok{H6659} the priest{H3548} took{H3947}{(H8799)} an horn{H7161} of oil{H8081} out of the tabernacle{H168}, and anointed{H4886}{(H8799)} Solomon{H8010}. And they blew{H8628}{(H8799)} the trumpet{H7782}; and all the people{H5971} said{H559}{(H8799)}, God save{H2421}{(H8799)} king{H4428} Solomon{H8010}."
1 Kings,1,40,"And all the people{H5971} came up{H5927}{(H8799)} after{H310} him, and the people{H5971} piped{H2490}{(H8764)} with pipes{H2485}, and rejoiced{H8056} with great{H1419} joy{H8057}, so that the earth{H776} rent{H1234}{(H8735)} with the sound{H6963} of them."
1 Kings,1,41,"And Adonijah{H138} and all the guests{H7121}{(H8803)} that were with him heard{H8085}{(H8799)} it as they had made an end{H3615}{(H8765)} of eating{H398}{(H8800)}. And when Joab{H3097} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} the sound{H6963} of the trumpet{H7782}, he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Wherefore is this noise{H6963} of the city{H7151} being in an uproar{H1993}{(H8802)}?"
1 Kings,1,42,"And while he yet spake{H1696}{(H8764)}, behold, Jonathan{H3129} the son{H1121} of Abiathar{H54} the priest{H3548} came{H935}{(H8804)}: and Adonijah{H138} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Come in{H935}{(H8798)}; for thou art a valiant{H2428} man{H376}{(H8676)}{H381}, and bringest{H1319} good{H2896} tidings{H1319}{(H8762)}."
1 Kings,1,43,"And Jonathan{H3129} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} to Adonijah{H138}, Verily{H61} our lord{H113} king{H4428} David{H1732} hath made Solomon{H8010} king{H4427}{(H8689)}."
1 Kings,1,44,"And the king{H4428} hath sent{H7971}{(H8799)} with him Zadok{H6659} the priest{H3548}, and Nathan{H5416} the prophet{H5030}, and Benaiah{H1141} the son{H1121} of Jehoiada{H3077}, and the Cherethites{H3774}, and the Pelethites{H6432}, and they have caused him to ride{H7392}{(H8686)} upon the king's{H4428} mule{H6506}:"
1 Kings,1,45,"And Zadok{H6659} the priest{H3548} and Nathan{H5416} the prophet{H5030} have anointed{H4886}{(H8799)} him king{H4428} in Gihon{H1521}: and they are come up{H5927}{(H8799)} from thence rejoicing{H8056}, so that the city{H7151} rang again{H1949}{(H8735)}. This is the noise{H6963} that ye have heard{H8085}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,1,46,And also Solomon{H8010} sitteth{H3427}{(H8804)} on the throne{H3678} of the kingdom{H4410}.
1 Kings,1,47,"And moreover the king's{H4428} servants{H5650} came{H935}{(H8804)} to bless{H1288}{(H8763)} our lord{H113} king{H4428} David{H1732}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, God{H430} make the name{H8034} of Solomon{H8010} better{H3190}{(H8686)} than thy name{H8034}, and make{H1431} his throne{H3678} greater{H1431}{(H8762)} than thy throne{H3678}. And the king{H4428} bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} himself upon the bed{H4904}."
1 Kings,1,48,"And also thus said{H559}{(H8804)} the king{H4428}, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, which hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} one to sit{H3427}{(H8802)} on my throne{H3678} this day{H3117}, mine eyes{H5869} even seeing{H7200}{(H8802)} it."
1 Kings,1,49,"And all the guests{H7121}{(H8803)} that were with Adonijah{H138} were afraid{H2729}{(H8799)}, and rose up{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} every man{H376} his way{H1870}."
1 Kings,1,50,"And Adonijah{H138} feared{H3372}{(H8804)} because{H6440} of Solomon{H8010}, and arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)}, and caught hold{H2388}{(H8686)} on the horns{H7161} of the altar{H4196}."
1 Kings,1,51,"And it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} Solomon{H8010}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, Adonijah{H138} feareth{H3372}{(H8804)} king{H4428} Solomon{H8010}: for, lo, he hath caught hold{H270}{(H8804)} on the horns{H7161} of the altar{H4196}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Let king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} swear{H7650}{(H8735)} unto me to day{H3117} that he will not slay{H4191}{(H8686)} his servant{H5650} with the sword{H2719}."
1 Kings,1,52,"And Solomon{H8010} said{H559}{(H8799)}, If he will shew himself a worthy{H2428} man{H1121}, there shall not an hair{H8185} of him fall{H5307}{(H8799)} to the earth{H776}: but if wickedness{H7451} shall be found{H4672}{(H8735)} in him, he shall die{H4191}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,1,53,"So king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} sent{H7971}{(H8799)}, and they brought him down{H3381}{(H8686)} from the altar{H4196}. And he came{H935}{(H8799)} and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} himself to king{H4428} Solomon{H8010}: and Solomon{H8010} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} to thine house{H1004}."
1 Kings,2,1,"Now the days{H3117} of David{H1732} drew nigh{H7126}{(H8799)} that he should die{H4191}{(H8800)}; and he charged{H6680}{(H8762)} Solomon{H8010} his son{H1121}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
1 Kings,2,2,"I go{H1980}{(H8802)} the way{H1870} of all the earth{H776}: be thou strong{H2388}{(H8804)} therefore, and shew thyself a man{H376};"
1 Kings,2,3,"And keep{H8104}{(H8804)} the charge{H4931} of the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}, to walk{H3212}{(H8800)} in his ways{H1870}, to keep{H8104}{(H8800)} his statutes{H2708}, and his commandments{H4687}, and his judgments{H4941}, and his testimonies{H5715}, as it is written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the law{H8451} of Moses{H4872}, that thou mayest prosper{H7919}{(H8686)} in all that thou doest{H6213}{(H8799)}, and whithersoever thou turnest{H6437}{(H8799)} thyself:"
1 Kings,2,4,"That the LORD{H3068} may continue{H6965}{(H8686)} his word{H1697} which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} concerning me, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, If thy children{H1121} take heed{H8104}{(H8799)} to their way{H1870}, to walk{H3212}{(H8800)} before{H6440} me in truth{H571} with all their heart{H3824} and with all their soul{H5315}, there shall not fail{H3772}{(H8735)} thee(said{H559}{(H8800)} he) a man{H376} on the throne{H3678} of Israel{H3478}."
1 Kings,2,5,"Moreover thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} also what Joab{H3097} the son{H1121} of Zeruiah{H6870} did{H6213}{(H8804)} to me, and what he did{H6213}{(H8804)} to the two{H8147} captains{H8269} of the hosts{H6635} of Israel{H3478}, unto Abner{H74} the son{H1121} of Ner{H5369}, and unto Amasa{H6021} the son{H1121} of Jether{H3500}, whom he slew{H2026}{(H8799)}, and shed{H7760}{(H8799)} the blood{H1818} of war{H4421} in peace{H7965}, and put{H5414}{(H8799)} the blood{H1818} of war{H4421} upon his girdle{H2290} that was about his loins{H4975}, and in his shoes{H5275} that were on his feet{H7272}."
1 Kings,2,6,"Do{H6213}{(H8804)} therefore according to thy wisdom{H2451}, and let not his hoar head{H7872} go down{H3381}{(H8686)} to the grave{H7585} in peace{H7965}."
1 Kings,2,7,"But shew{H6213}{(H8799)} kindness{H2617} unto the sons{H1121} of Barzillai{H1271} the Gileadite{H1569}, and let them be of those that eat{H398}{(H8802)} at thy table{H7979}: for so they came{H7126}{(H8804)} to me when I fled{H1272}{(H8800)} because{H6440} of Absalom{H53} thy brother{H251}."
1 Kings,2,8,"And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei{H8096} the son{H1121} of Gera{H1617}, a Benjamite{H1145} of Bahurim{H980}, which cursed{H7043}{(H8765)} me with a grievous{H4834}{(H8737)} curse{H7045} in the day{H3117} when I went{H3212}{(H8800)} to Mahanaim{H4266}: but he came down{H3381}{(H8804)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} me at Jordan{H3383}, and I sware{H7650}{(H8735)} to him by the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I will not put thee to death{H4191}{(H8686)} with the sword{H2719}."
1 Kings,2,9,"Now therefore hold him not guiltless{H5352}{(H8762)}: for thou art a wise{H2450} man{H376}, and knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} what thou oughtest to do{H6213}{(H8799)} unto him; but his hoar head{H7872} bring thou down{H3381}{(H8689)} to the grave{H7585} with blood{H1818}."
1 Kings,2,10,"So David{H1732} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} in the city{H5892} of David{H1732}."
1 Kings,2,11,"And the days{H3117} that David{H1732} reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} over Israel{H3478} were forty{H705} years{H8141}: seven{H7651} years{H8141} reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} he in Hebron{H2275}, and thirty{H7970} and three{H7969} years{H8141} reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} he in Jerusalem{H3389}."
1 Kings,2,12,Then sat{H3427}{(H8804)} Solomon{H8010} upon the throne{H3678} of David{H1732} his father{H1}; and his kingdom{H4438} was established{H3559}{(H8735)} greatly{H3966}.
1 Kings,2,13,"And Adonijah{H138} the son{H1121} of Haggith{H2294} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Bathsheba{H1339} the mother{H517} of Solomon{H8010}. And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, Comest{H935}{(H8800)} thou peaceably{H7965}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Peaceably{H7965}."
1 Kings,2,14,"He said{H559}{(H8799)} moreover, I have somewhat to say{H1697} unto thee. And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, Say on{H1696}{(H8761)}."
1 Kings,2,15,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} that the kingdom{H4410} was mine, and that all Israel{H3478} set{H7760}{(H8804)} their faces{H6440} on me, that I should reign{H4427}{(H8800)}: howbeit the kingdom{H4410} is turned about{H5437}{(H8735)}, and is become my brother's{H251}: for it was his from the LORD{H3068}."
1 Kings,2,16,"And now I ask{H7592}{(H8802)} one{H259} petition{H7596} of thee, deny{H7725}{(H8686)} me{H6440} not. And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Say on{H1696}{(H8761)}."
1 Kings,2,17,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Speak{H559}{(H8798)}, I pray thee, unto Solomon{H8010} the king{H4428},(for he will not say{H7725} thee{H6440} nay{H7725}{(H8686)},) that he give{H5414}{(H8799)} me Abishag{H49} the Shunammite{H7767} to wife{H802}."
1 Kings,2,18,"And Bathsheba{H1339} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Well{H2896}; I will speak{H1696}{(H8762)} for thee unto the king{H4428}."
1 Kings,2,19,"Bathsheba{H1339} therefore went{H935}{(H8799)} unto king{H4428} Solomon{H8010}, to speak{H1696}{(H8763)} unto him for Adonijah{H138}. And the king{H4428} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} her, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} himself unto her, and sat down{H3427}{(H8799)} on his throne{H3678}, and caused a seat{H3678} to be set{H7760}{(H8799)} for the king's{H4428} mother{H517}; and she sat{H3427}{(H8799)} on his right hand{H3225}."
1 Kings,2,20,"Then she said{H559}{(H8799)}, I desire{H7592}{(H8802)} one{H259} small{H6996} petition{H7596} of thee; I pray thee, say{H7725} me{H6440} not nay{H7725}{(H8686)}. And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Ask on{H7592}{(H8798)}, my mother{H517}: for I will not say{H7725} thee{H6440} nay{H7725}{(H8686)}."
1 Kings,2,21,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let Abishag{H49} the Shunammite{H7767} be given{H5414}{(H8714)} to Adonijah{H138} thy brother{H251} to wife{H802}."
1 Kings,2,22,"And king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his mother{H517}, And why dost thou ask{H7592}{(H8802)} Abishag{H49} the Shunammite{H7767} for Adonijah{H138}? ask{H7592}{(H8798)} for him the kingdom{H4410} also; for he is mine elder{H1419} brother{H251}; even for him, and for Abiathar{H54} the priest{H3548}, and for Joab{H3097} the son{H1121} of Zeruiah{H6870}."
1 Kings,2,23,"Then king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} sware{H7650}{(H8735)} by the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, God{H430} do{H6213}{(H8799)} so to me, and more also{H3254}{(H8686)}, if Adonijah{H138} have not spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} this word{H1697} against his own life{H5315}."
1 Kings,2,24,"Now therefore, as the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, which hath established{H3559}{(H8689)} me, and set{H3427}{(H8686)} me on the throne{H3678} of David{H1732} my father{H1}, and who hath made{H6213}{(H8804)} me an house{H1004}, as he promised{H1696}{(H8765)}, Adonijah{H138} shall be put to death{H4191}{(H8714)} this day{H3117}."
1 Kings,2,25,And king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} by the hand{H3027} of Benaiah{H1141} the son{H1121} of Jehoiada{H3077}; and he fell{H6293}{(H8799)} upon him that he died{H4191}{(H8799)}.
1 Kings,2,26,"And unto Abiathar{H54} the priest{H3548} said{H559}{(H8804)} the king{H4428}, Get{H3212}{(H8798)} thee to Anathoth{H6068}, unto thine own fields{H7704}; for thou art worthy{H376} of death{H4194}: but I will not at this time{H3117} put thee to death{H4191}{(H8686)}, because thou barest{H5375}{(H8804)} the ark{H727} of the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} before{H6440} David{H1732} my father{H1}, and because thou hast been afflicted{H6031}{(H8694)} in all wherein my father{H1} was afflicted{H6031}{(H8694)}."
1 Kings,2,27,"So Solomon{H8010} thrust out{H1644}{(H8762)} Abiathar{H54} from being priest{H3548} unto the LORD{H3068}; that he might fulfil{H4390}{(H8763)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} concerning the house{H1004} of Eli{H5941} in Shiloh{H7887}."
1 Kings,2,28,"Then tidings{H8052} came{H935}{(H8804)} to Joab{H3097}: for Joab{H3097} had turned{H5186}{(H8804)} after{H310} Adonijah{H138}, though he turned{H5186}{(H8804)} not after{H310} Absalom{H53}. And Joab{H3097} fled{H5127}{(H8799)} unto the tabernacle{H168} of the LORD{H3068}, and caught hold{H2388}{(H8686)} on the horns{H7161} of the altar{H4196}."
1 Kings,2,29,"And it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} that Joab{H3097} was fled{H5127}{(H8804)} unto the tabernacle{H168} of the LORD{H3068}; and, behold, he is by{H681} the altar{H4196}. Then Solomon{H8010} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Benaiah{H1141} the son{H1121} of Jehoiada{H3077}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, fall{H6293}{(H8798)} upon him."
1 Kings,2,30,"And Benaiah{H1141} came{H935}{(H8799)} to the tabernacle{H168} of the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the king{H4428}, Come forth{H3318}{(H8798)}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Nay; but I will die{H4191}{(H8799)} here. And Benaiah{H1141} brought{H7725} the king{H4428} word{H1697} again{H7725}{(H8686)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus said{H1696}{(H8765)} Joab{H3097}, and thus he answered{H6030}{(H8804)} me."
1 Kings,2,31,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Do{H6213}{(H8798)} as he hath said{H1696}{(H8765)}, and fall{H6293}{(H8798)} upon him, and bury{H6912}{(H8804)} him; that thou mayest take away{H5493}{(H8689)} the innocent{H2600} blood{H1818}, which Joab{H3097} shed{H8210}{(H8804)}, from me, and from the house{H1004} of my father{H1}."
1 Kings,2,32,"And the LORD{H3068} shall return{H7725}{(H8689)} his blood{H1818} upon his own head{H7218}, who fell{H6293}{(H8804)} upon two{H8147} men{H582} more righteous{H6662} and better{H2896} than he, and slew{H2026}{(H8799)} them with the sword{H2719}, my father{H1} David{H1732} not knowing{H3045}{(H8804)} thereof, to wit, Abner{H74} the son{H1121} of Ner{H5369}, captain{H8269} of the host{H6635} of Israel{H3478}, and Amasa{H6021} the son{H1121} of Jether{H3500}, captain{H8269} of the host{H6635} of Judah{H3063}."
1 Kings,2,33,"Their blood{H1818} shall therefore return{H7725}{(H8804)} upon the head{H7218} of Joab{H3097}, and upon the head{H7218} of his seed{H2233} for ever{H5769}: but upon David{H1732}, and upon his seed{H2233}, and upon his house{H1004}, and upon his throne{H3678}, shall there be peace{H7965} for{H5704} ever{H5769} from the LORD{H3068}."
1 Kings,2,34,"So Benaiah{H1141} the son{H1121} of Jehoiada{H3077} went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and fell{H6293}{(H8799)} upon him, and slew{H4191}{(H8686)} him: and he was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} in his own house{H1004} in the wilderness{H4057}."
1 Kings,2,35,And the king{H4428} put{H5414}{(H8799)} Benaiah{H1141} the son{H1121} of Jehoiada{H3077} in his room over the host{H6635}: and Zadok{H6659} the priest{H3548} did the king{H4428} put{H5414}{(H8804)} in the room of Abiathar{H54}.
1 Kings,2,36,"And the king{H4428} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and called{H7121}{(H8799)} for Shimei{H8096}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Build{H1129}{(H8798)} thee an house{H1004} in Jerusalem{H3389}, and dwell{H3427}{(H8804)} there, and go not forth{H3318}{(H8799)} thence any whither{H575}."
1 Kings,2,37,"For it shall be, that on the day{H3117} thou goest out{H3318}{(H8800)}, and passest over{H5674}{(H8804)} the brook{H5158} Kidron{H6939}, thou shalt know{H3045}{(H8799)} for certain{H3045}{(H8800)} that thou shalt surely{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}: thy blood{H1818} shall be upon thine own head{H7218}."
1 Kings,2,38,"And Shimei{H8096} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, The saying{H1697} is good{H2896}: as my lord{H113} the king{H4428} hath said{H1696}{(H8765)}, so will thy servant{H5650} do{H6213}{(H8799)}. And Shimei{H8096} dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in Jerusalem{H3389} many{H7227} days{H3117}."
1 Kings,2,39,"And it came to pass at the end{H7093} of three{H7969} years{H8141}, that two{H8147} of the servants{H5650} of Shimei{H8096} ran away{H1272}{(H8799)} unto Achish{H397} son{H1121} of Maachah{H4601} king{H4428} of Gath{H1661}. And they told{H5046}{(H8686)} Shimei{H8096}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, thy servants{H5650} be in Gath{H1661}."
1 Kings,2,40,"And Shimei{H8096} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and saddled{H2280}{(H8799)} his ass{H2543}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Gath{H1661} to Achish{H397} to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} his servants{H5650}: and Shimei{H8096} went{H3212}{(H8799)}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} his servants{H5650} from Gath{H1661}."
1 Kings,2,41,"And it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} Solomon{H8010} that Shimei{H8096} had gone{H1980}{(H8804)} from Jerusalem{H3389} to Gath{H1661}, and was come again{H7725}{(H8799)}."
1 Kings,2,42,"And the king{H4428} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and called{H7121}{(H8799)} for Shimei{H8096}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Did I not make thee to swear{H7650}{(H8689)} by the LORD{H3068}, and protested{H5749}{(H8686)} unto thee, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Know{H3045}{(H8799)} for a certain{H3045}{(H8800)}, on the day{H3117} thou goest out{H3318}{(H8800)}, and walkest{H1980}{(H8804)} abroad any whither{H575}, that thou shalt surely{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}? and thou saidst{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, The word{H1697} that I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} is good{H2896}."
1 Kings,2,43,"Why then hast thou not kept{H8104}{(H8804)} the oath{H7621} of the LORD{H3068}, and the commandment{H4687} that I have charged{H6680}{(H8765)} thee with?"
1 Kings,2,44,"The king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} moreover to Shimei{H8096}, Thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} all the wickedness{H7451} which thine heart{H3824} is privy to{H3045}{(H8804)}, that thou didst{H6213}{(H8804)} to David{H1732} my father{H1}: therefore the LORD{H3068} shall return{H7725}{(H8689)} thy wickedness{H7451} upon thine own head{H7218};"
1 Kings,2,45,"And king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} shall be blessed{H1288}{(H8803)}, and the throne{H3678} of David{H1732} shall be established{H3559}{(H8737)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} for{H5704} ever{H5769}."
1 Kings,2,46,"So the king{H4428} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} Benaiah{H1141} the son{H1121} of Jehoiada{H3077}; which went out{H3318}{(H8799)}, and fell{H6293}{(H8799)} upon him, that he died{H4191}{(H8799)}. And the kingdom{H4467} was established{H3559}{(H8738)} in the hand{H3027} of Solomon{H8010}."
1 Kings,3,1,"And Solomon{H8010} made affinity{H2859}{(H8691)} with Pharaoh{H6547} king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} Pharaoh's{H6547} daughter{H1323}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} her into the city{H5892} of David{H1732}, until he had made an end{H3615}{(H8763)} of building{H1129}{(H8800)} his own house{H1004}, and the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and the wall{H2346} of Jerusalem{H3389} round about{H5439}."
1 Kings,3,2,"Only the people{H5971} sacrificed{H2076}{(H8764)} in high places{H1116}, because there was no house{H1004} built{H1129}{(H8738)} unto the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068}, until those days{H3117}."
1 Kings,3,3,"And Solomon{H8010} loved{H157}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}, walking{H3212}{(H8800)} in the statutes{H2708} of David{H1732} his father{H1}: only he sacrificed{H2076}{(H8764)} and burnt incense{H6999}{(H8688)} in high places{H1116}."
1 Kings,3,4,And the king{H4428} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Gibeon{H1391} to sacrifice{H2076}{(H8800)} there; for that{H1931} was the great{H1419} high place{H1116}: a thousand{H505} burnt offerings{H5930} did Solomon{H8010} offer{H5927}{(H8686)} upon that altar{H4196}.
1 Kings,3,5,"In Gibeon{H1391} the LORD{H3068} appeared{H7200}{(H8738)} to Solomon{H8010} in a dream{H2472} by night{H3915}: and God{H430} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Ask{H7592}{(H8798)} what I shall give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee."
1 Kings,3,6,"And Solomon{H8010} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou hast shewed{H6213}{(H8804)} unto thy servant{H5650} David{H1732} my father{H1} great{H1419} mercy{H2617}, according as he walked{H1980}{(H8804)} before{H6440} thee in truth{H571}, and in righteousness{H6666}, and in uprightness{H3483} of heart{H3824} with thee; and thou hast kept{H8104}{(H8799)} for him this great{H1419} kindness{H2617}, that thou hast given{H5414}{(H8799)} him a son{H1121} to sit{H3427}{(H8802)} on his throne{H3678}, as it is this day{H3117}."
1 Kings,3,7,"And now, O LORD{H3068} my God{H430}, thou hast made thy servant{H5650} king{H4427}{(H8689)} instead of David{H1732} my father{H1}: and I am but a little{H6996} child{H5288}: I know{H3045}{(H8799)} not how to go out{H3318}{(H8800)} or come in{H935}{(H8800)}."
1 Kings,3,8,"And thy servant{H5650} is in the midst{H8432} of thy people{H5971} which thou hast chosen{H977}{(H8804)}, a great{H7227} people{H5971}, that cannot be numbered{H4487}{(H8735)} nor counted{H5608}{(H8735)} for multitude{H7230}."
1 Kings,3,9,"Give{H5414}{(H8804)} therefore thy servant{H5650} an understanding{H8085}{(H8802)} heart{H3820} to judge{H8199}{(H8800)} thy people{H5971}, that I may discern{H995}{(H8687)} between good{H2896} and bad{H7451}: for who is able{H3201}{(H8799)} to judge{H8199}{(H8800)} this thy so great{H3515} a people{H5971}?"
1 Kings,3,10,"And the speech{H1697} pleased{H3190}{(H8799)}{H5869} the Lord{H136}, that Solomon{H8010} had asked{H7592}{(H8804)} this thing{H1697}."
1 Kings,3,11,"And God{H430} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Because thou hast asked{H7592}{(H8804)} this thing{H1697}, and hast not asked{H7592}{(H8804)} for thyself long{H7227} life{H3117}; neither hast asked{H7592}{(H8804)} riches{H6239} for thyself, nor hast asked{H7592}{(H8804)} the life{H5315} of thine enemies{H341}{(H8802)}; but hast asked{H7592}{(H8804)} for thyself understanding{H995}{(H8687)} to discern{H8085}{(H8800)} judgment{H4941};"
1 Kings,3,12,"Behold, I have done{H6213}{(H8804)} according to thy words{H1697}: lo, I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} thee a wise{H2450} and an understanding{H995}{(H8737)} heart{H3820}; so that there was none like thee before{H6440} thee, neither after{H310} thee shall any arise{H6965}{(H8799)} like unto thee."
1 Kings,3,13,"And I have also given{H5414}{(H8804)} thee that which thou hast not asked{H7592}{(H8804)}, both riches{H6239}, and honour{H3519}: so that there shall not be any{H376} among the kings{H4428} like unto thee all thy days{H3117}."
1 Kings,3,14,"And if thou wilt walk{H3212}{(H8799)} in my ways{H1870}, to keep{H8104}{(H8800)} my statutes{H2706} and my commandments{H4687}, as thy father{H1} David{H1732} did walk{H1980}{(H8804)}, then I will lengthen{H748}{(H8689)} thy days{H3117}."
1 Kings,3,15,"And Solomon{H8010} awoke{H3364}{(H8799)}; and, behold, it was a dream{H2472}. And he came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068}, and offered up{H5927}{(H8686)} burnt offerings{H5930}, and offered{H6213}{(H8799)} peace offerings{H8002}, and made{H6213}{(H8799)} a feast{H4960} to all his servants{H5650}."
1 Kings,3,16,"Then came{H935}{(H8799)} there two{H8147} women{H802}, that were harlots{H2181}{(H8802)}, unto the king{H4428}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him."
1 Kings,3,17,"And the one{H259} woman{H802} said{H559}{(H8799)}, O{H994} my lord{H113}, I and this woman{H802} dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} in one{H259} house{H1004}; and I was delivered of a child{H3205}{(H8799)} with her in the house{H1004}."
1 Kings,3,18,"And it came to pass the third{H7992} day{H3117} after that I was delivered{H3205}{(H8800)}, that this woman{H802} was delivered{H3205}{(H8799)} also: and we were together{H3162}; there was no stranger{H2114}{(H8801)} with us in the house{H1004}, save{H2108} we two{H8147} in the house{H1004}."
1 Kings,3,19,And this woman's{H802} child{H1121} died{H4191}{(H8799)} in the night{H3915}; because she overlaid{H7901}{(H8804)} it.
1 Kings,3,20,"And she arose{H6965}{(H8799)} at midnight{H8432}{H3915}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} my son{H1121} from beside{H681} me, while thine handmaid{H519} slept{H3463}, and laid{H7901}{(H8686)} it in her bosom{H2436}, and laid{H7901}{(H8689)} her dead{H4191}{(H8801)} child{H1121} in my bosom{H2436}."
1 Kings,3,21,"And when I rose{H6965}{(H8799)} in the morning{H1242} to give my child{H1121} suck{H3243}{(H8687)}, behold, it was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}: but when I had considered{H995}{(H8709)} it in the morning{H1242}, behold, it was not my son{H1121}, which I did bear{H3205}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,3,22,"And the other{H312} woman{H802} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Nay; but the living{H2416} is my son{H1121}, and the dead{H4191}{(H8801)} is thy son{H1121}. And this said{H559}{(H8802)}, No; but the dead{H4191}{(H8801)} is thy son{H1121}, and the living{H2416} is my son{H1121}. Thus they spake{H1696}{(H8762)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}."
1 Kings,3,23,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the king{H4428}, The one{H2063} saith{H559}{(H8802)}, This is my son{H1121} that liveth{H2416}, and thy son{H1121} is the dead{H4191}{(H8801)}: and the other{H2063} saith{H559}{(H8802)}, Nay; but thy son{H1121} is the dead{H4191}{(H8801)}, and my son{H1121} is the living{H2416}."
1 Kings,3,24,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Bring{H3947}{(H8798)} me a sword{H2719}. And they brought{H935}{(H8686)} a sword{H2719} before{H6440} the king{H4428}."
1 Kings,3,25,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Divide{H1504}{(H8798)} the living{H2416} child{H3206} in two{H8147}, and give{H5414}{(H8798)} half{H2677} to the one{H259}, and half{H2677} to the other{H259}."
1 Kings,3,26,"Then spake{H559}{(H8799)} the woman{H802} whose the living{H2416} child{H1121} was unto the king{H4428}, for her bowels{H7356} yearned{H3648}{(H8738)} upon her son{H1121}, and she said{H559}{(H8799)}, O{H994} my lord{H113}, give{H5414}{(H8798)} her the living{H2416} child{H3205}{(H8803)}, and in no wise{H4191}{(H8687)} slay{H4191}{(H8686)} it. But the other said{H559}{(H8802)}, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide{H1504}{(H8798)} it."
1 Kings,3,27,"Then the king{H4428} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} her the living{H2416} child{H3205}{(H8803)}, and in no wise{H4191}{(H8687)} slay{H4191}{(H8686)} it: she is the mother{H517} thereof."
1 Kings,3,28,"And all Israel{H3478} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} of the judgment{H4941} which the king{H4428} had judged{H8199}{(H8804)}; and they feared{H3372}{(H8799)} the king{H6440}: for they saw{H7200}{(H8804)} that the wisdom{H2451} of God{H430} was in him{H7130}, to do{H6213}{(H8800)} judgment{H4941}."

1 Kings,5,6,Now therefore command{H6680}{(H8761)} thou that they hew{H3772}{(H8799)} me cedar trees{H730} out of Lebanon{H3844}; and my servants{H5650} shall be with thy servants{H5650}: and unto thee will I give{H5414}{(H8799)} hire{H7939} for thy servants{H5650} according to all that thou shalt appoint{H559}{(H8799)}: for thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} that there is not among us any{H376} that can skill{H3045}{(H8802)} to hew{H3772}{(H8800)} timber{H6086} like unto the Sidonians{H6722}.
1 Kings,5,7,"And it came to pass, when Hiram{H2438} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} the words{H1697} of Solomon{H8010}, that he rejoiced{H8055}{(H8799)} greatly{H3966}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be the LORD{H3068} this day{H3117}, which hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} unto David{H1732} a wise{H2450} son{H1121} over this great{H7227} people{H5971}."
1 Kings,5,8,"And Hiram{H2438} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Solomon{H8010}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I have considered{H8085}{(H8804)} the things which thou sentest{H7971}{(H8804)} to me for: and I will do{H6213}{(H8799)} all thy desire{H2656} concerning timber{H6086} of cedar{H730}, and concerning timber{H6086} of fir{H1265}."
1 Kings,5,9,"My servants{H5650} shall bring them down{H3381}{(H8686)} from Lebanon{H3844} unto the sea{H3220}: and I will convey{H7760}{(H8799)} them by sea{H3220} in floats{H1702} unto the place{H4725} that thou shalt appoint{H7971}{(H8799)} me, and will cause them to be discharged{H5310}{(H8765)} there, and thou shalt receive{H5375}{(H8799)} them: and thou shalt accomplish{H6213}{(H8799)} my desire{H2656}, in giving{H5414}{(H8800)} food{H3899} for my household{H1004}."
1 Kings,5,10,So Hiram{H2438} gave{H5414}{(H8802)} Solomon{H8010} cedar{H730} trees{H6086} and fir{H1265} trees{H6086} according to all his desire{H2656}.
1 Kings,5,11,"And Solomon{H8010} gave{H5414}{(H8804)} Hiram{H2438} twenty{H6242} thousand{H505} measures{H3734} of wheat{H2406} for food{H4361} to his household{H1004}, and twenty{H6242} measures{H3734} of pure{H3795} oil{H8081}: thus gave{H5414}{(H8799)} Solomon{H8010} to Hiram{H2438} year{H8141} by year{H8141}."
1 Kings,5,12,"And the LORD{H3068} gave{H5414}{(H8804)} Solomon{H8010} wisdom{H2451}, as he promised{H1696}{(H8765)} him: and there was peace{H7965} between Hiram{H2438} and Solomon{H8010}; and they two{H8147} made{H3772}{(H8799)} a league{H1285} together{H8147}."
1 Kings,5,13,And king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} raised{H5927}{(H8686)} a levy{H4522} out of all Israel{H3478}; and the levy{H4522} was thirty{H7970} thousand{H505} men{H376}.
1 Kings,5,14,"And he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} them to Lebanon{H3844}, ten{H6235} thousand{H505} a month{H2320} by courses{H2487}: a month{H2320} they were in Lebanon{H3844}, and two{H8147} months{H2320} at home{H1004}: and Adoniram{H141} was over the levy{H4522}."
1 Kings,5,15,"And Solomon{H8010} had threescore and ten{H7657} thousand{H505} that bare{H5375}{(H8802)} burdens{H5449}, and fourscore{H8084} thousand{H505} hewers{H2672}{(H8802)} in the mountains{H2022};"
1 Kings,5,16,"Beside the chief{H8269} of Solomon's{H8010} officers{H5324}{(H8737)} which were over the work{H4399}, three{H7969} thousand{H505} and three{H7969} hundred{H3967}, which ruled{H7287}{(H8802)} over the people{H5971} that wrought{H6213}{(H8802)} in the work{H4399}."
1 Kings,5,17,"And the king{H4428} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)}, and they brought{H5265}{(H8686)} great{H1419} stones{H68}, costly{H3368} stones{H68}, and hewed{H1496} stones{H68}, to lay the foundation{H3245}{(H8763)} of the house{H1004}."
1 Kings,5,18,"And Solomon's{H8010} builders{H1129}{(H8802)} and Hiram's{H2438} builders{H1129}{(H8802)} did hew{H6458}{(H8799)} them, and the stonesquarers{H1382}: so they prepared{H3559}{(H8686)} timber{H6086} and stones{H68} to build{H1129}{(H8800)} the house{H1004}."
1 Kings,6,1,"And it came to pass in the four{H702} hundred{H3967}{H8141} and eightieth{H8084} year{H8141} after the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} were come out{H3318}{(H8800)} of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, in the fourth{H7243} year{H8141} of Solomon's{H8010} reign{H4427}{(H8800)} over Israel{H3478}, in the month{H2320} Zif{H2099}, which is the second{H8145} month{H2320}, that he began to build{H1129}{(H8799)} the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
1 Kings,6,2,"And the house{H1004} which king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} built{H1129}{(H8804)} for the LORD{H3068}, the length{H753} thereof was threescore{H8346} cubits{H520}, and the breadth{H7341} thereof twenty{H6242} cubits, and the height{H6967} thereof thirty{H7970} cubits{H520}."
1 Kings,6,3,"And the porch{H197} before{H6440} the temple{H1964} of the house{H1004}, twenty{H6242} cubits{H520} was the length{H753} thereof, according to the breadth{H7341} of the house{H1004}; and ten{H6235} cubits{H520} was the breadth{H7341} thereof before the house{H1004}."
1 Kings,6,4,And for the house{H1004} he made{H6213}{(H8799)} windows{H2474} of narrow{H331}{(H8801)} lights{H8261}.
1 Kings,6,5,"And against the wall{H7023} of the house{H1004} he built{H1129}{(H8799)} chambers{H3326}{(H8675)}{H3326} round about{H5439}, against the walls{H7023} of the house{H1004} round about{H5439}, both of the temple{H1964} and of the oracle{H1687}: and he made{H6213}{(H8799)} chambers{H6763} round about{H5439}:"
1 Kings,6,6,"The nethermost{H8481} chamber{H3326}{(H8675)}{H3326} was five{H2568} cubits{H520} broad{H7341}, and the middle{H8484} was six{H8337} cubits{H520} broad{H7341}, and the third{H7992} was seven{H7651} cubits{H520} broad{H7341}: for without in the wall of{H2351} the house{H1004} he made{H5414}{(H8804)} narrowed rests{H4052} round about{H5439}, that the beams should not be fastened{H270}{(H8800)} in the walls{H7023} of the house{H1004}."
1 Kings,6,7,"And the house{H1004}, when it was in building{H1129}{(H8736)}, was built{H1129}{(H8738)} of stone{H68} made ready{H8003} before it was brought{H4551} thither: so that there was neither hammer{H4717} nor axe{H1631} nor any tool{H3627} of iron{H1270} heard{H8085}{(H8738)} in the house{H1004}, while it was in building{H1129}{(H8736)}."
1 Kings,6,8,"The door{H6607} for the middle{H8484} chamber{H6763} was in the right{H3233} side{H3802} of the house{H1004}: and they went up{H5927}{(H8799)} with winding stairs{H3883} into the middle{H8484} chamber, and out of the middle{H8484} into the third{H7992}."
1 Kings,6,9,"So he built{H1129}{(H8799)} the house{H1004}, and finished{H3615}{(H8762)} it; and covered{H5603}{(H8799)} the house{H1004} with beams{H1356} and boards{H7713} of cedar{H730}."
1 Kings,6,10,"And then he built{H1129}{(H8799)} chambers{H3326}{(H8675)}{H3326} against all the house{H1004}, five{H2568} cubits{H520} high{H6967}: and they rested{H270}{(H8799)} on the house{H1004} with timber{H6086} of cedar{H730}."
1 Kings,6,11,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came to Solomon{H8010}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
1 Kings,6,12,"Concerning this house{H1004} which thou art in building{H1129}{(H8802)}, if thou wilt walk{H3212}{(H8799)} in my statutes{H2708}, and execute{H6213}{(H8799)} my judgments{H4941}, and keep{H8104}{(H8804)} all my commandments{H4687} to walk{H3212}{(H8800)} in them; then will I perform{H6965}{(H8689)} my word{H1697} with thee, which I spake{H1696}{(H8765)} unto David{H1732} thy father{H1}:"
1 Kings,6,13,"And I will dwell{H7931}{(H8804)} among{H8432} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, and will not forsake{H5800}{(H8799)} my people{H5971} Israel{H3478}."
1 Kings,6,14,"So Solomon{H8010} built{H1129}{(H8799)} the house{H1004}, and finished{H3615}{(H8762)} it."
1 Kings,6,15,"And he built{H1129}{(H8799)} the walls{H7023} of the house{H1004} within{H1004} with boards{H6763} of cedar{H730}, both the floor{H7172} of the house{H1004}, and the walls{H7023} of the cieling{H5604}: and he covered{H6823}{(H8765)} them on the inside{H1004} with wood{H6086}, and covered{H6823}{(H8762)} the floor{H7172} of the house{H1004} with planks{H6763} of fir{H1265}."
1 Kings,6,16,"And he built{H1129}{(H8799)} twenty{H6242} cubits{H520} on the sides{H3411} of the house{H1004}, both{H4480} the floor{H7172} and the walls{H7023} with boards{H6763} of cedar{H730}: he even built{H1129}{(H8799)} them for it within{H1004}, even for the oracle{H1687}, even for the most{H6944} holy{H6944} place."
1 Kings,6,17,"And the house{H1004}, that is, the temple{H1964} before{H3942} it, was forty{H705} cubits{H520} long."
1 Kings,6,18,And the cedar{H730} of the house{H1004} within{H6441} was carved{H4734} with knops{H6497} and open{H6362}{(H8803)} flowers{H6731}: all was cedar{H730}; there was no stone{H68} seen{H7200}{(H8738)}.
1 Kings,6,19,"And the oracle{H1687} he prepared{H3559}{(H8689)} in{H8432} the house{H1004} within{H6441}, to set{H5414}{(H8800)} there the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068}."
1 Kings,6,20,"And the oracle{H1687} in the forepart{H6440} was twenty{H6242} cubits{H520} in length{H753}, and twenty{H6242} cubits{H520} in breadth{H7341}, and twenty{H6242} cubits{H520} in the height{H6967} thereof: and he overlaid{H6823}{(H8762)} it with pure{H5462}{(H8803)} gold{H2091}; and so covered{H6823}{(H8762)} the altar{H4196} which was of cedar{H730}."
1 Kings,6,21,So Solomon{H8010} overlaid{H6823}{(H8762)} the house{H1004} within{H6441} with pure{H5462}{(H8803)} gold{H2091}: and he made a partition{H5674}{(H8762)} by the chains{H7572}{(H8675)}{H7572} of gold{H2091} before{H6440} the oracle{H1687}; and he overlaid{H6823}{(H8762)} it with gold{H2091}.
1 Kings,6,22,"And the whole house{H1004} he overlaid{H6823}{(H8765)} with gold{H2091}, until he had finished{H8552}{(H8800)} all the house{H1004}: also the whole altar{H4196} that was by the oracle{H1687} he overlaid{H6823}{(H8765)} with gold{H2091}."
1 Kings,6,23,"And within the oracle{H1687} he made{H6213}{(H8799)} two{H8147} cherubims{H3742} of olive{H8081} tree{H6086}, each ten{H6235} cubits{H520} high{H6967}."
1 Kings,6,24,"And five{H2568} cubits{H520} was the one{H259} wing{H3671} of the cherub{H3742}, and five{H2568} cubits{H520} the other{H8145} wing{H3671} of the cherub{H3742}: from the uttermost part{H7098} of the one wing{H3671} unto the uttermost part{H7098} of the other{H3671} were ten{H6235} cubits{H520}."
1 Kings,6,25,And the other{H8145} cherub{H3742} was ten{H6235} cubits{H520}: both{H8147} the cherubims{H3742} were of one{H259} measure{H4060} and one{H259} size{H7095}.
1 Kings,6,26,"The height{H6967} of the one{H259} cherub{H3742} was ten{H6235} cubits{H520}, and so was it of the other{H8145} cherub{H3742}."
1 Kings,6,27,"And he set{H5414}{(H8799)} the cherubims{H3742} within{H8432} the inner{H6442} house{H1004}: and they stretched forth{H6566}{(H8799)} the wings{H3671} of the cherubims{H3742}, so that the wing{H3671} of the one{H259} touched{H5060}{(H8799)} the one wall{H7023}, and the wing{H3671} of the other{H8145} cherub{H3742} touched{H5060}{(H8802)} the other{H8145} wall{H7023}; and their wings{H3671} touched{H5060}{(H8802)} one{H3671} another{H3671} in the midst{H8432} of the house{H1004}."
1 Kings,6,28,And he overlaid{H6823}{(H8762)} the cherubims{H3742} with gold{H2091}.
1 Kings,6,29,"And he carved{H7049}{(H8804)} all the walls{H7023} of the house{H1004} round about{H4524} with carved{H6603} figures{H4734} of cherubims{H3742} and palm trees{H8561} and open{H6362}{(H8803)} flowers{H6731}, within{H6441} and without{H2435}."
1 Kings,6,30,"And the floor{H7172} of the house{H1004} he overlaid{H6823}{(H8765)} with gold{H2091}, within{H6441} and without{H2435}."
1 Kings,6,31,And for the entering{H6607} of the oracle{H1687} he made{H6213}{(H8804)} doors{H1817} of olive{H8081} tree{H6086}: the lintel{H352} and side posts{H4201} were a fifth part{H2549} of the wall.
1 Kings,6,32,"The two{H8147} doors{H1817} also were of olive{H8081} tree{H6086}; and he carved{H7049}{(H8804)} upon them carvings{H4734} of cherubims{H3742} and palm trees{H8561} and open{H6362}{(H8803)} flowers{H6731}, and overlaid{H6823}{(H8765)} them with gold{H2091}, and spread{H7286}{(H8686)} gold{H2091} upon the cherubims{H3742}, and upon the palm trees{H8561}."
1 Kings,6,33,"So also made{H6213}{(H8804)} he for the door{H6607} of the temple{H1964} posts{H4201} of olive{H8081} tree{H6086}, a fourth part{H7243} of the wall."
1 Kings,6,34,"And the two{H8147} doors{H1817} were of fir{H1265} tree{H6086}: the two{H8147} leaves{H6763} of the one{H259} door{H1817} were folding{H1550}, and the two{H8147} leaves{H7050} of the other{H8145} door{H1817} were folding{H1550}."
1 Kings,6,35,And he carved{H7049}{(H8804)} thereon cherubims{H3742} and palm trees{H8561} and open{H6362}{(H8803)} flowers{H6731}: and covered{H6823}{(H8765)} them with gold{H2091} fitted{H3474}{(H8794)} upon the carved work{H2707}{(H8794)}.
1 Kings,6,36,"And he built{H1129}{(H8799)} the inner{H6442} court{H2691} with three{H7969} rows{H2905} of hewed stone{H1496}, and a row{H2905} of cedar{H730} beams{H3773}."
1 Kings,6,37,"In the fourth{H7243} year{H8141} was the foundation{H3245} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} laid{H3245}{(H8795)}, in the month{H3391} Zif{H2099}:"
1 Kings,6,38,"And in the eleventh{H259}{H6240} year{H8141}, in the month{H3391} Bul{H945}, which is the eighth{H8066} month{H2320}, was the house{H1004} finished{H3615}{(H8804)} throughout all the parts{H1697} thereof, and according to all the fashion{H4941} of it. So was he seven{H7651} years{H8141} in building{H1129}{(H8799)} it."
1 Kings,7,1,"But Solomon{H8010} was building{H1129}{(H8804)} his own house{H1004} thirteen{H7969}{H6240} years{H8141}, and he finished{H3615}{(H8762)} all his house{H1004}."
1 Kings,7,2,"He built{H1129}{(H8799)} also the house{H1004} of the forest{H3293} of Lebanon{H3844}; the length{H753} thereof was an hundred{H3967} cubits{H520}, and the breadth{H7341} thereof fifty{H2572} cubits{H520}, and the height{H6967} thereof thirty{H7970} cubits{H520}, upon four{H702} rows{H2905} of cedar{H730} pillars{H5982}, with cedar{H730} beams{H3773} upon the pillars{H5982}."
1 Kings,7,3,"And it was covered{H5603}{(H8803)} with cedar{H730} above{H4605} upon the beams{H6763}, that lay on forty{H705} five{H2568} pillars{H5982}, fifteen{H6240} in a row{H2905}."
1 Kings,7,4,"And there were windows{H8261} in three{H7969} rows{H2905}, and light{H4237} was against light{H4237} in three{H7969} ranks{H6471}."
1 Kings,7,5,"And all the doors{H6607} and posts{H4201} were square{H7251}{(H8803)}, with the windows{H8260}: and light{H4237} was against{H4136} light{H4237} in three{H7969} ranks{H6471}."
1 Kings,7,6,"And he made{H6213}{(H8804)} a porch{H197} of pillars{H5982}; the length{H753} thereof was fifty{H2572} cubits{H520}, and the breadth{H7341} thereof thirty{H7970} cubits{H520}: and the porch{H197} was before{H6440} them: and the other pillars{H5982} and the thick beam{H5646} were before them."
1 Kings,7,7,"Then he made{H6213}{(H8804)} a porch{H197} for the throne{H3678} where he might judge{H8199}{(H8799)}, even the porch{H197} of judgment{H4941}: and it was covered{H5603}{(H8803)} with cedar{H730} from one side of the floor{H7172} to the other{H7172}."
1 Kings,7,8,"And his house{H1004} where he dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} had another{H312} court{H2691} within{H1004} the porch{H197}, which was of the like work{H4639}. Solomon{H8010} made{H6213}{(H8799)} also an house{H1004} for Pharaoh's{H6547} daughter{H1323}, whom he had taken{H3947}{(H8804)} to wife, like unto this porch{H197}."
1 Kings,7,9,"All these were of costly{H3368} stones{H68}, according to the measures{H4060} of hewed stones{H1496}, sawed{H1641}{(H8775)} with saws{H4050}, within{H1004} and without{H2351}, even from the foundation{H4527} unto the coping{H2947}, and so on the outside{H2351} toward the great{H1419} court{H2691}."
1 Kings,7,10,"And the foundation{H3245}{(H8794)} was of costly{H3368} stones{H68}, even great{H1419} stones{H68}, stones{H68} of ten{H6235} cubits{H520}, and stones{H68} of eight{H8083} cubits{H520}."
1 Kings,7,11,"And above{H4605} were costly{H3368} stones{H68}, after the measures{H4060} of hewed stones{H1496}, and cedars{H730}."
1 Kings,7,12,"And the great{H1419} court{H2691} round about{H5439} was with three{H7969} rows{H2905} of hewed stones{H1496}, and a row{H2905} of cedar{H730} beams{H3773}, both for the inner{H6442} court{H2691} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and for the porch{H197} of the house{H1004}."
1 Kings,7,13,And king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and fetched{H3947}{(H8799)} Hiram{H2438} out of Tyre{H6865}.
1 Kings,7,14,"He was a widow's{H802}{H490} son{H1121} of the tribe{H4294} of Naphtali{H5321}, and his father{H1} was a man{H376} of Tyre{H6876}, a worker{H2790}{(H8802)} in brass{H5178}: and he was filled{H4390}{(H8735)} with wisdom{H2451}, and understanding{H8394}, and cunning{H1847} to work{H6213}{(H8800)} all works{H4399} in brass{H5178}. And he came{H935}{(H8799)} to king{H4428} Solomon{H8010}, and wrought{H6213}{(H8799)} all his work{H4399}."
1 Kings,7,15,"For he cast{H6696}{(H8799)} two{H8147} pillars{H5982} of brass{H5178}, of eighteen{H8083}{H6240} cubits{H520} high{H6967} apiece{H5982}{H259}: and a line{H2339} of twelve{H8147}{H6240} cubits{H520} did compass{H5437} either{H8145} of them about{H5437}{(H8799)}."
1 Kings,7,16,"And he made{H6213}{(H8804)} two{H8147} chapiters{H3805} of molten{H3332}{(H8716)} brass{H5178}, to set{H5414}{(H8800)} upon the tops{H7218} of the pillars{H5982}: the height{H6967} of the one{H259} chapiter{H3805} was five{H2568} cubits{H520}, and the height{H6967} of the other{H8145} chapiter{H3805} was five{H2568} cubits{H520}:"
1 Kings,7,17,"And nets{H7638} of checker{H7639} work{H4639}, and wreaths{H1434} of chain{H8333} work{H4639}, for the chapiters{H3805} which were upon the top{H7218} of the pillars{H5982}; seven{H7651} for the one{H259} chapiter{H3805}, and seven{H7651} for the other{H8145} chapiter{H3805}."
1 Kings,7,18,"And he made{H6213}{(H8799)} the pillars{H5982}, and two{H8147} rows{H2905} round about{H5439} upon the one{H259} network{H7639}, to cover{H3680}{(H8763)} the chapiters{H3805} that were upon the top{H7218}, with pomegranates{H7416}: and so did{H6213}{(H8804)} he for the other{H8145} chapiter{H3805}."
1 Kings,7,19,"And the chapiters{H3805} that were upon the top{H7218} of the pillars{H5982} were of lily{H7799} work{H4639} in the porch{H197}, four{H702} cubits{H520}."
1 Kings,7,20,"And the chapiters{H3805} upon the two{H8147} pillars{H5982} had pomegranates also above{H4605}, over against{H5980} the belly{H990} which was by{H5676} the network{H7639}: and the pomegranates{H7416} were two hundred{H3967} in rows{H2905} round about{H5439} upon the other{H8145} chapiter{H3805}."
1 Kings,7,21,"And he set up{H6965}{(H8686)} the pillars{H5982} in the porch{H197} of the temple{H1964}: and he set up{H6965}{(H8686)} the right{H3233} pillar{H5982}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} the name{H8034} thereof Jachin{H3199}: and he set up{H6965}{(H8686)} the left{H8042} pillar{H5982}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} the name{H8034} thereof Boaz{H1162}."
1 Kings,7,22,And upon the top{H7218} of the pillars{H5982} was lily{H7799} work{H4639}: so was the work{H4399} of the pillars{H5982} finished{H8552}{(H8799)}.
1 Kings,7,23,"And he made{H6213}{(H8799)} a molten{H3332}{(H8716)} sea{H3220}, ten{H6235} cubits{H520} from the one brim{H8193} to the other{H8193}: it was round{H5696} all about{H5439}, and his height{H6967} was five{H2568} cubits{H520}: and a line{H6957}{(H8675)}{H6961} of thirty{H7970} cubits{H520} did compass{H5437}{(H8799)} it round about{H5439}."
1 Kings,7,24,"And under the brim{H8193} of it round about{H5439} there were knops{H6497} compassing{H5437}{(H8802)} it, ten{H6235} in a cubit{H520}, compassing{H5362}{(H8688)} the sea{H3220} round about{H5439}: the knops{H6497} were cast{H3333} in two{H8147} rows{H2905}, when it was cast{H3332}{(H8803)}."
1 Kings,7,25,"It stood{H5975}{(H8802)} upon twelve{H8147}{H6240} oxen{H1241}, three{H7969} looking{H6437}{(H8802)} toward the north{H6828}, and three{H7969} looking{H6437}{(H8802)} toward the west{H3220}, and three{H7969} looking{H6437}{(H8802)} toward the south{H5045}, and three{H7969} looking{H6437}{(H8802)} toward the east{H4217}: and the sea{H3220} was set above{H4605} upon them, and all their hinder parts{H268} were inward{H1004}."
1 Kings,7,26,"And it was an hand breadth{H2947} thick{H5672}, and the brim{H8193} thereof was wrought{H4639} like the brim{H8193} of a cup{H3563}, with flowers{H6525} of lilies{H7799}: it contained{H3557}{(H8686)} two thousand{H505} baths{H1324}."
1 Kings,7,27,"And he made{H6213}{(H8799)} ten{H6235} bases{H4350} of brass{H5178}; four{H702} cubits{H520} was the length{H753} of one{H259} base{H4350}, and four{H702} cubits{H520} the breadth{H7341} thereof, and three{H7969} cubits{H520} the height{H6967} of it."
1 Kings,7,28,"And the work{H4639} of the bases{H4350} was on this manner: they had borders{H4526}, and the borders{H4526} were between the ledges{H7948}:"
1 Kings,7,29,"And on the borders{H4526} that were between the ledges{H7948} were lions{H738}, oxen{H1241}, and cherubims{H3742}: and upon the ledges{H7948} there was a base{H3653} above{H4605}: and beneath the lions{H738} and oxen{H1241} were certain additions{H3914} made of thin{H4174} work{H4639}."
1 Kings,7,30,"And every{H259} base{H4350} had four{H702} brasen{H5178} wheels{H212}, and plates{H5633} of brass{H5178}: and the four{H702} corners{H6471} thereof had undersetters{H3802}: under the laver{H3595} were undersetters{H3802} molten{H3332}{(H8803)}, at the side{H5676} of every{H376} addition{H3914}."
1 Kings,7,31,"And the mouth{H6310} of it within{H1004} the chapiter{H3805} and above{H4605} was a cubit{H520}: but the mouth{H6310} thereof was round{H5696} after the work{H4639} of the base{H3653}, a cubit{H520} and an half{H2677}: and also upon the mouth{H6310} of it were gravings{H4734} with their borders{H4526}, foursquare{H7251}{(H8794)}, not round{H5696}."
1 Kings,7,32,And under{H8478} the borders{H4526} were four{H702} wheels{H212}; and the axletrees{H3027} of the wheels{H212} were joined to the base{H4350}: and the height{H6967} of a{H259} wheel{H212} was a cubit{H520} and half{H2677} a cubit{H520}.
1 Kings,7,33,"And the work{H4639} of the wheels{H212} was like the work{H4639} of a chariot{H4818} wheel{H212}: their axletrees{H3027}, and their naves{H1354}, and their felloes{H2839}, and their spokes{H2840}, were all molten{H3332}{(H8716)}."
1 Kings,7,34,And there were four{H702} undersetters{H3802} to the four{H702} corners{H6438} of one{H259} base{H4350}: and the undersetters{H3802} were of the very base{H4350} itself.
1 Kings,7,35,And in the top{H7218} of the base{H4350} was there a round{H5696} compass{H5439} of half{H2677} a cubit{H520} high{H6967}: and on the top{H7218} of the base{H4350} the ledges{H3027} thereof and the borders{H4526} thereof were of the same.
1 Kings,7,36,"For on the plates{H3871} of the ledges{H3027} thereof, and on the borders{H4526} thereof, he graved{H6605}{(H8762)} cherubims{H3742}, lions{H738}, and palm trees{H8561}, according to the proportion{H4626} of every one{H376}, and additions{H3914} round about{H5439}."
1 Kings,7,37,"After this manner he made{H6213}{(H8804)} the ten{H6235} bases{H4350}: all of them had one{H259} casting{H4165}, one{H259} measure{H4060}, and one{H259} size{H7095}."
1 Kings,7,38,Then made{H6213}{(H8799)} he ten{H6235} lavers{H3595} of brass{H5178}: one{H259} laver{H3595} contained{H3557}{(H8686)} forty{H705} baths{H1324}: and every{H259} laver{H3595} was four{H702} cubits{H520}: and upon every one{H259} of the ten{H6235} bases{H4350} one{H259} laver{H3595}.
1 Kings,7,39,"And he put{H5414}{(H8799)} five{H2568} bases{H4350} on the right{H3225} side{H3802} of the house{H1004}, and five{H2568} on the left{H8040} side{H3802} of the house{H1004}: and he set{H5414}{(H8804)} the sea{H3220} on the right{H3233} side{H3802} of the house{H1004} eastward{H6924} over against{H4136} the south{H5045}."
1 Kings,7,40,"And Hiram{H2438} made{H6213}{(H8799)} the lavers{H3595}, and the shovels{H3257}, and the basons{H4219}. So Hiram{H2438} made{H3615}{(H8762)} an end of doing{H6213}{(H8800)} all the work{H4399} that he made{H6213}{(H8804)} king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} for the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}:"
1 Kings,7,41,"The two{H8147} pillars{H5982}, and the two bowls{H1543} of the chapiters{H3805} that were on the top{H7218} of the two{H8147} pillars{H5982}; and the two{H8147} networks{H7639}, to cover{H3680}{(H8763)} the two{H8147} bowls{H1543} of the chapiters{H3805} which were upon the top{H7218} of the pillars{H5982};"
1 Kings,7,42,"And four{H702} hundred{H3967} pomegranates{H7416} for the two{H8147} networks{H7639}, even two{H8147} rows{H2905} of pomegranates{H7416} for one{H259} network{H7639}, to cover{H3680}{(H8763)} the two{H8147} bowls{H1543} of the chapiters{H3805} that were upon{H6440} the pillars{H5982};"
1 Kings,7,43,"And the ten{H6235} bases{H4350}, and ten{H6235} lavers{H3595} on the bases{H4350};"
1 Kings,7,44,"And one{H259} sea{H3220}, and twelve{H8147}{H6240} oxen{H1241} under the sea{H3220};"
1 Kings,7,45,"And the pots{H5518}, and the shovels{H3257}, and the basons{H4219}: and all these vessels{H3627}, which Hiram{H2438} made{H6213}{(H8804)} to king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} for the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, were of bright{H4178}{(H8794)} brass{H5178}."
1 Kings,7,46,"In the plain{H3603} of Jordan{H3383} did the king{H4428} cast{H3332}{(H8804)} them, in the clay{H4568} ground{H127} between Succoth{H5523} and Zarthan{H6891}."
1 Kings,7,47,"And Solomon{H8010} left{H3240}{(H8686)} all the vessels{H3627} unweighed, because they were exceeding{H3966}{H3966} many{H7230}: neither was the weight{H4948} of the brass{H5178} found out{H2713}{(H8738)}."
1 Kings,7,48,"And Solomon{H8010} made{H6213}{(H8799)} all the vessels{H3627} that pertained unto the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}: the altar{H4196} of gold{H2091}, and the table{H7979} of gold{H2091}, whereupon the shewbread{H3899}{H6440} was,"
1 Kings,7,49,"And the candlesticks{H4501} of pure{H5462}{(H8803)} gold{H2091}, five{H2568} on the right{H3225} side, and five{H2568} on the left{H8040}, before{H6440} the oracle{H1687}, with the flowers{H6525}, and the lamps{H5216}, and the tongs{H4457} of gold{H2091},"
1 Kings,7,50,"And the bowls{H5592}, and the snuffers{H4212}, and the basons{H4219}, and the spoons{H3709}, and the censers{H4289} of pure{H5462}{(H8803)} gold{H2091}; and the hinges{H6596} of gold{H2091}, both for the doors{H1817} of the inner{H6442} house{H1004}, the most{H6944} holy{H6944} place, and for the doors{H1817} of the house{H1004}, to wit, of the temple{H1964}."
1 Kings,7,51,"So was ended{H7999}{(H8799)} all the work{H4399} that king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} made{H6213}{(H8804)} for the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}. And Solomon{H8010} brought in{H935}{(H8686)} the things which David{H1732} his father{H1} had dedicated{H6944}; even the silver{H3701}, and the gold{H2091}, and the vessels{H3627}, did he put{H5414}{(H8804)} among the treasures{H214} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
1 Kings,8,1,"Then Solomon{H8010} assembled{H6950}{(H8686)} the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478}, and all the heads{H7218} of the tribes{H4294}, the chief{H5387} of the fathers{H1} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, unto king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} in Jerusalem{H3389}, that they might bring up{H5927}{(H8687)} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068} out of the city{H5892} of David{H1732}, which is Zion{H6726}."
1 Kings,8,2,"And all the men{H376} of Israel{H3478} assembled{H6950}{(H8735)} themselves unto king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} at the feast{H2282} in the month{H3391} Ethanim{H388}, which is the seventh{H7637} month{H2320}."
1 Kings,8,3,"And all the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478} came{H935}{(H8799)}, and the priests{H3548} took up{H5375}{(H8799)} the ark{H727}."
1 Kings,8,4,"And they brought up{H5927}{(H8686)} the ark{H727} of the LORD{H3068}, and the tabernacle{H168} of the congregation{H4150}, and all the holy{H6944} vessels{H3627} that were in the tabernacle{H168}, even those did the priests{H3548} and the Levites{H3881} bring up{H5927}{(H8686)}."
1 Kings,8,5,"And king{H4428} Solomon{H8010}, and all the congregation{H5712} of Israel{H3478}, that were assembled{H3259}{(H8737)} unto him, were with him before{H6440} the ark{H727}, sacrificing{H2076}{(H8764)} sheep{H6629} and oxen{H1241}, that could not be told{H5608}{(H8735)} nor numbered{H4487}{(H8735)} for multitude{H7230}."
1 Kings,8,6,"And the priests{H3548} brought in{H935}{(H8686)} the ark{H727} of the covenant{H1285} of the LORD{H3068} unto his place{H4725}, into the oracle{H1687} of the house{H1004}, to the most{H6944} holy{H6944} place, even under the wings{H3671} of the cherubims{H3742}."
1 Kings,8,7,"For the cherubims{H3742} spread forth{H6566}{(H8802)} their two wings{H3671} over the place{H4725} of the ark{H727}, and the cherubims{H3742} covered{H5526}{(H8799)} the ark{H727} and the staves{H905} thereof above{H4605}."
1 Kings,8,8,"And they drew out{H748}{(H8686)} the staves{H905}, that the ends{H7218} of the staves{H905} were seen out{H7200}{(H8735)} in the holy{H6944} place before{H6440} the oracle{H1687}, and they were not seen{H7200}{(H8735)} without{H2351}: and there they are unto this day{H3117}."
1 Kings,8,9,"There was nothing in the ark{H727} save{H7535} the two{H8147} tables{H3871} of stone{H68}, which Moses{H4872} put{H3240}{(H8689)} there at Horeb{H2722}, when the LORD{H3068} made{H3772}{(H8804)} a covenant with the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, when they came out{H3318}{(H8800)} of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
1 Kings,8,10,"And it came to pass, when the priests{H3548} were come out{H3318}{(H8800)} of the holy{H6944} place, that the cloud{H6051} filled{H4390}{(H8804)} the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068},"
1 Kings,8,11,So that the priests{H3548} could{H3201}{(H8804)} not stand{H5975}{(H8800)} to minister{H8334}{(H8763)} because{H6440} of the cloud{H6051}: for the glory{H3519} of the LORD{H3068} had filled{H4390}{(H8804)} the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}.
1 Kings,8,12,"Then spake{H559}{(H8804)} Solomon{H8010}, The LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8804)} that he would dwell{H7931}{(H8800)} in the thick darkness{H6205}."
1 Kings,8,13,"I have surely{H1129}{(H8800)} built{H1129}{(H8804)} thee an house{H1004} to dwell in{H2073}, a settled place{H4349} for thee to abide in{H3427}{(H8800)} for ever{H5769}."
1 Kings,8,14,"And the king{H4428} turned{H5437} his face{H6440} about{H5437}{(H8686)}, and blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} all the congregation{H6951} of Israel{H3478}:(and all the congregation{H6951} of Israel{H3478} stood{H5975}{(H8802)};)"

1 Kings,8,66,"On the eighth{H8066} day{H3117} he sent{H7971} the people{H5971} away{H7971}{(H8765)}: and they blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} the king{H4428}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} unto their tents{H168} joyful{H8056} and glad{H2896} of heart{H3820} for all the goodness{H2896} that the LORD{H3068} had done{H6213}{(H8804)} for David{H1732} his servant{H5650}, and for Israel{H3478} his people{H5971}."
1 Kings,9,1,"And it came to pass, when Solomon{H8010} had finished{H3615}{(H8763)} the building{H1129}{(H8800)} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, and all Solomon's{H8010} desire{H2837} which he was pleased{H2654}{(H8804)} to do{H6213}{(H8800)},"
1 Kings,9,2,"That the LORD{H3068} appeared{H7200}{(H8735)} to Solomon{H8010} the second time{H8145}, as he had appeared{H7200}{(H8738)} unto him at Gibeon{H1391}."
1 Kings,9,3,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} thy prayer{H8605} and thy supplication{H8467}, that thou hast made{H2603}{(H8694)} before{H6440} me: I have hallowed{H6942}{(H8689)} this house{H1004}, which thou hast built{H1129}{(H8804)}, to put{H7760}{(H8800)} my name{H8034} there for{H5704} ever{H5769}; and mine eyes{H5869} and mine heart{H3820} shall be there perpetually{H3117}."
1 Kings,9,4,"And if thou wilt walk{H3212}{(H8799)} before{H6440} me, as David{H1732} thy father{H1} walked{H1980}{(H8804)}, in integrity{H8537} of heart{H3824}, and in uprightness{H3476}, to do{H6213}{(H8800)} according to all that I have commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} thee, and wilt keep{H8104}{(H8799)} my statutes{H2706} and my judgments{H4941}:"
1 Kings,9,5,"Then I will establish{H6965}{(H8689)} the throne{H3678} of thy kingdom{H4467} upon Israel{H3478} for ever{H5769}, as I promised{H1696}{(H8765)} to David{H1732} thy father{H1}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, There shall not fail{H3772}{(H8735)} thee a man{H376} upon the throne{H3678} of Israel{H3478}."
1 Kings,9,6,"But if ye shall at all{H7725}{(H8800)} turn{H7725}{(H8799)} from following{H310} me, ye or your children{H1121}, and will not keep{H8104}{(H8799)} my commandments{H4687} and my statutes{H2708} which I have set{H5414}{(H8804)} before{H6440} you, but go{H1980}{(H8804)} and serve{H5647}{(H8804)} other{H312} gods{H430}, and worship{H7812}{(H8694)} them:"
1 Kings,9,7,"Then will I cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} Israel{H3478} out{H6440} of the land{H127} which I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} them; and this house{H1004}, which I have hallowed{H6942}{(H8689)} for my name{H8034}, will I cast out{H7971}{(H8762)} of my sight{H6440}; and Israel{H3478} shall be a proverb{H4912} and a byword{H8148} among all people{H5971}:"
1 Kings,9,8,"And at this house{H1004}, which is high{H5945}, every one that passeth{H5674}{(H8802)} by it shall be astonished{H8074}{(H8799)}, and shall hiss{H8319}{(H8804)}; and they shall say{H559}{(H8804)}, Why hath the LORD{H3068} done{H6213}{(H8804)} thus unto this land{H776}, and to this house{H1004}?"
1 Kings,9,9,"And they shall answer{H559}{(H8804)}, Because they forsook{H5800}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, who brought forth{H3318}{(H8689)} their fathers{H1} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, and have taken hold{H2388}{(H8686)} upon other{H312} gods{H430}, and have worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)} them, and served{H5647}{(H8799)} them: therefore hath the LORD{H3068} brought{H935}{(H8689)} upon them all this evil{H7451}."
1 Kings,9,10,"And it came to pass at the end{H7097} of twenty{H6242} years{H8141}, when Solomon{H8010} had built{H1129}{(H8804)} the two{H8147} houses{H1004}, the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and the king's{H4428} house{H1004},"
1 Kings,9,11,"( Now Hiram{H2438} the king{H4428} of Tyre{H6865} had furnished{H5375}{(H8765)} Solomon{H8010} with cedar{H730} trees{H6086} and fir{H1265} trees{H6086}, and with gold{H2091}, according to all his desire{H2656},) that then{H227} king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} Hiram{H2438} twenty{H6242} cities{H5892} in the land{H776} of Galilee{H1551}."
1 Kings,9,12,And Hiram{H2438} came out{H3318}{(H8799)} from Tyre{H6865} to see{H7200}{(H8800)} the cities{H5892} which Solomon{H8010} had given{H5414}{(H8804)} him; and they pleased{H3474}{(H8804)}{H5869} him not.
1 Kings,9,13,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, What cities{H5892} are these which thou hast given{H5414}{(H8804)} me, my brother{H251}? And he called{H7121}{(H8799)} them the land{H776} of Cabul{H3521} unto this day{H3117}."
1 Kings,9,14,And Hiram{H2438} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} sixscore{H3967}{H6242} talents{H3603} of gold{H2091}.
1 Kings,9,15,"And this is the reason{H1697} of the levy{H4522} which king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} raised{H5927}{(H8689)}; for to build{H1129}{(H8800)} the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and his own house{H1004}, and Millo{H4407}, and the wall{H2346} of Jerusalem{H3389}, and Hazor{H2674}, and Megiddo{H4023}, and Gezer{H1507}."
1 Kings,9,16,"For Pharaoh{H6547} king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714} had gone up{H5927}{(H8804)}, and taken{H3920}{(H8799)} Gezer{H1507}, and burnt{H8313}{(H8799)} it with fire{H784}, and slain{H2026}{(H8804)} the Canaanites{H3669} that dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} in the city{H5892}, and given{H5414}{(H8799)} it for a present{H7964} unto his daughter{H1323}, Solomon's{H8010} wife{H802}."
1 Kings,9,17,"And Solomon{H8010} built{H1129}{(H8799)} Gezer{H1507}, and Bethhoron{H1032} the nether{H8481},"

1 Kings,9,20,"And all the people{H5971} that were left{H3498}{(H8737)} of the Amorites{H567}, Hittites{H2850}, Perizzites{H6522}, Hivites{H2340}, and Jebusites{H2983}, which were not of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478},"
1 Kings,9,21,"Their children{H1121} that were left{H3498}{(H8738)} after{H310} them in the land{H776}, whom the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} also were not able{H3201}{(H8804)} utterly to destroy{H2763}{(H8687)}, upon those did Solomon{H8010} levy{H5927}{(H8686)} a tribute{H4522} of bondservice{H5647}{(H8802)} unto this day{H3117}."
1 Kings,9,22,"But of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} did Solomon{H8010} make{H5414}{(H8804)} no bondmen{H5650}: but they were men{H582} of war{H4421}, and his servants{H5650}, and his princes{H8269}, and his captains{H7991}, and rulers{H8269} of his chariots{H7393}, and his horsemen{H6571}."
1 Kings,9,23,"These were the chief{H8269} of the officers{H5324}{(H8737)} that were over Solomon's{H8010} work{H4399}, five{H2568} hundred{H3967} and fifty{H2572}, which bare rule{H7287}{(H8802)} over the people{H5971} that wrought{H6213}{(H8804)} in the work{H4399}."
1 Kings,9,24,But Pharaoh's{H6547} daughter{H1323} came up{H5927}{(H8804)} out of the city{H5892} of David{H1732} unto her house{H1004} which Solomon had built{H1129}{(H8804)} for her: then did he build{H1129}{(H8804)} Millo{H4407}.
1 Kings,9,25,"And three{H7969} times{H6471} in a year{H8141} did Solomon{H8010} offer{H5927}{(H8689)} burnt offerings{H5930} and peace offerings{H8002} upon the altar{H4196} which he built{H1129}{(H8804)} unto the LORD{H3068}, and he burnt incense{H6999}{(H8687)} upon the altar{H4196} that was before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}. So he finished{H7999}{(H8765)} the house{H1004}."
1 Kings,9,26,"And king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} made{H6213}{(H8804)} a navy of ships{H590} in Eziongeber{H6100}, which is beside Eloth{H359}, on the shore{H8193} of the Red{H5488} sea{H3220}, in the land{H776} of Edom{H123}."
1 Kings,9,27,"And Hiram{H2438} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} in the navy{H590} his servants{H5650}, shipmen{H582}{H591} that had knowledge{H3045}{(H8802)} of the sea{H3220}, with the servants{H5650} of Solomon{H8010}."
1 Kings,9,28,"And they came{H935}{(H8799)} to Ophir{H211}, and fetched{H3947}{(H8799)} from thence gold{H2091}, four{H702} hundred{H3967} and twenty{H6242} talents{H3603}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} it to king{H4428} Solomon{H8010}."
1 Kings,10,1,"And when the queen{H4436} of Sheba{H7614} heard{H8085}{(H8802)} of the fame{H8088} of Solomon{H8010} concerning the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068}, she came{H935}{(H8799)} to prove{H5254}{(H8763)} him with hard questions{H2420}."
1 Kings,10,2,"And she came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389} with a very{H3966} great{H3515} train{H2428}, with camels{H1581} that bare{H5375}{(H8802)} spices{H1314}, and very{H3966} much{H7227} gold{H2091}, and precious{H3368} stones{H68}: and when she was come{H935}{(H8799)} to Solomon{H8010}, she communed{H1696}{(H8762)} with him of all that was in her heart{H3824}."
1 Kings,10,3,"And Solomon{H8010} told{H5046}{(H8686)} her all her questions{H1697}: there was not any thing{H1697} hid{H5956}{(H8737)} from the king{H4428}, which he told{H5046}{(H8689)} her not."
1 Kings,10,4,"And when the queen{H4436} of Sheba{H7614} had seen{H7200}{(H8799)} all Solomon's{H8010} wisdom{H2451}, and the house{H1004} that he had built{H1129}{(H8804)},"
1 Kings,10,5,"And the meat{H3978} of his table{H7979}, and the sitting{H4186} of his servants{H5650}, and the attendance{H4612} of his ministers{H8334}{(H8764)}, and their apparel{H4403}, and his cupbearers{H8248}{(H8688)}, and his ascent{H5930} by which he went up{H5927}{(H8799)} unto the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}; there was no more spirit{H7307} in her."
1 Kings,10,6,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428}, It was a true{H571} report{H1697} that I heard{H8085}{(H8804)} in mine own land{H776} of thy acts{H1697} and of thy wisdom{H2451}."
1 Kings,10,7,"Howbeit I believed{H539}{(H8689)} not the words{H1697}, until I came{H935}{(H8804)}, and mine eyes{H5869} had seen{H7200}{(H8799)} it: and, behold, the half{H2677} was not told{H5046}{(H8717)} me: thy wisdom{H2451} and prosperity{H2896} exceedeth{H3254}{(H8689)} the fame{H8052} which I heard{H8085}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,10,8,"Happy{H835} are thy men{H582}, happy{H835} are these thy servants{H5650}, which stand{H5975}{(H8802)} continually{H8548} before{H6440} thee, and that hear{H8085}{(H8802)} thy wisdom{H2451}."
1 Kings,10,9,"Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}, which delighted{H2654}{(H8804)} in thee, to set{H5414}{(H8800)} thee on the throne{H3678} of Israel{H3478}: because the LORD{H3068} loved{H160} Israel{H3478} for ever{H5769}, therefore made{H7760}{(H8799)} he thee king{H4428}, to do{H6213}{(H8800)} judgment{H4941} and justice{H6666}."
1 Kings,10,10,"And she gave{H5414}{(H8799)} the king{H4428} an hundred{H3967} and twenty{H6242} talents{H3603} of gold{H2091}, and of spices{H1314} very{H3966} great store{H7235}{(H8687)}, and precious{H3368} stones{H68}: there came{H935}{(H8804)} no more such{H1931} abundance{H7230} of spices{H1314} as these which the queen{H4436} of Sheba{H7614} gave{H5414}{(H8804)} to king{H4428} Solomon{H8010}."
1 Kings,10,11,"And the navy{H590} also of Hiram{H2438}, that brought{H5375}{(H8804)} gold{H2091} from Ophir{H211}, brought in{H935}{(H8689)} from Ophir{H211} great{H3966} plenty{H7235}{(H8687)} of almug{H484} trees{H6086}, and precious{H3368} stones{H68}."
1 Kings,10,12,"And the king{H4428} made{H6213}{(H8799)} of the almug{H484} trees{H6086} pillars{H4552} for the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and for the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, harps{H3658} also and psalteries{H5035} for singers{H7891}{(H8802)}: there came{H935}{(H8804)} no such almug{H484} trees{H6086}, nor were seen{H7200}{(H8738)} unto this day{H3117}."
1 Kings,10,13,"And king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} gave{H5414}{(H8804)} unto the queen{H4436} of Sheba{H7614} all her desire{H2656}, whatsoever she asked{H7592}{(H8804)}, beside that which Solomon{H8010} gave{H5414}{(H8804)} her of his royal{H4428} bounty{H3027}. So she turned{H6437}{(H8799)} and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to her own country{H776}, she and her servants{H5650}."
1 Kings,10,14,"Now the weight{H4948} of gold{H2091} that came{H935}{(H8804)} to Solomon{H8010} in one{H259} year{H8141} was six{H8337} hundred{H3967} threescore{H8346} and six{H8337} talents{H3603} of gold{H2091},"
1 Kings,10,15,"Beside that he had of the merchantmen{H582}{H8446}{(H8802)}, and of the traffick{H4536} of the spice merchants{H7402}{(H8802)}, and of all the kings{H4428} of Arabia{H6153}, and of the governors{H6346} of the country{H776}."
1 Kings,10,16,And king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} made{H6213}{(H8799)} two hundred{H3967} targets{H6793} of beaten{H7820}{(H8803)} gold{H2091}: six{H8337} hundred{H3967} shekels of gold{H2091} went{H5927}{(H8686)} to one{H259} target{H6793}.
1 Kings,10,17,And he made three{H7969} hundred{H3967} shields{H4043} of beaten{H7820}{(H8803)} gold{H2091}; three{H7969} pound{H4488} of gold{H2091} went{H5927}{(H8686)} to one{H259} shield{H4043}: and the king{H4428} put{H5414}{(H8799)} them in the house{H1004} of the forest{H3293} of Lebanon{H3844}.
1 Kings,10,18,"Moreover the king{H4428} made{H6213}{(H8799)} a great{H1419} throne{H3678} of ivory{H8127}, and overlaid{H6823}{(H8762)} it with the best{H6338}{(H8716)} gold{H2091}."
1 Kings,10,19,"The throne{H3678} had six{H8337} steps{H4609}, and the top{H7218} of the throne{H3678} was round{H5696} behind{H310}: and there were stays{H3027} on either side on the place{H4725} of the seat{H7675}{(H8800)}, and two{H8147} lions{H738} stood{H5975}{(H8802)} beside{H681} the stays{H3027}."
1 Kings,10,20,And twelve{H8147}{H6240} lions{H738} stood{H5975}{(H8802)} there on the one side and on the other upon the six{H8337} steps{H4609}: there was not the like{H3651} made{H6213}{(H8738)} in any kingdom{H4467}.
1 Kings,10,21,"And all king{H4428} Solomon's{H8010} drinking{H4945} vessels{H3627} were of gold{H2091}, and all the vessels{H3627} of the house{H1004} of the forest{H3293} of Lebanon{H3844} were of pure{H5462}{(H8803)} gold{H2091}; none were of silver{H3701}: it was nothing{H3972} accounted{H2803}{(H8737)} of in the days{H3117} of Solomon{H8010}."
1 Kings,10,22,"For the king{H4428} had at sea{H3220} a navy{H590} of Tharshish{H8659} with the navy{H590} of Hiram{H2438}: once{H259} in three{H7969} years{H8141} came{H935}{(H8799)} the navy{H590} of Tharshish{H8659}, bringing{H5375}{(H8802)} gold{H2091}, and silver{H3701}, ivory{H8143}, and apes{H6971}, and peacocks{H8500}."
1 Kings,10,23,So king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} exceeded{H1431}{(H8799)} all the kings{H4428} of the earth{H776} for riches{H6239} and for wisdom{H2451}.
1 Kings,10,24,"And all the earth{H776} sought{H1245}{(H8764)} to{H6440} Solomon{H8010}, to hear{H8085}{(H8800)} his wisdom{H2451}, which God{H430} had put{H5414}{(H8804)} in his heart{H3820}."
1 Kings,10,25,"And they brought{H935}{(H8688)} every man{H376} his present{H4503}, vessels{H3627} of silver{H3701}, and vessels{H3627} of gold{H2091}, and garments{H8008}, and armour{H5402}, and spices{H1314}, horses{H5483}, and mules{H6505}, a rate{H1697} year{H8141} by year{H8141}."
1 Kings,10,26,"And Solomon{H8010} gathered together{H622}{(H8799)} chariots{H7393} and horsemen{H6571}: and he had a thousand{H505} and four{H702} hundred{H3967} chariots{H7393}, and twelve{H8147}{H6240} thousand{H505} horsemen{H6571}, whom he bestowed{H5148}{(H8686)} in the cities{H5892} for chariots{H7393}, and with the king{H4428} at Jerusalem{H3389}."
1 Kings,10,27,"And the king{H4428} made{H5414}{(H8799)} silver{H3701} to be in Jerusalem{H3389} as stones{H68}, and cedars{H730} made{H5414}{(H8804)} he to be as the sycomore trees{H8256} that are in the vale{H8219}, for abundance{H7230}."
1 Kings,10,28,"And Solomon{H8010} had horses{H5483} brought{H4161} out of Egypt{H4714}, and linen yarn{H4723}: the king's{H4428} merchants{H5503}{(H8802)} received{H3947}{(H8799)} the linen yarn{H4723} at a price{H4242}."
1 Kings,10,29,"And a chariot{H4818} came up{H5927}{(H8799)} and went out{H3318}{(H8799)} of Egypt{H4714} for six{H8337} hundred{H3967} shekels of silver{H3701}, and an horse{H5483} for an hundred{H3967} and fifty{H2572}: and so for all the kings{H4428} of the Hittites{H2850}, and for the kings{H4428} of Syria{H758}, did they bring them out{H3318}{(H8686)} by their means{H3027}."
1 Kings,11,1,"But king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} loved{H157}{(H8804)} many{H7227} strange{H5237} women{H802}, together with the daughter{H1323} of Pharaoh{H6547}, women of the Moabites{H4125}, Ammonites{H5984}, Edomites{H130}, Zidonians{H6722}, and Hittites{H2850};"
1 Kings,11,2,"Of the nations{H1471} concerning which the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8804)} unto the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, Ye shall not go in{H935}{(H8799)} to them, neither shall they come in{H935}{(H8799)} unto you: for surely{H403} they will turn away{H5186}{(H8686)} your heart{H3824} after{H310} their gods{H430}: Solomon{H8010} clave{H1692}{(H8804)} unto these in love{H157}{(H8800)}."
1 Kings,11,3,"And he had seven{H7651} hundred{H3967} wives{H802}, princesses{H8282}, and three{H7969} hundred{H3967} concubines{H6370}: and his wives{H802} turned away{H5186}{(H8686)} his heart{H3820}."
1 Kings,11,4,"For it came to pass, when{H6256} Solomon{H8010} was old{H2209}, that his wives{H802} turned away{H5186}{(H8689)} his heart{H3824} after{H310} other{H312} gods{H430}: and his heart{H3824} was not perfect{H8003} with the LORD{H3068} his God{H430}, as was the heart{H3824} of David{H1732} his father{H1}."
1 Kings,11,5,"For Solomon{H8010} went{H3212}{(H8799)} after{H310} Ashtoreth{H6253} the goddess{H430} of the Zidonians{H6722}, and after{H310} Milcom{H4445} the abomination{H8251} of the Ammonites{H5984}."
1 Kings,11,6,"And Solomon{H8010} did{H6213}{(H8799)} evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, and went not fully{H4390}{(H8765)} after{H310} the LORD{H3068}, as did David{H1732} his father{H1}."
1 Kings,11,7,"Then did Solomon{H8010} build{H1129}{(H8799)} an high place{H1116} for Chemosh{H3645}, the abomination{H8251} of Moab{H4124}, in the hill{H2022} that is before{H6440} Jerusalem{H3389}, and for Molech{H4432}, the abomination{H8251} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}."
1 Kings,11,8,"And likewise did{H6213}{(H8804)} he for all his strange{H5237} wives{H802}, which burnt incense{H6999}{(H8688)} and sacrificed{H2076}{(H8764)} unto their gods{H430}."
1 Kings,11,9,"And the LORD{H3068} was angry{H599}{(H8691)} with Solomon{H8010}, because his heart{H3824} was turned{H5186}{(H8804)} from the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, which had appeared{H7200}{(H8738)} unto him twice{H6471},"
1 Kings,11,10,"And had commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} him concerning this thing{H1697}, that he should not go{H3212}{(H8800)} after{H310} other{H312} gods{H430}: but he kept{H8104}{(H8804)} not that which the LORD{H3068} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}."
1 Kings,11,11,"Wherefore the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Solomon{H8010}, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept{H8104}{(H8804)} my covenant{H1285} and my statutes{H2708}, which I have commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} thee, I will surely{H7167}{(H8800)} rend{H7167}{(H8799)} the kingdom{H4467} from thee, and will give{H5414}{(H8804)} it to thy servant{H5650}."
1 Kings,11,12,Notwithstanding in thy days{H3117} I will not do{H6213}{(H8799)} it for David{H1732} thy father's{H1} sake: but I will rend{H7167}{(H8799)} it out of the hand{H3027} of thy son{H1121}.
1 Kings,11,13,"Howbeit{H7535} I will not rend away{H7167}{(H8799)} all the kingdom{H4467}; but will give{H5414}{(H8799)} one{H259} tribe{H7626} to thy son{H1121} for David{H1732} my servant's{H5650} sake, and for Jerusalem's{H3389} sake which I have chosen{H977}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,11,14,"And the LORD{H3068} stirred up{H6965}{(H8686)} an adversary{H7854} unto Solomon{H8010}, Hadad{H1908} the Edomite{H130}: he was of the king's{H4428} seed{H2233} in Edom{H123}."
1 Kings,11,15,"For it came to pass, when David{H1732} was in Edom{H123}, and Joab{H3097} the captain{H8269} of the host{H6635} was gone up{H5927}{(H8800)} to bury{H6912}{(H8763)} the slain{H2491}, after he had smitten{H5221}{(H8686)} every male{H2145} in Edom{H123};"
1 Kings,11,16,"(For six{H8337} months{H2320} did Joab{H3097} remain{H3427}{(H8804)} there with all Israel{H3478}, until he had cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} every male{H2145} in Edom{H123}:)"
1 Kings,11,17,"That Hadad{H111} fled{H1272}{(H8799)}, he and certain{H582} Edomites{H130} of his father's{H1} servants{H5650} with him, to go{H935}{(H8800)} into Egypt{H4714}; Hadad{H1908} being yet a little{H6996} child{H5288}."
1 Kings,11,18,"And they arose{H6965}{(H8799)} out of Midian{H4080}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Paran{H6290}: and they took{H3947}{(H8799)} men{H582} with them out of Paran{H6290}, and they came{H935}{(H8799)} to Egypt{H4714}, unto Pharaoh{H6547} king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714}; which gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him an house{H1004}, and appointed{H559}{(H8804)} him victuals{H3899}, and gave{H5414}{(H8804)} him land{H776}."
1 Kings,11,19,"And Hadad{H1908} found{H4672}{(H8799)} great{H3966} favour{H2580} in the sight{H5869} of Pharaoh{H6547}, so that he gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him to wife{H802} the sister{H269} of his own wife{H802}, the sister{H269} of Tahpenes{H8472} the queen{H1377}."
1 Kings,11,20,"And the sister{H269} of Tahpenes{H8472} bare{H3205}{(H8799)} him Genubath{H1592} his son{H1121}, whom Tahpenes{H8472} weaned{H1580}{(H8799)} in{H8432} Pharaoh's{H6547} house{H1004}: and Genubath{H1592} was in Pharaoh's{H6547} household{H1004} among{H8432} the sons{H1121} of Pharaoh{H6547}."
1 Kings,11,21,"And when Hadad{H1908} heard{H8085}{(H8804)} in Egypt{H4714} that David{H1732} slept{H7901}{(H8804)} with his fathers{H1}, and that Joab{H3097} the captain{H8269} of the host{H6635} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, Hadad{H1908} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Pharaoh{H6547}, Let me depart{H7971}{(H8761)}, that I may go{H3212}{(H8799)} to mine own country{H776}."
1 Kings,11,22,"Then Pharaoh{H6547} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, But what hast thou lacked{H2638} with me, that, behold, thou seekest{H1245}{(H8764)} to go{H3212}{(H8800)} to thine own country{H776}? And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Nothing: howbeit let me go{H7971}{(H8762)} in any wise{H7971}{(H8763)}."
1 Kings,11,23,"And God{H430} stirred him up{H6965}{(H8686)} another adversary{H7854}, Rezon{H7331} the son{H1121} of Eliadah{H450}, which fled{H1272}{(H8804)} from his lord{H113} Hadadezer{H1909} king{H4428} of Zobah{H6678}:"
1 Kings,11,24,"And he gathered{H6908}{(H8799)} men{H582} unto him, and became captain{H8269} over a band{H1416}, when David{H1732} slew{H2026}{(H8800)} them of Zobah: and they went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Damascus{H1834}, and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} therein, and reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in Damascus{H1834}."
1 Kings,11,25,"And he was an adversary{H7854} to Israel{H3478} all the days{H3117} of Solomon{H8010}, beside the mischief{H7451} that Hadad{H1908} did: and he abhorred{H6973}{(H8799)} Israel{H3478}, and reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} over Syria{H758}."
1 Kings,11,26,"And Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Nebat{H5028}, an Ephrathite{H673} of Zereda{H6868}, Solomon's{H8010} servant{H5650}, whose mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Zeruah{H6871}, a widow{H490} woman{H802}, even he lifted up{H7311}{(H8686)} his hand{H3027} against the king{H4428}."
1 Kings,11,27,"And this was the cause{H1697} that he lifted up{H7311}{(H8689)} his hand{H3027} against the king{H4428}: Solomon{H8010} built{H1129}{(H8804)} Millo{H4407}, and repaired{H5462}{(H8804)} the breaches{H6556} of the city{H5892} of David{H1732} his father{H1}."
1 Kings,11,28,"And the man{H376} Jeroboam{H3379} was a mighty man{H1368} of valour{H2428}: and Solomon{H8010} seeing{H7200}{(H8799)} the young man{H5288} that he was industrious{H6213}{(H8802)}{H4399}, he made him ruler{H6485}{(H8686)} over all the charge{H5447} of the house{H1004} of Joseph{H3130}."
1 Kings,11,29,"And it came to pass at that time{H6256} when Jeroboam{H3379} went out{H3318}{(H8804)} of Jerusalem{H3389}, that the prophet{H5030} Ahijah{H281} the Shilonite{H7888} found{H4672}{(H8799)} him in the way{H1870}; and he had clad{H3680}{(H8693)} himself with a new{H2319} garment{H8008}; and they two{H8147} were alone in the field{H7704}:"
1 Kings,11,30,"And Ahijah{H281} caught{H8610}{(H8799)} the new{H2319} garment{H8008} that was on him, and rent{H7167}{(H8799)} it in twelve{H8147}{H6240} pieces{H7168}:"
1 Kings,11,31,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} to Jeroboam{H3379}, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} thee ten{H6235} pieces{H7168}: for thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, Behold, I will rend{H7167}{(H8802)} the kingdom{H4467} out of the hand{H3027} of Solomon{H8010}, and will give{H5414}{(H8804)} ten{H6235} tribes{H7626} to thee:"
1 Kings,11,32,"(But he shall have one{H259} tribe{H7626} for my servant{H5650} David's{H1732} sake, and for Jerusalem's{H3389} sake, the city{H5892} which I have chosen{H977}{(H8804)} out of all the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}:)"
1 Kings,11,33,"Because that they have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} me, and have worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)} Ashtoreth{H6253} the goddess{H430} of the Zidonians{H6722}, Chemosh{H3645} the god{H430} of the Moabites{H4124}, and Milcom{H4445} the god{H430} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, and have not walked{H1980}{(H8804)} in my ways{H1870}, to do{H6213}{(H8800)} that which is right{H3477} in mine eyes{H5869}, and to keep my statutes{H2708} and my judgments{H4941}, as did David{H1732} his father{H1}."
1 Kings,11,34,"Howbeit I will not take{H3947}{(H8799)} the whole kingdom{H4467} out of his hand{H3027}: but I will make{H7896}{(H8799)} him prince{H5387} all the days{H3117} of his life{H2416} for David{H1732} my servant's{H5650} sake, whom I chose{H977}{(H8804)}, because he kept{H8104}{(H8804)} my commandments{H4687} and my statutes{H2708}:"
1 Kings,11,35,"But I will take{H3947}{(H8804)} the kingdom{H4410} out of his son's{H1121} hand{H3027}, and will give{H5414}{(H8804)} it unto thee, even ten{H6235} tribes{H7626}."
1 Kings,11,36,"And unto his son{H1121} will I give{H5414}{(H8799)} one{H259} tribe{H7626}, that David{H1732} my servant{H5650} may have a light{H5216} alway{H3117} before{H6440} me in Jerusalem{H3389}, the city{H5892} which I have chosen{H977}{(H8804)} me to put{H7760}{(H8800)} my name{H8034} there."
1 Kings,11,37,"And I will take{H3947}{(H8799)} thee, and thou shalt reign{H4427}{(H8804)} according to all that thy soul{H5315} desireth{H183}{(H8762)}, and shalt be king{H4428} over Israel{H3478}."
1 Kings,11,38,"And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} unto all that I command{H6680}{(H8762)} thee, and wilt walk{H1980}{(H8804)} in my ways{H1870}, and do{H6213}{(H8804)} that is right{H3477} in my sight{H5869}, to keep{H8104}{(H8800)} my statutes{H2708} and my commandments{H4687}, as David{H1732} my servant{H5650} did{H6213}{(H8804)}; that I will be with thee, and build{H1129}{(H8804)} thee a sure{H539}{(H8737)} house{H1004}, as I built{H1129}{(H8804)} for David{H1732}, and will give{H5414}{(H8804)} Israel{H3478} unto thee."
1 Kings,11,39,"And I will for this afflict{H6031}{(H8762)} the seed{H2233} of David{H1732}, but not for ever{H3117}."
1 Kings,11,40,"Solomon{H8010} sought{H1245}{(H8762)} therefore to kill{H4191}{(H8687)} Jeroboam{H3379}. And Jeroboam{H3379} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and fled{H1272}{(H8799)} into Egypt{H4714}, unto Shishak{H7895} king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714}, and was in Egypt{H4714} until the death{H4194} of Solomon{H8010}."
1 Kings,11,41,"And the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Solomon{H8010}, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, and his wisdom{H2451}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the acts{H1697} of Solomon{H8010}?"
1 Kings,11,42,And the time{H3117} that Solomon{H8010} reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} in Jerusalem{H3389} over all Israel{H3478} was forty{H705} years{H8141}.
1 Kings,11,43,"And Solomon{H8010} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} in the city{H5892} of David{H1732} his father{H1}: and Rehoboam{H7346} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead."
1 Kings,12,1,And Rehoboam{H7346} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Shechem{H7927}: for all Israel{H3478} were come{H935}{(H8804)} to Shechem{H7927} to make him king{H4427}{(H8687)}.
1 Kings,12,2,"And it came to pass, when Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Nebat{H5028}, who was yet in Egypt{H4714}, heard{H8085}{(H8800)} of it,(for he was fled{H1272}{(H8804)} from the presence{H6440} of king{H4428} Solomon{H8010}, and Jeroboam{H3379} dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in Egypt{H4714};)"
1 Kings,12,3,"That they sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and called{H7121}{(H8799)} him. And Jeroboam{H3379} and all the congregation{H6951} of Israel{H3478} came{H935}{(H8799)}, and spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto Rehoboam{H7346}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
1 Kings,12,4,"Thy father{H1} made{H7185} our yoke{H5923} grievous{H7185}{(H8689)}: now therefore make thou the grievous{H7186} service{H5656} of thy father{H1}, and his heavy{H3515} yoke{H5923} which he put{H5414}{(H8804)} upon us, lighter{H7043}{(H8685)}, and we will serve{H5647}{(H8799)} thee."
1 Kings,12,5,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Depart{H3212}{(H8798)} yet for three{H7969} days{H3117}, then come again{H7725}{(H8798)} to me. And the people{H5971} departed{H3212}{(H8799)}."
1 Kings,12,6,"And king{H4428} Rehoboam{H7346} consulted{H3289}{(H8735)} with the old men{H2205}, that stood{H5975}{(H8802)} before{H6440} Solomon{H8010} his father{H1} while he yet lived{H2416}, and said{H559}{(H8800)}, How do ye advise{H3289}{(H8737)} that I may{H7725}{(H8687)} answer{H1697} this people{H5971}?"
1 Kings,12,7,"And they spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, If thou wilt be a servant{H5650} unto this people{H5971} this day{H3117}, and wilt serve{H5647}{(H8804)} them, and answer{H6030}{(H8804)} them, and speak{H1696}{(H8765)} good{H2896} words{H1697} to them, then they will be thy servants{H5650} for ever{H3117}."
1 Kings,12,8,"But he forsook{H5800}{(H8799)} the counsel{H6098} of the old men{H2205}, which they had given{H3289}{(H8804)} him, and consulted{H3289}{(H8735)} with the young men{H3206} that were grown up{H1431}{(H8804)} with him, and which stood{H5975}{(H8802)} before{H6440} him:"
1 Kings,12,9,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, What counsel give{H3289}{(H8737)} ye that we may{H7725}{(H8686)} answer{H1697} this people{H5971}, who have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} to me, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Make{H7043} the yoke{H5923} which thy father{H1} did put{H5414}{(H8804)} upon us lighter{H7043}{(H8685)}?"
1 Kings,12,10,"And the young men{H3206} that were grown up{H1431}{(H8804)} with him spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus shalt thou speak{H559}{(H8799)} unto this people{H5971} that spake{H1696}{(H8765)} unto thee, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thy father{H1} made{H3513} our yoke{H5923} heavy{H3513}{(H8689)}, but make thou it lighter{H7043}{(H8685)} unto us; thus shalt thou say{H1696}{(H8762)} unto them, My little{H6995} finger shall be thicker{H5666}{(H8804)} than my father's{H1} loins{H4975}."
1 Kings,12,11,"And now whereas my father{H1} did lade{H6006}{(H8689)} you with a heavy{H3515} yoke{H5923}, I will add{H3254}{(H8686)} to your yoke{H5923}: my father{H1} hath chastised{H3256}{(H8765)} you with whips{H7752}, but I will chastise{H3256}{(H8762)} you with scorpions{H6137}."
1 Kings,12,12,"So Jeroboam{H3379} and all the people{H5971} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Rehoboam{H7346} the third{H7992} day{H3117}, as the king{H4428} had appointed{H1696}{(H8765)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Come to me again{H7725}{(H8798)} the third{H7992} day{H3117}."
1 Kings,12,13,"And the king{H4428} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the people{H5971} roughly{H7186}, and forsook{H5800}{(H8799)} the old men's{H2205} counsel{H6098} that they gave{H3289}{(H8804)} him;"
1 Kings,12,14,"And spake{H1696}{(H8762)} to them after the counsel{H6098} of the young men{H3206}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, My father{H1} made{H3513} your yoke{H5923} heavy{H3513}{(H8689)}, and I will add{H3254}{(H8686)} to your yoke{H5923}: my father{H1} also chastised{H3256}{(H8765)} you with whips{H7752}, but I will chastise{H3256}{(H8762)} you with scorpions{H6137}."
1 Kings,12,15,"Wherefore the king{H4428} hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not unto the people{H5971}; for the cause{H5438} was from the LORD{H3068}, that he might perform{H6965}{(H8687)} his saying{H1697}, which the LORD{H3068} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} by{H3027} Ahijah{H281} the Shilonite{H7888} unto Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Nebat{H5028}."
1 Kings,12,16,"So{H7725}{(H8686)} when all Israel{H3478} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that the king{H4428} hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not unto them, the people{H5971} answered{H1697} the king{H4428}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, What portion{H2506} have we in David{H1732}? neither have we inheritance{H5159} in the son{H1121} of Jesse{H3448}: to your tents{H168}, O Israel{H3478}: now see{H7200}{(H8798)} to thine own house{H1004}, David{H1732}. So Israel{H3478} departed{H3212}{(H8799)} unto their tents{H168}."
1 Kings,12,17,"But as for the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} which dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} in the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}, Rehoboam{H7346} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} over them."
1 Kings,12,18,"Then king{H4428} Rehoboam{H7346} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Adoram{H151}, who was over the tribute{H4522}; and all Israel{H3478} stoned{H7275}{(H8799)} him with stones{H68}, that he died{H4191}{(H8799)}. Therefore king{H4428} Rehoboam{H7346} made speed{H553}{(H8694)} to get him up{H5927}{(H8800)} to his chariot{H4818}, to flee{H5127}{(H8800)} to Jerusalem{H3389}."
1 Kings,12,19,So Israel{H3478} rebelled{H6586}{(H8799)} against the house{H1004} of David{H1732} unto this day{H3117}.
1 Kings,12,20,"And it came to pass, when all Israel{H3478} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} that Jeroboam{H3379} was come again{H7725}{(H8804)}, that they sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and called{H7121}{(H8799)} him unto the congregation{H5712}, and made him king{H4427}{(H8686)} over all Israel{H3478}: there was none that followed{H310} the house{H1004} of David{H1732}, but{H2108} the tribe{H7626} of Judah{H3063} only."
1 Kings,12,21,"And when Rehoboam{H7346} was come{H935}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}, he assembled{H6950}{(H8686)} all the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}, with the tribe{H7626} of Benjamin{H1144}, an hundred{H3967} and fourscore{H8084} thousand{H505} chosen men{H977}{(H8803)}, which were warriors{H6213}{(H8802)}{H4421}, to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} against the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, to bring{H7725} the kingdom{H4410} again{H7725}{(H8687)} to Rehoboam{H7346} the son{H1121} of Solomon{H8010}."
1 Kings,12,22,"But the word{H1697} of God{H430} came unto Shemaiah{H8098} the man{H376} of God{H430}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
1 Kings,12,23,"Speak{H559}{(H8798)} unto Rehoboam{H7346}, the son{H1121} of Solomon{H8010}, king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and unto all the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063} and Benjamin{H1144}, and to the remnant{H3499} of the people{H5971}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
1 Kings,12,24,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Ye shall not go up{H5927}{(H8799)}, nor fight{H3898}{(H8735)} against your brethren{H251} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}: return{H7725}{(H8798)} every man{H376} to his house{H1004}; for this thing{H1697} is{H1961}{(H8738)} from me. They hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} therefore to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, and returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to depart{H3212}{(H8800)}, according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}."
1 Kings,12,25,"Then Jeroboam{H3379} built{H1129}{(H8799)} Shechem{H7927} in mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}, and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} therein; and went out{H3318}{(H8799)} from thence, and built{H1129}{(H8799)} Penuel{H6439}."
1 Kings,12,26,"And Jeroboam{H3379} said{H559}{(H8799)} in his heart{H3820}, Now shall the kingdom{H4467} return{H7725}{(H8799)} to the house{H1004} of David{H1732}:"
1 Kings,12,27,"If this people{H5971} go up{H5927}{(H8799)} to do{H6213}{(H8800)} sacrifice{H2077} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} at Jerusalem{H3389}, then shall the heart{H3820} of this people{H5971} turn again{H7725}{(H8804)} unto their lord{H113}, even unto Rehoboam{H7346} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and they shall kill{H2026}{(H8804)} me, and go again{H7725}{(H8804)} to Rehoboam{H7346} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}."
1 Kings,12,28,"Whereupon the king{H4428} took counsel{H3289}{(H8735)}, and made{H6213}{(H8799)} two{H8147} calves{H5695} of gold{H2091}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, It is too much{H7227} for you to go up{H5927}{(H8800)} to Jerusalem{H3389}: behold thy gods{H430}, O Israel{H3478}, which brought thee up{H5927}{(H8689)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
1 Kings,12,29,"And he set{H7760}{(H8799)} the one{H259} in Bethel{H1008}, and the other{H259} put{H5414}{(H8804)} he in Dan{H1835}."
1 Kings,12,30,"And this thing{H1697} became a sin{H2403}: for the people{H5971} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to worship before{H6440} the one{H259}, even unto Dan{H1835}."
1 Kings,12,31,"And he made{H6213}{(H8799)} an house{H1004} of high places{H1116}, and made{H6213}{(H8799)} priests{H3548} of the lowest{H7098} of the people{H5971}, which were not of the sons{H1121} of Levi{H3878}."
1 Kings,12,32,"And Jeroboam{H3379} ordained{H6213}{(H8799)} a feast{H2282} in the eighth{H8066} month{H2320}, on the fifteenth{H2568}{H6240} day{H3117} of the month{H2320}, like unto the feast{H2282} that is in Judah{H3063}, and he offered{H5927}{(H8686)} upon the altar{H4196}. So did{H6213}{(H8804)} he in Bethel{H1008}, sacrificing{H2076}{(H8763)} unto the calves{H5695} that he had made{H6213}{(H8804)}: and he placed{H5975}{(H8689)} in Bethel{H1008} the priests{H3548} of the high places{H1116} which he had made{H6213}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,12,33,"So he offered{H5927}{(H8686)} upon the altar{H4196} which he had made{H6213}{(H8804)} in Bethel{H1008} the fifteenth{H2568}{H6240} day{H3117} of the eighth{H8066} month{H2320}, even in the month{H2320} which he had devised{H908}{(H8804)} of his own heart{H3820}; and ordained{H6213}{(H8799)} a feast{H2282} unto the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}: and he offered{H5927}{(H8686)} upon the altar{H4196}, and burnt incense{H6999}{(H8687)}."
1 Kings,13,1,"And, behold, there came{H935}{(H8804)} a man{H376} of God{H430} out of Judah{H3063} by the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} unto Bethel{H1008}: and Jeroboam{H3379} stood{H5975}{(H8802)} by the altar{H4196} to burn incense{H6999}{(H8687)}."
1 Kings,13,2,"And he cried{H7121}{(H8799)} against the altar{H4196} in the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, O altar{H4196}, altar{H4196}, thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Behold, a child{H1121} shall be born{H3205}{(H8737)} unto the house{H1004} of David{H1732}, Josiah{H2977} by name{H8034}; and upon thee shall he offer{H2076}{(H8804)} the priests{H3548} of the high places{H1116} that burn incense{H6999}{(H8688)} upon thee, and men's{H120} bones{H6106} shall be burnt{H8313}{(H8799)} upon thee."
1 Kings,13,3,"And he gave{H5414}{(H8804)} a sign{H4159} the same day{H3117}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, This is the sign{H4159} which the LORD{H3068} hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}; Behold, the altar{H4196} shall be rent{H7167}{(H8738)}, and the ashes{H1880} that are upon it shall be poured out{H8210}{(H8738)}."
1 Kings,13,4,"And it came to pass, when king{H4428} Jeroboam{H3379} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} the saying{H1697} of the man{H376} of God{H430}, which had cried{H7121}{(H8804)} against the altar{H4196} in Bethel{H1008}, that he put forth{H7971}{(H8799)} his hand{H3027} from the altar{H4196}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Lay hold{H8610}{(H8798)} on him. And his hand{H3027}, which he put forth{H7971}{(H8804)} against him, dried up{H3001}{(H8799)}, so that he could{H3201}{(H8804)} not pull it in again{H7725}{(H8687)} to him."
1 Kings,13,5,"The altar{H4196} also was rent{H7167}{(H8738)}, and the ashes{H1880} poured out{H8210}{(H8735)} from the altar{H4196}, according to the sign{H4159} which the man{H376} of God{H430} had given{H5414}{(H8804)} by the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}."
1 Kings,13,6,"And the king{H4428} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the man{H376} of God{H430}, Intreat{H2470}{(H8761)} now the face{H6440} of the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}, and pray{H6419}{(H8690)} for me, that my hand{H3027} may be restored me again{H7725}{(H8799)}. And the man{H376} of God{H430} besought{H2470}{(H8762)}{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, and the king's{H4428} hand{H3027} was restored him again{H7725}{(H8799)}, and became as it was before{H7223}."
1 Kings,13,7,"And the king{H4428} said{H1696}{(H8762)} unto the man{H376} of God{H430}, Come{H935}{(H8798)} home{H1004} with me, and refresh{H5582}{(H8798)} thyself, and I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee a reward{H4991}."
1 Kings,13,8,"And the man{H376} of God{H430} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, If thou wilt give{H5414}{(H8799)} me half{H2677} thine house{H1004}, I will not go in{H935}{(H8799)} with thee, neither will I eat{H398}{(H8799)} bread{H3899} nor drink{H8354}{(H8799)} water{H4325} in this place{H4725}:"
1 Kings,13,9,"For so was it charged{H6680}{(H8765)} me by the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Eat{H398}{(H8799)} no bread{H3899}, nor drink{H8354}{(H8799)} water{H4325}, nor turn again{H7725}{(H8799)} by the same way{H1870} that thou camest{H1980}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,13,10,"So he went{H3212}{(H8799)} another{H312} way{H1870}, and returned{H7725}{(H8804)} not by the way{H1870} that he came{H935}{(H8804)} to Bethel{H1008}."
1 Kings,13,11,"Now there dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} an{H259} old{H2205} prophet{H5030} in Bethel{H1008}; and his sons{H1121} came{H935}{(H8799)} and told{H5608}{(H8762)} him all the works{H4639} that the man{H376} of God{H430} had done{H6213}{(H8804)} that day{H3117} in Bethel{H1008}: the words{H1697} which he had spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} unto the king{H4428}, them they told{H5608}{(H8762)} also to their father{H1}."
1 Kings,13,12,"And their father{H1} said{H1696}{(H8762)} unto them, What way{H1870} went{H1980}{(H8804)} he? For his sons{H1121} had seen{H7200}{(H8799)} what{H335} way{H1870} the man{H376} of God{H430} went{H1980}{(H8804)}, which came{H935}{(H8804)} from Judah{H3063}."
1 Kings,13,13,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his sons{H1121}, Saddle{H2280}{(H8798)} me the ass{H2543}. So they saddled{H2280}{(H8799)} him the ass{H2543}: and he rode{H7392}{(H8799)} thereon,"
1 Kings,13,14,"And went{H3212}{(H8799)} after{H310} the man{H376} of God{H430}, and found{H4672}{(H8799)} him sitting{H3427}{(H8802)} under an oak{H424}: and he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Art thou the man{H376} of God{H430} that camest{H935}{(H8804)} from Judah{H3063}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I am."
1 Kings,13,15,"Then he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Come{H3212}{(H8798)} home{H1004} with me, and eat{H398}{(H8798)} bread{H3899}."
1 Kings,13,16,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I may{H3201}{(H8799)} not return{H7725}{(H8800)} with thee, nor go in{H935}{(H8800)} with thee: neither will I eat{H398}{(H8799)} bread{H3899} nor drink{H8354}{(H8799)} water{H4325} with thee in this place{H4725}:"
1 Kings,13,17,"For it was said{H1697} to me by the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, Thou shalt eat{H398}{(H8799)} no bread{H3899} nor drink{H8354}{(H8799)} water{H4325} there, nor turn again{H7725}{(H8799)} to go{H3212}{(H8800)} by the way{H1870} that thou camest{H1980}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,13,18,"He said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, I am a prophet{H5030} also as thou art; and an angel{H4397} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} unto me by the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Bring him back{H7725}{(H8685)} with thee into thine house{H1004}, that he may eat{H398}{(H8799)} bread{H3899} and drink{H8354}{(H8799)} water{H4325}. But he lied{H3584}{(H8765)} unto him."
1 Kings,13,19,"So he went back{H7725}{(H8799)} with him, and did eat{H398}{(H8799)} bread{H3899} in his house{H1004}, and drank{H8354}{(H8799)} water{H4325}."
1 Kings,13,20,"And it came to pass, as they sat{H3427}{(H8802)} at the table{H7979}, that the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto the prophet{H5030} that brought him back{H7725}{(H8689)}:"
1 Kings,13,21,"And he cried{H7121}{(H8799)} unto the man{H376} of God{H430} that came{H935}{(H8804)} from Judah{H3063}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Forasmuch as{H3282} thou hast disobeyed{H4784}{(H8804)} the mouth{H6310} of the LORD{H3068}, and hast not kept{H8104}{(H8804)} the commandment{H4687} which the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} thee,"
1 Kings,13,22,"But camest back{H7725}{(H8799)}, and hast eaten{H398}{(H8799)} bread{H3899} and drunk{H8354}{(H8799)} water{H4325} in the place{H4725}, of the which the LORD did say{H1696}{(H8765)} to thee, Eat{H398}{(H8799)} no bread{H3899}, and drink{H8354}{(H8799)} no water{H4325}; thy carcase{H5038} shall not come{H935}{(H8799)} unto the sepulchre{H6913} of thy fathers{H1}."
1 Kings,13,23,"And it came to pass, after{H310} he had eaten{H398}{(H8800)} bread{H3899}, and after{H310} he had drunk{H8354}{(H8800)}, that he saddled{H2280}{(H8799)} for him the ass{H2543}, to wit, for the prophet{H5030} whom he had brought back{H7725}{(H8689)}."
1 Kings,13,24,"And when he was gone{H3212}{(H8799)}, a lion{H738} met{H4672}{(H8799)} him by the way{H1870}, and slew{H4191}{(H8686)} him: and his carcase{H5038} was cast{H7993}{(H8716)} in the way{H1870}, and the ass{H2543} stood{H5975}{(H8802)} by{H681} it, the lion{H738} also stood{H5975}{(H8802)} by the carcase{H5038}."
1 Kings,13,25,"And, behold, men{H582} passed by{H5674}{(H8802)}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the carcase{H5038} cast{H7993}{(H8716)} in the way{H1870}, and the lion{H738} standing{H5975}{(H8802)} by{H681} the carcase{H5038}: and they came{H935}{(H8799)} and told{H1696}{(H8762)} it in the city{H5892} where the old{H2205} prophet{H5030} dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)}."
1 Kings,13,26,"And when the prophet{H5030} that brought him back{H7725}{(H8689)} from the way{H1870} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} thereof, he said{H559}{(H8799)}, It is the man{H376} of God{H430}, who was disobedient{H4784}{(H8804)} unto the word{H6310} of the LORD{H3068}: therefore the LORD{H3068} hath delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} him unto the lion{H738}, which hath torn{H7665}{(H8799)} him, and slain{H4191}{(H8686)} him, according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} unto him."
1 Kings,13,27,"And he spake{H1696}{(H8762)} to his sons{H1121}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Saddle{H2280}{(H8798)} me the ass{H2543}. And they saddled{H2280}{(H8799)} him."
1 Kings,13,28,"And he went{H3212}{(H8799)} and found{H4672}{(H8799)} his carcase{H5038} cast{H7993}{(H8716)} in the way{H1870}, and the ass{H2543} and the lion{H738} standing{H5975}{(H8802)} by{H681} the carcase{H5038}: the lion{H738} had not eaten{H398}{(H8804)} the carcase{H5038}, nor torn{H7665}{(H8804)} the ass{H2543}."
1 Kings,13,29,"And the prophet{H5030} took up{H5375}{(H8799)} the carcase{H5038} of the man{H376} of God{H430}, and laid{H3240}{(H8686)} it upon the ass{H2543}, and brought it back{H7725}{(H8686)}: and the old{H2205} prophet{H5030} came{H935}{(H8799)} to the city{H5892}, to mourn{H5594}{(H8800)} and to bury{H6912}{(H8800)} him."
1 Kings,13,30,"And he laid{H3240}{(H8686)} his carcase{H5038} in his own grave{H6913}; and they mourned{H5594}{(H8799)} over him, saying, Alas{H1945}, my brother{H251}!"
1 Kings,13,31,"And it came to pass, after{H310} he had buried{H6912}{(H8800)} him, that he spake{H559}{(H8799)} to his sons{H1121}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, When I am dead{H4191}{(H8800)}, then bury{H6912}{(H8804)} me in the sepulchre{H6913} wherein the man{H376} of God{H430} is buried{H6912}{(H8803)}; lay{H3240}{(H8685)} my bones{H6106} beside{H681} his bones{H6106}:"
1 Kings,13,32,"For the saying{H1697} which he cried{H7121}{(H8804)} by the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} against the altar{H4196} in Bethel{H1008}, and against all the houses{H1004} of the high places{H1116} which are in the cities{H5892} of Samaria{H8111}, shall surely come to pass."
1 Kings,13,33,"After{H310} this thing{H1697} Jeroboam{H3379} returned{H7725}{(H8804)} not from his evil{H7451} way{H1870}, but made{H6213}{(H8799)} again{H7725}{(H8799)} of the lowest{H7098} of the people{H5971} priests{H3548} of the high places{H1116}: whosoever would{H2655}, he consecrated{H4390}{(H8762)}{H3027} him, and he became one of the priests{H3548} of the high places{H1116}."
1 Kings,13,34,"And this thing{H1697} became sin{H2403} unto the house{H1004} of Jeroboam{H3379}, even to cut it off{H3582}{(H8687)}, and to destroy{H8045}{(H8687)} it from off the face{H6440} of the earth{H127}."
1 Kings,14,1,At that time{H6256} Abijah{H29} the son{H1121} of Jeroboam{H3379} fell sick{H2470}{(H8804)}.
1 Kings,14,2,"And Jeroboam{H3379} said{H559}{(H8799)} to his wife{H802}, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, I pray thee, and disguise{H8138}{(H8690)} thyself, that thou be not known{H3045}{(H8799)} to be the wife{H802} of Jeroboam{H3379}; and get{H1980}{(H8804)} thee to Shiloh{H7887}: behold, there is Ahijah{H281} the prophet{H5030}, which told{H1696}{(H8765)} me that I should be king{H4428} over this people{H5971}."
1 Kings,14,3,"And take{H3947}{(H8804)} with thee{H3027} ten{H6235} loaves{H3899}, and cracknels{H5350}, and a cruse{H1228} of honey{H1706}, and go{H935}{(H8804)} to him: he shall tell{H5046}{(H8686)} thee what shall become of the child{H5288}."
1 Kings,14,4,"And Jeroboam's{H3379} wife{H802} did so{H6213}{(H8799)}, and arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Shiloh{H7887}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to the house{H1004} of Ahijah{H281}. But Ahijah{H281} could{H3201}{(H8804)} not see{H7200}{(H8800)}; for his eyes{H5869} were set{H6965}{(H8804)} by reason of his age{H7869}."
1 Kings,14,5,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8804)} unto Ahijah{H281}, Behold, the wife{H802} of Jeroboam{H3379} cometh{H935}{(H8802)} to ask{H1875}{(H8800)} a thing{H1697} of thee for her son{H1121}; for he is sick{H2470}{(H8802)}: thus{H2090} and thus shalt thou say{H1696}{(H8762)} unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in{H935}{(H8800)}, that she shall feign herself to be another{H5234}{(H8693)} woman."
1 Kings,14,6,"And it was so, when Ahijah{H281} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} the sound{H6963} of her feet{H7272}, as she came in{H935}{(H8802)} at the door{H6607}, that he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Come in{H935}{(H8798)}, thou wife{H802} of Jeroboam{H3379}; why feignest thou thyself to be another{H5234}{(H8693)}? for I am sent{H7971}{(H8803)} to thee with heavy{H7186} tidings."
1 Kings,14,7,"Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, tell{H559}{(H8798)} Jeroboam{H3379}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, Forasmuch as{H3282} I exalted{H7311}{(H8689)} thee from among{H8432} the people{H5971}, and made{H5414}{(H8799)} thee prince{H5057} over my people{H5971} Israel{H3478},"
1 Kings,14,8,"And rent{H7167} the kingdom{H4467} away{H7167}{(H8799)} from the house{H1004} of David{H1732}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant{H5650} David{H1732}, who kept{H8104}{(H8804)} my commandments{H4687}, and who followed{H1980}{(H8804)}{H310} me with all his heart{H3824}, to do{H6213}{(H8800)} that only which was right{H3477} in mine eyes{H5869};"
1 Kings,14,9,"But hast done{H6213}{(H8800)} evil{H7489}{(H8686)} above all that were before{H6440} thee: for thou hast gone{H3212}{(H8799)} and made{H6213}{(H8799)} thee other{H312} gods{H430}, and molten images{H4541}, to provoke me to anger{H3707}{(H8687)}, and hast cast{H7993}{(H8689)} me behind{H310} thy back{H1458}:"
1 Kings,14,10,"Therefore, behold, I will bring{H935}{(H8688)} evil{H7451} upon the house{H1004} of Jeroboam{H3379}, and will cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} from Jeroboam{H3379} him that pisseth{H8366}{(H8688)} against the wall{H7023}, and him that is shut up{H6113}{(H8803)} and left{H5800}{(H8803)} in Israel{H3478}, and will take away{H1197}{(H8765)} the remnant{H310} of the house{H1004} of Jeroboam{H3379}, as a man taketh away{H1197}{(H8762)} dung{H1557}, till it be all gone{H8552}{(H8800)}."
1 Kings,14,11,Him that dieth{H4191}{(H8801)} of Jeroboam{H3379} in the city{H5892} shall the dogs{H3611} eat{H398}{(H8799)}; and him that dieth{H4191}{(H8801)} in the field{H7704} shall the fowls{H5775} of the air{H8064} eat{H398}{(H8799)}: for the LORD{H3068} hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} it.
1 Kings,14,12,"Arise{H6965}{(H8798)} thou therefore, get{H3212}{(H8798)} thee to thine own house{H1004}: and when thy feet{H7272} enter{H935}{(H8800)} into the city{H5892}, the child{H3206} shall die{H4191}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,14,13,"And all Israel{H3478} shall mourn{H5594}{(H8804)} for him, and bury{H6912}{(H8804)} him: for he only of Jeroboam{H3379} shall come{H935}{(H8799)} to the grave{H6913}, because in him there is found{H4672}{(H8738)} some good{H2896} thing{H1697} toward the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} in the house{H1004} of Jeroboam{H3379}."
1 Kings,14,14,"Moreover the LORD{H3068} shall raise him up{H6965}{(H8689)} a king{H4428} over Israel{H3478}, who shall cut off{H3772}{(H8686)} the house{H1004} of Jeroboam{H3379} that day{H3117}: but what? even now."
1 Kings,14,15,"For the LORD{H3068} shall smite{H5221}{(H8689)} Israel{H3478}, as a reed{H7070} is shaken{H5110}{(H8799)} in the water{H4325}, and he shall root up{H5428}{(H8804)} Israel{H3478} out of this good{H2896} land{H127}, which he gave{H5414}{(H8804)} to their fathers{H1}, and shall scatter{H2219}{(H8765)} them beyond{H5676} the river{H5104}, because they have made{H6213}{(H8804)} their groves{H842}, provoking the LORD{H3068} to anger{H3707}{(H8688)}."
1 Kings,14,16,"And he shall give{H5414} Israel{H3478} up{H5414}{(H8799)} because{H1558} of the sins{H2403} of Jeroboam{H3379}, who did sin{H2398}{(H8804)}, and who made Israel{H3478} to sin{H2398}{(H8689)}."
1 Kings,14,17,"And Jeroboam's{H3379} wife{H802} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and departed{H3212}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Tirzah{H8656}: and when she came{H935}{(H8802)} to the threshold{H5592} of the door{H1004}, the child{H5288} died{H4191}{(H8804)};"
1 Kings,14,18,"And they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him; and all Israel{H3478} mourned{H5594}{(H8799)} for him, according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} by the hand{H3027} of his servant{H5650} Ahijah{H281} the prophet{H5030}."
1 Kings,14,19,"And the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Jeroboam{H3379}, how he warred{H3898}{(H8738)}, and how he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)}, behold, they are written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478}."
1 Kings,14,20,"And the days{H3117} which Jeroboam{H3379} reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} were two{H8147} and twenty{H6242} years{H8141}: and he slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}, and Nadab{H5070} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead."
1 Kings,14,21,"And Rehoboam{H7346} the son{H1121} of Solomon{H8010} reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} in Judah{H3063}. Rehoboam{H7346} was forty{H705} and one{H259} years{H8141} old{H1121} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} seventeen{H7651}{H6240} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}, the city{H5892} which the LORD{H3068} did choose{H977}{(H8804)} out of all the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}, to put{H7760}{(H8800)} his name{H8034} there. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Naamah{H5279} an Ammonitess{H5985}."
1 Kings,14,22,"And Judah{H3063} did{H6213}{(H8799)} evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, and they provoked him to jealousy{H7065}{(H8762)} with their sins{H2403} which they had committed{H2398}{(H8804)}, above all that their fathers{H1} had done{H6213}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,14,23,"For they also built{H1129}{(H8799)} them high places{H1116}, and images{H4676}, and groves{H842}, on every high{H1364} hill{H1389}, and under every green{H7488} tree{H6086}."
1 Kings,14,24,And there were also sodomites{H6945} in the land{H776}: and they did{H6213}{(H8804)} according to all the abominations{H8441} of the nations{H1471} which the LORD{H3068} cast out{H3423}{(H8689)} before{H6440} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}.
1 Kings,14,25,"And it came to pass in the fifth{H2549} year{H8141} of king{H4428} Rehoboam{H7346}, that Shishak{H7895} king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714} came up{H5927}{(H8804)} against Jerusalem{H3389}:"
1 Kings,14,26,"And he took away{H3947}{(H8799)} the treasures{H214} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and the treasures{H214} of the king's{H4428} house{H1004}; he even took away{H3947}{(H8804)} all: and he took away{H3947}{(H8799)} all the shields{H4043} of gold{H2091} which Solomon{H8010} had made{H6213}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,14,27,"And king{H4428} Rehoboam{H7346} made{H6213}{(H8799)} in their stead brasen{H5178} shields{H4043}, and committed{H6485}{(H8689)} them unto the hands{H3027} of the chief{H8269} of the guard{H7323}{(H8801)}, which kept{H8104}{(H8802)} the door{H6607} of the king's{H4428} house{H1004}."
1 Kings,14,28,"And it was so, when{H1767} the king{H4428} went{H935}{(H8800)} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, that the guard{H7323}{(H8801)} bare{H5375}{(H8799)} them, and brought them back{H7725}{(H8689)} into the guard{H7323}{(H8801)} chamber{H8372}."
1 Kings,14,29,"Now the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Rehoboam{H7346}, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}?"
1 Kings,14,30,And there was war{H4421} between Rehoboam{H7346} and Jeroboam{H3379} all their days{H3117}.
1 Kings,14,31,"And Rehoboam{H7346} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} with his fathers{H1} in the city{H5892} of David{H1732}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Naamah{H5279} an Ammonitess{H5985}. And Abijam{H38} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead."
1 Kings,15,1,Now in the eighteenth{H8083}{H6240} year{H8141} of king{H4428} Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Nebat{H5028} reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} Abijam{H38} over Judah{H3063}.
1 Kings,15,2,"Three{H7969} years{H8141} reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} he in Jerusalem{H3389}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Maachah{H4601}, the daughter{H1323} of Abishalom{H53}."
1 Kings,15,3,"And he walked{H3212}{(H8799)} in all the sins{H2403} of his father{H1}, which he had done{H6213}{(H8804)} before{H6440} him: and his heart{H3824} was not perfect{H8003} with the LORD{H3068} his God{H430}, as the heart{H3824} of David{H1732} his father{H1}."
1 Kings,15,4,"Nevertheless for David's{H1732} sake did the LORD{H3068} his God{H430} give{H5414}{(H8804)} him a lamp{H5216} in Jerusalem{H3389}, to set up{H6965}{(H8687)} his son{H1121} after{H310} him, and to establish{H5975}{(H8687)} Jerusalem{H3389}:"
1 Kings,15,5,"Because David{H1732} did{H6213}{(H8804)} that which was right{H3477} in the eyes{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, and turned not aside{H5493}{(H8804)} from any thing that he commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} him all the days{H3117} of his life{H2416}, save only in the matter{H1697} of Uriah{H223} the Hittite{H2850}."
1 Kings,15,6,And there was war{H4421} between Rehoboam{H7346} and Jeroboam{H3379} all the days{H3117} of his life{H2416}.
1 Kings,15,7,"Now the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Abijam{H38}, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}? And there was war{H4421} between Abijam{H38} and Jeroboam{H3379}."
1 Kings,15,8,And Abijam{H38} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}; and they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him in the city{H5892} of David{H1732}: and Asa{H609} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead.
1 Kings,15,9,And in the twentieth{H6242} year{H8141} of Jeroboam{H3379} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} Asa{H609} over Judah{H3063}.
1 Kings,15,10,"And forty{H705} and one{H259} years{H8141} reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} he in Jerusalem{H3389}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Maachah{H4601}, the daughter{H1323} of Abishalom{H53}."
1 Kings,15,11,"And Asa{H609} did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was right{H3477} in the eyes{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, as did David{H1732} his father{H1}."
1 Kings,15,12,"And he took away{H5674}{(H8686)} the sodomites{H6945} out of the land{H776}, and removed{H5493}{(H8686)} all the idols{H1544} that his fathers{H1} had made{H6213}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,15,13,"And also Maachah{H4601} his mother{H517}, even her he removed{H5493}{(H8686)} from being queen{H1377}, because she had made{H6213}{(H8804)} an idol{H4656} in a grove{H842}; and Asa{H609} destroyed{H3772}{(H8799)} her idol{H4656}, and burnt{H8313}{(H8799)} it by the brook{H5158} Kidron{H6939}."
1 Kings,15,14,But the high places{H1116} were not removed{H5493}{(H8804)}: nevertheless Asa's{H609} heart{H3824} was perfect{H8003} with the LORD{H3068} all his days{H3117}.
1 Kings,15,15,"And he brought{H935}{(H8686)} in the things{H6944} which his father{H1} had dedicated{H6944}, and the things which himself had dedicated{H6944}, into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, silver{H3701}, and gold{H2091}, and vessels{H3627}."
1 Kings,15,16,And there was war{H4421} between Asa{H609} and Baasha{H1201} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} all their days{H3117}.
1 Kings,15,17,"And Baasha{H1201} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} against Judah{H3063}, and built{H1129}{(H8799)} Ramah{H7414}, that he might not suffer{H5414}{(H8800)} any to go out{H3318}{(H8802)} or come in{H935}{(H8802)} to Asa{H609} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}."
1 Kings,15,18,"Then Asa{H609} took{H3947}{(H8799)} all the silver{H3701} and the gold{H2091} that were left{H3498}{(H8737)} in the treasures{H214} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and the treasures{H214} of the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, and delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} them into the hand{H3027} of his servants{H5650}: and king{H4428} Asa{H609} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} them to Benhadad{H1130}, the son{H1121} of Tabrimon{H2886}, the son{H1121} of Hezion{H2383}, king{H4428} of Syria{H758}, that dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} at Damascus{H1834}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
1 Kings,15,19,"There is a league{H1285} between me and thee, and between my father{H1} and thy father{H1}: behold, I have sent{H7971}{(H8804)} unto thee a present{H7810} of silver{H3701} and gold{H2091}; come{H3212}{(H8798)} and break{H6565}{(H8685)} thy league{H1285} with Baasha{H1201} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, that he may depart{H5927}{(H8799)} from me."
1 Kings,15,20,"So Benhadad{H1130} hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} unto king{H4428} Asa{H609}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} the captains{H8269} of the hosts{H2428} which he had against the cities{H5892} of Israel{H3478}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} Ijon{H5859}, and Dan{H1835}, and Abelbethmaachah{H62}, and all Cinneroth{H3672}, with all the land{H776} of Naphtali{H5321}."
1 Kings,15,21,"And it came to pass, when Baasha{H1201} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} thereof, that he left off{H2308}{(H8799)} building{H1129}{(H8800)} of Ramah{H7414}, and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in Tirzah{H8656}."
1 Kings,15,22,"Then king{H4428} Asa{H609} made a proclamation{H8085}{(H8689)} throughout all Judah{H3063}; none was exempted{H5355}: and they took{H5375}{(H8799)} away the stones{H68} of Ramah{H7414}, and the timber{H6086} thereof, wherewith Baasha{H1201} had builded{H1129}{(H8804)}; and king{H4428} Asa{H609} built{H1129}{(H8799)} with them Geba{H1387} of Benjamin{H1144}, and Mizpah{H4709}."
1 Kings,15,23,"The rest{H3499} of all the acts{H1697} of Asa{H609}, and all his might{H1369}, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, and the cities{H5892} which he built{H1129}{(H8804)}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}? Nevertheless in the time{H6256} of his old age{H2209} he was diseased{H2470}{(H8804)} in his feet{H7272}."
1 Kings,15,24,"And Asa{H609} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} with his fathers{H1} in the city{H5892} of David{H1732} his father{H1}: and Jehoshaphat{H3092} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead."

1 Kings,16,31,"And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing{H7043}{(H8738)} for him to walk{H3212}{(H8800)} in the sins{H2403} of Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Nebat{H5028}, that he took{H3947}{(H8799)} to wife{H802} Jezebel{H348} the daughter{H1323} of Ethbaal{H856} king{H4428} of the Zidonians{H6722}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} and served{H5647}{(H8799)} Baal{H1168}, and worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)} him."
1 Kings,16,32,"And he reared up{H6965}{(H8686)} an altar{H4196} for Baal{H1168} in the house{H1004} of Baal{H1168}, which he had built{H1129}{(H8804)} in Samaria{H8111}."
1 Kings,16,33,And Ahab{H256} made{H6213}{(H8799)} a grove{H842}; and Ahab{H256} did{H6213}{(H8800)} more{H3254}{(H8686)} to provoke the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} to anger{H3707}{(H8687)} than all the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478} that were before{H6440} him.
1 Kings,16,34,"In his days{H3117} did Hiel{H2419} the Bethelite{H1017} build{H1129}{(H8804)} Jericho{H3405}: he laid the foundation{H3245}{(H8765)} thereof in Abiram{H48} his firstborn{H1060}, and set up{H5324}{(H8689)} the gates{H1817} thereof in his youngest{H6810} son Segub{H7687}, according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} by{H3027} Joshua{H3091} the son{H1121} of Nun{H5126}."
1 Kings,17,1,"And Elijah{H452} the Tishbite{H8664}, who was of the inhabitants{H8453} of Gilead{H1568}, said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Ahab{H256}, As the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} liveth{H2416}, before{H6440} whom I stand{H5975}{(H8804)}, there shall not be dew{H2919} nor rain{H4306} these years{H8141}, but according{H6310} to my word{H1697}."
1 Kings,17,2,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto him, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
1 Kings,17,3,"Get{H3212}{(H8798)} thee hence, and turn{H6437}{(H8804)} thee eastward{H6924}, and hide{H5641}{(H8738)} thyself by the brook{H5158} Cherith{H3747}, that is before{H6440} Jordan{H3383}."
1 Kings,17,4,"And it shall be, that thou shalt drink{H8354}{(H8799)} of the brook{H5158}; and I have commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} the ravens{H6158} to feed{H3557}{(H8771)} thee there."
1 Kings,17,5,"So he went{H3212}{(H8799)} and did{H6213}{(H8799)} according unto the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}: for he went{H3212}{(H8799)} and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} by the brook{H5158} Cherith{H3747}, that is before{H6440} Jordan{H3383}."
1 Kings,17,6,"And the ravens{H6158} brought{H935}{(H8688)} him bread{H3899} and flesh{H1320} in the morning{H1242}, and bread{H3899} and flesh{H1320} in the evening{H6153}; and he drank{H8354}{(H8799)} of the brook{H5158}."
1 Kings,17,7,"And it came to pass after{H7093} a while{H3117}, that the brook{H5158} dried up{H3001}{(H8799)}, because there had been no rain{H1653} in the land{H776}."
1 Kings,17,8,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto him, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
1 Kings,17,9,"Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, get{H3212}{(H8798)} thee to Zarephath{H6886}, which belongeth to Zidon{H6721}, and dwell{H3427}{(H8804)} there: behold, I have commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} a widow{H490} woman{H802} there to sustain{H3557}{(H8771)} thee."
1 Kings,17,10,"So he arose{H6965}{(H8799)} and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Zarephath{H6886}. And when he came{H935}{(H8799)} to the gate{H6607} of the city{H5892}, behold, the widow{H490} woman{H802} was there gathering{H7197}{(H8781)} of sticks{H6086}: and he called{H7121}{(H8799)} to her, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Fetch{H3947}{(H8798)} me, I pray thee, a little{H4592} water{H4325} in a vessel{H3627}, that I may drink{H8354}{(H8799)}."
1 Kings,17,11,"And as she was going{H3212}{(H8799)} to fetch{H3947}{(H8800)} it, he called{H7121}{(H8799)} to her, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Bring{H3947}{(H8798)} me, I pray thee, a morsel{H6595} of bread{H3899} in thine hand{H3027}."
1 Kings,17,12,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, As the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} liveth{H2416}, I have{H3426} not a cake{H4580}, but an handful{H4393}{H3709} of meal{H7058} in a barrel{H3537}, and a little{H4592} oil{H8081} in a cruse{H6835}: and, behold, I am gathering{H7197}{(H8781)} two{H8147} sticks{H6086}, that I may go in{H935}{(H8804)} and dress{H6213}{(H8804)} it for me and my son{H1121}, that we may eat{H398}{(H8804)} it, and die{H4191}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,17,13,"And Elijah{H452} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not; go{H935}{(H8798)} and do{H6213}{(H8798)} as thou hast said{H1697}: but make{H6213}{(H8798)} me thereof{H8033} a little{H6996} cake{H5692} first{H7223}, and bring{H3318}{(H8689)} it unto me, and after{H314} make{H6213}{(H8799)} for thee and for thy son{H1121}."
1 Kings,17,14,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, The barrel{H3537} of meal{H7058} shall not waste{H3615}{(H8799)}, neither shall the cruse{H6835} of oil{H8081} fail{H2637}{(H8799)}, until the day{H3117} that the LORD{H3068} sendeth{H5414}{(H8800)} rain{H1653} upon{H6440} the earth{H127}."
1 Kings,17,15,"And she went{H3212}{(H8799)} and did{H6213}{(H8799)} according to the saying{H1697} of Elijah{H452}: and she, and he, and her house{H1004}, did eat{H398}{(H8799)} many days{H3117}."
1 Kings,17,16,"And the barrel{H3537} of meal{H7058} wasted{H3615}{(H8804)} not, neither did the cruse{H6835} of oil{H8081} fail{H2638}, according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} by{H3027} Elijah{H452}."
1 Kings,17,17,"And it came to pass after{H310} these things{H1697}, that the son{H1121} of the woman{H802}, the mistress{H1172} of the house{H1004}, fell sick{H2470}{(H8804)}; and his sickness{H2483} was so{H3966} sore{H2389}, that there was no breath{H5397} left{H3498}{(H8738)} in him."
1 Kings,17,18,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Elijah{H452}, What have I to do with thee, O thou man{H376} of God{H430}? art thou come{H935}{(H8804)} unto me to call{H2142} my sin{H5771} to remembrance{H2142}{(H8687)}, and to slay{H4191}{(H8687)} my son{H1121}?"
1 Kings,17,19,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} me thy son{H1121}. And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} him out of her bosom{H2436}, and carried him up{H5927}{(H8686)} into a loft{H5944}, where he abode{H3427}{(H8802)}, and laid{H7901}{(H8686)} him upon his own bed{H4296}."
1 Kings,17,20,"And he cried{H7121}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, O LORD{H3068} my God{H430}, hast thou also brought evil{H7489}{(H8689)} upon the widow{H490} with whom I sojourn{H1481}{(H8711)}, by slaying{H4191}{(H8687)} her son{H1121}?"
1 Kings,17,21,"And he stretched{H4058}{(H8709)} himself upon the child{H3206} three{H7969} times{H6471}, and cried{H7121}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, O LORD{H3068} my God{H430}, I pray thee, let this child's{H3206} soul{H5315} come{H7725} into him{H7130} again{H7725}{(H8799)}."
1 Kings,17,22,"And the LORD{H3068} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} the voice{H6963} of Elijah{H452}; and the soul{H5315} of the child{H3206} came{H7725} into him{H7130} again{H7725}{(H8799)}, and he revived{H2421}{(H8799)}."
1 Kings,17,23,"And Elijah{H452} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the child{H3206}, and brought him down{H3381}{(H8686)} out of the chamber{H5944} into the house{H1004}, and delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} him unto his mother{H517}: and Elijah{H452} said{H559}{(H8799)}, See{H7200}{(H8798)}, thy son{H1121} liveth{H2416}."
1 Kings,17,24,"And the woman{H802} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Elijah{H452}, Now by this{H2088} I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that thou art a man{H376} of God{H430}, and that the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} in thy mouth{H6310} is truth{H571}."
1 Kings,18,1,"And it came to pass after many{H7227} days{H3117}, that the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came to Elijah{H452} in the third{H7992} year{H8141}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, shew{H7200}{(H8734)} thyself unto Ahab{H256}; and I will send{H5414}{(H8799)} rain{H4306} upon{H6440} the earth{H127}."
1 Kings,18,2,And Elijah{H452} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to shew{H7200}{(H8736)} himself unto Ahab{H256}. And there was a sore{H2389} famine{H7458} in Samaria{H8111}.
1 Kings,18,3,"And Ahab{H256} called{H7121}{(H8799)} Obadiah{H5662}, which was the governor of his house{H1004}.(Now Obadiah{H5662} feared{H3373} the LORD{H3068} greatly{H3966}:"
1 Kings,18,4,"For it was so, when Jezebel{H348} cut off{H3772}{(H8687)} the prophets{H5030} of the LORD{H3068}, that Obadiah{H5662} took{H3947}{(H8799)} an hundred{H3967} prophets{H5030}, and hid{H2244}{(H8686)} them by fifty{H376}{H2572} in a cave{H4631}, and fed{H3557}{(H8773)} them with bread{H3899} and water{H4325}.)"
1 Kings,18,5,"And Ahab{H256} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Obadiah{H5662}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} into the land{H776}, unto all fountains{H4599} of water{H4325}, and unto all brooks{H5158}: peradventure{H194} we may find{H4672}{(H8799)} grass{H2682} to save{H2421}{(H8762)} the horses{H5483} and mules{H6505} alive{H2421}{(H8762)}, that we lose{H3772}{(H8686)} not all the beasts{H929}."
1 Kings,18,6,"So they divided{H2505}{(H8762)} the land{H776} between them to pass throughout{H5674}{(H8800)} it: Ahab{H256} went{H1980}{(H8804)} one{H259} way{H1870} by himself, and Obadiah{H5662} went{H1980}{(H8804)} another{H259} way{H1870} by himself."
1 Kings,18,7,"And as Obadiah{H5662} was in the way{H1870}, behold, Elijah{H452} met{H7125}{(H8800)} him: and he knew{H5234}{(H8686)} him, and fell{H5307}{(H8799)} on his face{H6440}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Art thou that my lord{H113} Elijah{H452}?"
1 Kings,18,8,"And he answered{H559}{(H8799)} him, I am: go{H3212}{(H8798)}, tell{H559}{(H8798)} thy lord{H113}, Behold, Elijah{H452} is here."
1 Kings,18,9,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, What have I sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}, that thou wouldest deliver{H5414}{(H8802)} thy servant{H5650} into the hand{H3027} of Ahab{H256}, to slay{H4191}{(H8687)} me?"
1 Kings,18,10,"As the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} liveth{H2416}, there is no{H3426} nation{H1471} or kingdom{H4467}, whither{H834} my lord{H113} hath not sent{H7971}{(H8804)} to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} thee: and when they said{H559}{(H8804)}, He is not there; he took an oath{H7650}{(H8689)} of the kingdom{H4467} and nation{H1471}, that they found{H4672}{(H8799)} thee not."
1 Kings,18,11,"And now thou sayest{H559}{(H8802)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, tell{H559}{(H8798)} thy lord{H113}, Behold, Elijah{H452} is here."
1 Kings,18,12,"And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone{H3212}{(H8799)} from thee, that the Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} shall carry{H5375}{(H8799)} thee whither I know{H3045}{(H8799)} not; and so when I come{H935}{(H8804)} and tell{H5046}{(H8687)} Ahab{H256}, and he cannot find{H4672}{(H8799)} thee, he shall slay{H2026}{(H8804)} me: but I thy servant{H5650} fear{H3372}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} from my youth{H5271}."
1 Kings,18,13,"Was it not told{H5046}{(H8717)} my lord{H113} what I did{H6213}{(H8804)} when Jezebel{H348} slew{H2026}{(H8800)} the prophets{H5030} of the LORD{H3068}, how I hid{H2244}{(H8686)} an hundred{H3967} men{H376} of the LORD'S{H3068} prophets{H5030} by fifty{H2572} in a cave{H4631}, and fed{H3557}{(H8770)} them with bread{H3899} and water{H4325}?"
1 Kings,18,14,"And now thou sayest{H559}{(H8802)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, tell{H559}{(H8798)} thy lord{H113}, Behold, Elijah{H452} is here: and he shall slay{H2026}{(H8804)} me."
1 Kings,18,15,"And Elijah{H452} said{H559}{(H8799)}, As the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} liveth{H2416}, before{H6440} whom I stand{H5975}{(H8804)}, I will surely shew{H7200}{(H8735)} myself unto him to day{H3117}."
1 Kings,18,16,"So Obadiah{H5662} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} Ahab{H256}, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} him: and Ahab{H256} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} Elijah{H452}."
1 Kings,18,17,"And it came to pass, when Ahab{H256} saw{H7200}{(H8800)} Elijah{H452}, that Ahab{H256} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Art thou he that troubleth{H5916}{(H8802)} Israel{H3478}?"
1 Kings,18,18,"And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, I have not troubled{H5916}{(H8804)} Israel{H3478}; but thou, and thy father's{H1} house{H1004}, in that ye have forsaken{H5800}{(H8800)} the commandments{H4687} of the LORD{H3068}, and thou hast followed{H3212}{(H8799)}{H310} Baalim{H1168}."
1 Kings,18,19,"Now therefore send{H7971}{(H8798)}, and gather{H6908}{(H8798)} to me all Israel{H3478} unto mount{H2022} Carmel{H3760}, and the prophets{H5030} of Baal{H1168} four{H702} hundred{H3967} and fifty{H2572}, and the prophets{H5030} of the groves{H842} four{H702} hundred{H3967}, which eat{H398}{(H8802)} at Jezebel's{H348} table{H7979}."
1 Kings,18,20,"So Ahab{H256} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto all the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, and gathered{H6908} the prophets{H5030} together{H6908}{(H8799)} unto mount{H2022} Carmel{H3760}."
1 Kings,18,21,"And Elijah{H452} came{H5066}{(H8799)} unto all the people{H5971}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, How long{H5921} halt{H6452}{(H8802)} ye between two{H8147} opinions{H5587}? if the LORD{H3068} be God{H430}, follow him: but if Baal{H1168}, then follow{H3212}{(H8798)}{H310} him. And the people{H5971} answered{H6030}{(H8804)} him not a word{H1697}."
1 Kings,18,22,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Elijah{H452} unto the people{H5971}, I, even I only, remain{H3498}{(H8738)} a prophet{H5030} of the LORD{H3068}; but Baal's{H1168} prophets{H5030} are four{H702} hundred{H3967} and fifty{H2572} men{H376}."
1 Kings,18,23,"Let them therefore give{H5414}{(H8799)} us two{H8147} bullocks{H6499}; and let them choose{H977}{(H8799)} one{H259} bullock{H6499} for themselves, and cut it in pieces{H5408}{(H8762)}, and lay{H7760}{(H8799)} it on wood{H6086}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} no fire{H784} under: and I will dress{H6213}{(H8799)} the other{H259} bullock{H6499}, and lay{H5414}{(H8804)} it on wood{H6086}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} no fire{H784} under:"
1 Kings,18,24,"And call{H7121}{(H8804)} ye on the name{H8034} of your gods{H430}, and I will call{H7121}{(H8799)} on the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068}: and the God{H430} that answereth{H6030}{(H8799)} by fire{H784}, let him be God{H430}. And all the people{H5971} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, It is well{H2896} spoken{H1697}."
1 Kings,18,25,"And Elijah{H452} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the prophets{H5030} of Baal{H1168}, Choose{H977}{(H8798)} you one{H259} bullock{H6499} for yourselves, and dress{H6213}{(H8798)} it first{H7223}; for ye are many{H7227}; and call{H7121}{(H8798)} on the name{H8034} of your gods{H430}, but put{H7760}{(H8799)} no fire{H784} under."
1 Kings,18,26,"And they took{H3947}{(H8799)} the bullock{H6499} which was given{H5414}{(H8804)} them, and they dressed{H6213}{(H8799)} it, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} on the name{H8034} of Baal{H1168} from morning{H1242} even until noon{H6672}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, O Baal{H1168}, hear{H6030}{(H8798)} us. But there was no{H369} voice{H6963}, nor any that answered{H6030}{(H8802)}. And they leaped{H6452}{(H8762)} upon the altar{H4196} which was made{H6213}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,18,27,"And it came to pass at noon{H6672}, that Elijah{H452} mocked{H2048}{(H8762)} them, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Cry{H7121}{(H8798)} aloud{H1419}{H6963}: for he is a god{H430}; either he is talking{H7879}, or he is pursuing{H7873}, or he is in a journey{H1870}, or peradventure{H194} he sleepeth{H3463}, and must be awaked{H3364}{(H8799)}."
1 Kings,18,28,"And they cried{H7121}{(H8799)} aloud{H6963}{H1419}, and cut{H1413}{(H8704)} themselves after their manner{H4941} with knives{H2719} and lancets{H7420}, till the blood{H1818} gushed out{H8210}{(H8800)} upon them."
1 Kings,18,29,"And it came to pass, when midday{H6672} was past{H5674}{(H8800)}, and they prophesied{H5012}{(H8691)} until the time of the offering{H5927}{(H8800)} of the evening sacrifice{H4503}, that there was neither voice{H6963}, nor any to answer{H6030}{(H8802)}, nor any that regarded{H7182}."
1 Kings,18,30,"And Elijah{H452} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto all the people{H5971}, Come near{H5066}{(H8798)} unto me. And all the people{H5971} came near{H5066}{(H8799)} unto him. And he repaired{H7495}{(H8762)} the altar{H4196} of the LORD{H3068} that was broken down{H2040}{(H8803)}."
1 Kings,18,31,"And Elijah{H452} took{H3947}{(H8799)} twelve{H8147}{H6240} stones{H68}, according to the number{H4557} of the tribes{H7626} of the sons{H1121} of Jacob{H3290}, unto whom the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Israel{H3478} shall be thy name{H8034}:"
1 Kings,18,32,"And with the stones{H68} he built{H1129}{(H8799)} an altar{H4196} in the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068}: and he made{H6213}{(H8799)} a trench{H8585} about{H5439} the altar{H4196}, as great as would contain{H1004} two measures{H5429} of seed{H2233}."
1 Kings,18,33,"And he put{H6186} the wood{H6086} in order{H6186}{(H8799)}, and cut{H5408}{(H8762)} the bullock{H6499} in pieces, and laid{H7760}{(H8799)} him on the wood{H6086}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Fill{H4390}{(H8798)} four{H702} barrels{H3537} with water{H4325}, and pour{H3332}{(H8798)} it on the burnt sacrifice{H5930}, and on the wood{H6086}."
1 Kings,18,34,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Do it the second time{H8138}{(H8798)}. And they did it the second time{H8138}{(H8799)}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Do it the third time{H8027}{(H8761)}. And they did it the third time{H8027}{(H8762)}."
1 Kings,18,35,And the water{H4325} ran{H3212}{(H8799)} round about{H5439} the altar{H4196}; and he filled{H4390}{(H8765)} the trench{H8585} also with water{H4325}.
1 Kings,18,36,"And it came to pass at the time of the offering{H5927}{(H8800)} of the evening sacrifice{H4503}, that Elijah{H452} the prophet{H5030} came near{H5066}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Abraham{H85}, Isaac{H3327}, and of Israel{H3478}, let it be known{H3045}{(H8735)} this day{H3117} that thou art God{H430} in Israel{H3478}, and that I am thy servant{H5650}, and that I have done{H6213}{(H8804)} all these things at thy word{H1697}."
1 Kings,18,37,"Hear{H6030}{(H8798)} me, O LORD{H3068}, hear{H6030}{(H8798)} me, that this people{H5971} may know{H3045}{(H8799)} that thou art the LORD{H3068} God{H430}, and that thou hast turned{H5437} their heart{H3820} back{H5437}{(H8689)} again{H322}."
1 Kings,18,38,"Then the fire{H784} of the LORD{H3068} fell{H5307}{(H8799)}, and consumed{H398}{(H8799)} the burnt sacrifice{H5930}, and the wood{H6086}, and the stones{H68}, and the dust{H6083}, and licked up{H3897}{(H8765)} the water{H4325} that was in the trench{H8585}."
1 Kings,18,39,"And when all the people{H5971} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} it, they fell{H5307}{(H8799)} on their faces{H6440}: and they said{H559}{(H8799)}, The LORD{H3068}, he is the God{H430}; the LORD{H3068}, he is the God{H430}."
1 Kings,18,40,"And Elijah{H452} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Take{H8610}{(H8798)} the prophets{H5030} of Baal{H1168}; let not one{H376} of them escape{H4422}{(H8735)}. And they took{H8610}{(H8799)} them: and Elijah{H452} brought them down{H3381}{(H8686)} to the brook{H5158} Kishon{H7028}, and slew{H7819}{(H8799)} them there."
1 Kings,18,41,"And Elijah{H452} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Ahab{H256}, Get thee up{H5927}{(H8798)}, eat{H398}{(H8798)} and drink{H8354}{(H8798)}; for there is a sound{H6963} of abundance{H1995} of rain{H1653}."
1 Kings,18,42,"So Ahab{H256} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} to eat{H398}{(H8800)} and to drink{H8354}{(H8800)}. And Elijah{H452} went up{H5927}{(H8804)} to the top{H7218} of Carmel{H3760}; and he cast himself down{H1457}{(H8799)} upon the earth{H776}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} his face{H6440} between his knees{H1290},"
1 Kings,18,43,"And said{H559}{(H8799)} to his servant{H5288}, Go up{H5927}{(H8798)} now, look{H5027}{(H8685)} toward{H1870} the sea{H3220}. And he went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and looked{H5027}{(H8686)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, There is nothing{H3972}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go again{H7725}{(H8798)} seven{H7651} times{H6471}."
1 Kings,18,44,"And it came to pass at the seventh time{H7637}, that he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, there ariseth{H5927}{(H8802)} a little{H6996} cloud{H5645} out of the sea{H3220}, like a man's{H376} hand{H3709}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go up{H5927}{(H8798)}, say{H559}{(H8798)} unto Ahab{H256}, Prepare{H631}{(H8798)} thy chariot, and get thee down{H3381}{(H8798)}, that the rain{H1653} stop{H6113}{(H8799)} thee not."
1 Kings,18,45,"And it came to pass in the mean while{H3541}, that the heaven{H8064} was black{H6937}{(H8694)} with clouds{H5645} and wind{H7307}, and there was a great{H1419} rain{H1653}. And Ahab{H256} rode{H7392}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Jezreel{H3157}."
1 Kings,18,46,"And the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068} was on Elijah{H452}; and he girded up{H8151}{(H8762)} his loins{H4975}, and ran{H7323}{(H8799)} before{H6440} Ahab{H256} to the entrance{H935}{(H8800)} of Jezreel{H3157}."
1 Kings,19,1,"And Ahab{H256} told{H5046}{(H8686)} Jezebel{H348} all that Elijah{H452} had done{H6213}{(H8804)}, and withal how he had slain{H2026}{(H8804)} all the prophets{H5030} with the sword{H2719}."
1 Kings,19,2,"Then Jezebel{H348} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} a messenger{H4397} unto Elijah{H452}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, So let the gods{H430} do{H6213}{(H8799)} to me, and more{H3254}{(H8686)} also, if I make{H7760}{(H8799)} not thy life{H5315} as the life{H5315} of one{H259} of them by to morrow{H4279} about this time{H6256}."
1 Kings,19,3,"And when he saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that, he arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} for his life{H5315}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Beersheba{H884}, which belongeth to Judah{H3063}, and left{H3240}{(H8686)} his servant{H5288} there."
1 Kings,19,4,"But he himself went{H1980}{(H8804)} a day's{H3117} journey{H1870} into the wilderness{H4057}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} and sat down{H3427}{(H8799)} under a{H259} juniper tree{H7574}: and he requested{H7592}{(H8799)} for himself{H5315} that he might die{H4191}{(H8800)}; and said{H559}{(H8799)}, It is enough{H7227}; now, O LORD{H3068}, take away{H3947}{(H8798)} my life{H5315}; for I am not better{H2896} than my fathers{H1}."
1 Kings,19,5,"And as he lay{H7901}{(H8799)} and slept{H3462}{(H8799)} under a{H259} juniper tree{H7574}, behold, then an angel{H4397} touched{H5060}{(H8802)} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)} and eat{H398}{(H8798)}."
1 Kings,19,6,"And he looked{H5027}{(H8686)}, and, behold, there was a cake{H5692} baken on the coals{H7529}, and a cruse{H6835} of water{H4325} at his head{H4763}. And he did eat{H398}{(H8799)} and drink{H8354}{(H8799)}, and laid him down{H7901}{(H8799)} again{H7725}{(H8799)}."
1 Kings,19,7,"And the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} came again{H7725}{(H8799)} the second time{H8145}, and touched{H5060}{(H8799)} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)} and eat{H398}{(H8798)}; because the journey{H1870} is too great{H7227} for thee."
1 Kings,19,8,"And he arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and did eat{H398}{(H8799)} and drink{H8354}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} in the strength{H3581} of that meat{H396} forty{H705} days{H3117} and forty{H705} nights{H3915} unto Horeb{H2722} the mount{H2022} of God{H430}."
1 Kings,19,9,"And he came{H935}{(H8799)} thither unto a cave{H4631}, and lodged{H3885}{(H8799)} there; and, behold, the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came to him, and he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah{H452}?"
1 Kings,19,10,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I have been very{H7065}{(H8763)} jealous{H7065}{(H8765)} for the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of hosts{H6635}: for the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} thy covenant{H1285}, thrown down{H2040}{(H8804)} thine altars{H4196}, and slain{H2026}{(H8804)} thy prophets{H5030} with the sword{H2719}; and I, even I only, am left{H3498}{(H8735)}; and they seek{H1245}{(H8762)} my life{H5315}, to take it away{H3947}{(H8800)}."
1 Kings,19,11,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go forth{H3318}{(H8798)}, and stand{H5975}{(H8804)} upon the mount{H2022} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}. And, behold, the LORD{H3068} passed by{H5674}{(H8802)}, and a great{H1419} and strong{H2389} wind{H7307} rent{H6561}{(H8764)} the mountains{H2022}, and brake in pieces{H7665}{(H8764)} the rocks{H5553} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}; but the LORD{H3068} was not in the wind{H7307}: and after{H310} the wind{H7307} an earthquake{H7494}; but the LORD{H3068} was not in the earthquake{H7494}:"
1 Kings,19,12,And after{H310} the earthquake{H7494} a fire{H784}; but the LORD{H3068} was not in the fire{H784}: and after{H310} the fire{H784} a still{H1827} small{H1851} voice{H6963}.
1 Kings,19,13,"And it was so, when Elijah{H452} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} it, that he wrapped{H3874}{(H8686)} his face{H6440} in his mantle{H155}, and went out{H3318}{(H8799)}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} in the entering in{H6607} of the cave{H4631}. And, behold, there came a voice{H6963} unto him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, What doest thou here, Elijah{H452}?"
1 Kings,19,14,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I have been very{H7065}{(H8763)} jealous{H7065}{(H8765)} for the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of hosts{H6635}: because the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} thy covenant{H1285}, thrown down{H2040}{(H8804)} thine altars{H4196}, and slain{H2026}{(H8804)} thy prophets{H5030} with the sword{H2719}; and I, even I only, am left{H3498}{(H8735)}; and they seek{H1245}{(H8762)} my life{H5315}, to take it away{H3947}{(H8800)}."
1 Kings,19,15,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, return{H7725}{(H8798)} on thy way{H1870} to the wilderness{H4057} of Damascus{H1834}: and when thou comest{H935}{(H8804)}, anoint{H4886}{(H8804)} Hazael{H2371} to be king{H4428} over Syria{H758}:"
1 Kings,19,16,And Jehu{H3058} the son{H1121} of Nimshi{H5250} shalt thou anoint{H4886}{(H8799)} to be king{H4428} over Israel{H3478}: and Elisha{H477} the son{H1121} of Shaphat{H8202} of Abelmeholah{H65} shalt thou anoint{H4886}{(H8799)} to be prophet{H5030} in thy room.
1 Kings,19,17,"And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth{H4422}{(H8737)} the sword{H2719} of Hazael{H2371} shall Jehu{H3058} slay{H4191}{(H8686)}: and him that escapeth{H4422}{(H8737)} from the sword{H2719} of Jehu{H3058} shall Elisha{H477} slay{H4191}{(H8686)}."
1 Kings,19,18,"Yet I have left{H7604}{(H8689)} me seven{H7651} thousand{H505} in Israel{H3478}, all the knees{H1290} which have not bowed{H3766}{(H8804)} unto Baal{H1168}, and every mouth{H6310} which hath not kissed{H5401}{(H8804)} him."
1 Kings,19,19,"So he departed{H3212}{(H8799)} thence, and found{H4672}{(H8799)} Elisha{H477} the son{H1121} of Shaphat{H8202}, who was plowing{H2790}{(H8802)} with twelve{H8147}{H6240} yoke{H6776} of oxen before{H6440} him, and he with the twelfth{H8147}{H6240}: and Elijah{H452} passed{H5674}{(H8799)} by him, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} his mantle{H155} upon him."
1 Kings,19,20,"And he left{H5800}{(H8799)} the oxen{H1241}, and ran{H7323}{(H8799)} after{H310} Elijah{H452}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let me, I pray thee, kiss{H5401}{(H8799)} my father{H1} and my mother{H517}, and then I will follow{H3212}{(H8799)}{H310} thee. And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Go back{H3212}{(H8798)} again{H7725}{(H8798)}: for what have I done{H6213}{(H8804)} to thee?"
1 Kings,19,21,"And he returned back{H7725}{(H8799)} from him{H310}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} a yoke{H6776} of oxen{H1241}, and slew{H2076}{(H8799)} them, and boiled{H1310}{(H8765)} their flesh{H1320} with the instruments{H3627} of the oxen{H1241}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} unto the people{H5971}, and they did eat{H398}{(H8799)}. Then he arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} after{H310} Elijah{H452}, and ministered{H8334}{(H8762)} unto him."
1 Kings,20,1,"And Benhadad{H1130} the king{H4428} of Syria{H758} gathered{H6908} all his host{H2428} together{H6908}{(H8804)}: and there were thirty{H7970} and two{H8147} kings{H4428} with him, and horses{H5483}, and chariots{H7393}: and he went up{H5927}{(H8799)} and besieged{H6696}{(H8799)} Samaria{H8111}, and warred{H3898}{(H8735)} against it."
1 Kings,20,2,"And he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} to Ahab{H256} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} into the city{H5892}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} Benhadad{H1130},"
1 Kings,20,3,"Thy silver{H3701} and thy gold{H2091} is mine; thy wives{H802} also and thy children{H1121}, even the goodliest{H2896}, are mine."
1 Kings,20,4,"And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, My lord{H113}, O king{H4428}, according to thy saying{H1697}, I am thine, and all that I have."
1 Kings,20,5,"And the messengers{H4397} came again{H7725}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thus speaketh{H559}{(H8804)} Benhadad{H1130}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Although I have sent{H7971}{(H8804)} unto thee, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thou shalt deliver{H5414}{(H8799)} me thy silver{H3701}, and thy gold{H2091}, and thy wives{H802}, and thy children{H1121};"
1 Kings,20,6,"Yet I will send{H7971}{(H8799)} my servants{H5650} unto thee to morrow{H4279} about this time{H6256}, and they shall search{H2664}{(H8765)} thine house{H1004}, and the houses{H1004} of thy servants{H5650}; and it shall be{H1961}{(H8804)}, that whatsoever is pleasant{H4261} in thine eyes{H5869}, they shall put{H7760}{(H8799)} it in their hand{H3027}, and take it away{H3947}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,20,7,"Then the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} called{H7121}{(H8799)} all the elders{H2205} of the land{H776}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Mark{H3045}{(H8798)}, I pray you, and see{H7200}{(H8798)} how this man seeketh{H1245}{(H8764)} mischief{H7451}: for he sent{H7971}{(H8804)} unto me for my wives{H802}, and for my children{H1121}, and for my silver{H3701}, and for my gold{H2091}; and I denied{H4513}{(H8804)} him not."
1 Kings,20,8,"And all the elders{H2205} and all the people{H5971} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} not unto him, nor consent{H14}{(H8799)}."
1 Kings,20,9,"Wherefore he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the messengers{H4397} of Benhadad{H1130}, Tell{H559}{(H8798)} my lord{H113} the king{H4428}, All that thou didst send{H7971}{(H8804)} for to thy servant{H5650} at the first{H7223} I will do{H6213}{(H8799)}: but this thing{H1697} I may{H3201}{(H8799)} not do{H6213}{(H8800)}. And the messengers{H4397} departed{H3212}{(H8799)}, and brought{H7725} him word{H1697} again{H7725}{(H8686)}."
1 Kings,20,10,"And Benhadad{H1130} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, The gods{H430} do so{H6213}{(H8799)} unto me, and more also{H3254}{(H8686)}, if the dust{H6083} of Samaria{H8111} shall suffice{H5606}{(H8799)} for handfuls{H8168} for all the people{H5971} that follow{H7272} me."
1 Kings,20,11,"And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Tell{H1696}{(H8761)} him, Let not him that girdeth{H2296}{(H8802)} on his harness boast{H1984}{(H8691)} himself as he that putteth it off{H6605}{(H8764)}."
1 Kings,20,12,"And it came to pass, when Benhadad heard{H8085}{(H8800)} this message{H1697}, as he was drinking{H8354}{(H8802)}, he and the kings{H4428} in the pavilions{H5521}, that he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his servants{H5650}, Set{H7760}{(H8798)} yourselves in array. And they set{H7760}{(H8799)} themselves in array against the city{H5892}."
1 Kings,20,13,"And, behold, there came{H5066}{(H8738)} a{H259} prophet{H5030} unto Ahab{H256} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8799)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Hast thou seen{H7200}{(H8804)} all this great{H1419} multitude{H1995}? behold, I will deliver{H5414}{(H8802)} it into thine hand{H3027} this day{H3117}; and thou shalt know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
1 Kings,20,14,"And Ahab{H256} said{H559}{(H8799)}, By whom? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Even by the young men{H5288} of the princes{H8269} of the provinces{H4082}. Then he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who shall order{H631}{(H8799)} the battle{H4421}? And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou."
1 Kings,20,15,"Then he numbered{H6485}{(H8799)} the young men{H5288} of the princes{H8269} of the provinces{H4082}, and they were two{H8147} hundred{H3967} and thirty{H7970} two{H8147}: and after{H310} them he numbered{H6485}{(H8804)} all the people{H5971}, even all the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, being seven{H7651} thousand{H505}."
1 Kings,20,16,"And they went out{H3318}{(H8799)} at noon{H6672}. But Benhadad{H1130} was drinking{H8354}{(H8802)} himself drunk{H7910} in the pavilions{H5521}, he and the kings{H4428}, the thirty{H7970} and two{H8147} kings{H4428} that helped{H5826}{(H8802)} him."
1 Kings,20,17,"And the young men{H5288} of the princes{H8269} of the provinces{H4082} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} first{H7223}; and Benhadad{H1130} sent out{H7971}{(H8799)}, and they told{H5046}{(H8686)} him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, There are men{H582} come out{H3318}{(H8804)} of Samaria{H8111}."
1 Kings,20,18,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Whether they be come out{H3318}{(H8804)} for peace{H7965}, take{H8610}{(H8798)} them alive{H2416}; or whether they be come out{H3318}{(H8804)} for war{H4421}, take{H8610}{(H8798)} them alive{H2416}."
1 Kings,20,19,"So these young men{H5288} of the princes{H8269} of the provinces{H4082} came out{H3318}{(H8804)} of the city{H5892}, and the army{H2428} which followed{H310} them."
1 Kings,20,20,And they slew{H5221}{(H8686)} every one{H376} his man{H376}: and the Syrians{H758} fled{H5127}{(H8799)}; and Israel{H3478} pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} them: and Benhadad{H1130} the king{H4428} of Syria{H758} escaped{H4422}{(H8735)} on an horse{H5483} with the horsemen{H6571}.
1 Kings,20,21,"And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} went out{H3318}{(H8799)}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the horses{H5483} and chariots{H7393}, and slew{H5221}{(H8689)} the Syrians{H758} with a great{H1419} slaughter{H4347}."
1 Kings,20,22,"And the prophet{H5030} came{H5066}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, strengthen{H2388}{(H8690)} thyself, and mark{H3045}{(H8798)}, and see{H7200}{(H8798)} what thou doest{H6213}{(H8799)}: for at the return{H8666} of the year{H8141} the king{H4428} of Syria{H758} will come up{H5927}{(H8802)} against thee."
1 Kings,20,23,"And the servants{H5650} of the king{H4428} of Syria{H758} said{H559}{(H8804)} unto him, Their gods{H430} are gods{H430} of the hills{H2022}; therefore they were stronger{H2388}{(H8804)} than we; but{H199} let us fight{H3898}{(H8735)} against them in the plain{H4334}, and surely{H3808} we shall be stronger{H2388}{(H8799)} than they."
1 Kings,20,24,"And do{H6213}{(H8798)} this thing{H1697}, Take{H5493}{(H8685)} the kings{H4428} away, every man{H376} out of his place{H4725}, and put{H7760}{(H8798)} captains{H6346} in their rooms:"
1 Kings,20,25,"And number{H4487}{(H8799)} thee an army{H2428}, like the army{H2428} that thou hast lost{H5307}{(H8802)}, horse{H5483} for horse{H5483}, and chariot{H7393} for chariot{H7393}: and we will fight{H3898}{(H8735)} against{H854} them in the plain{H4334}, and surely we shall be stronger{H2388}{(H8799)} than they. And he hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} unto their voice{H6963}, and did so{H6213}{(H8799)}."
1 Kings,20,26,"And it came to pass at the return{H8666} of the year{H8141}, that Benhadad{H1130} numbered{H6485}{(H8799)} the Syrians{H758}, and went up{H5927}{(H8799)} to Aphek{H663}, to fight{H4421} against Israel{H3478}."
1 Kings,20,27,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} were numbered{H6485}{(H8719)}, and were all present{H3557}{(H8791)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} them: and the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} before them like two{H8147} little flocks{H2835} of kids{H5795}; but the Syrians{H758} filled{H4390}{(H8765)} the country{H776}."
1 Kings,20,28,"And there came{H5066}{(H8799)} a man{H376} of God{H430}, and spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Because the Syrians{H758} have said{H559}{(H8804)}, The LORD{H3068} is God{H430} of the hills{H2022}, but he is not God{H430} of the valleys{H6010}, therefore will I deliver{H5414}{(H8804)} all this great{H1419} multitude{H1995} into thine hand{H3027}, and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
1 Kings,20,29,"And they pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} one{H428} over against{H5227} the other{H428} seven{H7651} days{H3117}. And so it was, that in the seventh{H7637} day{H3117} the battle{H4421} was joined{H7126}{(H8799)}: and the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} slew{H5221}{(H8686)} of the Syrians{H758} an hundred{H3967} thousand{H505} footmen{H7273} in one{H259} day{H3117}."
1 Kings,20,30,"But the rest{H3498}{(H8737)} fled{H5127}{(H8799)} to Aphek{H663}, into the city{H5892}; and there a wall{H2346} fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon twenty{H6242} and seven{H7651} thousand{H505} of the men{H376} that were left{H3498}{(H8737)}. And Benhadad{H1130} fled{H5127}{(H8804)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} into the city{H5892}, into an inner{H2315} chamber{H2315}."
1 Kings,20,31,"And his servants{H5650} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Behold now, we have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} that the kings{H4428} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} are merciful{H2617} kings{H4428}: let us, I pray thee, put{H7760}{(H8799)} sackcloth{H8242} on our loins{H4975}, and ropes{H2256} upon our heads{H7218}, and go out{H3318}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}: peradventure he will save{H2421}{(H8762)} thy life{H5315}."
1 Kings,20,32,"So they girded{H2296}{(H8799)} sackcloth{H8242} on their loins{H4975}, and put ropes{H2256} on their heads{H7218}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thy servant{H5650} Benhadad{H1130} saith{H559}{(H8804)}, I pray thee, let me live{H2421}{(H8799)}{H5315}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is he yet alive{H2416}? he is my brother{H251}."
1 Kings,20,33,"Now the men{H582} did diligently observe{H5172}{(H8762)} whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily{H4116}{(H8762)} catch{H2480}{(H8686)} it: and they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thy brother{H251} Benhadad{H1130}. Then he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go{H935}{(H8798)} ye, bring{H3947}{(H8798)} him. Then Benhadad{H1130} came forth{H3318}{(H8799)} to him; and he caused him to come up{H5927}{(H8686)} into the chariot{H4818}."
1 Kings,20,34,"And Benhadad said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, The cities{H5892}, which my father{H1} took{H3947}{(H8804)} from thy father{H1}, I will restore{H7725}{(H8686)}; and thou shalt make{H7760}{(H8799)} streets{H2351} for thee in Damascus{H1834}, as my father{H1} made{H7760}{(H8804)} in Samaria{H8111}. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away{H7971}{(H8762)} with this covenant{H1285}. So he made{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285} with him, and sent him away{H7971}{(H8762)}."
1 Kings,20,35,"And a certain{H259} man{H376} of the sons{H1121} of the prophets{H5030} said{H559}{(H8804)} unto his neighbour{H7453} in the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, Smite{H5221}{(H8685)} me, I pray thee. And the man{H376} refused{H3985}{(H8762)} to smite{H5221}{(H8687)} him."
1 Kings,20,36,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068}, behold, as soon as thou art departed{H1980}{(H8802)} from me, a lion{H738} shall slay{H5221}{(H8689)} thee. And as soon as he was departed{H3212}{(H8799)} from him{H681}, a lion{H738} found{H4672}{(H8799)} him, and slew{H5221}{(H8686)} him."
1 Kings,20,37,"Then he found{H4672}{(H8799)} another{H312} man{H376}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Smite{H5221}{(H8685)} me, I pray thee. And the man{H376} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} him, so that in smiting{H5221}{(H8687)} he wounded{H6481}{(H8800)} him."
1 Kings,20,38,"So the prophet{H5030} departed{H3212}{(H8799)}, and waited{H5975}{(H8799)} for the king{H4428} by the way{H1870}, and disguised{H2664}{(H8691)} himself with ashes{H666} upon his face{H5869}."
1 Kings,20,39,"And as the king{H4428} passed by{H5674}{(H8802)}, he cried{H6817}{(H8804)} unto the king{H4428}: and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thy servant{H5650} went out{H3318}{(H8804)} into the midst{H7130} of the battle{H4421}; and, behold, a man{H376} turned aside{H5493}{(H8804)}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} a man{H376} unto me, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Keep{H8104}{(H8798)} this man{H376}: if by any means{H6485}{(H8736)} he be missing{H6485}{(H8735)}, then shall thy life{H5315} be for his life{H5315}, or else thou shalt pay{H8254}{(H8799)} a talent{H3603} of silver{H3701}."
1 Kings,20,40,"And as thy servant{H5650} was busy{H6213}{(H8802)} here and there, he was gone{H369}. And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, So shall thy judgment{H4941} be; thyself hast decided{H2782}{(H8804)} it."
1 Kings,20,41,"And he hasted{H4116}{(H8762)}, and took the ashes{H666} away{H5493}{(H8686)} from his face{H5869}; and the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} discerned{H5234}{(H8686)} him that he was of the prophets{H5030}."
1 Kings,20,42,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Because thou hast let go{H7971}{(H8765)} out of thy hand{H3027} a man{H376} whom I appointed to utter destruction{H2764}, therefore thy life{H5315} shall go for his life{H5315}, and thy people{H5971} for his people{H5971}."
1 Kings,20,43,"And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to his house{H1004} heavy{H5620} and displeased{H2198}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Samaria{H8111}."
1 Kings,21,1,"And it came to pass after{H310} these things{H1697}, that Naboth{H5022} the Jezreelite{H3158} had a vineyard{H3754}, which was in Jezreel{H3157}, hard by{H681} the palace{H1964} of Ahab{H256} king{H4428} of Samaria{H8111}."
1 Kings,21,2,"And Ahab{H256} spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto Naboth{H5022}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} me thy vineyard{H3754}, that I may have it for a garden{H1588} of herbs{H3419}, because it is near{H7138} unto{H681} my house{H1004}: and I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee for it a better{H2896} vineyard{H3754} than it; or, if it seem good{H2896} to thee{H5869}, I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee the worth{H4242} of it in money{H3701}."
1 Kings,21,3,"And Naboth{H5022} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Ahab{H256}, The LORD{H3068} forbid{H2486} it me, that I should give{H5414}{(H8800)} the inheritance{H5159} of my fathers{H1} unto thee."
1 Kings,21,4,"And Ahab{H256} came{H935}{(H8799)} into his house{H1004} heavy{H5620} and displeased{H2198} because of the word{H1697} which Naboth{H5022} the Jezreelite{H3158} had spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} to him: for he had said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will not give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee the inheritance{H5159} of my fathers{H1}. And he laid him down{H7901}{(H8799)} upon his bed{H4296}, and turned away{H5437}{(H8686)} his face{H6440}, and would eat{H398}{(H8804)} no bread{H3899}."
1 Kings,21,5,"But Jezebel{H348} his wife{H802} came{H935}{(H8799)} to him, and said{H1696}{(H8762)} unto him, Why is thy spirit{H7307} so sad{H5620}, that thou eatest{H398}{(H8802)} no bread{H3899}?"
1 Kings,21,6,"And he said{H1696}{(H8762)} unto her, Because I spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto Naboth{H5022} the Jezreelite{H3158}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} me thy vineyard{H3754} for money{H3701}; or else, if it please{H2655} thee, I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee another vineyard{H3754} for it: and he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, I will not give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee my vineyard{H3754}."
1 Kings,21,7,"And Jezebel{H348} his wife{H802} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Dost thou now govern{H6213}{(H8799)} the kingdom{H4410} of Israel{H3478}? arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, and eat{H398}{(H8798)} bread{H3899}, and let thine heart{H3820} be merry{H3190}{(H8799)}: I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee the vineyard{H3754} of Naboth{H5022} the Jezreelite{H3158}."
1 Kings,21,8,"So she wrote{H3789}{(H8799)} letters{H5612} in Ahab's{H256} name{H8034}, and sealed{H2856}{(H8799)} them with his seal{H2368}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} the letters{H5612} unto the elders{H2205} and to the nobles{H2715} that were in his city{H5892}, dwelling{H3427}{(H8802)} with Naboth{H5022}."
1 Kings,21,9,"And she wrote{H3789}{(H8799)} in the letters{H5612}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Proclaim{H7121}{(H8798)} a fast{H6685}, and set{H3427}{(H8685)} Naboth{H5022} on high{H7218} among the people{H5971}:"
1 Kings,21,10,"And set{H3427}{(H8685)} two{H8147} men{H582}, sons{H1121} of Belial{H1100}, before him, to bear witness{H5749}{(H8686)} against him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thou didst blaspheme{H1288}{(H8765)} God{H430} and the king{H4428}. And then carry him out{H3318}{(H8689)}, and stone{H5619}{(H8798)} him, that he may die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
1 Kings,21,11,"And the men{H582} of his city{H5892}, even the elders{H2205} and the nobles{H2715} who were the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} in his city{H5892}, did{H6213}{(H8799)} as Jezebel{H348} had sent{H7971}{(H8804)} unto them, and as it was written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the letters{H5612} which she had sent{H7971}{(H8804)} unto them."
1 Kings,21,12,"They proclaimed{H7121}{(H8804)} a fast{H6685}, and set{H3427}{(H8689)} Naboth{H5022} on high{H7218} among the people{H5971}."
1 Kings,21,13,"And there came{H935}{(H8799)} in two{H8147} men{H582}, children{H1121} of Belial{H1100}, and sat{H3427}{(H8799)} before him: and the men{H582} of Belial{H1100} witnessed{H5749}{(H8686)} against him, even against Naboth{H5022}, in the presence of the people{H5971}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Naboth{H5022} did blaspheme{H1288}{(H8765)} God{H430} and the king{H4428}. Then they carried him forth{H3318}{(H8686)} out{H2351} of the city{H5892}, and stoned{H5619}{(H8799)} him with stones{H68}, that he died{H4191}{(H8799)}."
1 Kings,21,14,"Then they sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Jezebel{H348}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Naboth{H5022} is stoned{H5619}{(H8795)}, and is dead{H4191}{(H8799)}."
1 Kings,21,15,"And it came to pass, when Jezebel{H348} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} that Naboth{H5022} was stoned{H5619}{(H8795)}, and was dead{H4191}{(H8799)}, that Jezebel{H348} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Ahab{H256}, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, take possession{H3423}{(H8798)} of the vineyard{H3754} of Naboth{H5022} the Jezreelite{H3158}, which he refused{H3985}{(H8765)} to give{H5414}{(H8800)} thee for money{H3701}: for Naboth{H5022} is not alive{H2416}, but dead{H4191}{(H8804)}."
1 Kings,21,16,"And it came to pass, when Ahab{H256} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} that Naboth{H5022} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, that Ahab{H256} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} to go down{H3381}{(H8800)} to the vineyard{H3754} of Naboth{H5022} the Jezreelite{H3158}, to take possession{H3423}{(H8800)} of it."
1 Kings,21,17,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came to Elijah{H452} the Tishbite{H8664}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
1 Kings,21,18,"Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, go down{H3381}{(H8798)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} Ahab{H256} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, which is in Samaria{H8111}: behold, he is in the vineyard{H3754} of Naboth{H5022}, whither he is gone down{H3381}{(H8804)} to possess{H3423}{(H8800)} it."
1 Kings,21,19,"And thou shalt speak{H1696}{(H8765)} unto him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Hast thou killed{H7523}{(H8804)}, and also taken possession{H3423}{(H8804)}? And thou shalt speak{H1696}{(H8765)} unto him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, In the place{H4725} where dogs{H3611} licked{H3952}{(H8804)} the blood{H1818} of Naboth{H5022} shall dogs{H3611} lick{H3952}{(H8799)} thy blood{H1818}, even thine."
1 Kings,21,20,"And Ahab{H256} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Elijah{H452}, Hast thou found{H4672}{(H8804)} me, O mine enemy{H341}{(H8802)}? And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, I have found{H4672}{(H8804)} thee: because thou hast sold{H4376}{(H8692)} thyself to work{H6213}{(H8800)} evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}."
1 Kings,21,21,"Behold, I will bring{H935}{(H8688)} evil{H7451} upon thee, and will take away{H1197}{(H8765)} thy posterity{H310}, and will cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} from Ahab{H256} him that pisseth{H8366}{(H8688)} against the wall{H7023}, and him that is shut up{H6113}{(H8803)} and left{H5800}{(H8803)} in Israel{H3478},"
1 Kings,21,22,"And will make{H5414}{(H8804)} thine house{H1004} like the house{H1004} of Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Nebat{H5028}, and like the house{H1004} of Baasha{H1201} the son{H1121} of Ahijah{H281}, for the provocation{H3708} wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger{H3707}{(H8689)}, and made Israel{H3478} to sin{H2398}{(H8686)}."
1 Kings,21,23,"And of Jezebel{H348} also spake{H1696}{(H8765)} the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The dogs{H3611} shall eat{H398}{(H8799)} Jezebel{H348} by the wall{H2426} of Jezreel{H3157}."
1 Kings,21,24,Him that dieth{H4191}{(H8801)} of Ahab{H256} in the city{H5892} the dogs{H3611} shall eat{H398}{(H8799)}; and him that dieth{H4191}{(H8801)} in the field{H7704} shall the fowls{H5775} of the air{H8064} eat{H398}{(H8799)}.
1 Kings,21,25,"But there was none like unto Ahab{H256}, which did sell{H4376}{(H8694)} himself to work{H6213}{(H8800)} wickedness{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, whom Jezebel{H348} his wife{H802} stirred up{H5496}{(H8689)}."
1 Kings,21,26,"And he did very{H3966} abominably{H8581}{(H8686)} in following{H3212}{(H8800)}{H310} idols{H1544}, according to all things as did{H6213}{(H8804)} the Amorites{H567}, whom the LORD{H3068} cast out{H3423}{(H8689)} before{H6440} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}."
1 Kings,21,27,"And it came to pass, when Ahab{H256} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} those words{H1697}, that he rent{H7167}{(H8799)} his clothes{H899}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} sackcloth{H8242} upon his flesh{H1320}, and fasted{H6684}{(H8799)}, and lay{H7901}{(H8799)} in sackcloth{H8242}, and went{H1980}{(H8762)} softly{H328}."
1 Kings,21,28,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came to Elijah{H452} the Tishbite{H8664}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
1 Kings,21,29,"Seest{H7200}{(H8804)} thou how Ahab{H256} humbleth{H3665}{(H8738)} himself before{H6440} me? because{H3282} he humbleth{H3665}{(H8738)} himself before{H6440} me, I will not bring{H935}{(H8686)} the evil{H7451} in his days{H3117}: but in his son's{H1121} days{H3117} will I bring{H935}{(H8686)} the evil{H7451} upon his house{H1004}."
1 Kings,22,1,And they continued{H3427}{(H8799)} three{H7969} years{H8141} without war{H4421} between Syria{H758} and Israel{H3478}.
1 Kings,22,2,"And it came to pass in the third{H7992} year{H8141}, that Jehoshaphat{H3092} the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} came down{H3381}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}."
1 Kings,22,3,"And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his servants{H5650}, Know{H3045}{(H8804)} ye that Ramoth{H7433} in Gilead{H1568} is ours, and we be still{H2814}{(H8688)}, and take{H3947}{(H8800)} it not out of the hand{H3027} of the king{H4428} of Syria{H758}?"
1 Kings,22,4,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jehoshaphat{H3092}, Wilt thou go{H3212}{(H8799)} with me to battle{H4421} to Ramothgilead{H7433}{H1568}? And Jehoshaphat{H3092} said{H559}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, I am as thou{H3644} art, my people{H5971} as thy people{H5971}, my horses{H5483} as thy horses{H5483}."
1 Kings,22,5,"And Jehoshaphat{H3092} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, Enquire{H1875}{(H8798)}, I pray thee, at the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} to day{H3117}."
1 Kings,22,6,"Then the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} gathered{H6908} the prophets{H5030} together{H6908}{(H8799)}, about four{H702} hundred{H3967} men{H376}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Shall I go{H3212}{(H8799)} against Ramothgilead{H7433}{H1568} to battle{H4421}, or shall I forbear{H2308}{(H8799)}? And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go up{H5927}{(H8798)}; for the Lord{H136} shall deliver{H5414}{(H8799)} it into the hand{H3027} of the king{H4428}."
1 Kings,22,7,"And Jehoshaphat{H3092} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is there not here a prophet{H5030} of the LORD{H3068} besides{H5750}, that we might enquire{H1875}{(H8799)} of him?"
1 Kings,22,8,"And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jehoshaphat{H3092}, There is yet one{H259} man{H376}, Micaiah{H4321} the son{H1121} of Imlah{H3229}, by whom we may enquire{H1875}{(H8800)} of the LORD{H3068}: but I hate{H8130}{(H8804)} him; for he doth not prophesy{H5012}{(H8691)} good{H2896} concerning me, but evil{H7451}. And Jehoshaphat{H3092} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let not the king{H4428} say{H559}{(H8799)} so."
1 Kings,22,9,"Then the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} called{H7121}{(H8799)} an{H259} officer{H5631}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Hasten{H4116}{(H8761)} hither Micaiah{H4321} the son{H1121} of Imlah{H3229}."
1 Kings,22,10,"And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} and Jehoshaphat{H3092} the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} sat{H3427}{(H8802)} each{H376} on his throne{H3678}, having put on{H3847}{(H8794)} their robes{H899}, in a void place{H1637} in the entrance{H6607} of the gate{H8179} of Samaria{H8111}; and all the prophets{H5030} prophesied{H5012}{(H8693)} before{H6440} them."
1 Kings,22,11,"And Zedekiah{H6667} the son{H1121} of Chenaanah{H3668} made{H6213}{(H8799)} him horns{H7161} of iron{H1270}: and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, With these shalt thou push{H5055}{(H8762)} the Syrians{H758}, until thou have consumed{H3615}{(H8763)} them."
1 Kings,22,12,"And all the prophets{H5030} prophesied{H5012}{(H8737)} so, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Go up{H5927}{(H8798)} to Ramothgilead{H7433}{H1568}, and prosper{H6743}{(H8685)}: for the LORD{H3068} shall deliver{H5414}{(H8804)} it into the king's{H4428} hand{H3027}."
1 Kings,22,13,"And the messenger{H4397} that was gone{H1980}{(H8804)} to call{H7121}{(H8800)} Micaiah{H4321} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} unto him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold now, the words{H1697} of the prophets{H5030} declare good{H2896} unto the king{H4428} with one{H259} mouth{H6310}: let thy word{H1697}, I pray thee, be like the word{H1697} of one{H259} of them, and speak{H1696}{(H8765)} that which is good{H2896}."
1 Kings,22,14,"And Micaiah{H4321} said{H559}{(H8799)}, As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, what the LORD{H3068} saith{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, that will I speak{H1696}{(H8762)}."
1 Kings,22,15,"So he came{H935}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428}. And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Micaiah{H4321}, shall we go{H3212}{(H8799)} against Ramothgilead{H7433}{H1568} to battle{H4421}, or shall we forbear{H2308}{(H8799)}? And he answered{H559}{(H8799)} him, Go{H5927}{(H8798)}, and prosper{H6743}{(H8685)}: for the LORD{H3068} shall deliver{H5414}{(H8804)} it into the hand{H3027} of the king{H4428}."
1 Kings,22,16,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, How many times{H6471} shall I adjure{H7650}{(H8688)} thee that thou tell{H1696}{(H8762)} me nothing but that which is true{H571} in the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068}?"
1 Kings,22,17,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} all Israel{H3478} scattered{H6327}{(H8737)} upon the hills{H2022}, as sheep{H6629} that have not a shepherd{H7462}{(H8802)}: and the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)}, These have no master{H113}: let them return{H7725}{(H8799)} every man{H376} to his house{H1004} in peace{H7965}."
1 Kings,22,18,"And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jehoshaphat{H3092}, Did I not tell{H559}{(H8804)} thee that he would prophesy{H5012}{(H8691)} no good{H2896} concerning me, but evil{H7451}?"
1 Kings,22,19,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} thou therefore the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}: I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} sitting{H3427}{(H8802)} on his throne{H3678}, and all the host{H6635} of heaven{H8064} standing{H5975}{(H8802)} by him on his right hand{H3225} and on his left{H8040}."
1 Kings,22,20,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who shall persuade{H6601}{(H8762)} Ahab{H256}, that he may go up{H5927}{(H8799)} and fall{H5307}{(H8799)} at Ramothgilead{H7433}{H1568}? And one said{H559}{(H8799)} on this manner{H3541}, and another said{H559}{(H8802)} on that manner{H3541}."
1 Kings,22,21,"And there came forth{H3318}{(H8799)} a spirit{H7307}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will persuade{H6601}{(H8762)} him."
1 Kings,22,22,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Wherewith? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will go forth{H3318}{(H8799)}, and I will be a lying{H8267} spirit{H7307} in the mouth{H6310} of all his prophets{H5030}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou shalt persuade{H6601}{(H8762)} him, and prevail{H3201}{(H8799)} also: go forth{H3318}{(H8798)}, and do{H6213}{(H8798)} so."
1 Kings,22,23,"Now therefore, behold, the LORD{H3068} hath put{H5414}{(H8804)} a lying{H8267} spirit{H7307} in the mouth{H6310} of all these thy prophets{H5030}, and the LORD{H3068} hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} evil{H7451} concerning thee."
1 Kings,22,24,"But Zedekiah{H6667} the son{H1121} of Chenaanah{H3668} went near{H5066}{(H8799)}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} Micaiah{H4321} on the cheek{H3895}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Which way{H335} went{H5674}{(H8804)} the Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} from me to speak{H1696}{(H8763)} unto thee?"
1 Kings,22,25,"And Micaiah{H4321} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, thou shalt see{H7200}{(H8802)} in that day{H3117}, when thou shalt go{H935}{(H8799)} into an inner{H2315} chamber{H2315} to hide{H2247}{(H8736)} thyself."
1 Kings,22,26,"And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} Micaiah{H4321}, and carry him back{H7725}{(H8685)} unto Amon{H526} the governor{H8269} of the city{H5892}, and to Joash{H3101} the king's{H4428} son{H1121};"
1 Kings,22,27,"And say{H559}{(H8804)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the king{H4428}, Put{H7760}{(H8798)} this fellow in the prison{H1004}{H3608}, and feed{H398}{(H8685)} him with bread{H3899} of affliction{H3906} and with water{H4325} of affliction{H3906}, until I come{H935}{(H8800)} in peace{H7965}."
1 Kings,22,28,"And Micaiah{H4321} said{H559}{(H8799)}, If thou return{H7725}{(H8799)} at all{H7725}{(H8800)} in peace{H7965}, the LORD{H3068} hath not spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} by me. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Hearken{H8085}{(H8798)}, O people{H5971}, every one of you."
1 Kings,22,29,So the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} and Jehoshaphat{H3092} the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} to Ramothgilead{H7433}{H1568}.
1 Kings,22,30,"And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jehoshaphat{H3092}, I will disguise{H2664}{(H8692)} myself, and enter{H935}{(H8800)} into the battle{H4421}; but put thou on{H3847}{(H8798)} thy robes{H899}. And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} disguised{H2664}{(H8691)} himself, and went{H935}{(H8799)} into the battle{H4421}."
1 Kings,22,31,"But the king{H4428} of Syria{H758} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} his thirty{H7970} and two{H8147} captains{H8269} that had rule over his chariots{H7393}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Fight{H3898}{(H8735)} neither with small{H6996} nor great{H1419}, save only with the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}."
1 Kings,22,32,"And it came to pass, when the captains{H8269} of the chariots{H7393} saw{H7200}{(H8800)} Jehoshaphat{H3092}, that they said{H559}{(H8804)}, Surely it is the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}. And they turned aside{H5493}{(H8799)} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} against him: and Jehoshaphat{H3092} cried out{H2199}{(H8799)}."
1 Kings,22,33,"And it came to pass, when the captains{H8269} of the chariots{H7393} perceived{H7200}{(H8800)} that it was not the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, that they turned back{H7725}{(H8799)} from pursuing{H310} him."
1 Kings,22,34,"And a certain man{H376} drew{H4900}{(H8804)} a bow{H7198} at a venture{H8537}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} between the joints{H1694} of the harness{H8302}: wherefore he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the driver of his chariot{H7395}, Turn{H2015}{(H8798)} thine hand{H3027}, and carry me out{H3318}{(H8685)} of the host{H4264}; for I am wounded{H2470}{(H8717)}."
1 Kings,22,35,"And the battle{H4421} increased{H5927}{(H8799)} that day{H3117}: and the king{H4428} was stayed up{H5975}{(H8716)} in his chariot{H4818} against{H5227} the Syrians{H758}, and died{H4191}{(H8799)} at even{H6153}: and the blood{H1818} ran out{H3332}{(H8799)} of the wound{H4347} into the midst{H2436} of the chariot{H7393}."
1 Kings,22,36,"And there went{H5674}{(H8799)} a proclamation{H7440} throughout the host{H4264} about the going down{H935}{(H8800)} of the sun{H8121}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Every man{H376} to his city{H5892}, and every man{H376} to his own country{H776}."
1 Kings,22,37,"So the king{H4428} died{H4191}{(H8799)}, and was brought{H935}{(H8799)} to Samaria{H8111}; and they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} the king{H4428} in Samaria{H8111}."
1 Kings,22,38,And one washed{H7857}{(H8799)} the chariot{H7393} in the pool{H1295} of Samaria{H8111}; and the dogs{H3611} licked up{H3952}{(H8799)} his blood{H1818}; and they washed{H7364}{(H8804)} his armour{H2185}; according unto the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)}.
1 Kings,22,39,"Now the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Ahab{H256}, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, and the ivory{H8127} house{H1004} which he made{H1129}{(H8804)}, and all the cities{H5892} that he built{H1129}{(H8804)}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478}?"
1 Kings,22,40,So Ahab{H256} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}; and Ahaziah{H274} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead.
1 Kings,22,41,And Jehoshaphat{H3092} the son{H1121} of Asa{H609} began to reign{H4427}{(H8804)} over Judah{H3063} in the fourth{H702} year{H8141} of Ahab{H256} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}.
1 Kings,22,42,Jehoshaphat{H3092} was thirty{H7970} and five{H2568} years{H8141} old{H1121} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}; and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} twenty{H6242} and five{H2568} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Azubah{H5806} the daughter{H1323} of Shilhi{H7977}.
1 Kings,22,43,"And he walked{H3212}{(H8799)} in all the ways{H1870} of Asa{H609} his father{H1}; he turned not aside{H5493}{(H8804)} from it, doing{H6213}{(H8800)} that which was right{H3477} in the eyes{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}: nevertheless the high places{H1116} were not taken away{H5493}{(H8804)}; for the people{H5971} offered{H2076}{(H8764)} and burnt incense{H6999}{(H8764)} yet in the high places{H1116}."
1 Kings,22,44,And Jehoshaphat{H3092} made peace{H7999}{(H8686)} with the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}.
1 Kings,22,45,"Now the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Jehoshaphat{H3092}, and his might{H1369} that he shewed{H6213}{(H8804)}, and how he warred{H3898}{(H8738)}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}?"
1 Kings,22,46,"And the remnant{H3499} of the sodomites{H6945}, which remained{H7604}{(H8738)} in the days{H3117} of his father{H1} Asa{H609}, he took{H1197}{(H8765)} out of the land{H776}."
1 Kings,22,47,There was then no king{H4428} in Edom{H123}: a deputy{H5324}{(H8737)} was king{H4428}.
1 Kings,22,48,Jehoshaphat{H3092} made{H6213}{(H8804)}{(H8675)}{H6240} ships{H591} of Tharshish{H8659} to go{H3212}{(H8800)} to Ophir{H211} for gold{H2091}: but they went{H1980}{(H8804)} not; for the ships{H591} were broken{H7665}{(H8738)} at Eziongeber{H6100}.
1 Kings,22,49,"Then said{H559}{(H8804)} Ahaziah{H274} the son{H1121} of Ahab{H256} unto Jehoshaphat{H3092}, Let my servants{H5650} go{H3212}{(H8799)} with thy servants{H5650} in the ships{H591}. But Jehoshaphat{H3092} would{H14}{(H8804)} not."
1 Kings,22,50,"And Jehoshaphat{H3092} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} with his fathers{H1} in the city{H5892} of David{H1732} his father{H1}: and Jehoram{H3088} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead."
1 Kings,22,51,"Ahaziah{H274} the son{H1121} of Ahab{H256} began to reign{H4427}{(H8804)} over Israel{H3478} in Samaria{H8111} the seventeenth{H7651}{H6240} year{H8141} of Jehoshaphat{H3092} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} two years{H8141} over Israel{H3478}."
1 Kings,22,52,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, and walked{H3212}{(H8799)} in the way{H1870} of his father{H1}, and in the way{H1870} of his mother{H517}, and in the way{H1870} of Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Nebat{H5028}, who made Israel{H3478} to sin{H2398}{(H8689)}:"
1 Kings,22,53,"For he served{H5647}{(H8799)} Baal{H1168}, and worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)} him, and provoked to anger{H3707}{(H8686)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, according to all that his father{H1} had done{H6213}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,1,1,Then Moab{H4124} rebelled{H6586}{(H8799)} against Israel{H3478} after{H310} the death{H4194} of Ahab{H256}.
2 Kings,1,2,"And Ahaziah{H274} fell down{H5307}{(H8799)} through a lattice{H7639} in his upper chamber{H5944} that was in Samaria{H8111}, and was sick{H2470}{(H8799)}: and he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, enquire{H1875}{(H8798)} of Baalzebub{H1176} the god{H430} of Ekron{H6138} whether I shall recover{H2421}{(H8799)} of this disease{H2483}."
2 Kings,1,3,"But the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} said{H1696}{(H8765)} to Elijah{H452} the Tishbite{H8664}, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, go up{H5927}{(H8798)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} the messengers{H4397} of the king{H4428} of Samaria{H8111}, and say{H1696}{(H8761)} unto them, Is it not because there is not a God{H430} in Israel{H3478}, that ye go{H1980}{(H8802)} to enquire{H1875}{(H8800)} of Baalzebub{H1176} the god{H430} of Ekron{H6138}?"
2 Kings,1,4,"Now therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Thou shalt not come down{H3381}{(H8799)} from that bed{H4296} on which thou art gone up{H5927}{(H8804)}, but shalt surely{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}. And Elijah{H452} departed{H3212}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,1,5,"And when the messengers{H4397} turned back{H7725}{(H8799)} unto him, he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Why are ye now{H2088} turned back{H7725}{(H8804)}?"
2 Kings,1,6,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, There came{H5927} a man{H376} up{H5927}{(H8804)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} us, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto us, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, turn again{H7725}{(H8798)} unto the king{H4428} that sent{H7971}{(H8804)} you, and say{H1696}{(H8765)} unto him, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Is it not because there is not a God{H430} in Israel{H3478}, that thou sendest{H7971}{(H8802)} to enquire{H1875}{(H8800)} of Baalzebub{H1176} the god{H430} of Ekron{H6138}? therefore thou shalt not come down{H3381}{(H8799)} from that bed{H4296} on which thou art gone up{H5927}{(H8804)}, but shalt surely{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,1,7,"And he said{H1696}{(H8762)} unto them, What manner{H4941} of man{H376} was he which came up{H5927}{(H8804)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} you, and told{H1696}{(H8762)} you these words{H1697}?"
2 Kings,1,8,"And they answered{H559}{(H8799)} him, He was an hairy{H8181} man{H1167}{H376}, and girt{H247}{(H8803)} with a girdle{H232} of leather{H5785} about his loins{H4975}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, It is Elijah{H452} the Tishbite{H8664}."
2 Kings,1,9,"Then the king{H4428} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto him a captain{H8269} of fifty{H2572} with his fifty{H2572}. And he went up{H5927}{(H8799)} to him: and, behold, he sat{H3427}{(H8802)} on the top{H7218} of an hill{H2022}. And he spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto him, Thou man{H376} of God{H430}, the king{H4428} hath said{H1696}{(H8765)}, Come down{H3381}{(H8798)}."
2 Kings,1,10,"And Elijah{H452} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H1696}{(H8762)} to the captain{H8269} of fifty{H2572}, If I be a man{H376} of God{H430}, then let fire{H784} come down{H3381}{(H8799)} from heaven{H8064}, and consume{H398}{(H8799)} thee and thy fifty{H2572}. And there came down{H3381}{(H8799)} fire{H784} from heaven{H8064}, and consumed{H398}{(H8799)} him and his fifty{H2572}."
2 Kings,1,11,"Again{H7725}{(H8799)} also he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto him another{H312} captain{H8269} of fifty{H2572} with his fifty{H2572}. And he answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H1696}{(H8762)} unto him, O man{H376} of God{H430}, thus hath the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8804)}, Come down{H3381}{(H8798)} quickly{H4120}."
2 Kings,1,12,"And Elijah{H452} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H1696}{(H8762)} unto them, If I be a man{H376} of God{H430}, let fire{H784} come down{H3381}{(H8799)} from heaven{H8064}, and consume{H398}{(H8799)} thee and thy fifty{H2572}. And the fire{H784} of God{H430} came down{H3381}{(H8799)} from heaven{H8064}, and consumed{H398}{(H8799)} him and his fifty{H2572}."
2 Kings,1,13,"And he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} again{H7725}{(H8799)} a captain{H8269} of the third{H7992} fifty{H2572} with his fifty{H2572}. And the third{H7992} captain{H8269} of fifty{H2572} went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} and fell{H3766}{(H8799)} on his knees{H1290} before{H5048} Elijah{H452}, and besought{H2603}{(H8691)} him, and said{H1696}{(H8762)} unto him, O man{H376} of God{H430}, I pray thee, let my life{H5315}, and the life{H5315} of these fifty{H2572} thy servants{H5650}, be precious{H3365}{(H8799)} in thy sight{H5869}."
2 Kings,1,14,"Behold, there came{H3381} fire{H784} down{H3381}{(H8804)} from heaven{H8064}, and burnt up{H398}{(H8799)} the two{H8147} captains{H8269} of the former{H7223} fifties{H2572} with their fifties{H2572}: therefore let my life{H5315} now be precious{H3365}{(H8799)} in thy sight{H5869}."
2 Kings,1,15,"And the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} said{H1696}{(H8762)} unto Elijah{H452}, Go down{H3381}{(H8798)} with him: be not afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} of him{H6440}. And he arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went down{H3381}{(H8799)} with him unto the king{H4428}."
2 Kings,1,16,"And he said{H1696}{(H8762)} unto him, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Forasmuch as thou hast sent{H7971}{(H8804)} messengers{H4397} to enquire{H1875}{(H8800)} of Baalzebub{H1176} the god{H430} of Ekron{H6138}, is it not because there is no God{H430} in Israel{H3478} to enquire{H1875}{(H8800)} of his word{H1697}? therefore thou shalt not come down{H3381}{(H8799)} off that bed{H4296} on which thou art gone up{H5927}{(H8804)}, but shalt surely{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,1,17,So he died{H4191}{(H8799)} according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} which Elijah{H452} had spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}. And Jehoram{H3088} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead in the second{H8147} year{H8141} of Jehoram{H3088} the son{H1121} of Jehoshaphat{H3092} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}; because he had no son{H1121}.
2 Kings,1,18,"Now the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Ahaziah{H274} which he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478}?"
2 Kings,2,1,"And it came to pass, when the LORD{H3068} would take up{H5927}{(H8687)} Elijah{H452} into heaven{H8064} by a whirlwind{H5591}, that Elijah{H452} went{H3212}{(H8799)} with Elisha{H477} from Gilgal{H1537}."
2 Kings,2,2,"And Elijah{H452} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Elisha{H477}, Tarry{H3427}{(H8798)} here, I pray thee; for the LORD{H3068} hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} me to Bethel{H1008}. And Elisha{H477} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, and as thy soul{H5315} liveth{H2416}, I will not leave{H5800}{(H8799)} thee. So they went down{H3381}{(H8799)} to Bethel{H1008}."
2 Kings,2,3,"And the sons{H1121} of the prophets{H5030} that were at Bethel{H1008} came forth{H3318}{(H8799)} to Elisha{H477}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} thou that the LORD{H3068} will take away{H3947}{(H8802)} thy master{H113} from thy head{H7218} to day{H3117}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Yea, I know{H3045}{(H8804)} it; hold ye your peace{H2814}{(H8685)}."
2 Kings,2,4,"And Elijah{H452} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Elisha{H477}, tarry{H3427}{(H8798)} here, I pray thee; for the LORD{H3068} hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} me to Jericho{H3405}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, and as thy soul{H5315} liveth{H2416}, I will not leave{H5800}{(H8799)} thee. So they came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jericho{H3405}."
2 Kings,2,5,"And the sons{H1121} of the prophets{H5030} that were at Jericho{H3405} came{H5066}{(H8799)} to Elisha{H477}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} thou that the LORD{H3068} will take away{H3947}{(H8802)} thy master{H113} from thy head{H7218} to day{H3117}? And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Yea, I know{H3045}{(H8804)} it; hold ye your peace{H2814}{(H8685)}."
2 Kings,2,6,"And Elijah{H452} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Tarry{H3427}{(H8798)}, I pray thee, here; for the LORD{H3068} hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} me to Jordan{H3383}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, and as thy soul{H5315} liveth{H2416}, I will not leave{H5800}{(H8799)} thee. And they two{H8147} went on{H3212}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,2,7,"And fifty{H2572} men{H376} of the sons{H1121} of the prophets{H5030} went{H1980}{(H8804)}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} to view{H5048} afar off{H7350}: and they two{H8147} stood{H5975}{(H8804)} by Jordan{H3383}."
2 Kings,2,8,"And Elijah{H452} took{H3947}{(H8799)} his mantle{H155}, and wrapped it together{H1563}{(H8799)}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the waters{H4325}, and they were divided{H2673}{(H8735)} hither and thither, so that they two{H8147} went over{H5674}{(H8799)} on dry{H2724} ground."
2 Kings,2,9,"And it came to pass, when they were gone over{H5674}{(H8800)}, that Elijah{H452} said{H559}{(H8804)} unto Elisha{H477}, Ask{H7592}{(H8798)} what I shall do{H6213}{(H8799)} for thee, before I be taken away{H3947}{(H8735)} from thee. And Elisha{H477} said{H559}{(H8799)}, I pray thee, let a double{H8147} portion{H6310} of thy spirit{H7307} be upon me."
2 Kings,2,10,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou hast asked{H7592}{(H8800)} a hard thing{H7185}{(H8689)}: nevertheless, if thou see{H7200}{(H8799)} me when I am taken{H3947}{(H8795)} from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so."
2 Kings,2,11,"And it came to pass, as they still{H1980}{(H8800)} went on{H1980}{(H8802)}, and talked{H1696}{(H8763)}, that, behold, there appeared a chariot{H7393} of fire{H784}, and horses{H5483} of fire{H784}, and parted{H6504}{(H8686)} them both{H8147} asunder{H996}; and Elijah{H452} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} by a whirlwind{H5591} into heaven{H8064}."
2 Kings,2,12,"And Elisha{H477} saw{H7200}{(H8802)} it, and he cried{H6817}{(H8764)}, My father{H1}, my father{H1}, the chariot{H7393} of Israel{H3478}, and the horsemen{H6571} thereof. And he saw{H7200}{(H8804)} him no more: and he took hold{H2388}{(H8686)} of his own clothes{H899}, and rent{H7167}{(H8799)} them in two{H8147} pieces{H7168}."
2 Kings,2,13,"He took up{H7311}{(H8686)} also the mantle{H155} of Elijah{H452} that fell{H5307}{(H8804)} from him, and went back{H7725}{(H8799)}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} by the bank{H8193} of Jordan{H3383};"
2 Kings,2,14,"And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} the mantle{H155} of Elijah{H452} that fell{H5307}{(H8804)} from him, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the waters{H4325}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Where is the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Elijah{H452}? and when he also had smitten{H5221}{(H8686)} the waters{H4325}, they parted{H2673}{(H8735)} hither and thither: and Elisha{H477} went over{H5674}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,2,15,"And when the sons{H1121} of the prophets{H5030} which were to view at Jericho{H3405} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} him, they said{H559}{(H8799)}, The spirit{H7307} of Elijah{H452} doth rest{H5117}{(H8804)} on Elisha{H477}. And they came{H935}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} him, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} themselves to the ground{H776} before him."
2 Kings,2,16,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Behold now, there be{H3426} with thy servants{H5650} fifty{H2572} strong{H2428} men{H1121}{H582}; let them go{H3212}{(H8799)}, we pray thee, and seek{H1245}{(H8762)} thy master{H113}: lest peradventure the Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} hath taken him up{H5375}{(H8804)}, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} him upon some{H259} mountain{H2022}, or into some{H259} valley{H1516}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Ye shall not send{H7971}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,2,17,"And when they urged{H6484}{(H8799)} him till he was ashamed{H954}{(H8800)}, he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Send{H7971}{(H8798)}. They sent{H7971}{(H8799)} therefore fifty{H2572} men{H376}; and they sought{H1245}{(H8762)} three{H7969} days{H3117}, but found{H4672}{(H8804)} him not."
2 Kings,2,18,"And when they came again{H7725}{(H8799)} to him,(for he tarried{H3427}{(H8802)} at Jericho{H3405},) he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Did I not say{H559}{(H8804)} unto you, Go{H3212}{(H8799)} not?"
2 Kings,2,19,"And the men{H582} of the city{H5892} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Elisha{H477}, Behold, I pray thee, the situation{H4186} of this city{H5892} is pleasant{H2896}, as my lord{H113} seeth{H7200}{(H8802)}: but the water{H4325} is naught{H7451}, and the ground{H776} barren{H7921}{(H8764)}."
2 Kings,2,20,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Bring{H3947}{(H8798)} me a new{H2319} cruse{H6746}, and put{H7760}{(H8798)} salt{H4417} therein. And they brought{H3947}{(H8799)} it to him."
2 Kings,2,21,"And he went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} unto the spring{H4161} of the waters{H4325}, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} the salt{H4417} in there, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, I have healed{H7495}{(H8765)} these waters{H4325}; there shall not be from thence any more death{H4194} or barren{H7921}{(H8764)} land."
2 Kings,2,22,"So the waters{H4325} were healed{H7495}{(H8735)} unto this day{H3117}, according to the saying{H1697} of Elisha{H477} which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)}."
2 Kings,2,23,"And he went up{H5927}{(H8799)} from thence unto Bethel{H1008}: and as he was going up{H5927}{(H8802)} by the way{H1870}, there came forth{H3318}{(H8804)} little{H6996} children{H5288} out of the city{H5892}, and mocked{H7046}{(H8691)} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Go up{H5927}{(H8798)}, thou bald head{H7142}; go up{H5927}{(H8798)}, thou bald head{H7142}."
2 Kings,2,24,"And he turned{H6437}{(H8799)} back{H310}, and looked{H7200}{(H8799)} on them, and cursed{H7043}{(H8762)} them in the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068}. And there came forth{H3318}{(H8799)} two{H8147} she bears{H1677} out of the wood{H3293}, and tare{H1234}{(H8762)} forty{H705} and two{H8147} children{H3206} of them."
2 Kings,2,25,"And he went{H3212}{(H8799)} from thence to mount{H2022} Carmel{H3760}, and from thence he returned{H7725}{(H8804)} to Samaria{H8111}."
2 Kings,3,1,"Now Jehoram{H3088} the son{H1121} of Ahab{H256} began to reign{H4427}{(H8804)} over Israel{H3478} in Samaria{H8111} the eighteenth{H8083}{H6240} year{H8141} of Jehoshaphat{H3092} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} twelve{H8147}{H6240} years{H8141}."
2 Kings,3,2,"And he wrought{H6213}{(H8799)} evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}; but not like his father{H1}, and like his mother{H517}: for he put away{H5493}{(H8686)} the image{H4676} of Baal{H1168} that his father{H1} had made{H6213}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,3,3,"Nevertheless he cleaved{H1692}{(H8804)} unto the sins{H2403} of Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Nebat{H5028}, which made Israel{H3478} to sin{H2398}{(H8689)}; he departed{H5493}{(H8804)} not therefrom."
2 Kings,3,4,"And Mesha{H4338} king{H4428} of Moab{H4124} was a sheepmaster{H5349}, and rendered{H7725}{(H8689)} unto the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} an hundred{H3967} thousand{H505} lambs{H3733}, and an hundred{H3967} thousand{H505} rams{H352}, with the wool{H6785}."
2 Kings,3,5,"But it came to pass, when Ahab{H256} was dead{H4194}, that the king{H4428} of Moab{H4124} rebelled{H6586}{(H8799)} against the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Kings,3,6,"And king{H4428} Jehoram{H3088} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} of Samaria{H8111} the same time{H3117}, and numbered{H6485}{(H8799)} all Israel{H3478}."
2 Kings,3,7,"And he went{H3212}{(H8799)} and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Jehoshaphat{H3092} the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The king{H4428} of Moab{H4124} hath rebelled{H6586}{(H8804)} against me: wilt thou go{H3212}{(H8799)} with me against Moab{H4124} to battle{H4421}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will go up{H5927}{(H8799)}: I am as thou art, my people{H5971} as thy people{H5971}, and my horses{H5483} as thy horses{H5483}."
2 Kings,3,8,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Which way{H1870} shall we go up{H5927}{(H8799)}? And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, The way{H1870} through the wilderness{H4057} of Edom{H123}."
2 Kings,3,9,"So the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} went{H3212}{(H8799)}, and the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and the king{H4428} of Edom{H123}: and they fetched a compass{H5437}{(H8799)} of seven{H7651} days{H3117}' journey{H1870}: and there was no water{H4325} for the host{H4264}, and for the cattle{H929} that followed{H7272} them."
2 Kings,3,10,"And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Alas{H162}! that the LORD{H3068} hath called{H7121} these three{H7969} kings{H4428} together{H7121}{(H8804)}, to deliver{H5414}{(H8800)} them into the hand{H3027} of Moab{H4124}!"
2 Kings,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat{H3092} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is there not here a prophet{H5030} of the LORD{H3068}, that we may enquire{H1875}{(H8799)} of the LORD{H3068} by him? And one{H259} of the king{H4428} of Israel's{H3478} servants{H5650} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Here is Elisha{H477} the son{H1121} of Shaphat{H8202}, which poured{H3332}{(H8804)} water{H4325} on the hands{H3027} of Elijah{H452}."
2 Kings,3,12,"And Jehoshaphat{H3092} said{H559}{(H8799)}, The word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} is{H3426} with him. So the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} and Jehoshaphat{H3092} and the king{H4428} of Edom{H123} went down{H3381}{(H8799)} to him."
2 Kings,3,13,"And Elisha{H477} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, What have I to do with thee? get{H3212}{(H8798)} thee to the prophets{H5030} of thy father{H1}, and to the prophets{H5030} of thy mother{H517}. And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Nay: for the LORD{H3068} hath called{H7121} these three{H7969} kings{H4428} together{H7121}{(H8804)}, to deliver{H5414}{(H8800)} them into the hand{H3027} of Moab{H4124}."
2 Kings,3,14,"And Elisha{H477} said{H559}{(H8799)}, As the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} liveth{H2416}, before{H6440} whom I stand{H5975}{(H8804)}, surely, were it not that{H3884} I regard{H5375}{(H8802)} the presence{H6440} of Jehoshaphat{H3092} the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, I would not look{H5027}{(H8686)} toward thee, nor see{H7200}{(H8799)} thee."
2 Kings,3,15,"But now bring{H3947}{(H8798)} me a minstrel{H5059}{(H8764)}. And it came to pass, when the minstrel{H5059}{(H8764)} played{H5059}{(H8763)}, that the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068} came upon him."
2 Kings,3,16,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Make{H6213}{(H8800)} this valley{H5158} full of ditches{H1356}."
2 Kings,3,17,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Ye shall not see{H7200}{(H8799)} wind{H7307}, neither shall ye see{H7200}{(H8799)} rain{H1653}; yet that valley{H5158} shall be filled{H4390}{(H8735)} with water{H4325}, that ye may drink{H8354}{(H8804)}, both ye, and your cattle{H4735}, and your beasts{H929}."
2 Kings,3,18,And this is but a light thing{H7043}{(H8738)} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}: he will deliver{H5414}{(H8804)} the Moabites{H4124} also into your hand{H3027}.
2 Kings,3,19,"And ye shall smite{H5221}{(H8689)} every fenced{H4013} city{H5892}, and every choice{H4004} city{H5892}, and shall fell{H5307}{(H8686)} every good{H2896} tree{H6086}, and stop{H5640}{(H8799)} all wells{H4599} of water{H4325}, and mar{H3510}{(H8686)} every good{H2896} piece{H2513} of land with stones{H68}."
2 Kings,3,20,"And it came to pass in the morning{H1242}, when the meat offering{H4503} was offered{H5927}{(H8800)}, that, behold, there came{H935}{(H8802)} water{H4325} by the way{H1870} of Edom{H123}, and the country{H776} was filled{H4390}{(H8735)} with water{H4325}."
2 Kings,3,21,"And when all the Moabites{H4124} heard{H8085}{(H8804)} that the kings{H4428} were come up{H5927}{(H8804)} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} against them, they gathered{H6817}{(H8735)} all that were able to put{H2296}{(H8802)} on armour{H2290}, and upward{H4605}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} in the border{H1366}."
2 Kings,3,22,"And they rose up early{H7925}{(H8686)} in the morning{H1242}, and the sun{H8121} shone{H2224}{(H8804)} upon the water{H4325}, and the Moabites{H4124} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the water{H4325} on the other side{H5048} as red{H122} as blood{H1818}:"
2 Kings,3,23,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, This is blood{H1818}: the kings{H4428} are surely{H2717}{(H8715)} slain{H2717}{(H8738)}, and they have smitten{H5221}{(H8686)} one{H376} another{H7453}: now therefore, Moab{H4124}, to the spoil{H7998}."
2 Kings,3,24,"And when they came{H935}{(H8799)} to the camp{H4264} of Israel{H3478}, the Israelites{H3478} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the Moabites{H4124}, so that they fled{H5127}{(H8799)} before{H6440} them: but they went forward{H5221}{(H8686)} smiting{H5221}{(H8687)} the Moabites{H4124}, even in their country."
2 Kings,3,25,"And they beat down{H2040}{(H8799)} the cities{H5892}, and on every good{H2896} piece{H2513} of land cast{H7993}{(H8686)} every man{H376} his stone{H68}, and filled{H4390}{(H8765)} it; and they stopped{H5640}{(H8799)} all the wells{H4599} of water{H4325}, and felled{H5307}{(H8686)} all the good{H2896} trees{H6086}: only in Kirharaseth{H7025} left{H7604}{(H8689)} they the stones{H68} thereof; howbeit the slingers{H7051} went about{H5437}{(H8799)} it, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} it."
2 Kings,3,26,"And when the king{H4428} of Moab{H4124} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that the battle{H4421} was too sore{H2388}{(H8804)} for him, he took{H3947}{(H8799)} with him seven{H7651} hundred{H3967} men{H376} that drew{H8025}{(H8802)} swords{H2719}, to break through{H1234}{(H8687)} even unto the king{H4428} of Edom{H123}: but they could{H3201}{(H8804)} not."
2 Kings,3,27,"Then he took{H3947}{(H8799)} his eldest{H1060} son{H1121} that should have reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead, and offered{H5927}{(H8686)} him for a burnt offering{H5930} upon the wall{H2346}. And there was great{H1419} indignation{H7110} against Israel{H3478}: and they departed{H5265}{(H8799)} from him, and returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to their own land{H776}."
2 Kings,4,1,"Now there cried{H6817}{(H8804)} a certain{H259} woman{H802} of the wives{H802} of the sons{H1121} of the prophets{H5030} unto Elisha{H477}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thy servant{H5650} my husband{H376} is dead{H4191}{(H8804)}; and thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} that thy servant{H5650} did fear{H3373} the LORD{H3068}: and the creditor{H5383}{(H8802)} is come{H935}{(H8804)} to take{H3947}{(H8800)} unto him my two{H8147} sons{H3206} to be bondmen{H5650}."
2 Kings,4,2,"And Elisha{H477} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, What shall I do{H6213}{(H8799)} for thee? tell{H5046}{(H8685)} me, what hast{H3426} thou in the house{H1004}? And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thine handmaid{H8198} hath not any thing in the house{H1004}, save a pot{H610} of oil{H8081}."
2 Kings,4,3,"Then he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, borrow{H7592}{(H8798)} thee vessels{H3627} abroad{H2351} of all thy neighbours{H7934}, even empty{H7386} vessels{H3627}; borrow not a few{H4591}{(H8686)}."
2 Kings,4,4,"And when thou art come in{H935}{(H8804)}, thou shalt shut{H5462}{(H8804)} the door{H1817} upon thee and upon thy sons{H1121}, and shalt pour out{H3332}{(H8804)} into all those vessels{H3627}, and thou shalt set aside{H5265}{(H8686)} that which is full{H4392}."
2 Kings,4,5,"So she went{H3212}{(H8799)} from him, and shut{H5462}{(H8799)} the door{H1817} upon her and upon{H1157} her sons{H1121}, who{H1992} brought{H5066}{(H8688)} the vessels to her; and she poured out{H3332}{(H8716)}."
2 Kings,4,6,"And it came to pass, when the vessels{H3627} were full{H4390}{(H8800)}, that she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her son{H1121}, Bring{H5066}{(H8685)} me yet a vessel{H3627}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, There is not a vessel{H3627} more. And the oil{H8081} stayed{H5975}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,4,7,"Then she came{H935}{(H8799)} and told{H5046}{(H8686)} the man{H376} of God{H430}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, sell{H4376}{(H8798)} the oil{H8081}, and pay{H7999}{(H8761)} thy debt{H5386}, and live{H2421}{(H8799)} thou and thy children{H1121} of the rest{H3498}{(H8737)}."
2 Kings,4,8,"And it fell on a day{H3117}, that Elisha{H477} passed{H5674}{(H8799)} to Shunem{H7766}, where was a great{H1419} woman{H802}; and she constrained{H2388}{(H8686)} him to eat{H398}{(H8800)} bread{H3899}. And so it was, that as oft{H1767} as he passed by{H5674}{(H8800)}, he turned{H5493}{(H8799)} in thither to eat{H398}{(H8800)} bread{H3899}."
2 Kings,4,9,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her husband{H376}, Behold now, I perceive{H3045}{(H8804)} that this is an holy{H6918} man{H376} of God{H430}, which passeth{H5674}{(H8802)} by us continually{H8548}."
2 Kings,4,10,"Let us make{H6213}{(H8799)} a little{H6996} chamber{H5944}, I pray thee, on the wall{H7023}; and let us set{H7760}{(H8799)} for him there a bed{H4296}, and a table{H7979}, and a stool{H3678}, and a candlestick{H4501}: and it shall be, when he cometh{H935}{(H8800)} to us, that he shall turn{H5493}{(H8799)} in thither."
2 Kings,4,11,"And it fell on a day{H3117}, that he came{H935}{(H8799)} thither, and he turned{H5493}{(H8799)} into the chamber{H5944}, and lay{H7901}{(H8799)} there."
2 Kings,4,12,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} to Gehazi{H1522} his servant{H5288}, Call{H7121}{(H8798)} this Shunammite{H7767}. And when he had called{H7121}{(H8799)} her, she stood{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him."
2 Kings,4,13,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Say{H559}{(H8798)} now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful{H2729}{(H8804)} for us with all this care{H2731}; what is to be done{H6213}{(H8800)} for thee? wouldest{H3426} thou be spoken{H1696}{(H8763)} for to the king{H4428}, or to the captain{H8269} of the host{H6635}? And she answered{H559}{(H8799)}, I dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} among{H8432} mine own people{H5971}."
2 Kings,4,14,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, What then is to be done{H6213}{(H8800)} for her? And Gehazi{H1522} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Verily{H61} she hath no child{H1121}, and her husband{H376} is old{H2204}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,4,15,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Call{H7121}{(H8798)} her. And when he had called{H7121}{(H8799)} her, she stood{H5975}{(H8799)} in the door{H6607}."
2 Kings,4,16,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, About this season{H4150}, according to the time{H6256} of life{H2416}, thou shalt embrace{H2263}{(H8802)} a son{H1121}. And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, Nay, my lord{H113}, thou man{H376} of God{H430}, do not lie{H3576}{(H8762)} unto thine handmaid{H8198}."
2 Kings,4,17,"And the woman{H802} conceived{H2029}{(H8799)}, and bare{H3205}{(H8799)} a son{H1121} at that season{H4150} that Elisha{H477} had said{H1696}{(H8765)} unto her, according to the time{H6256} of life{H2416}."
2 Kings,4,18,"And when the child{H3206} was grown{H1431}{(H8799)}, it fell on a day{H3117}, that he went out{H3318}{(H8799)} to his father{H1} to the reapers{H7114}{(H8802)}."
2 Kings,4,19,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his father{H1}, My head{H7218}, my head{H7218}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)} to a lad{H5288}, Carry{H5375}{(H8798)} him to his mother{H517}."
2 Kings,4,20,"And when he had taken{H5375}{(H8799)} him, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} him to his mother{H517}, he sat{H3427}{(H8799)} on her knees{H1290} till noon{H6672}, and then died{H4191}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,4,21,"And she went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and laid{H7901}{(H8686)} him on the bed{H4296} of the man{H376} of God{H430}, and shut{H5462}{(H8799)} the door upon him, and went out{H3318}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,4,22,"And she called{H7121}{(H8799)} unto her husband{H376}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Send{H7971}{(H8798)} me, I pray thee, one{H259} of the young men{H5288}, and one{H259} of the asses{H860}, that I may run{H7323}{(H8799)} to the man{H376} of God{H430}, and come again{H7725}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,4,23,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Wherefore wilt thou go{H1980}{(H8802)} to him to day{H3117}? it is neither new moon{H2320}, nor sabbath{H7676}. And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, It shall be well{H7965}."
2 Kings,4,24,"Then she saddled{H2280}{(H8799)} an ass{H860}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} to her servant{H5288}, Drive{H5090}{(H8798)}, and go forward{H3212}{(H8798)}; slack{H6113}{(H8799)} not thy riding{H7392}{(H8800)} for me, except I bid{H559}{(H8804)} thee."
2 Kings,4,25,"So she went{H3212}{(H8799)} and came{H935}{(H8799)} unto the man{H376} of God{H430} to mount{H2022} Carmel{H3760}. And it came to pass, when the man{H376} of God{H430} saw her afar off{H7200}{(H8800)}, that he said{H559}{(H8799)} to Gehazi{H1522} his servant{H5288}, Behold, yonder is that{H1975} Shunammite{H7767}:"
2 Kings,4,26,"Run{H7323}{(H8798)} now, I pray thee, to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} her, and say{H559}{(H8798)} unto her, Is it well{H7965} with thee? is it well{H7965} with thy husband{H376}? is it well{H7965} with the child{H3206}? And she answered{H559}{(H8799)}, It is well{H7965}."
2 Kings,4,27,"And when she came{H935}{(H8799)} to the man{H376} of God{H430} to the hill{H2022}, she caught{H2388}{(H8686)} him by the feet{H7272}: but Gehazi{H1522} came near{H5066}{(H8799)} to thrust her away{H1920}{(H8800)}. And the man{H376} of God{H430} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let her alone{H7503}{(H8685)}; for her soul{H5315} is vexed{H4843}{(H8804)} within her: and the LORD{H3068} hath hid{H5956}{(H8689)} it from me, and hath not told{H5046}{(H8689)} me."
2 Kings,4,28,"Then she said{H559}{(H8799)}, Did I desire{H7592}{(H8804)} a son{H1121} of my lord{H113}? did I not say{H559}{(H8804)}, Do not deceive{H7952}{(H8686)} me?"
2 Kings,4,29,"Then he said{H559}{(H8799)} to Gehazi{H1522}, Gird up{H2296}{(H8798)} thy loins{H4975}, and take{H3947}{(H8798)} my staff{H4938} in thine hand{H3027}, and go thy way{H3212}{(H8798)}: if thou meet{H4672}{(H8799)} any man{H376}, salute{H1288}{(H8762)} him not; and if any{H376} salute{H1288}{(H8762)} thee, answer him not again{H6030}{(H8799)}: and lay{H7760}{(H8804)} my staff{H4938} upon the face{H6440} of the child{H5288}."
2 Kings,4,30,"And the mother{H517} of the child{H5288} said{H559}{(H8799)}, As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, and as thy soul{H5315} liveth{H2416}, I will not leave{H5800}{(H8799)} thee. And he arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and followed{H3212}{(H8799)}{H310} her."
2 Kings,4,31,"And Gehazi{H1522} passed on{H5674}{(H8804)} before{H6440} them, and laid{H7760}{(H8799)} the staff{H4938} upon the face{H6440} of the child{H5288}; but there was neither voice{H6963}, nor hearing{H7182}. Wherefore he went again{H7725}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} him, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The child{H5288} is not awaked{H6974}{(H8689)}."
2 Kings,4,32,"And when Elisha{H477} was come{H935}{(H8799)} into the house{H1004}, behold, the child{H5288} was dead{H4191}{(H8801)}, and laid{H7901}{(H8716)} upon his bed{H4296}."
2 Kings,4,33,"He went in{H935}{(H8799)} therefore, and shut{H5462}{(H8799)} the door{H1817} upon them twain{H8147}, and prayed{H6419}{(H8691)} unto the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,4,34,"And he went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and lay{H7901}{(H8799)} upon the child{H3206}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} his mouth{H6310} upon his mouth{H6310}, and his eyes{H5869} upon his eyes{H5869}, and his hands{H3709} upon his hands{H3709}: and he stretched{H1457}{(H8799)} himself upon the child; and the flesh{H1320} of the child{H3206} waxed warm{H2552}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,4,35,"Then he returned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and walked{H3212}{(H8799)} in the house{H1004} to{H259}{H2008} and fro{H259}{H2008}; and went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and stretched{H1457}{(H8799)} himself upon him: and the child{H5288} sneezed{H2237}{(H8779)} seven{H7651} times{H6471}, and the child{H5288} opened{H6491}{(H8799)} his eyes{H5869}."
2 Kings,4,36,"And he called{H7121}{(H8799)} Gehazi{H1522}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Call{H7121}{(H8798)} this Shunammite{H7767}. So he called{H7121}{(H8799)} her. And when she was come in{H935}{(H8799)} unto him, he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Take up{H5375}{(H8798)} thy son{H1121}."
2 Kings,4,37,"Then she went in{H935}{(H8799)}, and fell{H5307}{(H8799)} at his feet{H7272}, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} herself to the ground{H776}, and took up{H5375}{(H8799)} her son{H1121}, and went out{H3318}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,4,38,"And Elisha{H477} came again{H7725}{(H8804)} to Gilgal{H1537}: and there was a dearth{H7458} in the land{H776}; and the sons{H1121} of the prophets{H5030} were sitting{H3427}{(H8802)} before{H6440} him: and he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his servant{H5288}, Set{H8239}{(H8798)} on the great{H1419} pot{H5518}, and seethe{H1310}{(H8761)} pottage{H5138} for the sons{H1121} of the prophets{H5030}."
2 Kings,4,39,"And one{H259} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} into the field{H7704} to gather{H3950}{(H8763)} herbs{H219}, and found{H4672}{(H8799)} a wild{H7704} vine{H1612}, and gathered{H3950}{(H8762)} thereof wild{H7704} gourds{H6498} his lap{H899} full{H4393}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} and shred{H6398}{(H8762)} them into the pot{H5518} of pottage{H5138}: for they knew{H3045}{(H8804)} them not."
2 Kings,4,40,"So they poured out{H3332}{(H8799)} for the men{H582} to eat{H398}{(H8800)}. And it came to pass, as they were eating{H398}{(H8800)} of the pottage{H5138}, that they cried out{H6817}{(H8804)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, O thou man{H376} of God{H430}, there is death{H4194} in the pot{H5518}. And they could{H3201}{(H8804)} not eat{H398}{(H8800)} thereof."
2 Kings,4,41,"But he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Then bring{H3947}{(H8798)} meal{H7058}. And he cast{H7993}{(H8686)} it into the pot{H5518}; and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Pour out{H3332}{(H8798)} for the people{H5971}, that they may eat{H398}{(H8799)}. And there was no harm{H1697}{H7451} in the pot{H5518}."
2 Kings,4,42,"And there came{H935}{(H8802)} a man{H376} from Baalshalisha{H1190}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} the man{H376} of God{H430} bread{H3899} of the firstfruits{H1061}, twenty{H6242} loaves{H3899} of barley{H8184}, and full ears of corn{H3759} in the husk{H6861} thereof. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} unto the people{H5971}, that they may eat{H398}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,4,43,"And his servitor{H8334}{(H8764)} said{H559}{(H8799)}, What, should I set{H5414}{(H8799)} this before{H6440} an hundred{H3967} men{H376}? He said again{H559}{(H8799)}, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} the people{H5971}, that they may eat{H398}{(H8799)}: for thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, They shall eat{H398}{(H8800)}, and shall leave{H3498}{(H8687)} thereof."
2 Kings,4,44,"So he set{H5414}{(H8799)} it before{H6440} them, and they did eat{H398}{(H8799)}, and left{H3498}{(H8686)} thereof, according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,5,1,"Now Naaman{H5283}, captain{H8269} of the host{H6635} of the king{H4428} of Syria{H758}, was a great{H1419} man{H376} with{H6440} his master{H113}, and honourable{H5375}{(H8803)}, because by him the LORD{H3068} had given{H5414}{(H8804)} deliverance{H8668} unto Syria{H758}: he was also a mighty{H1368} man{H376} in valour{H2428}, but he was a leper{H6879}{(H8794)}."
2 Kings,5,2,"And the Syrians{H758} had gone out{H3318}{(H8804)} by companies{H1416}, and had brought away captive{H7617}{(H8799)} out of the land{H776} of Israel{H3478} a little{H6996} maid{H5291}; and she waited on{H6440} Naaman's{H5283} wife{H802}."
2 Kings,5,3,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her mistress{H1404}, Would{H305} God my lord{H113} were with{H6440} the prophet{H5030} that is in Samaria{H8111}! for{H227} he would recover{H622}{(H8799)} him of his leprosy{H6883}."
2 Kings,5,4,"And one went in{H935}{(H8799)}, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} his lord{H113}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus and thus said{H1696}{(H8765)} the maid{H5291} that is of the land{H776} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Kings,5,5,"And the king{H4428} of Syria{H758} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go to{H3212}{(H8798)}, go{H935}{(H8798)}, and I will send{H7971}{(H8799)} a letter{H5612} unto the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}. And he departed{H3212}{(H8799)}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} with him{H3027} ten{H6235} talents{H3603} of silver{H3701}, and six{H8337} thousand{H505} pieces of gold{H2091}, and ten{H6235} changes{H2487} of raiment{H899}."
2 Kings,5,6,"And he brought{H935}{(H8686)} the letter{H5612} to the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Now when this letter{H5612} is come{H935}{(H8800)} unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent{H7971}{(H8804)} Naaman{H5283} my servant{H5650} to thee, that thou mayest recover{H622}{(H8804)} him of his leprosy{H6883}."
2 Kings,5,7,"And it came to pass, when the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} had read{H7121}{(H8800)} the letter{H5612}, that he rent{H7167}{(H8799)} his clothes{H899}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Am I God{H430}, to kill{H4191}{(H8687)} and to make alive{H2421}{(H8687)}, that this man{H2088} doth send{H7971}{(H8802)} unto me to recover{H622}{(H8800)} a man{H376} of his leprosy{H6883}? wherefore{H389} consider{H3045}{(H8798)}, I pray you, and see{H7200}{(H8798)} how he seeketh a quarrel{H579}{(H8693)} against me."
2 Kings,5,8,"And it was so, when Elisha{H477} the man{H376} of God{H430} had heard{H8085}{(H8800)} that the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} had rent{H7167}{(H8804)} his clothes{H899}, that he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Wherefore hast thou rent{H7167}{(H8804)} thy clothes{H899}? let him come{H935}{(H8799)} now to me, and he shall know{H3045}{(H8799)} that there is{H3426} a prophet{H5030} in Israel{H3478}."
2 Kings,5,9,"So Naaman{H5283} came{H935}{(H8799)} with his horses{H5483} and with his chariot{H7393}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} at the door{H6607} of the house{H1004} of Elisha{H477}."
2 Kings,5,10,"And Elisha{H477} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} a messenger{H4397} unto him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Go{H1980}{(H8800)} and wash{H7364}{(H8804)} in Jordan{H3383} seven{H7651} times{H6471}, and thy flesh{H1320} shall come again{H7725}{(H8799)} to thee, and thou shalt be clean{H2891}{(H8798)}."
2 Kings,5,11,"But Naaman{H5283} was wroth{H7107}{(H8799)}, and went away{H3212}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, I thought{H559}{(H8804)}, He will surely{H3318}{(H8800)} come out{H3318}{(H8799)} to me, and stand{H5975}{(H8804)}, and call{H7121}{(H8804)} on the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068} his God{H430}, and strike{H5130}{(H8689)} his hand{H3027} over the place{H4725}, and recover{H622}{(H8804)} the leper{H6879}{(H8794)}."
2 Kings,5,12,"Are not Abana{H71}{(H8676)}{H549} and Pharpar{H6554}, rivers{H5104} of Damascus{H1834}, better{H2896} than all the waters{H4325} of Israel{H3478}? may I not wash{H7364}{(H8799)} in them, and be clean{H2891}{(H8804)}? So he turned{H6437}{(H8799)} and went away{H3212}{(H8799)} in a rage{H2534}."
2 Kings,5,13,"And his servants{H5650} came near{H5066}{(H8799)}, and spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, My father{H1}, if the prophet{H5030} had bid{H1696}{(H8765)} thee do some great{H1419} thing{H1697}, wouldest thou not have done{H6213}{(H8799)} it? how much rather then{H637}, when he saith{H559}{(H8804)} to thee, Wash{H7364}{(H8798)}, and be clean{H2891}{(H8798)}?"
2 Kings,5,14,"Then went he down{H3381}{(H8799)}, and dipped{H2881}{(H8799)} himself seven{H7651} times{H6471} in Jordan{H3383}, according to the saying{H1697} of the man{H376} of God{H430}: and his flesh{H1320} came again{H7725}{(H8799)} like unto the flesh{H1320} of a little{H6996} child{H5288}, and he was clean{H2891}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,5,15,"And he returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to the man{H376} of God{H430}, he and all his company{H4264}, and came{H935}{(H8799)}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him: and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, now I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that there is no God{H430} in all the earth{H776}, but in Israel{H3478}: now therefore, I pray thee, take{H3947}{(H8798)} a blessing{H1293} of thy servant{H5650}."
2 Kings,5,16,"But he said{H559}{(H8799)}, As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, before{H6440} whom I stand{H5975}{(H8804)}, I will receive{H3947}{(H8799)} none. And he urged{H6484}{(H8799)} him to take{H3947}{(H8800)} it; but he refused{H3985}{(H8762)}."
2 Kings,5,17,"And Naaman{H5283} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given{H5414}{(H8714)} to thy servant{H5650} two{H6776} mules{H6505}' burden{H4853} of earth{H127}? for thy servant{H5650} will henceforth offer{H6213}{(H8799)} neither burnt offering{H5930} nor sacrifice{H2077} unto other{H312} gods{H430}, but unto the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,5,18,"In this thing{H1697} the LORD{H3068} pardon{H5545}{(H8799)} thy servant{H5650}, that when my master{H113} goeth{H935}{(H8800)} into the house{H1004} of Rimmon{H7417} to worship{H7812}{(H8692)} there, and he leaneth{H8172}{(H8737)} on my hand{H3027}, and I bow{H7812}{(H8694)} myself in the house{H1004} of Rimmon{H7417}: when I bow down{H7812}{(H8692)} myself in the house{H1004} of Rimmon{H7417}, the LORD{H3068} pardon{H5545}{(H8799)} thy servant{H5650} in this thing{H1697}."
2 Kings,5,19,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} in peace{H7965}. So he departed{H3212}{(H8799)} from him a little{H3530} way{H776}."
2 Kings,5,20,"But Gehazi{H1522}, the servant{H5288} of Elisha{H477} the man{H376} of God{H430}, said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, my master{H113} hath spared{H2820}{(H8804)} Naaman{H5283} this Syrian{H761}, in not receiving{H3947}{(H8800)} at his hands{H3027} that which he brought{H935}{(H8689)}: but, as the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, I will run{H7323}{(H8804)} after{H310} him, and take{H3947}{(H8804)} somewhat{H3972} of him."
2 Kings,5,21,"So Gehazi{H1522} followed{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} Naaman{H5283}. And when Naaman{H5283} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} him running{H7323}{(H8801)} after{H310} him, he lighted down{H5307}{(H8799)} from the chariot{H4818} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is all well{H7965}?"
2 Kings,5,22,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, All is well{H7965}. My master{H113} hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} me, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, even now there be come{H935}{(H8804)} to me from mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669} two{H8147} young men{H5288} of the sons{H1121} of the prophets{H5030}: give{H5414}{(H8798)} them, I pray thee, a talent{H3603} of silver{H3701}, and two{H8147} changes{H2487} of garments{H899}."
2 Kings,5,23,"And Naaman{H5283} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Be content{H2974}{(H8685)}, take{H3947}{(H8798)} two talents{H3603}. And he urged{H6555}{(H8799)} him, and bound{H6696}{(H8799)} two{H8147} talents{H3603} of silver{H3701} in two{H8147} bags{H2754}, with two{H8147} changes{H2487} of garments{H899}, and laid{H5414}{(H8799)} them upon two{H8147} of his servants{H5288}; and they bare{H5375}{(H8799)} them before{H6440} him."
2 Kings,5,24,"And when he came{H935}{(H8799)} to the tower{H6076}, he took{H3947}{(H8799)} them from their hand{H3027}, and bestowed{H6485}{(H8799)} them in the house{H1004}: and he let the men{H582} go{H7971}{(H8762)}, and they departed{H3212}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,5,25,"But he went in{H935}{(H8802)}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} before his master{H113}. And Elisha{H477} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Whence{H370} comest thou, Gehazi{H1522}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thy servant{H5650} went{H1980}{(H8804)} no whither{H575}."
2 Kings,5,26,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Went{H1980}{(H8804)} not mine heart{H3820} with thee, when the man{H376} turned{H2015}{(H8804)} again from his chariot{H4818} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} thee? Is it a time{H6256} to receive{H3947}{(H8800)} money{H3701}, and to receive{H3947}{(H8800)} garments{H899}, and oliveyards{H2132}, and vineyards{H3754}, and sheep{H6629}, and oxen{H1241}, and menservants{H5650}, and maidservants{H8198}?"
2 Kings,5,27,"The leprosy{H6883} therefore of Naaman{H5283} shall cleave{H1692}{(H8799)} unto thee, and unto thy seed{H2233} for ever{H5769}. And he went out{H3318}{(H8799)} from his presence{H6440} a leper{H6879}{(H8794)} as white as snow{H7950}."
2 Kings,6,1,"And the sons{H1121} of the prophets{H5030} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto{H6440} Elisha{H477}, Behold now, the place{H4725} where we dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} with thee is too strait{H6862} for us."
2 Kings,6,2,"Let us go{H3212}{(H8799)}, we pray thee, unto Jordan{H3383}, and take{H3947}{(H8799)} thence every man{H376} a{H259} beam{H6982}, and let us make{H6213}{(H8799)} us a place{H4725} there, where we may dwell{H3427}{(H8800)}. And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} ye."
2 Kings,6,3,"And one{H259} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Be content{H2974}{(H8685)}, I pray thee, and go{H3212}{(H8798)} with thy servants{H5650}. And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, I will go{H3212}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,6,4,"So he went{H3212}{(H8799)} with them. And when they came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jordan{H3383}, they cut down{H1504}{(H8799)} wood{H6086}."
2 Kings,6,5,"But as one{H259} was felling{H5307}{(H8688)} a beam{H6982}, the axe head{H1270} fell{H5307}{(H8804)} into the water{H4325}: and he cried{H6817}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Alas{H162}, master{H113}! for it was borrowed{H7592}{(H8803)}."
2 Kings,6,6,"And the man{H376} of God{H430} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Where{H575} fell{H5307}{(H8804)} it? And he shewed{H7200}{(H8686)} him the place{H4725}. And he cut down{H7094}{(H8799)} a stick{H6086}, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} it in thither; and the iron{H1270} did swim{H6687}{(H8686)}."
2 Kings,6,7,"Therefore said{H559}{(H8799)} he, Take it up{H7311}{(H8685)} to thee. And he put out{H7971}{(H8799)} his hand{H3027}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} it."
2 Kings,6,8,"Then the king{H4428} of Syria{H758} warred{H3898}{(H8737)} against Israel{H3478}, and took counsel{H3289}{(H8735)} with his servants{H5650}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, In such{H6423} and such{H492} a place{H4725} shall be my camp{H8466}."
2 Kings,6,9,"And the man{H376} of God{H430} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Beware{H8104}{(H8734)} that thou pass{H5674}{(H8800)} not such{H2088} a place{H4725}; for thither the Syrians{H758} are come down{H5185}."
2 Kings,6,10,"And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to the place{H4725} which the man{H376} of God{H430} told{H559}{(H8804)} him and warned{H2094}{(H8689)} him of, and saved{H8104}{(H8738)} himself there, not once{H259} nor twice{H8147}."
2 Kings,6,11,"Therefore the heart{H3820} of the king{H4428} of Syria{H758} was sore troubled{H5590}{(H8735)} for this thing{H1697}; and he called{H7121}{(H8799)} his servants{H5650}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Will ye not shew{H5046}{(H8686)} me which of us is for the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}?"
2 Kings,6,12,"And one{H259} of his servants{H5650} said{H559}{(H8799)}, None, my lord{H113}, O king{H4428}: but Elisha{H477}, the prophet{H5030} that is in Israel{H3478}, telleth{H5046}{(H8686)} the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} the words{H1697} that thou speakest{H1696}{(H8762)} in thy bedchamber{H2315}{H4904}."
2 Kings,6,13,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} and spy{H7200}{(H8798)} where{H351} he is, that I may send{H7971}{(H8799)} and fetch{H3947}{(H8799)} him. And it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, he is in Dothan{H1886}."
2 Kings,6,14,"Therefore sent{H7971}{(H8799)} he thither horses{H5483}, and chariots{H7393}, and a great{H3515} host{H2428}: and they came{H935}{(H8799)} by night{H3915}, and compassed{H5362} the city{H5892} about{H5362}{(H8686)}."
2 Kings,6,15,"And when the servant{H8334}{(H8764)} of the man{H376} of God{H430} was risen{H6965}{(H8800)} early{H7925}{(H8686)}, and gone forth{H3318}{(H8799)}, behold, an host{H2428} compassed{H5437}{(H8802)} the city{H5892} both with horses{H5483} and chariots{H7393}. And his servant{H5288} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Alas{H162}, my master{H113}! how shall we do{H6213}{(H8799)}?"
2 Kings,6,16,"And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not: for they that be with us are more{H7227} than they that be with them."
2 Kings,6,17,"And Elisha{H477} prayed{H6419}{(H8691)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, LORD{H3068}, I pray thee, open{H6491}{(H8798)} his eyes{H5869}, that he may see{H7200}{(H8799)}. And the LORD{H3068} opened{H6491}{(H8799)} the eyes{H5869} of the young man{H5288}; and he saw{H7200}{(H8799)}: and, behold, the mountain{H2022} was full{H4390}{(H8804)} of horses{H5483} and chariots{H7393} of fire{H784} round about{H5439} Elisha{H477}."
2 Kings,6,18,"And when they came down{H3381}{(H8799)} to him, Elisha{H477} prayed{H6419}{(H8691)} unto the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Smite{H5221}{(H8685)} this people{H1471}, I pray thee, with blindness{H5575}. And he smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them with blindness{H5575} according to the word{H1697} of Elisha{H477}."
2 Kings,6,19,"And Elisha{H477} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, This is not the way{H1870}, neither is this{H2090} the city{H5892}: follow{H3212}{(H8798)}{H310} me, and I will bring{H3212}{(H8686)} you to the man{H376} whom ye seek{H1245}{(H8762)}. But he led{H3212}{(H8686)} them to Samaria{H8111}."
2 Kings,6,20,"And it came to pass, when they were come{H935}{(H8800)} into Samaria{H8111}, that Elisha{H477} said{H559}{(H8799)}, LORD{H3068}, open{H6491}{(H8798)} the eyes{H5869} of these men, that they may see{H7200}{(H8799)}. And the LORD{H3068} opened{H6491}{(H8799)} their eyes{H5869}, and they saw{H7200}{(H8799)}; and, behold, they were in the midst{H8432} of Samaria{H8111}."
2 Kings,6,21,"And the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Elisha{H477}, when he saw{H7200}{(H8800)} them, My father{H1}, shall I smite{H5221}{(H8686)} them? shall I smite{H5221}{(H8686)} them?"
2 Kings,6,22,"And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou shalt not smite{H5221}{(H8686)} them: wouldest thou smite{H5221}{(H8688)} those whom thou hast taken captive{H7617}{(H8804)} with thy sword{H2719} and with thy bow{H7198}? set{H7760}{(H8798)} bread{H3899} and water{H4325} before{H6440} them, that they may eat{H398}{(H8799)} and drink{H8354}{(H8799)}, and go{H3212}{(H8799)} to their master{H113}."
2 Kings,6,23,"And he prepared{H3739}{(H8799)} great{H1419} provision{H3740} for them: and when they had eaten{H398}{(H8799)} and drunk{H8354}{(H8799)}, he sent them away{H7971}{(H8762)}, and they went{H3212}{(H8799)} to their master{H113}. So the bands{H1416} of Syria{H758} came{H935}{(H8800)} no more{H3254}{(H8804)} into the land{H776} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Kings,6,24,"And it came to pass after this{H310}, that Benhadad{H1130} king{H4428} of Syria{H758} gathered{H6908}{(H8799)} all his host{H4264}, and went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and besieged{H6696}{(H8799)} Samaria{H8111}."
2 Kings,6,25,"And there was a great{H1419} famine{H7458} in Samaria{H8111}: and, behold, they besieged{H6696}{(H8802)} it, until an ass's{H2543} head{H7218} was sold for fourscore{H8084} pieces of silver{H3701}, and the fourth part{H7255} of a cab{H6894} of dove's dung{H1686}{(H8675)}{H3123}{H2755} for five{H2568} pieces of silver{H3701}."
2 Kings,6,26,"And as the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} was passing by{H5674}{(H8802)} upon the wall{H2346}, there cried{H6817}{(H8804)} a woman{H802} unto him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Help{H3467}{(H8685)}, my lord{H113}, O king{H4428}."
2 Kings,6,27,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, If the LORD{H3068} do not help{H3467}{(H8686)} thee, whence{H370} shall I help{H3467}{(H8686)} thee? out of the barnfloor{H1637}, or out of the winepress{H3342}?"
2 Kings,6,28,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered{H559}{(H8799)}, This woman{H802} said{H559}{(H8804)} unto me, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} thy son{H1121}, that we may eat{H398}{(H8799)} him to day{H3117}, and we will eat{H398}{(H8799)} my son{H1121} to morrow{H4279}."
2 Kings,6,29,"So we boiled{H1310}{(H8762)} my son{H1121}, and did eat{H398}{(H8799)} him: and I said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her on the next{H312} day{H3117}, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} thy son{H1121}, that we may eat{H398}{(H8799)} him: and she hath hid{H2244}{(H8686)} her son{H1121}."
2 Kings,6,30,"And it came to pass, when the king{H4428} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} the words{H1697} of the woman{H802}, that he rent{H7167}{(H8799)} his clothes{H899}; and he passed by{H5674}{(H8802)} upon the wall{H2346}, and the people{H5971} looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, behold, he had sackcloth{H8242} within{H1004} upon his flesh{H1320}."
2 Kings,6,31,"Then he said{H559}{(H8799)}, God{H430} do{H6213}{(H8799)} so and more{H3254}{(H8686)} also to me, if the head{H7218} of Elisha{H477} the son{H1121} of Shaphat{H8202} shall stand{H5975}{(H8799)} on him this day{H3117}."
2 Kings,6,32,"But Elisha{H477} sat{H3427}{(H8802)} in his house{H1004}, and the elders{H2205} sat{H3427}{(H8802)} with him; and the king sent{H7971}{(H8799)} a man{H376} from before{H6440} him: but ere the messenger{H4397} came{H935}{(H8799)} to him, he said{H559}{(H8804)} to the elders{H2205}, See{H7200}{(H8804)} ye how this son{H1121} of a murderer{H7523}{(H8764)} hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} to take away{H5493}{(H8687)} mine head{H7218}? look{H7200}{(H8798)}, when the messenger{H4397} cometh{H935}{(H8800)}, shut{H5462}{(H8798)} the door{H1817}, and hold him fast{H3905}{(H8804)} at the door{H1817}: is not the sound{H6963} of his master's{H113} feet{H7272} behind{H310} him?"
2 Kings,6,33,"And while he yet talked{H1696}{(H8764)} with them, behold, the messenger{H4397} came down{H3381}{(H8802)} unto him: and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, this evil{H7451} is of the LORD{H3068}; what should I wait{H3176}{(H8686)} for the LORD{H3068} any longer?"
2 Kings,7,1,"Then Elisha{H477} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} ye the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}; Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, To morrow{H4279} about this time{H6256} shall a measure{H5429} of fine flour{H5560} be sold for a shekel{H8255}, and two measures{H5429} of barley{H8184} for a shekel{H8255}, in the gate{H8179} of Samaria{H8111}."
2 Kings,7,2,"Then a lord{H7991} on whose hand{H3027} the king{H4428} leaned{H8172}{(H8737)} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the man{H376} of God{H430}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, if the LORD{H3068} would make{H6213}{(H8802)} windows{H699} in heaven{H8064}, might this thing{H1697} be? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, thou shalt see{H7200}{(H8802)} it with thine eyes{H5869}, but shalt not eat{H398}{(H8799)} thereof."
2 Kings,7,3,"And there were four{H702} leprous{H6879}{(H8794)} men{H582} at the entering in{H6607} of the gate{H8179}: and they said{H559}{(H8799)} one{H376} to another{H7453}, Why sit{H3427}{(H8802)} we here until we die{H4191}{(H8804)}?"
2 Kings,7,4,"If we say{H559}{(H8804)}, We will enter{H935}{(H8799)} into the city{H5892}, then the famine{H7458} is in the city{H5892}, and we shall die{H4191}{(H8804)} there: and if we sit still{H3427}{(H8804)} here, we die{H4191}{(H8804)} also. Now therefore come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and let us fall{H5307}{(H8799)} unto the host{H4264} of the Syrians{H758}: if they save us alive{H2421}{(H8762)}, we shall live{H2421}{(H8799)}; and if they kill{H4191}{(H8686)} us, we shall but die{H4191}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,7,5,"And they rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} in the twilight{H5399}, to go{H935}{(H8800)} unto the camp{H4264} of the Syrians{H758}: and when they were come{H935}{(H8799)} to the uttermost part{H7097} of the camp{H4264} of Syria{H758}, behold, there was no man{H376} there."
2 Kings,7,6,"For the Lord{H136} had made the host{H4264} of the Syrians{H758} to hear{H8085}{(H8689)} a noise{H6963} of chariots{H7393}, and a noise{H6963} of horses{H5483}, even the noise{H6963} of a great{H1419} host{H2428}: and they said{H559}{(H8799)} one{H376} to another{H251}, Lo, the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} hath hired{H7936}{(H8804)} against us the kings{H4428} of the Hittites{H2850}, and the kings{H4428} of the Egyptians{H4714}, to come{H935}{(H8800)} upon us."
2 Kings,7,7,"Wherefore they arose{H6965}{(H8799)} and fled{H5127}{(H8799)} in the twilight{H5399}, and left{H5800}{(H8799)} their tents{H168}, and their horses{H5483}, and their asses{H2543}, even the camp{H4264} as it was, and fled{H5127}{(H8799)} for their life{H5315}."
2 Kings,7,8,"And when these lepers{H6879}{(H8794)} came{H935}{(H8799)} to the uttermost part{H7097} of the camp{H4264}, they went{H935}{(H8799)} into one{H259} tent{H168}, and did eat{H398}{(H8799)} and drink{H8354}{(H8799)}, and carried{H5375}{(H8799)} thence silver{H3701}, and gold{H2091}, and raiment{H899}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} and hid{H2934}{(H8686)} it; and came again{H7725}{(H8799)}, and entered{H935}{(H8799)} into another{H312} tent{H168}, and carried{H5375}{(H8799)} thence also, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} and hid{H2934}{(H8686)} it."
2 Kings,7,9,"Then they said{H559}{(H8799)} one{H376} to another{H7453}, We do{H6213}{(H8802)} not well: this day{H3117} is a day{H3117} of good tidings{H1309}, and we hold our peace{H2814}{(H8688)}: if we tarry{H2442}{(H8765)} till the morning{H1242} light{H216}, some mischief{H5771} will come{H4672}{(H8804)} upon us: now therefore come{H3212}{(H8798)}, that we may go{H935}{(H8799)} and tell{H5046}{(H8686)} the king's{H4428} household{H1004}."
2 Kings,7,10,"So they came{H935}{(H8799)} and called{H7121}{(H8799)} unto the porter{H7778} of the city{H5892}: and they told{H5046}{(H8686)} them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, We came{H935}{(H8804)} to the camp{H4264} of the Syrians{H758}, and, behold, there was no man{H376} there, neither voice{H6963} of man{H120}, but horses{H5483} tied{H631}{(H8803)}, and asses{H2543} tied{H631}{(H8803)}, and the tents{H168} as they were."
2 Kings,7,11,And he called{H7121}{(H8799)} the porters{H7778}; and they told{H5046}{(H8686)} it to the king's{H4428} house{H1004} within{H6441}.
2 Kings,7,12,"And the king{H4428} arose{H6965}{(H8799)} in the night{H3915}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his servants{H5650}, I will now shew{H5046}{(H8686)} you what the Syrians{H758} have done{H6213}{(H8804)} to us. They know{H3045}{(H8804)} that we be hungry{H7457}; therefore are they gone out{H3318}{(H8799)} of the camp{H4264} to hide{H2247}{(H8736)} themselves in the field{H7704}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, When they come out{H3318}{(H8799)} of the city{H5892}, we shall catch{H8610}{(H8799)} them alive{H2416}, and get{H935}{(H8799)} into the city{H5892}."
2 Kings,7,13,"And one{H259} of his servants{H5650} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let some take{H3947}{(H8799)}, I pray thee, five{H2568} of the horses{H5483} that remain{H7604}{(H8737)}, which are left{H7604}{(H8738)} in the city,(behold, they are as all the multitude{H1995} of Israel{H3478} that are left{H7604}{(H8738)} in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude{H1995} of the Israelites{H3478} that are consumed{H8552}{(H8804)}:) and let us send{H7971}{(H8799)} and see{H7200}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,7,14,"They took{H3947}{(H8799)} therefore two{H8147} chariot{H7393} horses{H5483}; and the king{H4428} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} after{H310} the host{H4264} of the Syrians{H758}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} and see{H7200}{(H8798)}."
2 Kings,7,15,"And they went{H3212}{(H8799)} after{H310} them unto Jordan{H3383}: and, lo, all the way{H1870} was full{H4392} of garments{H899} and vessels{H3627}, which the Syrians{H758} had cast away{H7993}{(H8689)} in their haste{H2648}{(H8800)}. And the messengers{H4397} returned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} the king{H4428}."
2 Kings,7,16,"And the people{H5971} went out{H3318}{(H8799)}, and spoiled{H962}{(H8799)} the tents{H4264} of the Syrians{H758}. So a measure{H5429} of fine flour{H5560} was sold for a shekel{H8255}, and two measures{H5429} of barley{H8184} for a shekel{H8255}, according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,7,17,"And the king{H4428} appointed{H6485}{(H8689)} the lord{H7991} on whose hand{H3027} he leaned{H8172}{(H8737)} to have the charge of the gate{H8179}: and the people{H5971} trode{H7429}{(H8799)} upon him in the gate{H8179}, and he died{H4191}{(H8799)}, as the man{H376} of God{H430} had said{H1696}{(H8765)}, who spake{H1696}{(H8765)} when the king{H4428} came down{H3381}{(H8800)} to him."
2 Kings,7,18,"And it came to pass as the man{H376} of God{H430} had spoken{H1696}{(H8763)} to the king{H4428}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Two measures{H5429} of barley{H8184} for a shekel{H8255}, and a measure{H5429} of fine flour{H5560} for a shekel{H8255}, shall be to morrow{H4279} about this time{H6256} in the gate{H8179} of Samaria{H8111}:"
2 Kings,7,19,"And that lord{H7991} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the man{H376} of God{H430}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Now, behold, if the LORD{H3068} should make{H6213}{(H8802)} windows{H699} in heaven{H8064}, might such a thing{H1697} be? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, thou shalt see{H7200}{(H8802)} it with thine eyes{H5869}, but shalt not eat{H398}{(H8799)} thereof."
2 Kings,7,20,"And so it fell out unto him: for the people{H5971} trode{H7429}{(H8799)} upon him in the gate{H8179}, and he died{H4191}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,8,1,"Then spake{H1696}{(H8765)} Elisha{H477} unto the woman{H802}, whose son{H1121} he had restored to life{H2421}{(H8689)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, and go{H3212}{(H8798)} thou and thine household{H1004}, and sojourn{H1481}{(H8798)} wheresoever{H834} thou canst sojourn{H1481}{(H8799)}: for the LORD{H3068} hath called{H7121}{(H8804)} for a famine{H7458}; and it shall also come{H935}{(H8804)} upon the land{H776} seven{H7651} years{H8141}."
2 Kings,8,2,"And the woman{H802} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and did{H6213}{(H8799)} after the saying{H1697} of the man{H376} of God{H430}: and she went{H3212}{(H8799)} with her household{H1004}, and sojourned{H1481}{(H8799)} in the land{H776} of the Philistines{H6430} seven{H7651} years{H8141}."
2 Kings,8,3,"And it came to pass at the seven{H7651} years{H8141}' end{H7097}, that the woman{H802} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} out of the land{H776} of the Philistines{H6430}: and she went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} to cry{H6817}{(H8800)} unto the king{H4428} for her house{H1004} and for her land{H7704}."
2 Kings,8,4,"And the king{H4428} talked{H1696}{(H8764)} with Gehazi{H1522} the servant{H5288} of the man{H376} of God{H430}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Tell{H5608}{(H8761)} me, I pray thee, all the great things{H1419} that Elisha{H477} hath done{H6213}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,8,5,"And it came to pass, as he was telling{H5608}{(H8764)} the king{H4428} how he had restored{H2421} a dead body{H4191}{(H8801)} to life{H2421}{(H8689)}, that, behold, the woman{H802}, whose son{H1121} he had restored to life{H2421}{(H8689)}, cried{H6817}{(H8802)} to the king{H4428} for her house{H1004} and for her land{H7704}. And Gehazi{H1522} said{H559}{(H8799)}, My lord{H113}, O king{H4428}, this is the woman{H802}, and this is her son{H1121}, whom Elisha{H477} restored to life{H2421}{(H8689)}."
2 Kings,8,6,"And when the king{H4428} asked{H7592}{(H8799)} the woman{H802}, she told{H5608}{(H8762)} him. So the king{H4428} appointed{H5414}{(H8799)} unto her a certain{H259} officer{H5631}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Restore{H7725}{(H8685)} all that was hers, and all the fruits{H8393} of the field{H7704} since the day{H3117} that she left{H5800}{(H8800)} the land{H776}, even until now."
2 Kings,8,7,"And Elisha{H477} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Damascus{H1834}; and Benhadad{H1130} the king{H4428} of Syria{H758} was sick{H2470}{(H8802)}; and it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The man{H376} of God{H430} is come{H935}{(H8804)} hither{H2008}."
2 Kings,8,8,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Hazael{H2371}, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} a present{H4503} in thine hand{H3027}, and go{H3212}{(H8798)}, meet{H7125}{(H8800)} the man{H376} of God{H430}, and enquire{H1875}{(H8804)} of the LORD{H3068} by him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Shall I recover{H2421}{(H8799)} of this disease{H2483}?"
2 Kings,8,9,"So Hazael{H2371} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} him, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} a present{H4503} with him{H3027}, even of every good thing{H2898} of Damascus{H1834}, forty{H705} camels{H1581}' burden{H4853}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thy son{H1121} Benhadad{H1130} king{H4428} of Syria{H758} hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} me to thee, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Shall I recover{H2421}{(H8799)} of this disease{H2483}?"
2 Kings,8,10,"And Elisha{H477} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, say{H559}{(H8798)} unto him, Thou mayest certainly{H2421}{(H8800)} recover{H2421}{(H8799)}: howbeit the LORD{H3068} hath shewed{H7200}{(H8689)} me that he shall surely{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,8,11,"And he settled{H5975}{(H8686)} his countenance{H6440} stedfastly{H7760}{(H8799)}, until he was ashamed{H954}{(H8800)}: and the man{H376} of God{H430} wept{H1058}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,8,12,"And Hazael{H2371} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Why weepeth{H1058}{(H8802)} my lord{H113}? And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Because I know{H3045}{(H8804)} the evil{H7451} that thou wilt do{H6213}{(H8799)} unto the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}: their strong holds{H4013} wilt thou set{H7971}{(H8762)} on fire{H784}, and their young men{H970} wilt thou slay{H2026}{(H8799)} with the sword{H2719}, and wilt dash{H7376}{(H8762)} their children{H5768}, and rip up{H1234}{(H8762)} their women with child{H2030}."
2 Kings,8,13,"And Hazael{H2371} said{H559}{(H8799)}, But what, is thy servant{H5650} a dog{H3611}, that he should do{H6213}{(H8799)} this great{H1419} thing{H1697}? And Elisha{H477} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, The LORD{H3068} hath shewed{H7200}{(H8689)} me that thou shalt be king{H4428} over Syria{H758}."
2 Kings,8,14,"So he departed{H3212}{(H8799)} from Elisha{H477}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to his master{H113}; who said{H559}{(H8799)} to him, What said{H559}{(H8804)} Elisha{H477} to thee? And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, He told{H559}{(H8804)} me that thou shouldest surely{H2421}{(H8800)} recover{H2421}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,8,15,"And it came to pass on the morrow{H4283}, that he took{H3947}{(H8799)} a thick cloth{H4346}, and dipped{H2881}{(H8799)} it in water{H4325}, and spread{H6566}{(H8799)} it on his face{H6440}, so that he died{H4191}{(H8799)}: and Hazael{H2371} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead."
2 Kings,8,16,"And in the fifth{H2568} year{H8141} of Joram{H3141} the son{H1121} of Ahab{H256} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, Jehoshaphat{H3092} being then king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, Jehoram{H3088} the son{H1121} of Jehoshaphat{H3092} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} began to reign{H4427}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,8,17,Thirty{H7970} and two{H8147} years{H8141} old{H1121} was he when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}; and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} eight{H8083} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}.
2 Kings,8,18,"And he walked{H3212}{(H8799)} in the way{H1870} of the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, as did{H6213}{(H8804)} the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256}: for the daughter{H1323} of Ahab{H256} was his wife{H802}: and he did{H6213}{(H8799)} evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,8,19,"Yet the LORD{H3068} would{H14}{(H8804)} not destroy{H7843}{(H8687)} Judah{H3063} for David{H1732} his servant's{H5650} sake, as he promised{H559}{(H8804)} him to give{H5414}{(H8800)} him alway{H3117} a light{H5216}, and to his children{H1121}."
2 Kings,8,20,"In his days{H3117} Edom{H123} revolted{H6586}{(H8804)} from under the hand{H3027} of Judah{H3063}, and made{H4427}{(H8686)} a king{H4428} over themselves."
2 Kings,8,21,"So Joram{H3141} went over{H5674}{(H8799)} to Zair{H6811}, and all the chariots{H7393} with him: and he rose{H6965}{(H8804)} by night{H3915}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the Edomites{H123} which compassed him about{H5437}{(H8802)}, and the captains{H8269} of the chariots{H7393}: and the people{H5971} fled{H5127}{(H8799)} into their tents{H168}."
2 Kings,8,22,Yet Edom{H123} revolted{H6586}{(H8799)} from under the hand{H3027} of Judah{H3063} unto this day{H3117}. Then Libnah{H3841} revolted{H6586}{(H8799)} at the same{H1931} time{H6256}.
2 Kings,8,23,"And the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Joram{H3141}, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}?"
2 Kings,8,24,"And Joram{H3141} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} with his fathers{H1} in the city{H5892} of David{H1732}: and Ahaziah{H274} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead."
2 Kings,8,25,In the twelfth{H8147}{H6240}{H8141} year{H8141} of Joram{H3141} the son{H1121} of Ahab{H256} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} did Ahaziah{H274} the son{H1121} of Jehoram{H3088} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} begin to reign{H4427}{(H8804)}.
2 Kings,8,26,"Two{H8147} and twenty{H6242} years{H8141} old{H1121} was Ahaziah{H274} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}; and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} one{H259} year{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Athaliah{H6271}, the daughter{H1323} of Omri{H6018} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Kings,8,27,"And he walked{H3212}{(H8799)} in the way{H1870} of the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256}, and did{H6213}{(H8799)} evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, as did the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256}: for he was the son in law{H2860} of the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256}."
2 Kings,8,28,And he went{H3212}{(H8799)} with Joram{H3141} the son{H1121} of Ahab{H256} to the war{H4421} against Hazael{H2371} king{H4428} of Syria{H758} in Ramothgilead{H7433}{H1568}; and the Syrians{H761} wounded{H5221}{(H8686)} Joram{H3141}.
2 Kings,8,29,"And king{H4428} Joram{H3141} went back{H7725}{(H8799)} to be healed{H7495}{(H8692)} in Jezreel{H3157} of the wounds{H4347} which the Syrians{H761} had given{H5221}{(H8686)} him at Ramah{H7414}, when he fought{H3898}{(H8736)} against Hazael{H2371} king{H4428} of Syria{H758}. And Ahaziah{H274} the son{H1121} of Jehoram{H3088} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} went down{H3381}{(H8804)} to see{H7200}{(H8800)} Joram{H3141} the son{H1121} of Ahab{H256} in Jezreel{H3157}, because he was sick{H2470}{(H8802)}."
2 Kings,9,1,"And Elisha{H477} the prophet{H5030} called{H7121}{(H8804)} one{H259} of the children{H1121} of the prophets{H5030}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Gird up{H2296}{(H8798)} thy loins{H4975}, and take{H3947}{(H8798)} this box{H6378} of oil{H8081} in thine hand{H3027}, and go{H3212}{(H8798)} to Ramothgilead{H7433}{H1568}:"
2 Kings,9,2,"And when thou comest{H935}{(H8804)} thither, look out{H7200}{(H8798)} there Jehu{H3058} the son{H1121} of Jehoshaphat{H3092} the son{H1121} of Nimshi{H5250}, and go in{H935}{(H8804)}, and make him arise up{H6965}{(H8689)} from among{H8432} his brethren{H251}, and carry{H935}{(H8689)} him to an inner{H2315} chamber{H2315};"
2 Kings,9,3,"Then take{H3947}{(H8804)} the box{H6378} of oil{H8081}, and pour{H3332}{(H8804)} it on his head{H7218}, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, I have anointed{H4886}{(H8804)} thee king{H4428} over Israel{H3478}. Then open{H6605}{(H8804)} the door{H1817}, and flee{H5127}{(H8804)}, and tarry{H2442}{(H8762)} not."
2 Kings,9,4,"So the young man{H5288}, even the young man{H5288} the prophet{H5030}, went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Ramothgilead{H7433}{H1568}."
2 Kings,9,5,"And when he came{H935}{(H8799)}, behold, the captains{H8269} of the host{H2428} were sitting{H3427}{(H8802)}; and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I have an errand{H1697} to thee, O captain{H8269}. And Jehu{H3058} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Unto which of all us? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, To thee, O captain{H8269}."
2 Kings,9,6,"And he arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H935}{(H8799)} into the house{H1004}; and he poured{H3332}{(H8799)} the oil{H8081} on his head{H7218}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, I have anointed{H4886}{(H8804)} thee king{H4428} over the people{H5971} of the LORD{H3068}, even over Israel{H3478}."
2 Kings,9,7,"And thou shalt smite{H5221}{(H8689)} the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256} thy master{H113}, that I may avenge{H5358}{(H8765)} the blood{H1818} of my servants{H5650} the prophets{H5030}, and the blood{H1818} of all the servants{H5650} of the LORD{H3068}, at the hand{H3027} of Jezebel{H348}."
2 Kings,9,8,"For the whole house{H1004} of Ahab{H256} shall perish{H6}{(H8804)}: and I will cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} from Ahab{H256} him that pisseth{H8366}{(H8688)} against the wall{H7023}, and him that is shut up{H6113}{(H8803)} and left{H5800}{(H8803)} in Israel{H3478}:"
2 Kings,9,9,"And I will make{H5414}{(H8804)} the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256} like the house{H1004} of Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Nebat{H5028}, and like the house{H1004} of Baasha{H1201} the son{H1121} of Ahijah{H281}:"
2 Kings,9,10,"And the dogs{H3611} shall eat{H398}{(H8799)} Jezebel{H348} in the portion{H2506} of Jezreel{H3157}, and there shall be none to bury{H6912}{(H8802)} her. And he opened{H6605}{(H8799)} the door{H1817}, and fled{H5127}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,9,11,"Then Jehu{H3058} came forth{H3318}{(H8804)} to the servants{H5650} of his lord{H113}: and one said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Is all well{H7965}? wherefore came{H935}{(H8804)} this mad{H7696}{(H8794)} fellow to thee? And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Ye know{H3045}{(H8804)} the man{H376}, and his communication{H7879}."
2 Kings,9,12,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, It is false{H8267}; tell{H5046}{(H8685)} us now. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thus and thus spake{H559}{(H8804)} he to me, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, I have anointed{H4886}{(H8804)} thee king{H4428} over Israel{H3478}."
2 Kings,9,13,"Then they hasted{H4116}{(H8762)}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} every man{H376} his garment{H899}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} it under him on the top{H1634} of the stairs{H4609}, and blew{H8628}{(H8799)} with trumpets{H7782}, saying{H559}{(H8799)}, Jehu{H3058} is king{H4427}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,9,14,"So Jehu{H3058} the son{H1121} of Jehoshaphat{H3092} the son{H1121} of Nimshi{H5250} conspired{H7194}{(H8691)} against Joram{H3141}.(Now Joram{H3141} had kept{H8104}{(H8802)} Ramothgilead{H7433}{H1568}, he and all Israel{H3478}, because{H6440} of Hazael{H2371} king{H4428} of Syria{H758}."
2 Kings,9,15,"But king{H4428} Joram{H3088} was returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to be healed{H7495}{(H8692)} in Jezreel{H3157} of the wounds{H4347} which the Syrians{H761} had given{H5221}{(H8686)} him, when he fought{H3898}{(H8736)} with Hazael{H2371} king{H4428} of Syria{H758}.) And Jehu{H3058} said{H559}{(H8799)}, If it be{H3426} your minds{H5315}, then let none{H408} go forth{H3318}{(H8799)} nor escape{H6412} out of the city{H5892} to go{H3212}{(H8800)} to tell{H5046}{(H8687)} it in Jezreel{H3157}."
2 Kings,9,16,"So Jehu{H3058} rode in a chariot{H7392}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Jezreel{H3157}; for Joram{H3141} lay{H7901}{(H8802)} there. And Ahaziah{H274} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} was come down{H3381}{(H8804)} to see{H7200}{(H8800)} Joram{H3141}."
2 Kings,9,17,"And there stood{H5975}{(H8802)} a watchman{H6822}{(H8802)} on the tower{H4026} in Jezreel{H3157}, and he spied{H7200}{(H8799)} the company{H8229} of Jehu{H3058} as he came{H935}{(H8800)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, I see{H7200}{(H8802)} a company{H8229}. And Joram{H3088} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} an horseman{H7395}, and send{H7971}{(H8798)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} them, and let him say{H559}{(H8799)}, Is it peace{H7965}?"
2 Kings,9,18,"So there went{H3212}{(H8799)} one on horseback{H7392}{(H8802)}{H5483} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the king{H4428}, Is it peace{H7965}? And Jehu{H3058} said{H559}{(H8799)}, What hast thou to do with peace{H7965}? turn{H5437}{(H8798)} thee behind{H310} me. And the watchman{H6822}{(H8802)} told{H5046}{(H8686)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The messenger{H4397} came{H935}{(H8804)} to them, but he cometh not again{H7725}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,9,19,"Then he sent out{H7971}{(H8799)} a second{H8145} on horseback{H7392}{(H8802)}{H5483}, which came{H935}{(H8799)} to them, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the king{H4428}, Is it peace{H7965}? And Jehu{H3058} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, What hast thou to do with peace{H7965}? turn{H5437}{(H8798)} thee behind{H310} me."
2 Kings,9,20,"And the watchman{H6822}{(H8802)} told{H5046}{(H8686)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, He came{H935}{(H8804)} even unto them, and cometh not again{H7725}{(H8804)}: and the driving{H4491} is like the driving{H4491} of Jehu{H3058} the son{H1121} of Nimshi{H5250}; for he driveth{H5090}{(H8799)} furiously{H7697}."
2 Kings,9,21,"And Joram{H3088} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Make ready{H631}{(H8798)}. And his chariot{H7393} was made ready{H631}{(H8799)}. And Joram{H3088} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} and Ahaziah{H274} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} went out{H3318}{(H8799)}, each{H376} in his chariot{H7393}, and they went out{H3318}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} Jehu{H3058}, and met{H4672}{(H8799)} him in the portion{H2513} of Naboth{H5022} the Jezreelite{H3158}."
2 Kings,9,22,"And it came to pass, when Joram{H3088} saw{H7200}{(H8800)} Jehu{H3058}, that he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is it peace{H7965}, Jehu{H3058}? And he answered{H559}{(H8799)}, What peace{H7965}, so long as{H5704} the whoredoms{H2183} of thy mother{H517} Jezebel{H348} and her witchcrafts{H3785} are so many{H7227}?"
2 Kings,9,23,"And Joram{H3088} turned{H2015}{(H8799)} his hands{H3027}, and fled{H5127}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} to Ahaziah{H274}, There is treachery{H4820}, O Ahaziah{H274}."
2 Kings,9,24,"And Jehu{H3058} drew a bow{H7198} with his full{H4390}{(H8765)} strength{H3027}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} Jehoram{H3088} between his arms{H2220}, and the arrow{H2678} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} at his heart{H3820}, and he sunk down{H3766}{(H8799)} in his chariot{H7393}."
2 Kings,9,25,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Jehu to Bidkar{H920} his captain{H7991}, Take up{H5375}{(H8798)}, and cast{H7993}{(H8685)} him in the portion{H2513} of the field{H7704} of Naboth{H5022} the Jezreelite{H3158}: for remember{H2142}{(H8798)} how that, when I and thou rode{H7392}{(H8802)} together{H6776} after{H310} Ahab{H256} his father{H1}, the LORD{H3068} laid{H5375}{(H8804)} this burden{H4853} upon him;"
2 Kings,9,26,"Surely I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} yesterday{H570} the blood{H1818} of Naboth{H5022}, and the blood{H1818} of his sons{H1121}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}; and I will requite{H7999}{(H8765)} thee in this plat{H2513}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}. Now therefore take{H5375}{(H8798)} and cast{H7993}{(H8685)} him into the plat{H2513} of ground, according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,9,27,"But when Ahaziah{H274} the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} saw{H7200}{(H8804)} this, he fled{H5127}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870} of the garden{H1588} house{H1004}. And Jehu{H3058} followed{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Smite{H5221}{(H8685)} him also in the chariot{H4818}. And they did so at the going up{H4608} to Gur{H1483}, which is by Ibleam{H2991}. And he fled{H5127}{(H8799)} to Megiddo{H4023}, and died{H4191}{(H8799)} there."
2 Kings,9,28,"And his servants{H5650} carried{H7392}{(H8686)} him in a chariot to Jerusalem{H3389}, and buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him in his sepulchre{H6900} with his fathers{H1} in the city{H5892} of David{H1732}."
2 Kings,9,29,And in the eleventh{H259}{H6240}{H8141} year{H8141} of Joram{H3141} the son{H1121} of Ahab{H256} began Ahaziah{H274} to reign{H4427}{(H8804)} over Judah{H3063}.
2 Kings,9,30,"And when Jehu{H3058} was come{H935}{(H8799)} to Jezreel{H3157}, Jezebel{H348} heard{H8085}{(H8804)} of it; and she painted{H7760}{(H8799)}{H6320} her face{H5869}, and tired{H3190}{(H8686)} her head{H7218}, and looked out{H8259}{(H8686)} at a window{H2474}."
2 Kings,9,31,"And as Jehu{H3058} entered in{H935}{(H8804)} at the gate{H8179}, she said{H559}{(H8799)}, Had Zimri{H2174} peace{H7965}, who slew{H2026}{(H8802)} his master{H113}?"
2 Kings,9,32,"And he lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} his face{H6440} to the window{H2474}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out{H8259}{(H8686)} to him two{H8147} or three{H7969} eunuchs{H5631}."
2 Kings,9,33,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Throw her down{H8058}{(H8798)}. So they threw her down{H8058}{(H8799)}: and some of her blood{H1818} was sprinkled{H5137}{(H8799)} on the wall{H7023}, and on the horses{H5483}: and he trode her under foot{H7429}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,9,34,"And when he was come in{H935}{(H8799)}, he did eat{H398}{(H8799)} and drink{H8354}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go{H6485}{(H8798)}, see now this cursed{H779}{(H8803)} woman, and bury{H6912}{(H8798)} her: for she is a king's{H4428} daughter{H1323}."
2 Kings,9,35,"And they went{H3212}{(H8799)} to bury{H6912}{(H8800)} her: but they found{H4672}{(H8804)} no more of her than{H518} the skull{H1538}, and the feet{H7272}, and the palms{H3709} of her hands{H3027}."
2 Kings,9,36,"Wherefore they came again{H7725}{(H8799)}, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} him. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, This is the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} by{H3027} his servant{H5650} Elijah{H452} the Tishbite{H8664}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, In the portion{H2506} of Jezreel{H3157} shall dogs{H3611} eat{H398}{(H8799)} the flesh{H1320} of Jezebel{H348}:"
2 Kings,9,37,"And the carcase{H5038} of Jezebel{H348} shall be as dung{H1828} upon the face{H6440} of the field{H7704} in the portion{H2506} of Jezreel{H3157}; so that they shall not say{H559}{(H8799)}, This is Jezebel{H348}."
2 Kings,10,1,"And Ahab{H256} had seventy{H7657} sons{H1121} in Samaria{H8111}. And Jehu{H3058} wrote{H3789}{(H8799)} letters{H5612}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Samaria{H8111}, unto the rulers{H8269} of Jezreel{H3157}, to the elders{H2205}, and to them that brought up{H539}{(H8802)} Ahab's{H256} children, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
2 Kings,10,2,"Now as soon as this letter{H5612} cometh{H935}{(H8800)} to you, seeing your master's{H113} sons{H1121} are with you, and there are with you chariots{H7393} and horses{H5483}, a fenced{H4013} city{H5892} also, and armour{H5402};"
2 Kings,10,3,"Look even out{H7200}{(H8804)} the best{H2896} and meetest{H3477} of your master's{H113} sons{H1121}, and set{H7760}{(H8804)} him on his father's{H1} throne{H3678}, and fight{H3898}{(H8734)} for your master's{H113} house{H1004}."
2 Kings,10,4,"But they were exceedingly{H3966}{H3966} afraid{H3372}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, two{H8147} kings{H4428} stood{H5975}{(H8804)} not before{H6440} him: how then shall we stand{H5975}{(H8799)}?"
2 Kings,10,5,"And he that was over the house{H1004}, and he that was over the city{H5892}, the elders{H2205} also, and the bringers up{H539}{(H8802)} of the children, sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Jehu{H3058}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, We are thy servants{H5650}, and will do{H6213}{(H8799)} all that thou shalt bid{H559}{(H8799)} us; we will not make any{H376} king{H4427}{(H8686)}: do{H6213}{(H8798)} thou that which is good{H2896} in thine eyes{H5869}."
2 Kings,10,6,"Then he wrote{H3789}{(H8799)} a letter{H5612} the second time{H8145} to them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken{H8085}{(H8802)} unto my voice{H6963}, take{H3947}{(H8798)} ye the heads{H7218} of the men{H582} your master's{H113} sons{H1121}, and come{H935}{(H8798)} to me to Jezreel{H3157} by to morrow{H4279} this time{H6256}. Now the king's{H4428} sons{H1121}, being seventy{H7657} persons{H376}, were with the great men{H1419} of the city{H5892}, which brought them up{H1431}{(H8764)}."
2 Kings,10,7,"And it came to pass, when the letter{H5612} came{H935}{(H8800)} to them, that they took{H3947}{(H8799)} the king's{H4428} sons{H1121}, and slew{H7819}{(H8799)} seventy{H7657} persons{H376}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} their heads{H7218} in baskets{H1731}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} him them to Jezreel{H3157}."
2 Kings,10,8,"And there came{H935}{(H8799)} a messenger{H4397}, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, They have brought{H935}{(H8689)} the heads{H7218} of the king's{H4428} sons{H1121}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Lay{H7760}{(H8798)} ye them in two{H8147} heaps{H6652} at the entering in{H6607} of the gate{H8179} until the morning{H1242}."
2 Kings,10,9,"And it came to pass in the morning{H1242}, that he went out{H3318}{(H8799)}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} to all the people{H5971}, Ye be righteous{H6662}: behold, I conspired{H7194}{(H8804)} against my master{H113}, and slew{H2026}{(H8799)} him: but who slew{H5221}{(H8689)} all these?"
2 Kings,10,10,"Know{H3045}{(H8798)} now{H645} that there shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)} unto the earth{H776} nothing of the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, which the LORD{H3068} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} concerning the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256}: for the LORD{H3068} hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} that which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} by{H3027} his servant{H5650} Elijah{H452}."
2 Kings,10,11,"So Jehu{H3058} slew{H5221}{(H8686)} all that remained{H7604}{(H8737)} of the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256} in Jezreel{H3157}, and all his great men{H1419}, and his kinsfolks{H3045}{(H8794)}, and his priests{H3548}, until he left{H7604}{(H8689)} him none remaining{H8300}."
2 Kings,10,12,"And he arose{H6965}{(H8799)} and departed{H935}{(H8799)}, and came{H3212}{(H8799)} to Samaria{H8111}. And as he was at the shearing{H7462}{(H8802)} house{H1004}{(H8677)}{H1044} in the way{H1870},"
2 Kings,10,13,"Jehu{H3058} met{H4672}{(H8804)} with the brethren{H251} of Ahaziah{H274} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who are ye? And they answered{H559}{(H8799)}, We are the brethren{H251} of Ahaziah{H274}; and we go down{H3381}{(H8799)} to salute{H7965} the children{H1121} of the king{H4428} and the children{H1121} of the queen{H1377}."
2 Kings,10,14,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Take{H8610}{(H8798)} them alive{H2416}. And they took{H8610}{(H8799)} them alive{H2416}, and slew{H7819}{(H8799)} them at the pit{H953} of the shearing house{H1044}, even two{H8147} and forty{H705} men{H376}; neither left{H7604}{(H8689)} he any{H376} of them."
2 Kings,10,15,"And when he was departed{H3212}{(H8799)} thence, he lighted{H4672}{(H8799)} on Jehonadab{H3082} the son{H1121} of Rechab{H7394} coming to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} him: and he saluted{H1288}{(H8762)} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)} to him, Is{H3426} thine heart{H3824} right{H3477}, as my heart{H3824} is with thy heart{H3824}? And Jehonadab{H3082} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, It is{H3426}. If it be, give{H5414}{(H8798)} me thine hand{H3027}. And he gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him his hand{H3027}; and he took him up{H5927}{(H8686)} to him into the chariot{H4818}."
2 Kings,10,16,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)} with me, and see{H7200}{(H8798)} my zeal{H7068} for the LORD{H3068}. So they made him ride{H7392}{(H8686)} in his chariot{H7393}."
2 Kings,10,17,"And when he came{H935}{(H8799)} to Samaria{H8111}, he slew{H5221}{(H8686)} all that remained{H7604}{(H8737)} unto Ahab{H256} in Samaria{H8111}, till he had destroyed{H8045}{(H8689)} him, according to the saying{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} to Elijah{H452}."
2 Kings,10,18,"And Jehu{H3058} gathered{H6908} all the people{H5971} together{H6908}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Ahab{H256} served{H5647}{(H8804)} Baal{H1168} a little{H4592}; but Jehu{H3058} shall serve{H5647}{(H8799)} him much{H7235}{(H8687)}."
2 Kings,10,19,"Now therefore call{H7121}{(H8798)} unto me all the prophets{H5030} of Baal{H1168}, all his servants{H5647}{(H8802)}, and all his priests{H3548}; let none{H376} be wanting{H6485}{(H8735)}: for I have a great{H1419} sacrifice{H2077} to do to Baal{H1168}; whosoever shall be wanting{H6485}{(H8735)}, he shall not live{H2421}{(H8799)}. But Jehu{H3058} did{H6213}{(H8804)} it in subtilty{H6122}, to the intent that he might destroy{H6}{(H8687)} the worshippers{H5647}{(H8802)} of Baal{H1168}."
2 Kings,10,20,"And Jehu{H3058} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Proclaim{H6942}{(H8761)} a solemn assembly{H6116} for Baal{H1168}. And they proclaimed{H7121}{(H8799)} it."
2 Kings,10,21,"And Jehu{H3058} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} through all Israel{H3478}: and all the worshippers{H5647}{(H8802)} of Baal{H1168} came{H935}{(H8799)}, so that there was not a man{H376} left{H7604}{(H8738)} that came{H935}{(H8804)} not. And they came{H935}{(H8799)} into the house{H1004} of Baal{H1168}; and the house{H1004} of Baal{H1168} was full{H4390}{(H8735)} from one end{H6310} to another{H6310}."
2 Kings,10,22,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him that was over the vestry{H4458}, Bring forth{H3318}{(H8685)} vestments{H3830} for all the worshippers{H5647}{(H8802)} of Baal{H1168}. And he brought them forth{H3318}{(H8686)} vestments{H4403}."
2 Kings,10,23,"And Jehu{H3058} went{H935}{(H8799)}, and Jehonadab{H3082} the son{H1121} of Rechab{H7394}, into the house{H1004} of Baal{H1168}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the worshippers{H5647}{(H8802)} of Baal{H1168}, Search{H2664}{(H8761)}, and look{H7200}{(H8798)} that there be{H3426} here with you none of the servants{H5650} of the LORD{H3068}, but the worshippers{H5647}{(H8802)} of Baal{H1168} only."
2 Kings,10,24,"And when they went in{H935}{(H8799)} to offer{H6213}{(H8800)} sacrifices{H2077} and burnt offerings{H5930}, Jehu{H3058} appointed{H7760}{(H8804)} fourscore{H8084} men{H376} without{H2351}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, If any{H376} of the men{H582} whom I have brought{H935}{(H8688)} into your hands{H3027} escape{H4422}{(H8735)}, he that letteth him go, his life{H5315} shall be for the life{H5315} of him."
2 Kings,10,25,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end{H3615}{(H8763)} of offering{H6213}{(H8800)} the burnt offering{H5930}, that Jehu{H3058} said{H559}{(H8799)} to the guard{H7323}{(H8801)} and to the captains{H7991}, Go in{H935}{(H8798)}, and slay{H5221}{(H8685)} them; let none{H376} come forth{H3318}{(H8799)}. And they smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}; and the guard{H7323}{(H8801)} and the captains{H7991} cast them out{H7993}{(H8686)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to the city{H5892} of the house{H1004} of Baal{H1168}."
2 Kings,10,26,"And they brought forth{H3318}{(H8686)} the images{H4676} out of the house{H1004} of Baal{H1168}, and burned{H8313}{(H8799)} them."
2 Kings,10,27,"And they brake down{H5422}{(H8799)} the image{H4676} of Baal{H1168}, and brake down{H5422}{(H8799)} the house{H1004} of Baal{H1168}, and made{H7760}{(H8799)} it a draught house{H4163}{(H8675)}{H4280} unto this day{H3117}."
2 Kings,10,28,Thus Jehu{H3058} destroyed{H8045}{(H8686)} Baal{H1168} out of Israel{H3478}.
2 Kings,10,29,"Howbeit from the sins{H2399} of Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Nebat{H5028}, who made Israel{H3478} to sin{H2398}{(H8689)}, Jehu{H3058} departed{H5493}{(H8804)} not from after{H310} them, to wit, the golden{H2091} calves{H5695} that were in Bethel{H1008}, and that were in Dan{H1835}."
2 Kings,10,30,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jehu{H3058}, Because thou hast done well{H2895}{(H8689)} in executing{H6213}{(H8800)} that which is right{H3477} in mine eyes{H5869}, and hast done{H6213}{(H8804)} unto the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256} according to all that was in mine heart{H3824}, thy children{H1121} of the fourth{H7243} generation shall sit{H3427}{(H8799)} on the throne{H3678} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Kings,10,31,"But Jehu{H3058} took no heed{H8104}{(H8804)} to walk{H3212}{(H8800)} in the law{H8451} of the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} with all his heart{H3824}: for he departed{H5493}{(H8804)} not from the sins{H2403} of Jeroboam{H3379}, which made Israel{H3478} to sin{H2398}{(H8689)}."
2 Kings,10,32,In those days{H3117} the LORD{H3068} began{H2490}{(H8689)} to cut{H7096} Israel{H3478} short{H7096}{(H8763)}: and Hazael{H2371} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them in all the coasts{H1366} of Israel{H3478};
2 Kings,10,33,"From Jordan{H3383} eastward{H4217}{H8121}, all the land{H776} of Gilead{H1568}, the Gadites{H1425}, and the Reubenites{H7206}, and the Manassites{H4520}, from Aroer{H6177}, which is by the river{H5158} Arnon{H769}, even Gilead{H1568} and Bashan{H1316}."
2 Kings,10,34,"Now the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Jehu{H3058}, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, and all his might{H1369}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478}?"
2 Kings,10,35,And Jehu{H3058} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}: and they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him in Samaria{H8111}. And Jehoahaz{H3059} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead.
2 Kings,10,36,And the time{H3117} that Jehu{H3058} reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} over Israel{H3478} in Samaria{H8111} was twenty{H6242} and eight{H8083} years{H8141}.
2 Kings,11,1,"And when Athaliah{H6271} the mother{H517} of Ahaziah{H274} saw{H7200}{(H8804)} that her son{H1121} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, she arose{H6965}{(H8799)} and destroyed{H6}{(H8762)} all the seed{H2233} royal{H4467}."
2 Kings,11,2,"But Jehosheba{H3089}, the daughter{H1323} of king{H4428} Joram{H3141}, sister{H269} of Ahaziah{H274}, took{H3947}{(H8799)} Joash{H3101} the son{H1121} of Ahaziah{H274}, and stole{H1589}{(H8799)} him from among{H8432} the king's{H4428} sons{H1121} which were slain{H4191}{(H8716)}; and they hid{H5641}{(H8686)} him, even him and his nurse{H3243}{(H8688)}, in the bedchamber{H2315}{H4296} from{H6440} Athaliah{H6271}, so that he was not slain{H4191}{(H8717)}."
2 Kings,11,3,And he was with her hid{H2244}{(H8693)} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} six{H8337} years{H8141}. And Athaliah{H6271} did reign{H4427}{(H8802)} over the land{H776}.
2 Kings,11,4,"And the seventh{H7637} year{H8141} Jehoiada{H3077} sent{H7971}{(H8804)} and fetched{H3947}{(H8799)} the rulers{H8269} over hundreds{H3967}, with the captains{H3746} and the guard{H7323}{(H8801)}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} them to him into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and made{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285} with them, and took an oath{H7650}{(H8686)} of them in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and shewed{H7200}{(H8686)} them the king's{H4428} son{H1121}."
2 Kings,11,5,"And he commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, This is the thing{H1697} that ye shall do{H6213}{(H8799)}; A third part{H7992} of you that enter in{H935}{(H8802)} on the sabbath{H7676} shall even be keepers{H8104}{(H8802)} of the watch{H4931} of the king's{H4428} house{H1004};"
2 Kings,11,6,"And a third part{H7992} shall be at the gate{H8179} of Sur{H5495}; and a third part{H7992} at the gate{H8179} behind{H310} the guard{H7323}{(H8801)}: so shall ye keep{H8104}{(H8804)} the watch{H4931} of the house{H1004}, that it be not broken down{H4535}."
2 Kings,11,7,"And two{H8147} parts{H3027} of all you that go forth{H3318}{(H8802)} on the sabbath{H7676}, even they shall keep{H8104}{(H8804)} the watch{H4931} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} about{H413} the king{H4428}."
2 Kings,11,8,"And ye shall compass{H5362}{(H8689)} the king{H4428} round about{H5439}, every man{H376} with his weapons{H3627} in his hand{H3027}: and he that cometh{H935}{(H8802)} within the ranges{H7713}, let him be slain{H4191}{(H8714)}: and be ye with the king{H4428} as he goeth out{H3318}{(H8800)} and as he cometh in{H935}{(H8800)}."
2 Kings,11,9,"And the captains{H8269} over the hundreds{H3967} did{H6213}{(H8799)} according to all things that Jehoiada{H3077} the priest{H3548} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}: and they took{H3947}{(H8799)} every man{H376} his men{H582} that were to come in{H935}{(H8802)} on the sabbath{H7676}, with them that should go out{H3318}{(H8802)} on the sabbath{H7676}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jehoiada{H3077} the priest{H3548}."
2 Kings,11,10,"And to the captains{H8269} over hundreds{H3967} did the priest{H3548} give{H5414}{(H8799)} king{H4428} David's{H1732} spears{H2595} and shields{H7982}, that were in the temple{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,11,11,"And the guard{H7323}{(H8801)} stood{H5975}{(H8799)}, every man{H376} with his weapons{H3627} in his hand{H3027}, round about{H5439} the king{H4428}, from the right{H3233} corner{H3802} of the temple{H1004} to the left{H8042} corner{H3802} of the temple{H1004}, along by the altar{H4196} and the temple{H1004}."
2 Kings,11,12,"And he brought forth{H3318}{(H8686)} the king's{H4428} son{H1121}, and put{H5414}{(H8799)} the crown{H5145} upon him, and gave him the testimony{H5715}; and they made him king{H4427}{(H8686)}, and anointed{H4886}{(H8799)} him; and they clapped{H5221}{(H8686)} their hands{H3709}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, God save{H2421}{(H8799)} the king{H4428}."
2 Kings,11,13,"And when Athaliah{H6271} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} the noise{H6963} of the guard{H7323}{(H8801)} and of the people{H5971}, she came{H935}{(H8799)} to the people{H5971} into the temple{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,11,14,"And when she looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, behold, the king{H4428} stood{H5975}{(H8802)} by a pillar{H5982}, as the manner{H4941} was, and the princes{H8269} and the trumpeters{H2689} by the king{H4428}, and all the people{H5971} of the land{H776} rejoiced{H8056}, and blew{H8628}{(H8802)} with trumpets{H2689}: and Athaliah{H6271} rent{H7167}{(H8799)} her clothes{H899}, and cried{H7121}{(H8799)}, Treason{H7195}, Treason{H7195}."
2 Kings,11,15,"But Jehoiada{H3077} the priest{H3548} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} the captains{H8269} of the hundreds{H3967}, the officers{H6485}{(H8803)} of the host{H2428}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Have her forth{H3318}{(H8685)} without{H1004} the ranges{H7713}: and him that followeth{H935}{(H8802)}{H310} her kill{H4191}{(H8687)} with the sword{H2719}. For the priest{H3548} had said{H559}{(H8804)}, Let her not be slain{H4191}{(H8714)} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,11,16,And they laid{H7760}{(H8799)} hands{H3027} on her; and she went{H935}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870} by the which the horses{H5483} came{H3996} into the king's{H4428} house{H1004}: and there was she slain{H4191}{(H8714)}.
2 Kings,11,17,"And Jehoiada{H3077} made{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285} between the LORD{H3068} and the king{H4428} and the people{H5971}, that they should be the LORD'S{H3068} people{H5971}; between the king{H4428} also and the people{H5971}."
2 Kings,11,18,"And all the people{H5971} of the land{H776} went{H935}{(H8799)} into the house{H1004} of Baal{H1168}, and brake it down{H5422}{(H8799)}; his altars{H4196} and his images{H6754} brake they in pieces{H7665}{(H8765)} thoroughly{H3190}{(H8687)}, and slew{H2026}{(H8804)} Mattan{H4977} the priest{H3548} of Baal{H1168} before{H6440} the altars{H4196}. And the priest{H3548} appointed{H7760}{(H8799)} officers{H6485}{(H8803)}{(H8676)}{H6486} over the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,11,19,"And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} the rulers{H8269} over hundreds{H3967}, and the captains{H3746}, and the guard{H7323}{(H8801)}, and all the people{H5971} of the land{H776}; and they brought down{H3381}{(H8686)} the king{H4428} from the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870} of the gate{H8179} of the guard{H7323}{(H8801)} to the king's{H4428} house{H1004}. And he sat{H3427}{(H8799)} on the throne{H3678} of the kings{H4428}."
2 Kings,11,20,"And all the people{H5971} of the land{H776} rejoiced{H8055}{(H8799)}, and the city{H5892} was in quiet{H8252}{(H8804)}: and they slew{H4191}{(H8689)} Athaliah{H6271} with the sword{H2719} beside the king's{H4428} house{H1004}."
2 Kings,11,21,Seven{H7651} years{H8141} old{H1121} was Jehoash{H3060} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}.
2 Kings,12,1,In the seventh{H7651} year{H8141} of Jehu{H3058} Jehoash{H3060} began to reign{H4427}{(H8804)}; and forty{H705} years{H8141} reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} he in Jerusalem{H3389}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Zibiah{H6645} of Beersheba{H884}.
2 Kings,12,2,And Jehoash{H3060} did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was right{H3477} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068} all his days{H3117} wherein Jehoiada{H3077} the priest{H3548} instructed{H3384}{(H8689)} him.
2 Kings,12,3,But the high places{H1116} were not taken away{H5493}{(H8804)}: the people{H5971} still sacrificed{H2076}{(H8764)} and burnt incense{H6999}{(H8764)} in the high places{H1116}.
2 Kings,12,4,"And Jehoash{H3060} said{H559}{(H8799)} to the priests{H3548}, All the money{H3701} of the dedicated things{H6944} that is brought{H935}{(H8714)} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, even the money{H3701} of every one{H376} that passeth{H5674}{(H8802)} the account, the money{H3701} that every man{H5315} is set at{H6187}, and all the money{H3701} that cometh{H5927}{(H8799)} into any man's{H376} heart{H3820} to bring{H935}{(H8687)} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068},"
2 Kings,12,5,"Let the priests{H3548} take{H3947}{(H8799)} it to them, every man{H376} of his acquaintance{H4378}: and let them repair{H2388}{(H8762)} the breaches{H919} of the house{H1004}, wheresoever any breach{H919} shall be found{H4672}{(H8735)}."
2 Kings,12,6,"But it was so, that in the three{H7969}{H8141} and twentieth{H6242} year{H8141} of king{H4428} Jehoash{H3060} the priests{H3548} had not repaired{H2388}{(H8765)} the breaches{H919} of the house{H1004}."
2 Kings,12,7,"Then king{H4428} Jehoash{H3060} called{H7121}{(H8799)} for Jehoiada{H3077} the priest{H3548}, and the other priests{H3548}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Why repair{H2388}{(H8764)} ye not the breaches{H919} of the house{H1004}? now therefore receive{H3947}{(H8799)} no more money{H3701} of your acquaintance{H4378}, but deliver{H5414}{(H8799)} it for the breaches{H919} of the house{H1004}."
2 Kings,12,8,"And the priests{H3548} consented{H225}{(H8735)} to receive{H3947}{(H8800)} no{H1115} more money{H3701} of the people{H5971}, neither{H1115} to repair{H2388}{(H8763)} the breaches{H919} of the house{H1004}."
2 Kings,12,9,"But Jehoiada{H3077} the priest{H3548} took{H3947}{(H8799)} a{H259} chest{H727}, and bored{H5344}{(H8799)} a hole{H2356} in the lid{H1817} of it, and set{H5414}{(H8799)} it beside{H681} the altar{H4196}, on the right side{H3225} as one{H376} cometh{H935}{(H8800)} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}: and the priests{H3548} that kept{H8104}{(H8802)} the door{H5592} put{H5414}{(H8804)} therein all the money{H3701} that was brought{H935}{(H8716)} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,12,10,"And it was so, when they saw{H7200}{(H8800)} that there was much{H7227} money{H3701} in the chest{H727}, that the king's{H4428} scribe{H5608}{(H8802)} and the high{H1419} priest{H3548} came up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and they put up in bags{H6696}{(H8799)}, and told{H4487}{(H8799)} the money{H3701} that was found{H4672}{(H8737)} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,12,11,"And they gave{H5414}{(H8804)} the money{H3701}, being told{H8505}{(H8794)}, into the hands{H3027} of them that did{H6213}{(H8802)} the work{H4399}, that had the oversight{H6485}{(H8716)}{(H8675)}{H6485}{(H8803)} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}: and they laid it out{H3318}{(H8686)} to the carpenters{H2796}{H6086} and builders{H1129}{(H8802)}, that wrought{H6213}{(H8802)} upon the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068},"

2 Kings,12,13,"Howbeit there were not made{H6213}{(H8735)} for the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} bowls{H5592} of silver{H3701}, snuffers{H4212}, basons{H4219}, trumpets{H2689}, any vessels{H3627} of gold{H2091}, or vessels{H3627} of silver{H3701}, of the money{H3701} that was brought{H935}{(H8716)} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}:"
2 Kings,12,14,"But they gave{H5414}{(H8799)} that to the workmen{H4399}{H6213}{(H8802)}, and repaired{H2388}{(H8765)} therewith the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,12,15,"Moreover they reckoned{H2803}{(H8762)} not with the men{H582}, into whose hand{H3027} they delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} the money{H3701} to be bestowed{H5414}{(H8800)} on workmen{H4399}: for they dealt{H6213}{(H8802)} faithfully{H530}."
2 Kings,12,16,The trespass{H817} money{H3701} and sin{H2403} money{H3701} was not brought{H935}{(H8714)} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}: it was the priests{H3548}'.
2 Kings,12,17,"Then Hazael{H2371} king{H4428} of Syria{H758} went up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against Gath{H1661}, and took{H3920}{(H8799)} it: and Hazael{H2371} set{H7760}{(H8799)} his face{H6440} to go up{H5927}{(H8800)} to Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Kings,12,18,"And Jehoash{H3060} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} took{H3947}{(H8799)} all the hallowed things{H6944} that Jehoshaphat{H3092}, and Jehoram{H3088}, and Ahaziah{H274}, his fathers{H1}, kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, had dedicated{H6942}{(H8689)}, and his own hallowed things{H6944}, and all the gold{H2091} that was found{H4672}{(H8737)} in the treasures{H214} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and in the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} it to Hazael{H2371} king{H4428} of Syria{H758}: and he went away{H5927}{(H8799)} from Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Kings,12,19,"And the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Joash{H3101}, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}?"
2 Kings,12,20,"And his servants{H5650} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and made{H7194}{(H8799)} a conspiracy{H7195}, and slew{H5221}{(H8686)} Joash{H3101} in the house{H1004} of Millo{H4407}{(H8677)}{H1037}, which goeth down{H3381}{(H8802)} to Silla{H5538}."
2 Kings,12,21,"For Jozachar{H3108} the son{H1121} of Shimeath{H8100}, and Jehozabad{H3075} the son{H1121} of Shomer{H7763}, his servants{H5650}, smote{H5221}{(H8689)} him, and he died{H4191}{(H8799)}; and they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him with his fathers{H1} in the city{H5892} of David{H1732}: and Amaziah{H558} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead."
2 Kings,13,1,"In the three{H7969}{H8141} and twentieth{H6242} year{H8141} of Joash{H3101} the son{H1121} of Ahaziah{H274} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} Jehoahaz{H3059} the son{H1121} of Jehu{H3058} began to reign{H4427}{(H8804)} over Israel{H3478} in Samaria{H8111}, and reigned seventeen{H7651}{H6240} years{H8141}."
2 Kings,13,2,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, and followed{H3212}{(H8799)}{H310} the sins{H2403} of Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Nebat{H5028}, which made Israel{H3478} to sin{H2398}{(H8689)}; he departed{H5493}{(H8804)} not therefrom."
2 Kings,13,3,"And the anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} was kindled{H2734}{(H8799)} against Israel{H3478}, and he delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} them into the hand{H3027} of Hazael{H2371} king{H4428} of Syria{H758}, and into the hand{H3027} of Benhadad{H1130} the son{H1121} of Hazael{H2371}, all their days{H3117}."
2 Kings,13,4,"And Jehoahaz{H3059} besought{H2470}{(H8762)} the LORD{H3068}, and the LORD{H3068} hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} unto{H6440} him: for he saw{H7200}{(H8804)} the oppression{H3906} of Israel{H3478}, because the king{H4428} of Syria{H758} oppressed{H3905}{(H8804)} them."
2 Kings,13,5,"(And the LORD{H3068} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} Israel{H3478} a saviour{H3467}{(H8688)}, so that they went out{H3318}{(H8799)} from under the hand{H3027} of the Syrians{H758}: and the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in their tents{H168}, as beforetime{H8032}{H8543}."
2 Kings,13,6,"Nevertheless they departed{H5493}{(H8804)} not from the sins{H2403} of the house{H1004} of Jeroboam{H3379}, who made Israel{H3478} sin{H2398}{(H8689)}, but walked{H1980}{(H8804)} therein: and there remained{H5975}{(H8804)} the grove{H842} also in Samaria{H8111}.)"
2 Kings,13,7,"Neither did he leave{H7604}{(H8689)} of the people{H5971} to Jehoahaz{H3059} but fifty{H2572} horsemen{H6571}, and ten{H6235} chariots{H7393}, and ten{H6235} thousand{H505} footmen{H7273}; for the king{H4428} of Syria{H758} had destroyed{H6}{(H8765)} them, and had made{H7760}{(H8799)} them like the dust{H6083} by threshing{H1758}{(H8800)}."
2 Kings,13,8,"Now the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Jehoahaz{H3059}, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, and his might{H1369}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478}?"
2 Kings,13,9,And Jehoahaz{H3059} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}; and they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him in Samaria{H8111}: and Joash{H3101} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead.
2 Kings,13,10,"In the thirty{H7970}{H8141} and seventh{H7651} year{H8141} of Joash{H3101} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} began Jehoash{H3060} the son{H1121} of Jehoahaz{H3059} to reign{H4427}{(H8804)} over Israel{H3478} in Samaria{H8111}, and reigned sixteen{H8337}{H6240} years{H8141}."
2 Kings,13,11,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}; he departed{H5493}{(H8804)} not from all the sins{H2403} of Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Nebat{H5028}, who made Israel{H3478} sin{H2398}{(H8689)}: but he walked{H1980}{(H8804)} therein."
2 Kings,13,12,"And the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Joash{H3101}, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, and his might{H1369} wherewith he fought{H3898}{(H8738)} against Amaziah{H558} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478}?"
2 Kings,13,13,And Joash{H3101} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}; and Jeroboam{H3379} sat{H3427}{(H8804)} upon his throne{H3678}: and Joash{H3101} was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} in Samaria{H8111} with the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478}.
2 Kings,13,14,"Now Elisha{H477} was fallen sick{H2470}{(H8804)} of his sickness{H2483} whereof he died{H4191}{(H8799)}. And Joash{H3101} the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} came down{H3381}{(H8799)} unto him, and wept{H1058}{(H8799)} over his face{H6440}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, O my father{H1}, my father{H1}, the chariot{H7393} of Israel{H3478}, and the horsemen{H6571} thereof."
2 Kings,13,15,"And Elisha{H477} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} bow{H7198} and arrows{H2671}. And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} unto him bow{H7198} and arrows{H2671}."
2 Kings,13,16,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, Put{H7392}{(H8685)} thine hand{H3027} upon the bow{H7198}. And he put{H7392}{(H8686)} his hand{H3027} upon it: and Elisha{H477} put{H7760}{(H8799)} his hands{H3027} upon the king's{H4428} hands{H3027}."
2 Kings,13,17,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Open{H6605}{(H8798)} the window{H2474} eastward{H6924}. And he opened{H6605}{(H8799)} it. Then Elisha{H477} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Shoot{H3384}{(H8798)}. And he shot{H3384}{(H8686)}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, The arrow{H2671} of the LORD'S{H3068} deliverance{H8668}, and the arrow{H2671} of deliverance{H8668} from Syria{H758}: for thou shalt smite{H5221}{(H8689)} the Syrians{H758} in Aphek{H663}, till thou have consumed{H3615}{(H8763)} them."
2 Kings,13,18,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} the arrows{H2671}. And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} them.

2 Kings,13,19,"And the man{H376} of God{H430} was wroth{H7107}{(H8799)} with him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou shouldest have smitten{H5221}{(H8687)} five{H2568} or six{H8337} times{H6471}; then hadst thou smitten{H5221}{(H8689)} Syria{H758} till thou hadst consumed{H3615}{(H8763)} it: whereas now thou shalt smite{H5221}{(H8686)} Syria{H758} but thrice{H7969}{H6471}."
2 Kings,13,20,"And Elisha{H477} died{H4191}{(H8799)}, and they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him. And the bands{H1416} of the Moabites{H4124} invaded{H935}{(H8799)} the land{H776} at the coming in{H935}{(H8802)} of the year{H8141}."
2 Kings,13,21,"And it came to pass, as they were burying{H6912}{(H8802)} a man{H376}, that, behold, they spied{H7200}{(H8804)} a band{H1416} of men; and they cast{H7993}{(H8686)} the man{H376} into the sepulchre{H6913} of Elisha{H477}: and when the man{H376} was let down{H3212}{(H8799)}, and touched{H5060}{(H8799)} the bones{H6106} of Elisha{H477}, he revived{H2421}{(H8799)}, and stood up{H6965}{(H8799)} on his feet{H7272}."
2 Kings,13,22,But Hazael{H2371} king{H4428} of Syria{H758} oppressed{H3905}{(H8804)} Israel{H3478} all the days{H3117} of Jehoahaz{H3059}.
2 Kings,13,23,"And the LORD{H3068} was gracious{H2603}{(H8799)} unto them, and had compassion{H7355}{(H8762)} on them, and had respect{H6437}{(H8799)} unto them, because of{H4616} his covenant{H1285} with Abraham{H85}, Isaac{H3327}, and Jacob{H3290}, and would{H14}{(H8804)} not destroy{H7843}{(H8687)} them, neither cast{H7993}{(H8689)} he them from his presence{H6440} as yet{H5704}."
2 Kings,13,24,So Hazael{H2371} king{H4428} of Syria{H758} died{H4191}{(H8799)}; and Benhadad{H1130} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead.
2 Kings,13,25,"And Jehoash{H3060} the son{H1121} of Jehoahaz{H3059} took{H3947}{(H8799)} again{H7725}{(H8799)} out of the hand{H3027} of Benhadad{H1130} the son{H1121} of Hazael{H2371} the cities{H5892}, which he had taken{H3947}{(H8804)} out of the hand{H3027} of Jehoahaz{H3059} his father{H1} by war{H4421}. Three{H7969} times{H6471} did Joash{H3101} beat{H5221}{(H8689)} him, and recovered{H7725}{(H8686)} the cities{H5892} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Kings,14,1,In the second{H8147} year{H8141} of Joash{H3101} son{H1121} of Jehoahaz{H3099} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} Amaziah{H558} the son{H1121} of Joash{H3101} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}.
2 Kings,14,2,"He was twenty{H6242} and five{H2568} years{H8141} old{H1121} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, and reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} twenty{H6242} and nine{H8672} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Jehoaddan{H3086} of Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Kings,14,3,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was right{H3477} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, yet{H7535} not like David{H1732} his father{H1}: he did{H6213}{(H8804)} according to all things as Joash{H3101} his father{H1} did{H6213}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,14,4,Howbeit the high places{H1116} were not taken away{H5493}{(H8804)}: as yet{H5750} the people{H5971} did sacrifice{H2076}{(H8764)} and burnt incense{H6999}{(H8764)} on the high places{H1116}.
2 Kings,14,5,"And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom{H4467} was confirmed{H2388}{(H8804)} in his hand{H3027}, that he slew{H5221}{(H8686)} his servants{H5650} which had slain{H5221}{(H8688)} the king{H4428} his father{H1}."
2 Kings,14,6,"But the children{H1121} of the murderers{H5221}{(H8688)} he slew{H4191}{(H8689)} not: according unto that which is written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the law{H8451} of Moses{H4872}, wherein the LORD{H3068} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The fathers{H1} shall not be put to death{H4191}{(H8714)} for the children{H1121}, nor the children{H1121} be put to death{H4191}{(H8714)} for the fathers{H1}; but every man{H376} shall be put to death{H4191}{(H8799)} for his own sin{H2399}."
2 Kings,14,7,"He slew{H5221}{(H8689)} of Edom{H123} in the valley{H1516} of salt{H4417} ten{H6235} thousand{H505}, and took{H8610}{(H8804)} Selah{H5554} by war{H4421}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} the name{H8034} of it Joktheel{H3371} unto this day{H3117}."
2 Kings,14,8,"Then Amaziah{H558} sent{H7971}{(H8804)} messengers{H4397} to Jehoash{H3060}, the son{H1121} of Jehoahaz{H3059} son{H1121} of Jehu{H3058}, king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, let us look{H7200}{(H8691)} one another in the face{H6440}."
2 Kings,14,9,"And Jehoash{H3060} the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Amaziah{H558} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The thistle{H2336} that was in Lebanon{H3844} sent{H7971}{(H8804)} to the cedar{H730} that was in Lebanon{H3844}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} thy daughter{H1323} to my son{H1121} to wife{H802}: and there passed{H5674}{(H8799)} by a wild{H7704} beast{H2416} that was in Lebanon{H3844}, and trode down{H7429}{(H8799)} the thistle{H2336}."
2 Kings,14,10,"Thou hast indeed{H5221}{(H8687)} smitten{H5221}{(H8689)} Edom{H123}, and thine heart{H3820} hath lifted thee up{H5375}{(H8804)}: glory{H3513}{(H8734)} of this, and tarry{H3427}{(H8798)} at home{H1004}: for why shouldest thou meddle{H1624}{(H8691)} to thy hurt{H7451}, that thou shouldest fall{H5307}{(H8804)}, even thou, and Judah{H3063} with thee?"
2 Kings,14,11,"But Amaziah{H558} would not hear{H8085}{(H8804)}. Therefore Jehoash{H3060} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} went up{H5927}{(H8799)}; and he and Amaziah{H558} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} looked{H7200}{(H8691)} one another in the face{H6440} at Bethshemesh{H1053}, which belongeth to Judah{H3063}."
2 Kings,14,12,And Judah{H3063} was put to the worse{H5062}{(H8735)} before{H6440} Israel{H3478}; and they fled{H5127}{(H8799)} every man{H376} to their tents{H168}.
2 Kings,14,13,"And Jehoash{H3060} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} took{H8610}{(H8804)} Amaziah{H558} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, the son{H1121} of Jehoash{H3060} the son{H1121} of Ahaziah{H274}, at Bethshemesh{H1053}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}, and brake down{H6555}{(H8799)} the wall{H2346} of Jerusalem{H3389} from the gate{H8179} of Ephraim{H669} unto the corner{H6438} gate{H8179}, four{H702} hundred{H3967} cubits{H520}."

2 Kings,14,17,And Amaziah{H558} the son{H1121} of Joash{H3101} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} lived{H2421}{(H8799)} after{H310} the death{H4194} of Jehoash{H3060} son{H1121} of Jehoahaz{H3059} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} fifteen{H2568}{H6240} years{H8141}.

2 Kings,14,19,"Now they made{H7194}{(H8799)} a conspiracy{H7195} against him in Jerusalem{H3389}: and he fled{H5127}{(H8799)} to Lachish{H3923}; but they sent{H7971}{(H8799)} after{H310} him to Lachish{H3923}, and slew{H4191}{(H8686)} him there."
2 Kings,14,20,And they brought{H5375}{(H8799)} him on horses{H5483}: and he was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} at Jerusalem{H3389} with his fathers{H1} in the city{H5892} of David{H1732}.
2 Kings,14,21,"And all the people{H5971} of Judah{H3063} took{H3947}{(H8799)} Azariah{H5838}, which was sixteen{H8337}{H6240} years{H8141} old{H1121}, and made him king{H4427}{(H8686)} instead of his father{H1} Amaziah{H558}."
2 Kings,14,22,"He built{H1129}{(H8804)} Elath{H359}, and restored{H7725}{(H8686)} it to Judah{H3063}, after{H310} that the king{H4428} slept{H7901}{(H8800)} with his fathers{H1}."

2 Kings,14,24,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}: he departed{H5493}{(H8804)} not from all the sins{H2403} of Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Nebat{H5028}, who made Israel{H3478} to sin{H2398}{(H8689)}."

2 Kings,15,4,Save that the high places{H1116} were not removed{H5493}{(H8804)}: the people{H5971} sacrificed{H2076}{(H8764)} and burnt incense{H6999}{(H8764)} still on the high places{H1116}.
2 Kings,15,5,"And the LORD{H3068} smote{H5060}{(H8762)} the king{H4428}, so that he was a leper{H6879}{(H8794)} unto the day{H3117} of his death{H4194}, and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in a several{H2669} house{H1004}.

2 Kings,15,30,"And Hoshea{H1954} the son{H1121} of Elah{H425} made{H7194}{(H8799)} a conspiracy{H7195} against Pekah{H6492} the son{H1121} of Remaliah{H7425}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} him, and slew{H4191}{(H8686)} him, and reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead, in the twentieth{H6242} year{H8141} of Jotham{H3147} the son{H1121} of Uzziah{H5818}."
2 Kings,15,31,"And the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Pekah{H6492}, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, behold, they are written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Kings,15,32,In the second{H8147} year{H8141} of Pekah{H6492} the son{H1121} of Remaliah{H7425} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} began Jotham{H3147} the son{H1121} of Uzziah{H5818} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} to reign{H4427}{(H8804)}.
2 Kings,15,33,"Five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} years{H8141} old{H1121} was he when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} sixteen{H8337}{H6240} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Jerusha{H3388}, the daughter{H1323} of Zadok{H6659}."
2 Kings,15,34,And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was right{H3477} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}: he did{H6213}{(H8804)} according to all that his father{H1} Uzziah{H5818} had done{H6213}{(H8804)}.
2 Kings,15,35,Howbeit the high places{H1116} were not removed{H5493}{(H8804)}: the people{H5971} sacrificed{H2076}{(H8764)} and burned incense{H6999}{(H8764)} still in the high places{H1116}. He built{H1129}{(H8804)} the higher{H5945} gate{H8179} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}.
2 Kings,15,36,"Now the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Jotham{H3147}, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}?"
2 Kings,15,37,"In those days{H3117} the LORD{H3068} began{H2490}{(H8689)} to send{H7971}{(H8687)} against Judah{H3063} Rezin{H7526} the king{H4428} of Syria{H758}, and Pekah{H6492} the son{H1121} of Remaliah{H7425}."
2 Kings,15,38,"And Jotham{H3147} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} with his fathers{H1} in the city{H5892} of David{H1732} his father{H1}: and Ahaz{H271} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead."
2 Kings,16,1,In the seventeenth{H7651}{H6240}{H8141} year{H8141} of Pekah{H6492} the son{H1121} of Remaliah{H7425} Ahaz{H271} the son{H1121} of Jotham{H3147} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} began to reign{H4427}{(H8804)}.
2 Kings,16,2,"Twenty{H6242} years{H8141} old{H1121} was Ahaz{H271} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, and reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} sixteen{H8337}{H6240} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}, and did{H6213}{(H8804)} not that which was right{H3477} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068} his God{H430}, like David{H1732} his father{H1}."
2 Kings,16,3,"But he walked{H3212}{(H8799)} in the way{H1870} of the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, yea, and made his son{H1121} to pass through{H5674}{(H8689)} the fire{H784}, according to the abominations{H8441} of the heathen{H1471}, whom the LORD{H3068} cast out{H3423}{(H8689)} from before{H6440} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Kings,16,4,"And he sacrificed{H2076}{(H8762)} and burnt incense{H6999}{(H8762)} in the high places{H1116}, and on the hills{H1389}, and under every green{H7488} tree{H6086}."
2 Kings,16,5,"Then Rezin{H7526} king{H4428} of Syria{H758} and Pekah{H6492} son{H1121} of Remaliah{H7425} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} came up{H5927}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389} to war{H4421}: and they besieged{H6696}{(H8799)} Ahaz{H271}, but could{H3201}{(H8804)} not overcome{H3898}{(H8736)} him."
2 Kings,16,6,"At that time{H6256} Rezin{H7526} king{H4428} of Syria{H758} recovered{H7725}{(H8689)} Elath{H359} to Syria{H758}{(H8675)}{H130}, and drave{H5394}{(H8762)} the Jews{H3064} from Elath{H359}: and the Syrians{H726} came{H935}{(H8804)} to Elath{H359}, and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} there unto this day{H3117}."
2 Kings,16,7,"So Ahaz{H271} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} to Tiglathpileser{H8407} king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I am thy servant{H5650} and thy son{H1121}: come up{H5927}{(H8798)}, and save{H3467}{(H8685)} me out of the hand{H3709} of the king{H4428} of Syria{H758}, and out of the hand{H3709} of the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, which rise up{H6965}{(H8801)} against me."
2 Kings,16,8,"And Ahaz{H271} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the silver{H3701} and gold{H2091} that was found{H4672}{(H8737)} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and in the treasures{H214} of the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} it for a present{H7810} to the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}."
2 Kings,16,9,"And the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} unto him: for the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} against Damascus{H1834}, and took{H8610}{(H8799)} it, and carried the people of it captive{H1540}{(H8686)} to Kir{H7024}, and slew{H4191}{(H8689)} Rezin{H7526}."
2 Kings,16,10,"And king{H4428} Ahaz{H271} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Damascus{H1834} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} Tiglathpileser{H8407} king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} an altar{H4196} that was at Damascus{H1834}: and king{H4428} Ahaz{H271} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Urijah{H223} the priest{H3548} the fashion{H1823} of the altar{H4196}, and the pattern{H8403} of it, according to all the workmanship{H4639} thereof."
2 Kings,16,11,And Urijah{H223} the priest{H3548} built{H1129}{(H8799)} an altar{H4196} according to all that king{H4428} Ahaz{H271} had sent{H7971}{(H8804)} from Damascus{H1834}: so Urijah{H223} the priest{H3548} made{H6213}{(H8804)} it against king{H4428} Ahaz{H271} came{H935}{(H8800)} from Damascus{H1834}.
2 Kings,16,12,"And when the king{H4428} was come{H935}{(H8799)} from Damascus{H1834}, the king{H4428} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the altar{H4196}: and the king{H4428} approached{H7126}{(H8799)} to the altar{H4196}, and offered{H5927}{(H8686)} thereon."
2 Kings,16,13,"And he burnt{H6999}{(H8686)} his burnt offering{H5930} and his meat offering{H4503}, and poured{H5258}{(H8686)} his drink offering{H5262}, and sprinkled{H2236}{(H8799)} the blood{H1818} of his peace offerings{H8002}, upon the altar{H4196}."
2 Kings,16,14,"And he brought{H7126}{(H8686)} also the brasen{H5178} altar{H4196}, which was before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, from the forefront{H6440} of the house{H1004}, from between the altar{H4196} and the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and put{H5414}{(H8799)} it on the north{H6828} side{H3409} of the altar{H4196}."
2 Kings,16,15,"And king{H4428} Ahaz{H271} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} Urijah{H223} the priest{H3548}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Upon the great{H1419} altar{H4196} burn{H6999}{(H8685)} the morning{H1242} burnt offering{H5930}, and the evening{H6153} meat offering{H4503}, and the king's{H4428} burnt sacrifice{H5930}, and his meat offering{H4503}, with the burnt offering{H5930} of all the people{H5971} of the land{H776}, and their meat offering{H4503}, and their drink offerings{H5262}; and sprinkle{H2236}{(H8799)} upon it all the blood{H1818} of the burnt offering{H5930}, and all the blood{H1818} of the sacrifice{H2077}: and the brasen{H5178} altar{H4196} shall be for me to enquire{H1239}{(H8763)} by."
2 Kings,16,16,"Thus did{H6213}{(H8799)} Urijah{H223} the priest{H3548}, according to all that king{H4428} Ahaz{H271} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}."
2 Kings,16,17,"And king{H4428} Ahaz{H271} cut off{H7112}{(H8762)} the borders{H4526} of the bases{H4350}, and removed{H5493}{(H8686)} the laver{H3595} from off them; and took down{H3381}{(H8689)} the sea{H3220} from off the brasen{H5178} oxen{H1241} that were under it, and put{H5414}{(H8799)} it upon a pavement{H4837} of stones{H68}."
2 Kings,16,18,"And the covert{H4329}{(H8675)}{H4329} for the sabbath{H7676} that they had built{H1129}{(H8804)} in the house{H1004}, and the king's{H4428} entry{H3996} without{H2435}, turned{H5437}{(H8689)} he from the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} for{H6440} the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}."
2 Kings,16,19,"Now the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Ahaz{H271} which he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}?"
2 Kings,16,20,"And Ahaz{H271} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} with his fathers{H1} in the city{H5892} of David{H1732}: and Hezekiah{H2396} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead."
2 Kings,17,1,In the twelfth{H8147}{H6240} year{H8141} of Ahaz{H271} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} began Hoshea{H1954} the son{H1121} of Elah{H425} to reign{H4427}{(H8804)} in Samaria{H8111} over Israel{H3478} nine{H8672} years{H8141}.
2 Kings,17,2,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, but not as the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478} that were before{H6440} him."
2 Kings,17,3,"Against him came up{H5927}{(H8804)} Shalmaneser{H8022} king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}; and Hoshea{H1954} became his servant{H5650}, and gave{H7725}{(H8686)} him presents{H4503}."
2 Kings,17,4,"And the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} found{H4672}{(H8799)} conspiracy{H7195} in Hoshea{H1954}: for he had sent{H7971}{(H8804)} messengers{H4397} to So{H5471} king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714}, and brought{H5927}{(H8689)} no present{H4503} to the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}, as he had done year{H8141} by year{H8141}: therefore the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} shut him up{H6113}{(H8799)}, and bound{H631}{(H8799)} him in prison{H1004}{H3608}."
2 Kings,17,5,"Then the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} came up{H5927}{(H8799)} throughout all the land{H776}, and went up{H5927}{(H8799)} to Samaria{H8111}, and besieged{H6696}{(H8799)} it three{H7969} years{H8141}."
2 Kings,17,6,"In the ninth{H8671} year{H8141} of Hoshea{H1954} the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} took{H3920}{(H8804)} Samaria{H8111}, and carried{H1540} Israel{H3478} away{H1540}{(H8686)} into Assyria{H804}, and placed{H3427}{(H8686)} them in Halah{H2477} and in Habor{H2249} by the river{H5104} of Gozan{H1470}, and in the cities{H5892} of the Medes{H4074}."
2 Kings,17,7,"For so it was, that the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} had sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, which had brought them up{H5927}{(H8688)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, from under the hand{H3027} of Pharaoh{H6547} king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714}, and had feared{H3372}{(H8799)} other{H312} gods{H430},"
2 Kings,17,8,"And walked{H3212}{(H8799)} in the statutes{H2708} of the heathen{H1471}, whom the LORD{H3068} cast out{H3423}{(H8689)} from before{H6440} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, and of the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, which they had made{H6213}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,17,9,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} did secretly{H2644}{(H8762)} those things{H1697} that were not right against the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, and they built{H1129}{(H8799)} them high places{H1116} in all their cities{H5892}, from the tower{H4026} of the watchmen{H5341}{(H8802)} to the fenced{H4013} city{H5892}."
2 Kings,17,10,"And they set them up{H5324}{(H8686)} images{H4676} and groves{H842} in every high{H1364} hill{H1389}, and under every green{H7488} tree{H6086}:"
2 Kings,17,11,"And there they burnt incense{H6999}{(H8762)} in all the high places{H1116}, as did the heathen{H1471} whom the LORD{H3068} carried away{H1540}{(H8689)} before{H6440} them; and wrought{H6213}{(H8799)} wicked{H7451} things{H1697} to provoke the LORD{H3068} to anger{H3707}{(H8687)}:"
2 Kings,17,12,"For they served{H5647}{(H8799)} idols{H1544}, whereof the LORD{H3068} had said{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Ye shall not do{H6213}{(H8799)} this thing{H1697}."
2 Kings,17,13,"Yet the LORD{H3068} testified{H5749}{(H8686)} against Israel{H3478}, and against Judah{H3063}, by{H3027} all the prophets{H5030}, and by all the seers{H2374}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Turn{H7725}{(H8798)} ye from your evil{H7451} ways{H1870}, and keep{H8104}{(H8798)} my commandments{H4687} and my statutes{H2708}, according to all the law{H8451} which I commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} your fathers{H1}, and which I sent{H7971}{(H8804)} to you by{H3027} my servants{H5650} the prophets{H5030}."
2 Kings,17,14,"Notwithstanding they would not hear{H8085}{(H8804)}, but hardened{H7185}{(H8686)} their necks{H6203}, like to the neck{H6203} of their fathers{H1}, that did not believe{H539}{(H8689)} in the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}."
2 Kings,17,15,"And they rejected{H3988}{(H8799)} his statutes{H2706}, and his covenant{H1285} that he made{H3772}{(H8804)} with their fathers{H1}, and his testimonies{H5715} which he testified{H5749}{(H8689)} against them; and they followed{H3212}{(H8799)}{H310} vanity{H1892}, and became vain{H1891}{(H8799)}, and went after{H310} the heathen{H1471} that were round about{H5439} them, concerning whom the LORD{H3068} had charged{H6680}{(H8765)} them, that they should not do{H6213}{(H8800)} like them."
2 Kings,17,16,"And they left{H5800}{(H8799)} all the commandments{H4687} of the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, and made{H6213}{(H8799)} them molten images{H4541}, even two{H8147} calves{H5695}, and made{H6213}{(H8799)} a grove{H842}, and worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)} all the host{H6635} of heaven{H8064}, and served{H5647}{(H8799)} Baal{H1168}."
2 Kings,17,17,"And they caused their sons{H1121} and their daughters{H1323} to pass{H5674}{(H8686)} through the fire{H784}, and used{H7080}{(H8799)} divination{H7081} and enchantments{H5172}{(H8762)}, and sold{H4376}{(H8691)} themselves to do{H6213}{(H8800)} evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, to provoke him to anger{H3707}{(H8687)}."
2 Kings,17,18,"Therefore the LORD{H3068} was very{H3966} angry{H599}{(H8691)} with Israel{H3478}, and removed{H5493}{(H8686)} them out of his sight{H6440}: there was none left{H7604}{(H8738)} but the tribe{H7626} of Judah{H3063} only."
2 Kings,17,19,"Also Judah{H3063} kept{H8104}{(H8804)} not the commandments{H4687} of the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, but walked{H3212}{(H8799)} in the statutes{H2708} of Israel{H3478} which they made{H6213}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,17,20,"And the LORD{H3068} rejected{H3988}{(H8799)} all the seed{H2233} of Israel{H3478}, and afflicted{H6031}{(H8762)} them, and delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} them into the hand{H3027} of spoilers{H8154}{(H8802)}, until he had cast{H7993}{(H8689)} them out of his sight{H6440}."
2 Kings,17,21,"For he rent{H7167}{(H8804)} Israel{H3478} from the house{H1004} of David{H1732}; and they made Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Nebat{H5028} king{H4427}{(H8686)}: and Jeroboam{H3379} drave{H5080}{(H8686)}{(H8675)}{H5077}{(H8686)} Israel{H3478} from following{H310} the LORD{H3068}, and made them sin{H2398}{(H8689)} a great{H1419} sin{H2401}."
2 Kings,17,22,For the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} walked{H3212}{(H8799)} in all the sins{H2403} of Jeroboam{H3379} which he did{H6213}{(H8804)}; they departed{H5493}{(H8804)} not from them;
2 Kings,17,23,"Until the LORD{H3068} removed{H5493}{(H8689)} Israel{H3478} out of his sight{H6440}, as he had said{H1696}{(H8765)} by{H3027} all his servants{H5650} the prophets{H5030}. So was Israel{H3478} carried away{H1540}{(H8799)} out of their own land{H127} to Assyria{H804} unto this day{H3117}."
2 Kings,17,24,"And the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} brought{H935}{(H8686)} men from Babylon{H894}, and from Cuthah{H3575}, and from Ava{H5755}, and from Hamath{H2574}, and from Sepharvaim{H5617}, and placed{H3427}{(H8686)} them in the cities{H5892} of Samaria{H8111} instead of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}: and they possessed{H3423}{(H8799)} Samaria{H8111}, and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in the cities{H5892} thereof."
2 Kings,17,25,"And so it was at the beginning{H8462} of their dwelling{H3427}{(H8800)} there, that they feared{H3372}{(H8804)} not the LORD{H3068}: therefore the LORD{H3068} sent{H7971}{(H8762)} lions{H738} among them, which slew{H2026}{(H8802)} some of them."
2 Kings,17,26,"Wherefore they spake{H559}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The nations{H1471} which thou hast removed{H1540}{(H8689)}, and placed{H3427}{(H8686)} in the cities{H5892} of Samaria{H8111}, know{H3045}{(H8804)} not the manner{H4941} of the God{H430} of the land{H776}: therefore he hath sent{H7971}{(H8762)} lions{H738} among them, and, behold, they slay{H4191}{(H8688)} them, because they know{H3045}{(H8802)} not the manner{H4941} of the God{H430} of the land{H776}."
2 Kings,17,27,"Then the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Carry{H3212}{(H8685)} thither one{H259} of the priests{H3548} whom ye brought{H1540}{(H8689)} from thence; and let them go{H3212}{(H8799)} and dwell{H3427}{(H8799)} there, and let him teach{H3384}{(H8686)} them the manner{H4941} of the God{H430} of the land{H776}."
2 Kings,17,28,"Then one{H259} of the priests{H3548} whom they had carried away{H1540}{(H8689)} from Samaria{H8111} came{H935}{(H8799)} and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in Bethel{H1008}, and taught{H3384}{(H8688)} them how they should fear{H3372}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,17,29,"Howbeit every nation{H1471} made{H6213}{(H8802)} gods{H430} of their own, and put{H3240}{(H8686)} them in the houses{H1004} of the high places{H1116} which the Samaritans{H8118} had made{H6213}{(H8804)}, every nation{H1471} in their cities{H5892} wherein they dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)}."
2 Kings,17,30,"And the men{H582} of Babylon{H894} made{H6213}{(H8804)} Succothbenoth{H5524}, and the men{H582} of Cuth{H3575} made{H6213}{(H8804)} Nergal{H5370}, and the men{H582} of Hamath{H2574} made{H6213}{(H8804)} Ashima{H807},"
2 Kings,17,31,"And the Avites{H5757} made{H6213}{(H8804)} Nibhaz{H5026} and Tartak{H8662}, and the Sepharvites{H5616} burnt{H8313}{(H8802)} their children{H1121} in fire{H784} to Adrammelech{H152} and Anammelech{H6048}, the gods{H430} of Sepharvaim{H5617}."
2 Kings,17,32,"So they feared{H3373} the LORD{H3068}, and made{H6213}{(H8799)} unto themselves of the lowest{H7098} of them priests{H3548} of the high places{H1116}, which sacrificed{H6213}{(H8802)} for them in the houses{H1004} of the high places{H1116}."
2 Kings,17,33,"They feared{H3373} the LORD{H3068}, and served{H5647}{(H8802)} their own gods{H430}, after the manner{H4941} of the nations{H1471} whom they carried away{H1540}{(H8689)} from thence."
2 Kings,17,34,"Unto this day{H3117} they do{H6213}{(H8802)} after the former{H7223} manners{H4941}: they fear{H3373} not the LORD{H3068}, neither do{H6213}{(H8802)} they after their statutes{H2708}, or after their ordinances{H4941}, or after the law{H8451} and commandment{H4687} which the LORD{H3068} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} the children{H1121} of Jacob{H3290}, whom he named{H7760}{(H8804)}{H8034} Israel{H3478};"
2 Kings,17,35,"With whom the LORD{H3068} had made{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285}, and charged{H6680}{(H8762)} them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Ye shall not fear{H3372}{(H8799)} other{H312} gods{H430}, nor bow{H7812}{(H8691)} yourselves to them, nor serve{H5647}{(H8799)} them, nor sacrifice{H2076}{(H8799)} to them:"
2 Kings,17,36,"But the LORD{H3068}, who brought you up{H5927}{(H8689)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} with great{H1419} power{H3581} and a stretched out{H5186}{(H8803)} arm{H2220}, him shall ye fear{H3372}{(H8799)}, and him shall ye worship{H7812}{(H8691)}, and to him shall ye do sacrifice{H2076}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,17,37,"And the statutes{H2706}, and the ordinances{H4941}, and the law{H8451}, and the commandment{H4687}, which he wrote{H3789}{(H8804)} for you, ye shall observe{H8104}{(H8799)} to do{H6213}{(H8800)} for evermore{H3117}; and ye shall not fear{H3372}{(H8799)} other{H312} gods{H430}."
2 Kings,17,38,And the covenant{H1285} that I have made{H3772}{(H8804)} with you ye shall not forget{H7911}{(H8799)}; neither shall ye fear{H3372}{(H8799)} other{H312} gods{H430}.
2 Kings,17,39,But the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} ye shall fear{H3372}{(H8799)}; and he shall deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} you out of the hand{H3027} of all your enemies{H341}{(H8802)}.
2 Kings,17,40,"Howbeit they did not hearken{H8085}{(H8804)}, but they did{H6213}{(H8802)} after their former{H7223} manner{H4941}."
2 Kings,17,41,"So these nations{H1471} feared{H3373} the LORD{H3068}, and served{H5647}{(H8802)} their graven images{H6456}, both their children{H1121}, and their children's{H1121} children{H1121}: as did{H6213}{(H8804)} their fathers{H1}, so do{H6213}{(H8802)} they unto this day{H3117}."
2 Kings,18,1,"Now it came to pass in the third{H7969} year{H8141} of Hoshea{H1954} son{H1121} of Elah{H425} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, that Hezekiah{H2396} the son{H1121} of Ahaz{H271} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} began to reign{H4427}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,18,2,"Twenty{H6242} and five{H2568} years{H8141} old{H1121} was he when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}; and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} twenty{H6242} and nine{H8672} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}. His mother's{H517} name{H8034} also was Abi{H21}, the daughter{H1323} of Zachariah{H2148}."
2 Kings,18,3,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was right{H3477} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, according to all that David{H1732} his father{H1} did{H6213}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,18,4,"He removed{H5493}{(H8689)} the high places{H1116}, and brake{H7665}{(H8765)} the images{H4676}, and cut down{H3772}{(H8804)} the groves{H842}, and brake in pieces{H3807}{(H8765)} the brasen{H5178} serpent{H5175} that Moses{H4872} had made{H6213}{(H8804)}: for unto those days{H3117} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} did burn incense{H6999}{(H8764)} to it: and he called{H7121}{(H8799)} it Nehushtan{H5180}."
2 Kings,18,5,"He trusted{H982}{(H8804)} in the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; so that after{H310} him was none like him among all the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, nor any that were before{H6440} him."
2 Kings,18,6,"For he clave{H1692}{(H8799)} to the LORD{H3068}, and departed{H5493}{(H8804)} not from following{H310} him, but kept{H8104}{(H8799)} his commandments{H4687}, which the LORD{H3068} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} Moses{H4872}."
2 Kings,18,7,"And the LORD{H3068} was with him; and he prospered{H7919}{(H8686)} whithersoever he went forth{H3318}{(H8799)}: and he rebelled{H4775}{(H8799)} against the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}, and served{H5647}{(H8804)} him not."
2 Kings,18,8,"He smote{H5221}{(H8689)} the Philistines{H6430}, even unto Gaza{H5804}, and the borders{H1366} thereof, from the tower{H4026} of the watchmen{H5341}{(H8802)} to the fenced{H4013} city{H5892}."
2 Kings,18,9,"And it came to pass in the fourth{H7243} year{H8141} of king{H4428} Hezekiah{H2396}, which was the seventh{H7637} year{H8141} of Hoshea{H1954} son{H1121} of Elah{H425} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, that Shalmaneser{H8022} king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} came up{H5927}{(H8804)} against Samaria{H8111}, and besieged{H6696}{(H8799)} it."
2 Kings,18,10,"And at the end{H7097} of three{H7969} years{H8141} they took{H3920}{(H8799)} it: even in the sixth{H8337} year{H8141} of Hezekiah{H2396}, that is the ninth{H8672} year{H8141} of Hoshea{H1954} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, Samaria{H8111} was taken{H3920}{(H8738)}."
2 Kings,18,11,"And the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} did carry away{H1540}{(H8686)} Israel{H3478} unto Assyria{H804}, and put{H5148}{(H8686)} them in Halah{H2477} and in Habor{H2249} by the river{H5104} of Gozan{H1470}, and in the cities{H5892} of the Medes{H4074}:"
2 Kings,18,12,"Because they obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} not the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, but transgressed{H5674}{(H8799)} his covenant{H1285}, and all that Moses{H4872} the servant{H5650} of the LORD{H3068} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}, and would not hear{H8085}{(H8804)} them, nor do{H6213}{(H8804)} them."
2 Kings,18,13,"Now in the fourteenth{H702}{H6240} year{H8141} of king{H4428} Hezekiah{H2396} did Sennacherib{H5576} king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} come up{H5927}{(H8804)} against all the fenced{H1219}{(H8803)} cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}, and took{H8610}{(H8799)} them."
2 Kings,18,14,"And Hezekiah{H2396} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} to Lachish{H3923}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I have offended{H2398}{(H8804)}; return{H7725}{(H8798)} from me: that which thou puttest{H5414}{(H8799)} on me will I bear{H5375}{(H8799)}. And the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} appointed{H7760}{(H8799)} unto Hezekiah{H2396} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} three{H7969} hundred{H3967} talents{H3603} of silver{H3701} and thirty{H7970} talents{H3603} of gold{H2091}."
2 Kings,18,15,"And Hezekiah{H2396} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him all the silver{H3701} that was found{H4672}{(H8737)} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and in the treasures{H214} of the king's{H4428} house{H1004}."
2 Kings,18,16,"At that time{H6256} did Hezekiah{H2396} cut off{H7112}{(H8765)} the gold from the doors{H1817} of the temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068}, and from the pillars{H547} which Hezekiah{H2396} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} had overlaid{H6823}{(H8765)}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} it to the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}."
2 Kings,18,17,"And the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Tartan{H8661} and Rabsaris{H7249} and Rabshakeh{H7262} from Lachish{H3923} to king{H4428} Hezekiah{H2396} with a great{H3515} host{H2426} against Jerusalem{H3389}. And they went up{H5927}{(H8799)} and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}. And when they were come up{H5927}{(H8799)}, they came{H935}{(H8799)} and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} by the conduit{H8585} of the upper{H5945} pool{H1295}, which is in the highway{H4546} of the fuller's{H3526}{(H8801)} field{H7704}."
2 Kings,18,18,"And when they had called{H7121}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428}, there came out{H3318}{(H8799)} to them Eliakim{H471} the son{H1121} of Hilkiah{H2518}, which was over the household{H1004}, and Shebna{H7644} the scribe{H5608}{(H8802)}, and Joah{H3098} the son{H1121} of Asaph{H623} the recorder{H2142}{(H8688)}."
2 Kings,18,19,"And Rabshakeh{H7262} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Speak{H559}{(H8798)} ye now to Hezekiah{H2396}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the great{H1419} king{H4428}, the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}, What confidence{H986} is this wherein thou trustest{H982}{(H8804)}?"
2 Kings,18,20,"Thou sayest{H559}{(H8804)},(but they are but vain{H8193} words{H1697},) I have counsel{H6098} and strength{H1369} for the war{H4421}. Now on whom dost thou trust{H982}{(H8804)}, that thou rebellest{H4775}{(H8804)} against me?"
2 Kings,18,21,"Now, behold, thou trustest{H982}{(H8804)} upon the staff{H4938} of this bruised{H7533}{(H8803)} reed{H7070}, even upon Egypt{H4714}, on which if a man{H376} lean{H5564}{(H8735)}, it will go{H935}{(H8804)} into his hand{H3709}, and pierce{H5344}{(H8804)} it: so is Pharaoh{H6547} king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714} unto all that trust{H982}{(H8802)} on him."
2 Kings,18,22,"But if ye say{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, We trust{H982}{(H8804)} in the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}: is not that he, whose high places{H1116} and whose altars{H4196} Hezekiah{H2396} hath taken away{H5493}{(H8689)}, and hath said{H559}{(H8799)} to Judah{H3063} and Jerusalem{H3389}, Ye shall worship{H7812}{(H8691)} before{H6440} this altar{H4196} in Jerusalem{H3389}?"
2 Kings,18,23,"Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges{H6148}{(H8690)} to my lord{H113} the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}, and I will deliver{H5414}{(H8799)} thee two thousand{H505} horses{H5483}, if thou be able{H3201}{(H8799)} on thy part to set{H5414}{(H8800)} riders{H7392}{(H8802)} upon them."
2 Kings,18,24,"How then wilt thou turn away{H7725}{(H8686)} the face{H6440} of one{H259} captain{H6346} of the least{H6996} of my master's{H113} servants{H5650}, and put thy trust{H982}{(H8799)} on Egypt{H4714} for chariots{H7393} and for horsemen{H6571}?"
2 Kings,18,25,"Am I now come up{H5927}{(H8804)} without{H1107} the LORD{H3068} against this place{H4725} to destroy{H7843}{(H8687)} it? The LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8804)} to me, Go up{H5927}{(H8798)} against this land{H776}, and destroy{H7843}{(H8685)} it."
2 Kings,18,26,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Eliakim{H471} the son{H1121} of Hilkiah{H2518}, and Shebna{H7644}, and Joah{H3098}, unto Rabshakeh{H7262}, Speak{H1696}{(H8761)}, I pray thee, to thy servants{H5650} in the Syrian language{H762}; for we understand{H8085}{(H8802)} it: and talk{H1696}{(H8762)} not with us in the Jews' language{H3066} in the ears{H241} of the people{H5971} that are on the wall{H2346}."
2 Kings,18,27,"But Rabshakeh{H7262} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Hath my master{H113} sent{H7971}{(H8804)} me to thy master{H113}, and to thee, to speak{H1696}{(H8763)} these words{H1697}? hath he not sent me to the men{H582} which sit{H3427}{(H8802)} on the wall{H2346}, that they may eat{H398}{(H8800)} their own dung{H6675}{(H8675)}{H2755}, and drink{H8354}{(H8800)} their own piss{H4325}{H7272}{(H8675)}{H7890} with you?"
2 Kings,18,28,"Then Rabshakeh{H7262} stood{H5975}{(H8799)} and cried{H7121}{(H8799)} with a loud{H1419} voice{H6963} in the Jews' language{H3066}, and spake{H1696}{(H8762)}, saying{H559}{(H8799)}, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the great{H1419} king{H4428}, the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}:"
2 Kings,18,29,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the king{H4428}, Let not Hezekiah{H2396} deceive{H5377}{(H8686)} you: for he shall not be able{H3201}{(H8799)} to deliver{H5337}{(H8687)} you out of his hand{H3027}:"
2 Kings,18,30,"Neither let Hezekiah{H2396} make you trust{H982}{(H8686)} in the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The LORD{H3068} will surely{H5337}{(H8687)} deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} us, and this city{H5892} shall not be delivered{H5414}{(H8735)} into the hand{H3027} of the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}."
2 Kings,18,31,"Hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} not to Hezekiah{H2396}: for thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}, Make{H6213}{(H8798)} an agreement with me by a present{H1293}, and come out{H3318}{(H8798)} to me, and then eat{H398}{(H8798)} ye every man{H376} of his own vine{H1612}, and every one{H376} of his fig tree{H8384}, and drink{H8354}{(H8798)} ye every one{H376} the waters{H4325} of his cistern{H953}:"
2 Kings,18,32,"Until I come{H935}{(H8800)} and take you away{H3947}{(H8804)} to a land{H776} like your own land{H776}, a land{H776} of corn{H1715} and wine{H8492}, a land{H776} of bread{H3899} and vineyards{H3754}, a land{H776} of oil{H3323} olive{H2132} and of honey{H1706}, that ye may live{H2421}{(H8798)}, and not die{H4191}{(H8799)}: and hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} not unto Hezekiah{H2396}, when he persuadeth{H5496}{(H8686)} you, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The LORD{H3068} will deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} us."
2 Kings,18,33,Hath any{H376} of the gods{H430} of the nations{H1471} delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} at all{H5337}{(H8687)} his land{H776} out of the hand{H3027} of the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}?
2 Kings,18,34,"Where are the gods{H430} of Hamath{H2574}, and of Arpad{H774}? where are the gods{H430} of Sepharvaim{H5617}, Hena{H2012}, and Ivah{H5755}? have they delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} Samaria{H8111} out of mine hand{H3027}?"

2 Kings,18,36,"But the people{H5971} held their peace{H2790}{(H8689)}, and answered{H6030}{(H8804)} him not a word{H1697}: for the king's{H4428} commandment{H4687} was, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Answer{H6030}{(H8799)} him not."
2 Kings,18,37,"Then came{H935}{(H8799)} Eliakim{H471} the son{H1121} of Hilkiah{H2518}, which was over the household{H1004}, and Shebna{H7644} the scribe{H5608}{(H8802)}, and Joah{H3098} the son{H1121} of Asaph{H623} the recorder{H2142}{(H8688)}, to Hezekiah{H2396} with their clothes{H899} rent{H7167}{(H8803)}, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} him the words{H1697} of Rabshakeh{H7262}."
2 Kings,19,1,"And it came to pass, when king{H4428} Hezekiah{H2396} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} it, that he rent{H7167}{(H8799)} his clothes{H899}, and covered{H3680}{(H8691)} himself with sackcloth{H8242}, and went{H935}{(H8799)} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,19,2,"And he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Eliakim{H471}, which was over the household{H1004}, and Shebna{H7644} the scribe{H5608}{(H8802)}, and the elders{H2205} of the priests{H3548}, covered{H3680}{(H8693)} with sackcloth{H8242}, to Isaiah{H3470} the prophet{H5030} the son{H1121} of Amoz{H531}."
2 Kings,19,3,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} Hezekiah{H2396}, This day{H3117} is a day{H3117} of trouble{H6869}, and of rebuke{H8433}, and blasphemy{H5007}: for the children{H1121} are come{H935}{(H8804)} to the birth{H4866}, and there is not strength{H3581} to bring forth{H3205}{(H8800)}."
2 Kings,19,4,"It may be{H194} the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} will hear{H8085}{(H8799)} all the words{H1697} of Rabshakeh{H7262}, whom the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} his master{H113} hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} to reproach{H2778}{(H8763)} the living{H2416} God{H430}; and will reprove{H3198}{(H8689)} the words{H1697} which the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} hath heard{H8085}{(H8804)}: wherefore lift up{H5375}{(H8804)} thy prayer{H8605} for the remnant{H7611} that are left{H4672}{(H8737)}."
2 Kings,19,5,So the servants{H5650} of king{H4428} Hezekiah{H2396} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Isaiah{H3470}.
2 Kings,19,6,"And Isaiah{H3470} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Thus shall ye say{H559}{(H8799)} to your master{H113}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Be not afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} of{H6440} the words{H1697} which thou hast heard{H8085}{(H8804)}, with which the servants{H5288} of the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} have blasphemed{H1442}{(H8765)} me."
2 Kings,19,7,"Behold, I will send{H5414}{(H8802)} a blast{H7307} upon him, and he shall hear{H8085}{(H8804)} a rumour{H8052}, and shall return{H7725}{(H8804)} to his own land{H776}; and I will cause him to fall{H5307}{(H8689)} by the sword{H2719} in his own land{H776}."

2 Kings,19,9,"And when he heard{H8085}{(H8799)} say{H559}{(H8800)} of Tirhakah{H8640} king{H4428} of Ethiopia{H3568}, Behold, he is come out{H3318}{(H8804)} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} against thee: he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} again{H7725}{(H8799)} unto Hezekiah{H2396}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
2 Kings,19,10,"Thus shall ye speak{H559}{(H8799)} to Hezekiah{H2396} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Let not thy God{H430} in whom thou trustest{H982}{(H8802)} deceive{H5377}{(H8686)} thee, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Jerusalem{H3389} shall not be delivered{H5414}{(H8735)} into the hand{H3027} of the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}."

2 Kings,19,15,"And Hezekiah{H2396} prayed{H6419}{(H8691)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, O LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, which dwellest{H3427}{(H8802)} between the cherubims{H3742}, thou art the God{H430}, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms{H4467} of the earth{H776}; thou hast made{H6213}{(H8804)} heaven{H8064} and earth{H776}."
2 Kings,19,16,"LORD{H3068}, bow down{H5186}{(H8685)} thine ear{H241}, and hear{H8085}{(H8798)}: open{H6491}{(H8798)}, LORD{H3068}, thine eyes{H5869}, and see{H7200}{(H8798)}: and hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the words{H1697} of Sennacherib{H5576}, which hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} him to reproach{H2778}{(H8763)} the living{H2416} God{H430}."

2 Kings,19,18,"And have cast{H5414}{(H8804)} their gods{H430} into the fire{H784}: for they were no gods{H430}, but the work{H4639} of men's{H120} hands{H3027}, wood{H6086} and stone{H68}: therefore they have destroyed{H6}{(H8762)} them."
2 Kings,19,19,"Now therefore, O LORD{H3068} our God{H430}, I beseech thee, save{H3467}{(H8685)} thou us out of his hand{H3027}, that all the kingdoms{H4467} of the earth{H776} may know{H3045}{(H8799)} that thou art the LORD{H3068} God{H430}, even thou only."
2 Kings,19,20,"Then Isaiah{H3470} the son{H1121} of Amoz{H531} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Hezekiah{H2396}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, That which thou hast prayed{H6419}{(H8694)} to me against Sennacherib{H5576} king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,19,21,"This is the word{H1697} that the LORD{H3068} hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} concerning him; The virgin{H1330} the daughter{H1323} of Zion{H6726} hath despised{H959}{(H8804)} thee, and laughed thee to scorn{H3932}{(H8804)}; the daughter{H1323} of Jerusalem{H3389} hath shaken{H5128}{(H8689)} her head{H7218} at thee{H310}."

2 Kings,19,23,"By{H3027} thy messengers{H4397} thou hast reproached{H2778}{(H8765)} the Lord{H136}, and hast said{H559}{(H8799)}, With the multitude{H7230} of my chariots{H7393}{(H8675)}{H7393} I am come up{H5927}{(H8804)} to the height{H4791} of the mountains{H2022}, to the sides{H3411} of Lebanon{H3844}, and will cut down{H3772}{(H8799)} the tall{H6967} cedar trees{H730} thereof, and the choice{H4004} fir trees{H1265} thereof: and I will enter{H935}{(H8799)} into the lodgings{H4411} of his borders{H7093}, and into the forest{H3293} of his Carmel{H3760}."
2 Kings,19,24,"I have digged{H6979}{(H8804)} and drunk{H8354}{(H8804)} strange{H2114}{(H8801)} waters{H4325}, and with the sole{H3709} of my feet{H6471} have I dried{H2717}{(H8686)} up all the rivers{H2975} of besieged places{H4693}."
2 Kings,19,25,"Hast thou not heard{H8085}{(H8804)} long ago{H7350} how I have done{H6213}{(H8804)} it, and of ancient{H6924} times{H3117} that I have formed{H3335}{(H8804)} it? now have I brought{H935}{(H8689)} it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste{H7582}{(H8687)} fenced{H1219}{(H8803)} cities{H5892} into ruinous{H5327}{(H8737)} heaps{H1530}."
2 Kings,19,26,"Therefore their inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} were of small{H7116} power{H3027}, they were dismayed{H2865}{(H8804)} and confounded{H954}{(H8799)}; they were as the grass{H6212} of the field{H7704}, and as the green{H3419} herb{H1877}, as the grass{H2682} on the housetops{H1406}, and as corn blasted{H7711} before{H6440} it be grown up{H7054}."
2 Kings,19,27,"But I know{H3045}{(H8804)} thy abode{H3427}{(H8800)}, and thy going out{H3318}{(H8800)}, and thy coming in{H935}{(H8800)}, and thy rage{H7264}{(H8692)} against me."
2 Kings,19,28,"Because thy rage{H7264}{(H8692)} against me and thy tumult{H7600} is come up{H5927}{(H8804)} into mine ears{H241}, therefore I will put{H7760}{(H8804)} my hook{H2397} in thy nose{H639}, and my bridle{H4964} in thy lips{H8193}, and I will turn thee back{H7725}{(H8689)} by the way{H1870} by which thou camest{H935}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,19,29,"And this shall be a sign{H226} unto thee, Ye shall eat{H398}{(H8800)} this year{H8141} such things as grow{H5599} of themselves, and in the second{H8145} year{H8141} that which springeth{H7823} of the same; and in the third{H7992} year{H8141} sow{H2232}{(H8798)} ye, and reap{H7114}{(H8798)}, and plant{H5193}{(H8798)} vineyards{H3754}, and eat{H398}{(H8798)} the fruits{H6529} thereof."
2 Kings,19,30,"And the remnant{H7604}{(H8737)} that is escaped{H6413} of the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063} shall yet again{H3254}{(H8804)} take root{H8328} downward{H4295}, and bear{H6213}{(H8804)} fruit{H6529} upward{H4605}."
2 Kings,19,31,"For out of Jerusalem{H3389} shall go forth{H3318}{(H8799)} a remnant{H7611}, and they that escape{H6413} out of mount{H2022} Zion{H6726}: the zeal{H7068} of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{(H8675)}{H6635} shall do{H6213}{(H8799)} this."
2 Kings,19,32,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} concerning the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}, He shall not come{H935}{(H8799)} into this city{H5892}, nor shoot{H3384}{(H8686)} an arrow{H2671} there, nor come before{H6923}{(H8762)} it with shield{H4043}, nor cast{H8210}{(H8799)} a bank{H5550} against it."
2 Kings,19,33,"By the way{H1870} that he came{H935}{(H8799)}, by the same shall he return{H7725}{(H8799)}, and shall not come{H935}{(H8799)} into this city{H5892}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,19,34,"For I will defend{H1598}{(H8804)} this city{H5892}, to save{H3467}{(H8687)} it, for mine own sake, and for my servant{H5650} David's{H1732} sake."
2 Kings,19,35,"And it came to pass that night{H3915}, that the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} went out{H3318}{(H8799)}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} in the camp{H4264} of the Assyrians{H804} an hundred{H3967} fourscore{H8084} and five{H2568} thousand{H505}: and when they arose early{H7925}{(H8686)} in the morning{H1242}, behold, they were all dead{H4191}{(H8801)} corpses{H6297}."
2 Kings,19,36,"So Sennacherib{H5576} king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} departed{H5265}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} and returned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} at Nineveh{H5210}."
2 Kings,19,37,"And it came to pass, as he was worshipping{H7812}{(H8693)} in the house{H1004} of Nisroch{H5268} his god{H430}, that Adrammelech{H152} and Sharezer{H8272} his sons{H1121} smote{H5221}{(H8689)} him with the sword{H2719}: and they escaped{H4422}{(H8738)} into the land{H776} of Armenia{H780}.

2 Kings,20,1,"In those days{H3117} was Hezekiah{H2396} sick{H2470}{(H8804)} unto death{H4191}{(H8800)}.

2 Kings,20,7,"And Isaiah{H3470} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} a lump{H1690} of figs{H8384}. And they took{H3947}{(H8799)} and laid{H7760}{(H8799)} it on the boil{H7822}, and he recovered{H2421}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,20,8,"And Hezekiah{H2396} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Isaiah{H3470}, What shall be the sign{H226} that the LORD{H3068} will heal{H7495}{(H8799)} me, and that I shall go up{H5927}{(H8804)} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} the third{H7992} day{H3117}?"
2 Kings,20,9,"And Isaiah{H3470} said{H559}{(H8799)}, This sign{H226} shalt thou have of the LORD{H3068}, that the LORD{H3068} will do{H6213}{(H8799)} the thing{H1697} that he hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}: shall the shadow{H6738} go forward{H1980}{(H8804)} ten{H6235} degrees{H4609}, or go back{H7725}{(H8799)} ten{H6235} degrees{H4609}?"
2 Kings,20,10,"And Hezekiah{H3169} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, It is a light thing{H7043}{(H8738)} for the shadow{H6738} to go down{H5186}{(H8800)} ten{H6235} degrees{H4609}: nay, but let the shadow{H6738} return{H7725}{(H8799)} backward{H322} ten{H6235} degrees{H4609}."
2 Kings,20,11,"And Isaiah{H3470} the prophet{H5030} cried{H7121}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}: and he brought{H7725}{(H8686)} the shadow{H6738} ten{H6235} degrees{H4609} backward{H322}, by{H4609} which it had gone down{H3381}{(H8804)} in the dial{H4609} of Ahaz{H271}."
2 Kings,20,12,"At that time{H6256} Berodachbaladan{H1255}, the son{H1121} of Baladan{H1081}, king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, sent{H7971}{(H8804)} letters{H5612} and a present{H4503} unto Hezekiah{H2396}: for he had heard{H8085}{(H8804)} that Hezekiah{H2396} had been sick{H2470}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,20,13,"And Hezekiah{H2396} hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} unto them, and shewed{H7200}{(H8686)} them all the house{H1004} of his precious things{H5238}, the silver{H3701}, and the gold{H2091}, and the spices{H1314}, and the precious{H2896} ointment{H8081}, and all the house{H1004} of his armour{H3627}, and all that was found{H4672}{(H8738)} in his treasures{H214}: there was nothing{H1697} in his house{H1004}, nor in all his dominion{H4475}, that Hezekiah{H2396} shewed{H7200}{(H8689)} them not."
2 Kings,20,14,"Then came{H935}{(H8799)} Isaiah{H3470} the prophet{H5030} unto king{H4428} Hezekiah{H2396}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, What said{H559}{(H8804)} these men{H582}? and from whence{H370} came{H935}{(H8799)} they unto thee? And Hezekiah{H2396} said{H559}{(H8799)}, They are come{H935}{(H8804)} from a far{H7350} country{H776}, even from Babylon{H894}."
2 Kings,20,15,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, What have they seen{H7200}{(H8804)} in thine house{H1004}? And Hezekiah{H2396} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, All the things that are in mine house{H1004} have they seen{H7200}{(H8804)}: there is nothing{H1697} among my treasures{H214} that I have not shewed{H7200}{(H8689)} them."
2 Kings,20,16,"And Isaiah{H3470} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Hezekiah{H2396}, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,20,17,"Behold, the days{H3117} come{H935}{(H8802)}, that all that is in thine house{H1004}, and that which thy fathers{H1} have laid up in store{H686}{(H8804)} unto this day{H3117}, shall be carried{H5375}{(H8738)} into Babylon{H894}: nothing{H1697} shall be left{H3498}{(H8735)}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,20,18,"And of thy sons{H1121} that shall issue{H3318}{(H8799)} from thee, which thou shalt beget{H3205}{(H8686)}, shall they take away{H3947}{(H8799)}; and they shall be eunuchs{H5631} in the palace{H1964} of the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}."
2 Kings,20,19,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Hezekiah{H2396} unto Isaiah{H3470}, Good{H2896} is the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} which thou hast spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is it not good, if peace{H7965} and truth{H571} be in my days{H3117}?"
2 Kings,20,20,"And the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Hezekiah{H2396}, and all his might{H1369}, and how he made{H6213}{(H8804)} a pool{H1295}, and a conduit{H8585}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} water{H4325} into the city{H5892}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}?"
2 Kings,20,21,And Hezekiah{H2396} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}: and Manasseh{H4519} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead.
2 Kings,21,1,"Manasseh{H4519} was twelve{H8147}{H6240} years{H8141} old{H1121} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, and reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} fifty{H2572} and five{H2568} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Hephzibah{H2657}."
2 Kings,21,2,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, after the abominations{H8441} of the heathen{H1471}, whom the LORD{H3068} cast out{H3423}{(H8689)} before{H6440} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Kings,21,3,"For he built up{H1129}{(H8799)} again{H7725}{(H8799)} the high places{H1116} which Hezekiah{H2396} his father{H1} had destroyed{H6}{(H8765)}; and he reared up{H6965}{(H8686)} altars{H4196} for Baal{H1168}, and made{H6213}{(H8799)} a grove{H842}, as did{H6213}{(H8804)} Ahab{H256} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}; and worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)} all the host{H6635} of heaven{H8064}, and served{H5647}{(H8799)} them."
2 Kings,21,4,"And he built{H1129}{(H8804)} altars{H4196} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, of which the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8804)}, In Jerusalem{H3389} will I put{H7760}{(H8799)} my name{H8034}."
2 Kings,21,5,And he built{H1129}{(H8799)} altars{H4196} for all the host{H6635} of heaven{H8064} in the two{H8147} courts{H2691} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}.
2 Kings,21,6,"And he made his son{H1121} pass{H5674}{(H8689)} through the fire{H784}, and observed times{H6049}{(H8782)}, and used enchantments{H5172}{(H8765)}, and dealt{H6213}{(H8804)} with familiar spirits{H178} and wizards{H3049}: he wrought{H6213}{(H8800)} much{H7235}{(H8689)} wickedness{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, to provoke him to anger{H3707}{(H8687)}."
2 Kings,21,7,"And he set{H7760}{(H8799)} a graven image{H6459} of the grove{H842} that he had made{H6213}{(H8804)} in the house{H1004}, of which the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8804)} to David{H1732}, and to Solomon{H8010} his son{H1121}, In this house{H1004}, and in Jerusalem{H3389}, which I have chosen{H977}{(H8804)} out of all tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}, will I put{H7760}{(H8799)} my name{H8034} for ever{H5769}:"
2 Kings,21,8,"Neither will I make the feet{H7272} of Israel{H3478} move{H5110}{(H8687)} any more{H3254}{(H8686)} out of the land{H127} which I gave{H5414}{(H8804)} their fathers{H1}; only if they will observe{H8104}{(H8799)} to do{H6213}{(H8800)} according to all that I have commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} them, and according to all the law{H8451} that my servant{H5650} Moses{H4872} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} them."
2 Kings,21,9,But they hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not: and Manasseh{H4519} seduced{H8582}{(H8686)} them to do{H6213}{(H8800)} more evil{H7451} than did the nations{H1471} whom the LORD{H3068} destroyed{H8045}{(H8689)} before{H6440} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}.
2 Kings,21,10,"And the LORD{H3068} spake{H1696}{(H8762)} by{H3027} his servants{H5650} the prophets{H5030}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
2 Kings,21,11,"Because Manasseh{H4519} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} these abominations{H8441}, and hath done wickedly{H7489}{(H8689)} above all that the Amorites{H567} did{H6213}{(H8804)}, which were before{H6440} him, and hath made Judah{H3063} also to sin{H2398}{(H8686)} with his idols{H1544}:"
2 Kings,21,12,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, Behold, I am bringing{H935}{(H8688)} such evil{H7451} upon Jerusalem{H3389} and Judah{H3063}, that whosoever heareth{H8085}{(H8802)} of it, both{H8147} his ears{H241} shall tingle{H6750}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,21,13,"And I will stretch{H5186}{(H8804)} over Jerusalem{H3389} the line{H6957} of Samaria{H8111}, and the plummet{H4949} of the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256}: and I will wipe{H4229}{(H8804)} Jerusalem{H3389} as a man wipeth{H4229}{(H8799)} a dish{H6747}, wiping{H4229}{(H8804)} it, and turning{H2015}{(H8804)} it upside down{H6440}."
2 Kings,21,14,"And I will forsake{H5203}{(H8804)} the remnant{H7611} of mine inheritance{H5159}, and deliver{H5414}{(H8804)} them into the hand{H3027} of their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}; and they shall become a prey{H957} and a spoil{H4933} to all their enemies{H341}{(H8802)};"
2 Kings,21,15,"Because they have done{H6213}{(H8804)} that which was evil{H7451} in my sight{H5869}, and have provoked{H4480} me to anger{H3707}{(H8688)}, since the day{H3117} their fathers{H1} came forth{H3318}{(H8804)} out of Egypt{H4714}, even unto this day{H3117}."
2 Kings,21,16,"Moreover Manasseh{H4519} shed{H8210}{(H8804)} innocent{H5355} blood{H1818} very{H3966} much{H7235}{(H8687)}, till he had filled{H4390}{(H8765)} Jerusalem{H3389} from one end{H6310} to another{H6310}; beside his sin{H2403} wherewith he made Judah{H3063} to sin{H2398}{(H8689)}, in doing{H6213}{(H8800)} that which was evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,21,17,"Now the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Manasseh{H4519}, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, and his sin{H2403} that he sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}?"
2 Kings,21,18,"And Manasseh{H4519} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} in the garden{H1588} of his own house{H1004}, in the garden{H1588} of Uzza{H5798}: and Amon{H526} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead."
2 Kings,21,19,"Amon{H526} was twenty{H6242} and two{H8147} years{H8141} old{H1121} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} two{H8147} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Meshullemeth{H4922}, the daughter{H1323} of Haruz{H2743} of Jotbah{H3192}."
2 Kings,21,20,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, as his father{H1} Manasseh{H4519} did{H6213}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,21,21,"And he walked{H3212}{(H8799)} in all the way{H1870} that his father{H1} walked in{H1980}{(H8804)}, and served{H5647}{(H8799)} the idols{H1544} that his father{H1} served{H5647}{(H8804)}, and worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)} them:"
2 Kings,21,22,"And he forsook{H5800}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of his fathers{H1}, and walked{H1980}{(H8804)} not in the way{H1870} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,21,23,"And the servants{H5650} of Amon{H526} conspired{H7194}{(H8799)} against him, and slew{H4191}{(H8686)} the king{H4428} in his own house{H1004}."
2 Kings,21,24,And the people{H5971} of the land{H776} slew{H5221}{(H8686)} all them that had conspired{H7194}{(H8802)} against king{H4428} Amon{H526}; and the people{H5971} of the land{H776} made Josiah{H2977} his son{H1121} king{H4427}{(H8686)} in his stead.
2 Kings,21,25,"Now the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Amon{H526} which he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}?"
2 Kings,21,26,And he was buried{H6912}{(H8799)} in his sepulchre{H6900} in the garden{H1588} of Uzza{H5798}: and Josiah{H2977} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead.

2 Kings,22,14,"So Hilkiah{H2518} the priest{H3548}, and Ahikam{H296}, and Achbor{H5907}, and Shaphan{H8227}, and Asahiah{H6222}, went{H3212}{(H8799)} unto Huldah{H2468} the prophetess{H5031}, the wife{H802} of Shallum{H7967} the son{H1121} of Tikvah{H8616}, the son{H1121} of Harhas{H2745}, keeper{H8104}{(H8802)} of the wardrobe{H899};(now she dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} in Jerusalem{H3389} in the college{H4932};) and they communed{H1696}{(H8762)} with her."
2 Kings,22,15,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, Tell{H559}{(H8798)} the man{H376} that sent{H7971}{(H8804)} you to me,"
2 Kings,22,16,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Behold, I will bring{H935}{(H8688)} evil{H7451} upon this place{H4725}, and upon the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} thereof, even all the words{H1697} of the book{H5612} which the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} hath read{H7121}{(H8804)}:"
2 Kings,22,17,"Because they have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} me, and have burned incense{H6999}{(H8762)} unto other{H312} gods{H430}, that they might provoke me to anger{H3707}{(H8687)} with all the works{H4639} of their hands{H3027}; therefore my wrath{H2534} shall be kindled{H3341}{(H8738)} against this place{H4725}, and shall not be quenched{H3518}{(H8799)}."
2 Kings,22,18,"But to the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} which sent{H7971}{(H8802)} you to enquire{H1875}{(H8800)} of the LORD{H3068}, thus shall ye say{H559}{(H8799)} to him, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, As touching the words{H1697} which thou hast heard{H8085}{(H8804)};"
2 Kings,22,19,"Because thine heart{H3824} was tender{H7401}{(H8804)}, and thou hast humbled{H3665}{(H8735)} thyself before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, when thou heardest{H8085}{(H8800)} what I spake{H1696}{(H8765)} against this place{H4725}, and against the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} thereof, that they should become a desolation{H8047} and a curse{H7045}, and hast rent{H7167}{(H8799)} thy clothes{H899}, and wept{H1058}{(H8799)} before{H6440} me; I also have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} thee, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,22,20,"Behold therefore, I will gather{H622}{(H8802)} thee unto thy fathers{H1}, and thou shalt be gathered{H622}{(H8738)} into thy grave{H6913} in peace{H7965}; and thine eyes{H5869} shall not see{H7200}{(H8799)} all the evil{H7451} which I will bring{H935}{(H8688)} upon this place{H4725}. And they brought{H7725} the king{H4428} word{H1697} again{H7725}{(H8686)}."
2 Kings,23,1,"And the king{H4428} sent{H7971}{(H8799)}, and they gathered{H622}{(H8799)} unto him all the elders{H2205} of Judah{H3063} and of Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Kings,23,2,"And the king{H4428} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and all the men{H376} of Judah{H3063} and all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389} with him, and the priests{H3548}, and the prophets{H5030}, and all the people{H5971}, both small{H6996} and great{H1419}: and he read{H7121}{(H8799)} in their ears{H241} all the words{H1697} of the book{H5612} of the covenant{H1285} which was found{H4672}{(H8737)} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,23,3,"And the king{H4428} stood{H5975}{(H8799)} by a pillar{H5982}, and made{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, to walk{H3212}{(H8800)} after{H310} the LORD{H3068}, and to keep{H8104}{(H8800)} his commandments{H4687} and his testimonies{H5715} and his statutes{H2708} with all their heart{H3820} and all their soul{H5315}, to perform{H6965}{(H8687)} the words{H1697} of this covenant{H1285} that were written{H3789}{(H8803)} in this book{H5612}. And all the people{H5971} stood{H5975}{(H8799)} to the covenant{H1285}."
2 Kings,23,4,"And the king{H4428} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} Hilkiah{H2518} the high{H1419} priest{H3548}, and the priests{H3548} of the second order{H4932}, and the keepers{H8104}{(H8802)} of the door{H5592}, to bring forth{H3318}{(H8687)} out of the temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068} all the vessels{H3627} that were made{H6213}{(H8803)} for Baal{H1168}, and for the grove{H842}, and for all the host{H6635} of heaven{H8064}: and he burned{H8313}{(H8799)} them without{H2351} Jerusalem{H3389} in the fields{H7709} of Kidron{H6939}, and carried{H5375}{(H8804)} the ashes{H6083} of them unto Bethel{H1008}."
2 Kings,23,5,"And he put down{H7673}{(H8689)} the idolatrous priests{H3649}, whom the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063} had ordained{H5414}{(H8804)} to burn incense{H6999}{(H8762)} in the high places{H1116} in the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}, and in the places round about{H4524} Jerusalem{H3389}; them also that burned incense{H6999}{(H8764)} unto Baal{H1168}, to the sun{H8121}, and to the moon{H3394}, and to the planets{H4208}, and to all the host{H6635} of heaven{H8064}."
2 Kings,23,6,"And he brought out{H3318}{(H8686)} the grove{H842} from the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, without{H2351} Jerusalem{H3389}, unto the brook{H5158} Kidron{H6939}, and burned{H8313}{(H8799)} it at the brook{H5158} Kidron{H6939}, and stamped it small{H1854}{(H8686)} to powder{H6083}, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} the powder{H6083} thereof upon the graves{H6913} of the children{H1121} of the people{H5971}."
2 Kings,23,7,"And he brake down{H5422}{(H8799)} the houses{H1004} of the sodomites{H6945}, that were by the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, where the women{H802} wove{H707}{(H8802)} hangings{H1004} for the grove{H842}."
2 Kings,23,8,"And he brought{H935}{(H8686)} all the priests{H3548} out of the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}, and defiled{H2930}{(H8762)} the high places{H1116} where the priests{H3548} had burned incense{H6999}{(H8765)}, from Geba{H1387} to Beersheba{H884}, and brake down{H5422}{(H8804)} the high places{H1116} of the gates{H8179} that were in the entering in{H6607} of the gate{H8179} of Joshua{H3091} the governor{H8269} of the city{H5892}, which were on a man's{H376} left hand{H8040} at the gate{H8179} of the city{H5892}."
2 Kings,23,9,"Nevertheless the priests{H3548} of the high places{H1116} came not up{H5927}{(H8799)} to the altar{H4196} of the LORD{H3068} in Jerusalem{H3389}, but they did eat{H398}{(H8804)} of the unleavened bread{H4682} among{H8432} their brethren{H251}."
2 Kings,23,10,"And he defiled{H2930}{(H8765)} Topheth{H8612}, which is in the valley{H1516} of the children{H1121}{(H8675)}{H1121} of Hinnom{H2011}, that no man{H376} might make his son{H1121} or his daughter{H1323} to pass through{H5674}{(H8687)} the fire{H784} to Molech{H4432}."
2 Kings,23,11,"And he took away{H7673}{(H8686)} the horses{H5483} that the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063} had given{H5414}{(H8804)} to the sun{H8121}, at the entering in{H935}{(H8800)} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, by the chamber{H3957} of Nathanmelech{H5419} the chamberlain{H5631}, which was in the suburbs{H6503}, and burned{H8313}{(H8804)} the chariots{H4818} of the sun{H8121} with fire{H784}."
2 Kings,23,12,"And the altars{H4196} that were on the top{H1406} of the upper chamber{H5944} of Ahaz{H271}, which the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063} had made{H6213}{(H8804)}, and the altars{H4196} which Manasseh{H4519} had made{H6213}{(H8804)} in the two{H8147} courts{H2691} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, did the king{H4428} beat down{H5422}{(H8804)}, and brake them down{H7323}{(H8799)} from thence, and cast{H7993}{(H8689)} the dust{H6083} of them into the brook{H5158} Kidron{H6939}."
2 Kings,23,13,"And the high places{H1116} that were before{H6440} Jerusalem{H3389}, which were on the right hand{H3225} of the mount{H2022} of corruption{H4889}, which Solomon{H8010} the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} had builded{H1129}{(H8804)} for Ashtoreth{H6253} the abomination{H8251} of the Zidonians{H6722}, and for Chemosh{H3645} the abomination{H8251} of the Moabites{H4124}, and for Milcom{H4445} the abomination{H8441} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, did the king{H4428} defile{H2930}{(H8765)}."
2 Kings,23,14,"And he brake in pieces{H7665}{(H8765)} the images{H4676}, and cut down{H3772}{(H8799)} the groves{H842}, and filled{H4390}{(H8762)} their places{H4725} with the bones{H6106} of men{H120}."
2 Kings,23,15,"Moreover the altar{H4196} that was at Bethel{H1008}, and the high place{H1116} which Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Nebat{H5028}, who made Israel{H3478} to sin{H2398}{(H8689)}, had made{H6213}{(H8804)}, both that altar{H4196} and the high place{H1116} he brake down{H5422}{(H8804)}, and burned{H8313}{(H8799)} the high place{H1116}, and stamped{H1854}{(H8689)} it small to powder{H6083}, and burned{H8313}{(H8804)} the grove{H842}."
2 Kings,23,16,"And as Josiah{H2977} turned{H6437}{(H8799)} himself, he spied{H7200}{(H8799)} the sepulchres{H6913} that were there in the mount{H2022}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} the bones{H6106} out of the sepulchres{H6913}, and burned{H8313}{(H8799)} them upon the altar{H4196}, and polluted{H2930}{(H8762)} it, according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} which the man{H376} of God{H430} proclaimed{H7121}{(H8804)}, who proclaimed{H7121}{(H8804)} these words{H1697}."
2 Kings,23,17,"Then he said{H559}{(H8799)}, What title{H6725} is that{H1975} that I see{H7200}{(H8802)}? And the men{H582} of the city{H5892} told{H559}{(H8799)} him, It is the sepulchre{H6913} of the man{H376} of God{H430}, which came{H935}{(H8804)} from Judah{H3063}, and proclaimed{H7121}{(H8799)} these things{H1697} that thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)} against the altar{H4196} of Bethel{H1008}."
2 Kings,23,18,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let him alone{H3240}{(H8685)}; let no man{H376} move{H5128}{(H8686)} his bones{H6106}. So they let his bones{H6106} alone{H4422}{(H8762)}, with the bones{H6106} of the prophet{H5030} that came out{H935}{(H8804)} of Samaria{H8111}."
2 Kings,23,19,"And all the houses{H1004} also of the high places{H1116} that were in the cities{H5892} of Samaria{H8111}, which the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478} had made{H6213}{(H8804)} to provoke the LORD to anger{H3707}{(H8687)}, Josiah{H2977} took away{H5493}{(H8689)}, and did{H6213}{(H8799)} to them according to all the acts{H4639} that he had done{H6213}{(H8804)} in Bethel{H1008}."
2 Kings,23,20,"And he slew{H2076}{(H8799)} all the priests{H3548} of the high places{H1116} that were there upon the altars{H4196}, and burned{H8313}{(H8799)} men's{H120} bones{H6106} upon them, and returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Kings,23,21,"And the king{H4428} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} all the people{H5971}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Keep{H6213}{(H8798)} the passover{H6453} unto the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, as it is written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of this covenant{H1285}."
2 Kings,23,22,"Surely there was not holden{H6213}{(H8738)} such a passover{H6453} from the days{H3117} of the judges{H8199}{(H8802)} that judged{H8199}{(H8804)} Israel{H3478}, nor in all the days{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, nor of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063};"
2 Kings,23,23,"But in the eighteenth{H8083}{H6240} year{H8141} of king{H4428} Josiah{H2977}, wherein this passover{H6453} was holden{H6213}{(H8738)} to the LORD{H3068} in Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Kings,23,24,"Moreover the workers with familiar spirits{H178}, and the wizards{H3049}, and the images{H8655}, and the idols{H1544}, and all the abominations{H8251} that were spied{H7200}{(H8738)} in the land{H776} of Judah{H3063} and in Jerusalem{H3389}, did Josiah{H2977} put away{H1197}{(H8765)}, that he might perform{H6965}{(H8687)} the words{H1697} of the law{H8451} which were written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} that Hilkiah{H2518} the priest{H3548} found{H4672}{(H8804)} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Kings,23,25,"And like unto him was there no king{H4428} before{H6440} him, that turned{H7725}{(H8804)} to the LORD{H3068} with all his heart{H3824}, and with all his soul{H5315}, and with all his might{H3966}, according to all the law{H8451} of Moses{H4872}; neither after{H310} him arose{H6965}{(H8804)} there any like him."
2 Kings,23,26,"Notwithstanding the LORD{H3068} turned{H7725}{(H8804)} not from the fierceness{H2740} of his great{H1419} wrath{H639}, wherewith his anger{H639} was kindled{H2734}{(H8804)} against Judah{H3063}, because of all the provocations{H3708} that Manasseh{H4519} had provoked{H3707}{(H8689)} him withal."
2 Kings,23,27,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will remove{H5493}{(H8686)} Judah{H3063} also out of my sight{H6440}, as I have removed{H5493}{(H8689)} Israel{H3478}, and will cast off{H3988}{(H8804)} this city{H5892} Jerusalem{H3389} which I have chosen{H977}{(H8804)}, and the house{H1004} of which I said{H559}{(H8804)}, My name{H8034} shall be there."
2 Kings,23,28,"Now the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Josiah{H2977}, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}?"
2 Kings,23,29,"In his days{H3117} Pharaohnechoh{H6549} king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714} went up{H5927}{(H8804)} against the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} to the river{H5104} Euphrates{H6578}: and king{H4428} Josiah{H2977} went{H3212}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} him; and he slew{H4191}{(H8686)} him at Megiddo{H4023}, when he had seen{H7200}{(H8800)} him."
2 Kings,23,30,"And his servants{H5650} carried him in a chariot{H7392}{(H8686)} dead{H4191}{(H8801)} from Megiddo{H4023}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} him to Jerusalem{H3389}, and buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him in his own sepulchre{H6900}. And the people{H5971} of the land{H776} took{H3947}{(H8799)} Jehoahaz{H3059} the son{H1121} of Josiah{H2977}, and anointed{H4886}{(H8799)} him, and made him king{H4427}{(H8686)} in his father's{H1} stead."
2 Kings,23,31,"Jehoahaz{H3059} was twenty{H6242} and three{H7969} years{H8141} old{H1121} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}; and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} three{H7969} months{H2320} in Jerusalem{H3389}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Hamutal{H2537}, the daughter{H1323} of Jeremiah{H3414} of Libnah{H3841}."
2 Kings,23,32,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, according to all that his fathers{H1} had done{H6213}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,23,33,"And Pharaohnechoh{H6549} put him in bands{H631}{(H8799)} at Riblah{H7247} in the land{H776} of Hamath{H2574}, that he might not reign{H4427}{(H8800)} in Jerusalem{H3389}; and put{H5414}{(H8799)} the land{H776} to a tribute{H6066} of an hundred{H3967} talents{H3603} of silver{H3701}, and a talent{H3603} of gold{H2091}."
2 Kings,23,34,"And Pharaohnechoh{H6549} made Eliakim{H471} the son{H1121} of Josiah{H2977} king{H4427}{(H8686)} in the room of Josiah{H2977} his father{H1}, and turned{H5437}{(H8686)} his name{H8034} to Jehoiakim{H3079}, and took{H3947} Jehoahaz{H3059} away{H3947}{(H8804)}: and he came{H935}{(H8799)} to Egypt{H4714}, and died{H4191}{(H8799)} there."
2 Kings,23,35,"And Jehoiakim{H3079} gave{H5414}{(H8804)} the silver{H3701} and the gold{H2091} to Pharaoh{H6547}; but he taxed{H6186}{(H8689)} the land{H776} to give{H5414}{(H8800)} the money{H3701} according to the commandment{H6310} of Pharaoh{H6547}: he exacted{H5065}{(H8804)} the silver{H3701} and the gold{H2091} of the people{H5971} of the land{H776}, of every one{H376} according to his taxation{H6187}, to give{H5414}{(H8800)} it unto Pharaohnechoh{H6549}."
2 Kings,23,36,"Jehoiakim{H3079} was twenty{H6242} and five{H2568} years{H8141} old{H1121} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}; and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} eleven{H259}{H6240} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Zebudah{H2080}, the daughter{H1323} of Pedaiah{H6305} of Rumah{H7316}."
2 Kings,23,37,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, according to all that his fathers{H1} had done{H6213}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,24,1,"In his days{H3117} Nebuchadnezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} came up{H5927}{(H8804)}, and Jehoiakim{H3079} became his servant{H5650} three{H7969} years{H8141}: then he turned{H7725}{(H8799)} and rebelled{H4775}{(H8799)} against him."
2 Kings,24,2,"And the LORD{H3068} sent{H7971}{(H8762)} against him bands{H1416} of the Chaldees{H3778}, and bands{H1416} of the Syrians{H758}, and bands{H1416} of the Moabites{H4124}, and bands{H1416} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, and sent{H7971}{(H8762)} them against Judah{H3063} to destroy{H6}{(H8687)} it, according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} by{H3027} his servants{H5650} the prophets{H5030}."
2 Kings,24,3,"Surely at the commandment{H6310} of the LORD{H3068} came this upon Judah{H3063}, to remove{H5493}{(H8687)} them out of his sight{H6440}, for the sins{H2403} of Manasseh{H4519}, according to all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)};"
2 Kings,24,4,And also for the innocent{H5355} blood{H1818} that he shed{H8210}{(H8804)}: for he filled{H4390}{(H8762)} Jerusalem{H3389} with innocent{H5355} blood{H1818}; which the LORD{H3068} would{H14}{(H8804)} not pardon{H5545}{(H8800)}.
2 Kings,24,5,"Now the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Jehoiakim{H3079}, and all that he did{H6213}{(H8804)}, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}?"
2 Kings,24,6,So Jehoiakim{H3079} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}: and Jehoiachin{H3078} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead.
2 Kings,24,7,And the king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714} came{H3318}{(H8800)} not again{H3254}{(H8689)} any more out of his land{H776}: for the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} had taken{H3947}{(H8804)} from the river{H5158} of Egypt{H4714} unto the river{H5104} Euphrates{H6578} all that pertained to the king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714}.
2 Kings,24,8,"Jehoiachin{H3078} was eighteen{H8083}{H6240} years{H8141} old{H1121} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} in Jerusalem{H3389} three{H7969} months{H2320}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Nehushta{H5179}, the daughter{H1323} of Elnathan{H494} of Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Kings,24,9,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, according to all that his father{H1} had done{H6213}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,24,10,"At that time{H6256} the servants{H5650} of Nebuchadnezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} came up{H5927}{(H8804)} against Jerusalem{H3389}, and the city{H5892} was besieged{H935}{(H8799)}{H4692}."
2 Kings,24,11,"And Nebuchadnezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} came{H935}{(H8799)} against the city{H5892}, and his servants{H5650} did besiege{H6696}{(H8802)} it."
2 Kings,24,12,"And Jehoiachin{H3078} the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, he, and his mother{H517}, and his servants{H5650}, and his princes{H8269}, and his officers{H5631}: and the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} took{H3947}{(H8799)} him in the eighth{H8083} year{H8141} of his reign{H4427}{(H8800)}."
2 Kings,24,13,"And he carried out{H3318}{(H8686)} thence all the treasures{H214} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and the treasures{H214} of the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, and cut in pieces{H7112}{(H8762)} all the vessels{H3627} of gold{H2091} which Solomon{H8010} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} had made{H6213}{(H8804)} in the temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068}, as the LORD{H3068} had said{H1696}{(H8765)}."
2 Kings,24,14,"And he carried away{H1540}{(H8689)} all Jerusalem{H3389}, and all the princes{H8269}, and all the mighty men{H1368} of valour{H2428}, even ten{H6235} thousand{H505} captives{H1540}{(H8802)}, and all the craftsmen{H2796} and smiths{H4525}: none remained{H7604}{(H8738)}, save{H2108} the poorest sort{H1803} of the people{H5971} of the land{H776}."
2 Kings,24,15,"And he carried away{H1540}{(H8686)} Jehoiachin{H3078} to Babylon{H894}, and the king's{H4428} mother{H517}, and the king's{H4428} wives{H802}, and his officers{H5631}, and the mighty{H352}{(H8675)}{H193} of the land{H776}, those carried{H3212}{(H8689)} he into captivity{H1473} from Jerusalem{H3389} to Babylon{H894}."
2 Kings,24,16,"And all the men{H582} of might{H2428}, even seven{H7651} thousand{H505}, and craftsmen{H2796} and smiths{H4525} a thousand{H505}, all that were strong{H1368} and apt{H6213}{(H8802)} for war{H4421}, even them the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} brought{H935}{(H8686)} captive{H1473} to Babylon{H894}."
2 Kings,24,17,"And the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} made Mattaniah{H4983} his father's brother{H1730} king{H4427}{(H8686)} in his stead, and changed{H5437}{(H8686)} his name{H8034} to Zedekiah{H6667}."
2 Kings,24,18,"Zedekiah{H6667} was twenty{H6242} and one{H259} years{H8141} old{H1121} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} eleven{H259}{H6240} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Hamutal{H2537}, the daughter{H1323} of Jeremiah{H3414} of Libnah{H3841}."
2 Kings,24,19,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, according to all that Jehoiakim{H3079} had done{H6213}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,24,20,"For through the anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} it came to pass in Jerusalem{H3389} and Judah{H3063}, until he had cast them out{H7993}{(H8689)} from his presence{H6440}, that Zedekiah{H6667} rebelled{H4775}{(H8799)} against the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}."
2 Kings,25,1,"And it came to pass in the ninth{H8671} year{H8141} of his reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, in the tenth{H6224} month{H2320}, in the tenth{H6218} day of the month{H2320}, that Nebuchadnezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} came{H935}{(H8804)}, he, and all his host{H2428}, against Jerusalem{H3389}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} against it; and they built{H1129}{(H8799)} forts{H1785} against it round about{H5439}."
2 Kings,25,2,And the city{H5892} was besieged{H935}{(H8799)}{H4692} unto the eleventh{H6249}{H6240} year{H8141} of king{H4428} Zedekiah{H6667}.
2 Kings,25,3,"And on the ninth{H8672} day of the fourth month{H2320} the famine{H7458} prevailed{H2388}{(H8799)} in the city{H5892}, and there was no bread{H3899} for the people{H5971} of the land{H776}."
2 Kings,25,4,"And the city{H5892} was broken up{H1234}{(H8735)}, and all the men{H582} of war{H4421} fled by night{H3915} by the way{H1870} of the gate{H8179} between two walls{H2346}, which is by the king's{H4428} garden{H1588}:(now the Chaldees{H3778} were against the city{H5892} round about{H5439}:) and the king went{H3212}{(H8799)} the way{H1870} toward the plain{H6160}."
2 Kings,25,5,"And the army{H2428} of the Chaldees{H3778} pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} the king{H4428}, and overtook{H5381}{(H8686)} him in the plains{H6160} of Jericho{H3405}: and all his army{H2428} were scattered{H6327}{(H8738)} from him."
2 Kings,25,6,"So they took{H8610}{(H8799)} the king{H4428}, and brought him up{H5927}{(H8686)} to the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} to Riblah{H7247}; and they gave{H1696}{(H8762)} judgment{H4941} upon him."
2 Kings,25,7,"And they slew{H7819}{(H8804)} the sons{H1121} of Zedekiah{H6667} before his eyes{H5869}, and put out{H5786}{(H8765)} the eyes{H5869} of Zedekiah{H6667}, and bound{H631}{(H8799)} him with fetters{H5178} of brass{H5178}, and carried{H935}{(H8686)} him to Babylon{H894}."
2 Kings,25,8,"And in the fifth{H2549} month{H2320}, on the seventh{H7651} day of the month{H2320}, which is the nineteenth{H8672}{H6240}{H8141} year{H8141} of king{H4428} Nebuchadnezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, came{H935}{(H8804)} Nebuzaradan{H5018}, captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876}, a servant{H5650} of the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, unto Jerusalem{H3389}:"

2 Kings,25,10,"And all the army{H2428} of the Chaldees{H3778}, that were with the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876}, brake down{H5422}{(H8804)} the walls{H2346} of Jerusalem{H3389} round about{H5439}."
2 Kings,25,11,"Now the rest{H3499} of the people{H5971} that were left{H7604}{(H8737)} in the city{H5892}, and the fugitives{H5307}{(H8802)} that fell away{H5307}{(H8804)} to the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, with the remnant{H3499} of the multitude{H1995}, did Nebuzaradan{H5018} the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} carry away{H1540}{(H8689)}."
2 Kings,25,12,But the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} left{H7604}{(H8689)} of the poor{H1803} of the land{H776} to be vinedressers{H3755} and husbandmen{H3009}{(H8802)}{(H8675)}{H1461}{(H8801)}.
2 Kings,25,13,"And the pillars{H5982} of brass{H5178} that were in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and the bases{H4350}, and the brasen{H5178} sea{H3220} that was in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, did the Chaldees{H3778} break in pieces{H7665}{(H8765)}, and carried{H5375}{(H8799)} the brass{H5178} of them to Babylon{H894}."
2 Kings,25,14,"And the pots{H5518}, and the shovels{H3257}, and the snuffers{H4212}, and the spoons{H3709}, and all the vessels{H3627} of brass{H5178} wherewith they ministered{H8334}{(H8762)}, took they away{H3947}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,25,15,"And the firepans{H4289}, and the bowls{H4219}, and such things as were of gold{H2091}, in gold{H2091}, and of silver{H3701}, in silver{H3701}, the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} took away{H3947}{(H8804)}."
2 Kings,25,16,"The two{H8147} pillars{H5982}, one{H259} sea{H3220}, and the bases{H4350} which Solomon{H8010} had made{H6213}{(H8804)} for the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}; the brass{H5178} of all these vessels{H3627} was without{H3808} weight{H4948}."
2 Kings,25,17,"The height{H6967} of the one{H259} pillar{H5982} was eighteen{H8083}{H6240} cubits{H520}, and the chapiter{H3805} upon it was brass{H5178}: and the height{H6967} of the chapiter{H3805} three{H7969} cubits{H520}; and the wreathen work{H7639}, and pomegranates{H7416} upon the chapiter{H3805} round about{H5439}, all of brass{H5178}: and like unto these had the second{H8145} pillar{H5982} with wreathen work{H7639}."
2 Kings,25,18,"And the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} took{H3947}{(H8799)} Seraiah{H8304} the chief{H7218} priest{H3548}, and Zephaniah{H6846} the second{H4932} priest{H3548}, and the three{H7969} keepers{H8104}{(H8802)} of the door{H5592}:"

1 Chronicles,11,3,"Therefore came{H935}{(H8799)} all the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478} to the king{H4428} to Hebron{H2275}; and David{H1732} made{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285} with them in Hebron{H2275} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}; and they anointed{H4886}{(H8799)} David{H1732} king{H4428} over Israel{H3478}, according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} by{H3027} Samuel{H8050}."
1 Chronicles,11,4,"And David{H1732} and all Israel{H3478} went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}, which is Jebus{H2982}; where the Jebusites{H2983} were, the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the land{H776}."

1 Chronicles,11,7,And David{H1732} dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in the castle{H4679}; therefore they called{H7121}{(H8804)} it the city{H5892} of David{H1732}.
1 Chronicles,11,8,"And he built{H1129}{(H8799)} the city{H5892} round about{H5439}, even from Millo{H4407} round about{H5439}: and Joab{H3097} repaired{H2421}{(H8762)} the rest{H7605} of the city{H5892}."
1 Chronicles,11,9,So David{H1732} waxed{H3212}{(H8799)} greater{H1980}{(H8800)} and greater{H1419}: for the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} was with him.
1 Chronicles,11,10,"These also are the chief{H7218} of the mighty men{H1368} whom David{H1732} had, who strengthened{H2388}{(H8693)} themselves with him in his kingdom{H4438}, and with all Israel{H3478}, to make him king{H4427}{(H8687)}, according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} concerning Israel{H3478}."

1 Chronicles,11,14,"And they set{H3320}{(H8691)} themselves in the midst{H8432} of that parcel{H2513}, and delivered{H5337}{(H8686)} it, and slew{H5221}{(H8686)} the Philistines{H6430}; and the LORD{H3068} saved{H3467}{(H8686)} them by a great{H1419} deliverance{H8668}."
1 Chronicles,11,15,"Now three{H7969} of the thirty{H7970} captains{H7218} went down{H3381}{(H8799)} to the rock{H6697} to David{H1732}, into the cave{H4631} of Adullam{H5725}; and the host{H4264} of the Philistines{H6430} encamped{H2583}{(H8802)} in the valley{H6010} of Rephaim{H7497}."
1 Chronicles,11,16,"And David{H1732} was then in the hold{H4686}, and the Philistines{H6430}' garrison{H5333} was then at Bethlehem{H1035}."

1 Chronicles,11,18,"And the three{H7969} brake through{H1234}{(H8799)} the host{H4264} of the Philistines{H6430}, and drew{H7579}{(H8799)} water{H4325} out of the well{H953} of Bethlehem{H1035}, that was by the gate{H8179}, and took{H5375}{(H8799)} it, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} it to David{H1732}: but David{H1732} would{H14}{(H8804)} not drink{H8354}{(H8800)} of it, but poured it out{H5258}{(H8762)} to the LORD{H3068},"

1 Chronicles,20,3,"And he brought out{H3318}{(H8689)} the people{H5971} that were in it, and cut{H7787}{(H8799)} them with saws{H4050}, and with harrows{H2757} of iron{H1270}, and with axes{H4050}. Even so dealt{H6213}{(H8799)} David{H1732} with all the cities{H5892} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}. And David{H1732} and all the people{H5971} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}."
1 Chronicles,20,4,"And it came to pass after this{H310}, that there arose{H5975}{(H8799)} war{H4421} at Gezer{H1507} with the Philistines{H6430}; at which time{H227} Sibbechai{H5444} the Hushathite{H2843} slew{H5221}{(H8689)} Sippai{H5598}, that was of the children{H3211} of the giant{H7497}: and they were subdued{H3665}{(H8735)}."
1 Chronicles,20,5,"And there was war{H4421} again with the Philistines{H6430}; and Elhanan{H445} the son{H1121} of Jair{H3265} slew{H5221}{(H8686)} Lahmi{H3902} the brother{H251} of Goliath{H1555} the Gittite{H1663}, whose spear{H2595} staff{H6086} was like a weaver's{H707}{(H8802)} beam{H4500}."
1 Chronicles,20,6,"And yet again there was war{H4421} at Gath{H1661}, where was a man{H376} of great stature{H4060}, whose fingers{H676} and toes{H676} were four{H702} and twenty{H6242}, six{H8337} on each hand, and six{H8337} on each foot: and he also was the son{H3205}{(H8738)} of the giant{H7497}."
1 Chronicles,20,7,"But when he defied{H2778}{(H8762)} Israel{H3478}, Jonathan{H3083} the son{H1121} of Shimea{H8092} David's{H1732} brother{H251} slew{H5221}{(H8686)} him."
1 Chronicles,20,8,"These{H411} were born{H3205}{(H8738)} unto the giant{H7497} in Gath{H1661}; and they fell{H5307}{(H8799)} by the hand{H3027} of David{H1732}, and by the hand{H3027} of his servants{H5650}."
1 Chronicles,21,1,"And Satan{H7854} stood up{H5975}{(H8799)} against Israel{H3478}, and provoked{H5496}{(H8686)} David{H1732} to number{H4487}{(H8800)} Israel{H3478}."
1 Chronicles,21,2,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Joab{H3097} and to the rulers{H8269} of the people{H5971}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, number{H5608}{(H8798)} Israel{H3478} from Beersheba{H884} even to Dan{H1835}; and bring{H935}{(H8685)} the number{H4557} of them to me, that I may know{H3045}{(H8799)} it."
1 Chronicles,21,3,"And Joab{H3097} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, The LORD{H3068} make his people{H5971} an hundred{H3967} times{H6471} so many more{H3254}{(H8686)} as they{H1992} be: but, my lord{H113} the king{H4428}, are they not all my lord's{H113} servants{H5650}? why then doth my lord{H113} require{H1245}{(H8762)} this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass{H819} to Israel{H3478}?"
1 Chronicles,21,4,"Nevertheless the king's{H4428} word{H1697} prevailed{H2388}{(H8804)} against Joab{H3097}. Wherefore Joab{H3097} departed{H3318}{(H8799)}, and went{H1980}{(H8691)} throughout all Israel{H3478}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}."
1 Chronicles,21,5,And Joab{H3097} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} the sum{H4557} of the number{H4662} of the people{H5971} unto David{H1732}. And all they of Israel{H3478} were a thousand{H505} thousand{H505} and an hundred{H3967} thousand{H505} men{H376} that drew{H8025}{(H8802)} sword{H2719}: and Judah{H3063} was four{H702} hundred{H3967} threescore and ten{H7657} thousand{H505} men{H376} that drew{H8025}{(H8802)} sword{H2719}.
1 Chronicles,21,6,But Levi{H3878} and Benjamin{H1144} counted{H6485}{(H8804)} he not among{H8432} them: for the king's{H4428} word{H1697} was abominable{H8581}{(H8738)} to Joab{H3097}.
1 Chronicles,21,7,And God{H430} was displeased{H3415}{(H8799)}{H5869} with this thing{H1697}; therefore he smote{H5221}{(H8686)} Israel{H3478}.
1 Chronicles,21,8,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto God{H430}, I have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} greatly{H3966}, because I have done{H6213}{(H8804)} this thing{H1697}: but now, I beseech thee, do away{H5674}{(H8685)} the iniquity{H5771} of thy servant{H5650}; for I have done very{H3966} foolishly{H5528}{(H8738)}."
1 Chronicles,21,9,"And the LORD{H3068} spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto Gad{H1410}, David's{H1732} seer{H2374}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
1 Chronicles,21,10,"Go{H3212}{(H8798)} and tell{H1696}{(H8765)} David{H1732}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, I offer{H5186}{(H8802)} thee three{H7969} things: choose{H977}{(H8798)} thee one{H259} of them{H2007}, that I may do{H6213}{(H8799)} it unto thee."
1 Chronicles,21,11,"So Gad{H1410} came{H935}{(H8799)} to David{H1732}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Choose{H6901}{(H8761)} thee"
1 Chronicles,21,12,"Either three{H7969} years{H8141}' famine{H7458}; or three{H7969} months{H2320} to be destroyed{H5595}{(H8737)} before{H6440} thy foes{H6862}, while that the sword{H2719} of thine enemies{H341}{(H8802)} overtaketh{H5381}{(H8688)} thee; or{H518} else three{H7969} days{H3117} the sword{H2719} of the LORD{H3068}, even the pestilence{H1698}, in the land{H776}, and the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} destroying{H7843}{(H8688)} throughout all the coasts{H1366} of Israel{H3478}. Now therefore advise{H7200}{(H8798)} thyself what word{H1697} I shall bring again{H7725}{(H8686)} to him that sent{H7971}{(H8802)} me."
1 Chronicles,21,13,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Gad{H1410}, I am in a great{H3966} strait{H6887}{(H8804)}: let me fall{H5307}{(H8799)} now into the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068}; for very{H3966} great{H7227} are his mercies{H7356}: but let me not fall{H5307}{(H8799)} into the hand{H3027} of man{H120}."
1 Chronicles,21,14,So the LORD{H3068} sent{H5414}{(H8799)} pestilence{H1698} upon Israel{H3478}: and there fell{H5307}{(H8799)} of Israel{H3478} seventy{H7657} thousand{H505} men{H376}.
1 Chronicles,21,15,"And God{H430} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} an angel{H4397} unto Jerusalem{H3389} to destroy{H7843}{(H8687)} it: and as he was destroying{H7843}{(H8687)}, the LORD{H3068} beheld{H7200}{(H8804)}, and he repented{H5162}{(H8735)} him of the evil{H7451}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} to the angel{H4397} that destroyed{H7843}{(H8688)}, It is enough{H7227}, stay{H7503}{(H8685)} now thine hand{H3027}. And the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} stood{H5975}{(H8802)} by the threshingfloor{H1637} of Ornan{H771} the Jebusite{H2983}."
1 Chronicles,21,16,"And David{H1732} lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} his eyes{H5869}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} stand{H5975}{(H8802)} between the earth{H776} and the heaven{H8064}, having a drawn{H8025}{(H8803)} sword{H2719} in his hand{H3027} stretched out{H5186}{(H8803)} over Jerusalem{H3389}. Then David{H1732} and the elders{H2205} of Israel, who were clothed{H3680}{(H8794)} in sackcloth{H8242}, fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon their faces{H6440}."
1 Chronicles,21,17,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto God{H430}, Is it not I that commanded{H559}{(H8804)} the people{H5971} to be numbered{H4487}{(H8800)}? even I it is that have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} and done evil{H7489}{(H8689)} indeed{H7489}{(H8687)}; but as for these sheep{H6629}, what have they done{H6213}{(H8804)}? let thine hand{H3027}, I pray thee, O LORD{H3068} my God{H430}, be on me, and on my father's{H1} house{H1004}; but not on thy people{H5971}, that they should be plagued{H4046}."
1 Chronicles,21,18,"Then the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} commanded{H559}{(H8804)} Gad{H1410} to say{H559}{(H8800)} to David{H1732}, that David{H1732} should go up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and set up{H6965}{(H8687)} an altar{H4196} unto the LORD{H3068} in the threshingfloor{H1637} of Ornan{H771} the Jebusite{H2983}."
1 Chronicles,21,19,"And David{H1732} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} at the saying{H1697} of Gad{H1410}, which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} in the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068}."
1 Chronicles,21,20,"And Ornan{H771} turned back{H7725}{(H8799)}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the angel{H4397}; and his four{H702} sons{H1121} with him hid{H2244}{(H8693)} themselves. Now Ornan{H771} was threshing{H1758}{(H8804)} wheat{H2406}."
1 Chronicles,21,21,"And as David{H1732} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Ornan{H771}, Ornan{H771} looked{H5027}{(H8686)} and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} David{H1732}, and went out{H3318}{(H8799)} of the threshingfloor{H1637}, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} himself to David{H1732} with his face{H639} to the ground{H776}."
1 Chronicles,21,22,"Then David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Ornan{H771}, Grant{H5414}{(H8798)} me the place{H4725} of this threshingfloor{H1637}, that I may build{H1129}{(H8799)} an altar{H4196} therein unto the LORD{H3068}: thou shalt grant{H5414}{(H8798)} it me for the full{H4392} price{H3701}: that the plague{H4046} may be stayed{H6113}{(H8735)} from the people{H5971}."
1 Chronicles,21,23,"And Ornan{H771} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto David{H1732}, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} it to thee, and let my lord{H113} the king{H4428} do{H6213}{(H8799)} that which is good{H2896} in his eyes{H5869}: lo{H7200}{(H8798)}, I give{H5414}{(H8804)} thee the oxen{H1241} also for burnt offerings{H5930}, and the threshing instruments{H4173} for wood{H6086}, and the wheat{H2406} for the meat offering{H4503}; I give{H5414}{(H8804)} it all."
1 Chronicles,21,24,"And king{H4428} David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Ornan{H771}, Nay; but I will verily{H7069}{(H8800)} buy{H7069}{(H8799)} it for the full{H4392} price{H3701}: for I will not take{H5375}{(H8799)} that which is thine for the LORD{H3068}, nor offer{H5927}{(H8687)} burnt offerings{H5930} without cost{H2600}."
1 Chronicles,21,25,So David{H1732} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} to Ornan{H771} for the place{H4725} six{H8337} hundred{H3967} shekels{H8255} of gold{H2091} by weight{H4948}.
1 Chronicles,21,26,"And David{H1732} built{H1129}{(H8799)} there an altar{H4196} unto the LORD{H3068}, and offered{H5927}{(H8686)} burnt offerings{H5930} and peace offerings{H8002}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} upon the LORD{H3068}; and he answered{H6030}{(H8799)} him from heaven{H8064} by fire{H784} upon the altar{H4196} of burnt offering{H5930}."
1 Chronicles,21,27,And the LORD{H3068} commanded{H559}{(H8799)} the angel{H4397}; and he put up{H7725} his sword{H2719} again{H7725}{(H8686)} into the sheath{H5084} thereof.
1 Chronicles,21,28,"At that time{H6256} when David{H1732} saw{H7200}{(H8800)} that the LORD{H3068} had answered{H6030}{(H8804)} him in the threshingfloor{H1637} of Ornan{H771} the Jebusite{H2983}, then he sacrificed{H2076}{(H8799)} there."
1 Chronicles,21,29,"For the tabernacle{H4908} of the LORD{H3068}, which Moses{H4872} made{H6213}{(H8804)} in the wilderness{H4057}, and the altar{H4196} of the burnt offering{H5930}, were at that season{H6256} in the high place{H1116} at Gibeon{H1391}."
1 Chronicles,21,30,But David{H1732} could{H3201}{(H8804)} not go{H3212}{(H8800)} before{H6440} it to enquire{H1875}{(H8800)} of God{H430}: for he was afraid{H1204}{(H8738)} because{H6440} of the sword{H2719} of the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068}.
1 Chronicles,22,1,"Then David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)}, This is the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} God{H430}, and this is the altar{H4196} of the burnt offering{H5930} for Israel{H3478}."
1 Chronicles,22,2,And David{H1732} commanded{H559}{(H8799)} to gather together{H3664}{(H8800)} the strangers{H1616} that were in the land{H776} of Israel{H3478}; and he set{H5975}{(H8686)} masons{H2672}{(H8802)} to hew{H2672}{(H8800)} wrought{H1496} stones{H68} to build{H1129}{(H8800)} the house{H1004} of God{H430}.
1 Chronicles,22,3,"And David{H1732} prepared{H3559}{(H8689)} iron{H1270} in abundance{H7230} for the nails{H4548} for the doors{H1817} of the gates{H8179}, and for the joinings{H4226}; and brass{H5178} in abundance{H7230} without weight{H4948};"
1 Chronicles,22,4,Also cedar{H730} trees{H6086} in abundance{H369}{H4557}: for the Zidonians{H6722} and they of Tyre{H6876} brought{H935}{(H8689)} much{H7230} cedar{H730} wood{H6086} to David{H1732}.
1 Chronicles,22,5,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Solomon{H8010} my son{H1121} is young{H5288} and tender{H7390}, and the house{H1004} that is to be builded{H1129}{(H8800)} for the LORD{H3068} must be exceeding{H4605} magnifical{H1431}{(H8687)}, of fame{H8034} and of glory{H8597} throughout all countries{H776}: I will therefore now make preparation{H3559}{(H8686)} for it. So David{H1732} prepared{H3559}{(H8686)} abundantly{H7230} before{H6440} his death{H4194}."
1 Chronicles,22,6,"Then he called{H7121}{(H8799)} for Solomon{H8010} his son{H1121}, and charged{H6680}{(H8762)} him to build{H1129}{(H8800)} an house{H1004} for the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}."
1 Chronicles,22,7,"And David{H1732} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Solomon{H8010}, My son{H1121}, as for me, it was in my mind{H3824} to build{H1129}{(H8800)} an house{H1004} unto the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068} my God{H430}:"
1 Chronicles,22,8,"But the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came to me, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thou hast shed{H8210}{(H8804)} blood{H1818} abundantly{H7230}, and hast made{H6213}{(H8804)} great{H1419} wars{H4421}: thou shalt not build{H1129}{(H8799)} an house{H1004} unto my name{H8034}, because thou hast shed{H8210}{(H8804)} much{H7227} blood{H1818} upon the earth{H776} in my sight{H6440}."
1 Chronicles,22,9,"Behold, a son{H1121} shall be born{H3205}{(H8737)} to thee, who shall be a man{H376} of rest{H4496}; and I will give him rest{H5117}{(H8689)} from all his enemies{H341}{(H8802)} round about{H5439}: for his name{H8034} shall be Solomon{H8010}, and I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} peace{H7965} and quietness{H8253} unto Israel{H3478} in his days{H3117}."
1 Chronicles,22,10,"He shall build{H1129}{(H8799)} an house{H1004} for my name{H8034}; and he shall be my son{H1121}, and I will be his father{H1}; and I will establish{H3559}{(H8689)} the throne{H3678} of his kingdom{H4438} over Israel{H3478} for{H5704} ever{H5769}."
1 Chronicles,22,11,"Now, my son{H1121}, the LORD{H3068} be with thee; and prosper{H6743}{(H8689)} thou, and build{H1129}{(H8804)} the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}, as he hath said{H1696}{(H8765)} of thee."
1 Chronicles,22,12,"Only the LORD{H3068} give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee wisdom{H7922} and understanding{H998}, and give thee charge{H6680}{(H8762)} concerning Israel{H3478}, that thou mayest keep{H8104}{(H8800)} the law{H8451} of the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}."
1 Chronicles,22,13,"Then shalt thou prosper{H6743}{(H8686)}, if thou takest heed{H8104}{(H8799)} to fulfil{H6213}{(H8800)} the statutes{H2706} and judgments{H4941} which the LORD{H3068} charged{H6680}{(H8765)} Moses{H4872} with concerning Israel{H3478}: be strong{H2388}{(H8798)}, and of good courage{H553}{(H8798)}; dread{H3372}{(H8799)} not, nor be dismayed{H2865}{(H8735)}."
1 Chronicles,22,14,"Now, behold, in my trouble{H6040} I have prepared{H3559}{(H8689)} for the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} an hundred{H3967} thousand{H505} talents{H3603} of gold{H2091}, and a thousand{H505} thousand{H505} talents{H3603} of silver{H3701}; and of brass{H5178} and iron{H1270} without weight{H4948}; for it is in abundance{H7230}: timber{H6086} also and stone{H68} have I prepared{H3559}{(H8689)}; and thou mayest add{H3254}{(H8686)} thereto."
1 Chronicles,22,15,"Moreover there are workmen{H6213}{(H8802)}{H4399} with thee in abundance{H7230}, hewers{H2672}{(H8802)} and workers{H2796} of stone{H68} and timber{H6086}, and all manner of cunning men{H2450} for every manner of work{H4399}."
1 Chronicles,22,16,"Of the gold{H2091}, the silver{H3701}, and the brass{H5178}, and the iron{H1270}, there is no number{H4557}. Arise{H6965}{(H8798)} therefore, and be doing{H6213}{(H8798)}, and the LORD{H3068} be with thee."
