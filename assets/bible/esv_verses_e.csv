Daniel,9,12,"He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled us, by bringing upon us a great calamity. For under the whole heaven there has not been done anything like what has been done against Jerusalem."
Daniel,9,13,"As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this calamity has come upon us; yet we have not entreated the favor of the LORD our God, turning from our iniquities and gaining insight by your truth."
Daniel,9,14,"Therefore the LORD has kept ready the calamity and has brought it upon us, for the LORD our God is righteous in all the works that he has done, and we have not obeyed his voice."
Daniel,9,15,"And now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have made a name for yourself, as at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly."
Daniel,9,16,"""O Lord, according to all your righteous acts, let your anger and your wrath turn away from your city Jerusalem, your holy hill, because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a byword among all who are around us."
Daniel,9,17,"Now therefore, O our God, listen to the prayer of your servant and to his pleas for mercy, and for your own sake, O Lord, make your face to shine upon your sanctuary, which is desolate."
Daniel,9,18,"O my God, incline your ear and hear. Open your eyes and see our desolations, and the city that is called by your name. For we do not present our pleas before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great mercy."
Daniel,9,19,"O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive. O Lord, pay attention and act. Delay not, for your own sake, O my God, because your city and your people are called by your name."""
Daniel,9,20,"While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my plea before the LORD my God for the holy hill of my God,"
Daniel,9,21,"while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the first, came to me in swift flight at the time of the evening sacrifice."
Daniel,9,22,"He made me understand, speaking with me and saying, ""O Daniel, I have now come out to give you insight and understanding."
Daniel,9,23,"At the beginning of your pleas for mercy a word went out, and I have come to tell it to you, for you are greatly loved. Therefore consider the word and understand the vision."
Daniel,9,24,"""Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place."
Daniel,9,25,"Know therefore and understand that from the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to the coming of an anointed one, a prince, there shall be seven weeks. Then for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time."
Daniel,9,26,"And after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing. And the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed."
Daniel,9,27,"And he shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed end is poured out on the desolator."""
Daniel,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar. And the word was true, and it was a great conflict. And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision."
Daniel,10,2,"In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks."
Daniel,10,3,"I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks."
Daniel,10,4,"On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river (that is, the Tigris)"
Daniel,10,5,"I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist."
Daniel,10,6,"His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude."
Daniel,10,7,"And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves."
Daniel,10,8,"So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me. My radiant appearance was fearfully changed, and I retained no strength."
Daniel,10,9,"Then I heard the sound of his words, and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in deep sleep with my face to the ground."
Daniel,10,10,"And behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees."
Daniel,10,11,"And he said to me, ""O Daniel, man greatly loved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for now I have been sent to you."" And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling."
Daniel,10,12,"Then he said to me, ""Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and humbled yourself before your God, your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words."
Daniel,10,13,"The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days, but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I was left there with the kings of Persia,"
Daniel,10,14,"and came to make you understand what is to happen to your people in the latter days. For the vision is for days yet to come."""
Daniel,10,15,"When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and was mute."
Daniel,10,16,"And behold, one in the likeness of the children of man touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, ""O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength."
Daniel,10,17,"How can my lord's servant talk with my lord? For now no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me."""
Daniel,10,18,Again one having the appearance of a man touched me and strengthened me.
Daniel,10,19,"And he said, ""O man greatly loved, fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage."" And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, ""Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me."""
Daniel,10,20,"Then he said, ""Do you know why I have come to you? But now I will return to fight against the prince of Persia; and when I go out, behold, the prince of Greece will come."
Daniel,10,21,"But I will tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth: there is none who contends by my side against these except Michael, your prince."
Daniel,11,1,"And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him."
Daniel,11,2,"""And now I will show you the truth. Behold, three more kings shall arise in Persia, and a fourth shall be far richer than all of them. And when he has become strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece."
Daniel,11,3,"Then a mighty king shall arise, who shall rule with great dominion and do as he wills."
Daniel,11,4,"And as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom shall be broken and divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to the authority with which he ruled, for his kingdom shall be plucked up and go to others besides these."
Daniel,11,5,"""Then the king of the south shall be strong, but one of his princes shall be stronger than he and shall rule, and his authority shall be a great authority."
Daniel,11,6,"After some years they shall make an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement. But she shall not retain the strength of her arm, and he and his arm shall not endure, but she shall be given up, and her attendants, he who fathered her, and he who supported her in those times."
Daniel,11,7,"""And from a branch from her roots one shall arise in his place. He shall come against the army and enter the fortress of the king of the north, and he shall deal with them and shall prevail."
Daniel,11,8,"He shall also carry off to Egypt their gods with their metal images and their precious vessels of silver and gold, and for some years he shall refrain from attacking the king of the north."
Daniel,11,9,Then the latter shall come into the realm of the king of the south but shall return to his own land.
Daniel,11,10,"""His sons shall wage war and assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall keep coming and overflow and pass through, and again shall carry the war as far as his fortress."
Daniel,11,11,"Then the king of the south, moved with rage, shall come out and fight with the king of the north. And he shall raise a great multitude, but it shall be given into his hand."
Daniel,11,12,"And when the multitude is taken away, his heart shall be exalted, and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail."
Daniel,11,13,"For the king of the north shall again raise a multitude, greater than the first. And after some years he shall come on with a great army and abundant supplies."
Daniel,11,14,"""In those times many shall rise against the king of the south, and the violent among your own people shall lift themselves up in order to fulfill the vision, but they shall fail."
Daniel,11,15,"Then the king of the north shall come and throw up siegeworks and take a well-fortified city. And the forces of the south shall not stand, or even his best troops, for there shall be no strength to stand."
Daniel,11,16,"But he who comes against him shall do as he wills, and none shall stand before him. And he shall stand in the glorious land, with destruction in his hand."
Daniel,11,17,"He shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and he shall bring terms of an agreement and perform them. He shall give him the daughter of women to destroy the kingdom, but it shall not stand or be to his advantage."
Daniel,11,18,"Afterward he shall turn his face to the coastlands and shall capture many of them, but a commander shall put an end to his insolence. Indeed, he shall turn his insolence back upon him."
Daniel,11,19,"Then he shall turn his face back toward the fortresses of his own land, but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found."
Daniel,11,20,"""Then shall arise in his place one who shall send an exactor of tribute for the glory of the kingdom. But within a few days he shall be broken, neither in anger nor in battle."
Daniel,11,21,In his place shall arise a contemptible person to whom royal majesty has not been given. He shall come in without warning and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
Daniel,11,22,"Armies shall be utterly swept away before him and broken, even the prince of the covenant."
Daniel,11,23,"And from the time that an alliance is made with him he shall act deceitfully, and he shall become strong with a small people."
Daniel,11,24,"Without warning he shall come into the richest parts of the province, and he shall do what neither his fathers nor his fathers' fathers have done, scattering among them plunder, spoil, and goods. He shall devise plans against strongholds, but only for a time."
Daniel,11,25,"And he shall stir up his power and his heart against the king of the south with a great army. And the king of the south shall wage war with an exceedingly great and mighty army, but he shall not stand, for plots shall be devised against him."
Daniel,11,26,"Even those who eat his food shall break him. His army shall be swept away, and many shall fall down slain."
Daniel,11,27,"And as for the two kings, their hearts shall be bent on doing evil. They shall speak lies at the same table, but to no avail, for the end is yet to be at the time appointed."
Daniel,11,28,"And he shall return to his land with great wealth, but his heart shall be set against the holy covenant. And he shall work his will and return to his own land."
Daniel,11,29,"""At the time appointed he shall return and come into the south, but it shall not be this time as it was before."
Daniel,11,30,"For ships of Kittim shall come against him, and he shall be afraid and withdraw, and shall turn back and be enraged and take action against the holy covenant. He shall turn back and pay attention to those who forsake the holy covenant."
Daniel,11,31,"Forces from him shall appear and profane the temple and fortress, and shall take away the regular burnt offering. And they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate."
Daniel,11,32,"He shall seduce with flattery those who violate the covenant, but the people who know their God shall stand firm and take action."
Daniel,11,33,"And the wise among the people shall make many understand, though for some days they shall stumble by sword and flame, by captivity and plunder."
Daniel,11,34,"When they stumble, they shall receive a little help. And many shall join themselves to them with flattery,"
Daniel,11,35,"and some of the wise shall stumble, so that they may be refined, purified, and made white, until the time of the end, for it still awaits the appointed time."
Daniel,11,36,"""And the king shall do as he wills. He shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak astonishing things against the God of gods. He shall prosper till the indignation is accomplished; for what is decreed shall be done."
Daniel,11,37,"He shall pay no attention to the gods of his fathers, or to the one beloved by women. He shall not pay attention to any other god, for he shall magnify himself above all."
Daniel,11,38,"He shall honor the god of fortresses instead of these. A god whom his fathers did not know he shall honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts."
Daniel,11,39,He shall deal with the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god. Those who acknowledge him he shall load with honor. He shall make them rulers over many and shall divide the land for a price.
Daniel,11,40,"""At the time of the end, the king of the south shall attack him, but the king of the north shall rush upon him like a whirlwind, with chariots and horsemen, and with many ships. And he shall come into countries and shall overflow and pass through."
Daniel,11,41,"He shall come into the glorious land. And tens of thousands shall fall, but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom and Moab and the main part of the Ammonites."
Daniel,11,42,"He shall stretch out his hand against the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape."
Daniel,11,43,"He shall become ruler of the treasures of gold and of silver, and all the precious things of Egypt, and the Libyans and the Cushites shall follow in his train."
Daniel,11,44,"But news from the east and the north shall alarm him, and he shall go out with great fury to destroy and devote many to destruction."
Daniel,11,45,"And he shall pitch his palatial tents between the sea and the glorious holy mountain. Yet he shall come to his end, with none to help him."
Daniel,12,1,"""At that time shall arise Michael, the great prince who has charge of your people. And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time. But at that time your people shall be delivered, everyone whose name shall be found written in the book."
Daniel,12,2,"And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."
Daniel,12,3,"And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever."
Daniel,12,4,"But you, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, until the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase."""
Daniel,12,5,"Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, two others stood, one on this bank of the stream and one on that bank of the stream."
Daniel,12,6,"And someone said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream, ""How long shall it be till the end of these wonders?"""
Daniel,12,7,"And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream; he raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven and swore by him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time, and that when the shattering of the power of the holy people comes to an end all these things would be finished."
Daniel,12,8,"I heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, ""O my lord, what shall be the outcome of these things?"""
Daniel,12,9,"He said, ""Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end."
Daniel,12,10,"Many shall purify themselves and make themselves white and be refined, but the wicked shall act wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but those who are wise shall understand."
Daniel,12,11,"And from the time that the regular burnt offering is taken away and the abomination that makes desolate is set up, there shall be 1,290 days."
Daniel,12,12,"Blessed is he who waits and arrives at the 1,335 days."
Daniel,12,13,"But go your way till the end. And you shall rest and shall stand in your allotted place at the end of the days."""
Hosea,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel."
Hosea,1,2,"When the LORD first spoke through Hosea, the LORD said to Hosea, ""Go, take to yourself a wife of whoredom and have children of whoredom, for the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the LORD."""
Hosea,1,3,"So he went and took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son."
Hosea,1,4,"And the LORD said to him, ""Call his name Jezreel, for in just a little while I will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel."
Hosea,1,5,"And on that day I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel."""
Hosea,1,6,"She conceived again and bore a daughter. And the LORD said to him, ""Call her name No Mercy, for I will no more have mercy on the house of Israel, to forgive them at all."
Hosea,1,7,"But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and I will save them by the LORD their God. I will not save them by bow or by sword or by war or by horses or by horsemen."""
Hosea,1,8,"When she had weaned No Mercy, she conceived and bore a son."
Hosea,1,9,"And the LORD said, ""Call his name Not My People, for you are not my people, and I am not your God."""
Hosea,1,10,"Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered. And in the place where it was said to them, ""You are not my people,"" it shall be said to them, ""Children of the living God."""
Hosea,1,11,"And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint for themselves one head. And they shall go up from the land, for great shall be the day of Jezreel."
Hosea,2,1,"Say to your brothers, ""You are my people,"" and to your sisters, ""You have received mercy."""
Hosea,2,2,"""Plead with your mother, plead--for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband--that she put away her whoring from her face, and her adultery from between her breasts;"
Hosea,2,3,"lest I strip her naked and make her as in the day she was born, and make her like a wilderness, and make her like a parched land, and kill her with thirst."
Hosea,2,4,"Upon her children also I will have no mercy, because they are children of whoredom."
Hosea,2,5,"For their mother has played the whore; she who conceived them has acted shamefully. For she said, 'I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.'"
Hosea,2,6,"Therefore I will hedge up her way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, so that she cannot find her paths."
Hosea,2,7,"She shall pursue her lovers but not overtake them, and she shall seek them but shall not find them. Then she shall say, 'I will go and return to my first husband, for it was better for me then than now.'"
Hosea,2,8,"And she did not know that it was I who gave her the grain, the wine, and the oil, and who lavished on her silver and gold, which they used for Baal."
Hosea,2,9,"Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, and my wine in its season, and I will take away my wool and my flax, which were to cover her nakedness."
Hosea,2,10,"Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and no one shall rescue her out of my hand."
Hosea,2,11,"And I will put an end to all her mirth, her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her appointed feasts."
Hosea,2,12,"And I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, of which she said, 'These are my wages, which my lovers have given me.' I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall devour them."
Hosea,2,13,"And I will punish her for the feast days of the Baals when she burned offerings to them and adorned herself with her ring and jewelry, and went after her lovers and forgot me, declares the LORD."
Hosea,2,14,"""Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her."
Hosea,2,15,"And there I will give her her vineyards and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. And there she shall answer as in the days of her youth, as at the time when she came out of the land of Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"""And in that day, declares the LORD, you will call me 'My Husband,' and no longer will you call me 'My Baal.'"
Hosea,2,17,"For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they shall be remembered by name no more."
Hosea,2,18,"And I will make for them a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground. And I will abolish the bow, the sword, and war from the land, and I will make you lie down in safety."
Hosea,2,19,"And I will betroth you to me forever. I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love and in mercy."
Hosea,2,20,I will betroth you to me in faithfulness. And you shall know the LORD.
Hosea,2,21,"""And in that day I will answer, declares the LORD, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth,"
Hosea,2,22,"and the earth shall answer the grain, the wine, and the oil, and they shall answer Jezreel,"
Hosea,2,23,"and I will sow her for myself in the land. And I will have mercy on No Mercy, and I will say to Not My People, 'You are my people'; and he shall say, 'You are my God.'"""
Hosea,3,1,"And the LORD said to me, ""Go again, love a woman who is loved by another man and is an adulteress, even as the LORD loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love cakes of raisins."""
Hosea,3,2,So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a lethech of barley.
Hosea,3,3,"And I said to her, ""You must dwell as mine for many days. You shall not play the whore, or belong to another man; so will I also be to you."""
Hosea,3,4,"For the children of Israel shall dwell many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or pillar, without ephod or household gods."
Hosea,3,5,"Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek the LORD their God, and David their king, and they shall come in fear to the LORD and to his goodness in the latter days."
Hosea,4,1,"Hear the word of the LORD, O children of Israel, for the LORD has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land. There is no faithfulness or steadfast love, and no knowledge of God in the land;"
Hosea,4,2,"there is swearing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed."
Hosea,4,3,"Therefore the land mourns, and all who dwell in it languish, and also the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens, and even the fish of the sea are taken away."
Hosea,4,4,"Yet let no one contend, and let none accuse, for with you is my contention, O priest."
Hosea,4,5,You shall stumble by day; the prophet also shall stumble with you by night; and I will destroy your mother.
Hosea,4,6,"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children."
Hosea,4,7,"The more they increased, the more they sinned against me; I will change their glory into shame."
Hosea,4,8,They feed on the sin of my people; they are greedy for their iniquity.
Hosea,4,9,"And it shall be like people, like priest; I will punish them for their ways and repay them for their deeds."
Hosea,4,10,"They shall eat, but not be satisfied; they shall play the whore, but not multiply, because they have forsaken the LORD to cherish"
Hosea,4,11,"whoredom, wine, and new wine, which take away the understanding."
Hosea,4,12,"My people inquire of a piece of wood, and their walking staff gives them oracles. For a spirit of whoredom has led them astray, and they have left their God to play the whore."
Hosea,4,13,"They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar, and terebinth, because their shade is good. Therefore your daughters play the whore, and your brides commit adultery."
Hosea,4,14,"I will not punish your daughters when they play the whore, nor your brides when they commit adultery; for the men themselves go aside with prostitutes and sacrifice with cult prostitutes, and a people without understanding shall come to ruin."
Hosea,4,15,"Though you play the whore, O Israel, let not Judah become guilty. Enter not into Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-aven, and swear not, ""As the LORD lives."""
Hosea,4,16,"Like a stubborn heifer, Israel is stubborn; can the LORD now feed them like a lamb in a broad pasture?"
Hosea,4,17,Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone.
Hosea,4,18,"When their drink is gone, they give themselves to whoring; their rulers dearly love shame."
Hosea,4,19,"A wind has wrapped them in its wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices."
Hosea,5,1,"Hear this, O priests! Pay attention, O house of Israel! Give ear, O house of the king! For the judgment is for you; for you have been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread upon Tabor."
Hosea,5,2,"And the revolters have gone deep into slaughter, but I will discipline all of them."
Hosea,5,3,"I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me; for now, O Ephraim, you have played the whore; Israel is defiled."
Hosea,5,4,"Their deeds do not permit them to return to their God. For the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not the LORD."
Hosea,5,5,The pride of Israel testifies to his face; Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in his guilt; Judah also shall stumble with them.
Hosea,5,6,"With their flocks and herds they shall go to seek the LORD, but they will not find him; he has withdrawn from them."
Hosea,5,7,They have dealt faithlessly with the LORD; for they have borne alien children. Now the new moon shall devour them with their fields.
Hosea,5,8,"Blow the horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah. Sound the alarm at Beth-aven; we follow you, O Benjamin!"
Hosea,5,9,Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of punishment; among the tribes of Israel I make known what is sure.
Hosea,5,10,The princes of Judah have become like those who move the landmark; upon them I will pour out my wrath like water.
Hosea,5,11,"Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, because he was determined to go after filth."
Hosea,5,12,"But I am like a moth to Ephraim, and like dry rot to the house of Judah."
Hosea,5,13,"When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to the great king. But he is not able to cure you or heal your wound."
Hosea,5,14,"For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and no one shall rescue."
Hosea,5,15,"I will return again to my place, until they acknowledge their guilt and seek my face, and in their distress earnestly seek me."
Hosea,6,1,"""Come, let us return to the LORD; for he has torn us, that he may heal us; he has struck us down, and he will bind us up."
Hosea,6,2,"After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will raise us up, that we may live before him."
Hosea,6,3,"Let us know; let us press on to know the LORD; his going out is sure as the dawn; he will come to us as the showers, as the spring rains that water the earth."""
Hosea,6,4,"What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? Your love is like a morning cloud, like the dew that goes early away."
Hosea,6,5,"Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth, and my judgment goes forth as the light."
Hosea,6,6,"For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings."
Hosea,6,7,But like Adam they transgressed the covenant; there they dealt faithlessly with me.
Hosea,6,8,"Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with blood."
Hosea,6,9,"As robbers lie in wait for a man, so the priests band together; they murder on the way to Shechem; they commit villainy."
Hosea,6,10,In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim's whoredom is there; Israel is defiled.
Hosea,6,11,"For you also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed, when I restore the fortunes of my people."
Hosea,7,1,"When I would heal Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim is revealed, and the evil deeds of Samaria; for they deal falsely; the thief breaks in, and the bandits raid outside."
Hosea,7,2,But they do not consider that I remember all their evil. Now their deeds surround them; they are before my face.
Hosea,7,3,"By their evil they make the king glad, and the princes by their treachery."
Hosea,7,4,"They are all adulterers; they are like a heated oven whose baker ceases to stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened."
Hosea,7,5,"On the day of our king, the princes became sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with mockers."
Hosea,7,6,For with hearts like an oven they approach their intrigue; all night their anger smolders; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
Hosea,7,7,"All of them are hot as an oven, and they devour their rulers. All their kings have fallen, and none of them calls upon me."
Hosea,7,8,Ephraim mixes himself with the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
Hosea,7,9,"Strangers devour his strength, and he knows it not; gray hairs are sprinkled upon him, and he knows it not."
Hosea,7,10,"The pride of Israel testifies to his face; yet they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him, for all this."
Hosea,7,11,"Ephraim is like a dove, silly and without sense, calling to Egypt, going to Assyria."
Hosea,7,12,"As they go, I will spread over them my net; I will bring them down like birds of the heavens; I will discipline them according to the report made to their congregation."
Hosea,7,13,"Woe to them, for they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against me! I would redeem them, but they speak lies against me."
Hosea,7,14,"They do not cry to me from the heart, but they wail upon their beds; for grain and wine they gash themselves; they rebel against me."
Hosea,7,15,"Although I trained and strengthened their arms, yet they devise evil against me."
Hosea,7,16,"They return, but not upward; they are like a treacherous bow; their princes shall fall by the sword because of the insolence of their tongue. This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt."
Hosea,8,1,"Set the trumpet to your lips! One like a vulture is over the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant and rebelled against my law."
Hosea,8,2,"To me they cry, My God, we--Israel--know you."
Hosea,8,3,Israel has spurned the good; the enemy shall pursue him.
Hosea,8,4,"They made kings, but not through me. They set up princes, but I knew it not. With their silver and gold they made idols for their own destruction."
Hosea,8,5,"I have spurned your calf, O Samaria. My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of innocence?"
Hosea,8,6,For it is from Israel; a craftsman made it; it is not God. The calf of Samaria shall be broken to pieces.
Hosea,8,7,"For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no heads; it shall yield no flour; if it were to yield, strangers would devour it."
Hosea,8,8,Israel is swallowed up; already they are among the nations as a useless vessel.
Hosea,8,9,"For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild donkey wandering alone; Ephraim has hired lovers."
Hosea,8,10,"Though they hire allies among the nations, I will soon gather them up. And the king and princes shall soon writhe because of the tribute."
Hosea,8,11,"Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, they have become to him altars for sinning."
Hosea,8,12,"Were I to write for him my laws by the ten thousands, they would be regarded as a strange thing."
Hosea,8,13,"As for my sacrificial offerings, they sacrifice meat and eat it, but the LORD does not accept them. Now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins; they shall return to Egypt."
Hosea,8,14,"For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces, and Judah has multiplied fortified cities; so I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour her strongholds."
Hosea,9,1,"Rejoice not, O Israel! Exult not like the peoples; for you have played the whore, forsaking your God. You have loved a prostitute's wages on all threshing floors."
Hosea,9,2,"Threshing floor and wine vat shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail them."
Hosea,9,3,"They shall not remain in the land of the LORD, but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria."
Hosea,9,4,"They shall not pour drink offerings of wine to the LORD, and their sacrifices shall not please him. It shall be like mourners' bread to them; all who eat of it shall be defiled; for their bread shall be for their hunger only; it shall not come to the house of the LORD."
Hosea,9,5,"What will you do on the day of the appointed festival, and on the day of the feast of the LORD?"
Hosea,9,6,"For behold, they are going away from destruction; but Egypt shall gather them; Memphis shall bury them. Nettles shall possess their precious things of silver; thorns shall be in their tents."
Hosea,9,7,"The days of punishment have come; the days of recompense have come; Israel shall know it. The prophet is a fool; the man of the spirit is mad, because of your great iniquity and great hatred."
Hosea,9,8,"The prophet is the watchman of Ephraim with my God; yet a fowler's snare is on all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God."
Hosea,9,9,They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity; he will punish their sins.
Hosea,9,10,"Like grapes in the wilderness, I found Israel. Like the first fruit on the fig tree in its first season, I saw your fathers. But they came to Baal-peor and consecrated themselves to the thing of shame, and became detestable like the thing they loved."
Hosea,9,11,"Ephraim's glory shall fly away like a bird--no birth, no pregnancy, no conception!"
Hosea,9,12,"Even if they bring up children, I will bereave them till none is left. Woe to them when I depart from them!"
Hosea,9,13,"Ephraim, as I have seen, was like a young palm planted in a meadow; but Ephraim must lead his children out to slaughter."
Hosea,9,14,"Give them, O LORD--what will you give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts."
Hosea,9,15,Every evil of theirs is in Gilgal; there I began to hate them. Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house. I will love them no more; all their princes are rebels.
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim is stricken; their root is dried up; they shall bear no fruit. Even though they give birth, I will put their beloved children to death."
Hosea,9,17,My God will reject them because they have not listened to him; they shall be wanderers among the nations.
Hosea,10,1,"Israel is a luxuriant vine that yields its fruit. The more his fruit increased, the more altars he built; as his country improved, he improved his pillars."
Hosea,10,2,Their heart is false; now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will break down their altars and destroy their pillars.
Hosea,10,3,"For now they will say: ""We have no king, for we do not fear the LORD; and a king--what could he do for us?"""
Hosea,10,4,They utter mere words; with empty oaths they make covenants; so judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.
Hosea,10,5,"The inhabitants of Samaria tremble for the calf of Beth-aven. Its people mourn for it, and so do its idolatrous priests--those who rejoiced over it and over its glory--for it has departed from them."
Hosea,10,6,"The thing itself shall be carried to Assyria as tribute to the great king. Ephraim shall be put to shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his idol."
Hosea,10,7,Samaria's king shall perish like a twig on the face of the waters.
Hosea,10,8,"The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed. Thorn and thistle shall grow up on their altars, and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us, and to the hills, Fall on us."
Hosea,10,9,"From the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, O Israel; there they have continued. Shall not the war against the unjust overtake them in Gibeah?"
Hosea,10,10,"When I please, I will discipline them, and nations shall be gathered against them when they are bound up for their double iniquity."
Hosea,10,11,"Ephraim was a trained calf that loved to thresh, and I spared her fair neck; but I will put Ephraim to the yoke; Judah must plow; Jacob must harrow for himself."
Hosea,10,12,"Sow for yourselves righteousness; reap steadfast love; break up your fallow ground, for it is the time to seek the LORD, that he may come and rain righteousness upon you."
Hosea,10,13,"You have plowed iniquity; you have reaped injustice; you have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your own way and in the multitude of your warriors,"
Hosea,10,14,"therefore the tumult of war shall arise among your people, and all your fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle; mothers were dashed in pieces with their children."
Hosea,10,15,"Thus it shall be done to you, O Bethel, because of your great evil. At dawn the king of Israel shall be utterly cut off."
Hosea,11,1,"When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son."
Hosea,11,2,"The more they were called, the more they went away; they kept sacrificing to the Baals and burning offerings to idols."
Hosea,11,3,"Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk; I took them up by their arms, but they did not know that I healed them."
Hosea,11,4,"I led them with cords of kindness, with the bands of love, and I became to them as one who eases the yoke on their jaws, and I bent down to them and fed them."
Hosea,11,5,"They shall not return to the land of Egypt, but Assyria shall be their king, because they have refused to return to me."
Hosea,11,6,"The sword shall rage against their cities, consume the bars of their gates, and devour them because of their own counsels."
Hosea,11,7,"My people are bent on turning away from me, and though they call out to the Most High, he shall not raise them up at all."
Hosea,11,8,"How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart recoils within me; my compassion grows warm and tender."
Hosea,11,9,"I will not execute my burning anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim; for I am God and not a man, the Holy One in your midst, and I will not come in wrath."
Hosea,11,10,"They shall go after the LORD; he will roar like a lion; when he roars, his children shall come trembling from the west;"
Hosea,11,11,"they shall come trembling like birds from Egypt, and like doves from the land of Assyria, and I will return them to their homes, declares the LORD."
Hosea,11,12,"Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit, but Judah still walks with God and is faithful to the Holy One."
Hosea,12,1,"Ephraim feeds on the wind and pursues the east wind all day long; they multiply falsehood and violence; they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried to Egypt."
Hosea,12,2,The LORD has an indictment against Judah and will punish Jacob according to his ways; he will repay him according to his deeds.
Hosea,12,3,"In the womb he took his brother by the heel, and in his manhood he strove with God."
Hosea,12,4,"He strove with the angel and prevailed; he wept and sought his favor. He met God at Bethel, and there God spoke with us--"
Hosea,12,5,"the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD is his memorial name:"
Hosea,12,6,"""So you, by the help of your God, return, hold fast to love and justice, and wait continually for your God."""
Hosea,12,7,"A merchant, in whose hands are false balances, he loves to oppress."
Hosea,12,8,"Ephraim has said, ""Ah, but I am rich; I have found wealth for myself; in all my labors they cannot find in me iniquity or sin."""
Hosea,12,9,"I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt; I will again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed feast."
Hosea,12,10,"I spoke to the prophets; it was I who multiplied visions, and through the prophets gave parables."
Hosea,12,11,"If there is iniquity in Gilead, they shall surely come to nothing: in Gilgal they sacrifice bulls; their altars also are like stone heaps on the furrows of the field."
Hosea,12,12,"Jacob fled to the land of Aram; there Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he guarded sheep."
Hosea,12,13,"By a prophet the LORD brought Israel up from Egypt, and by a prophet he was guarded."
Hosea,12,14,Ephraim has given bitter provocation; so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him and will repay him for his disgraceful deeds.
Hosea,13,1,"When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; he was exalted in Israel, but he incurred guilt through Baal and died."
Hosea,13,2,"And now they sin more and more, and make for themselves metal images, idols skillfully made of their silver, all of them the work of craftsmen. It is said of them, ""Those who offer human sacrifice kiss calves!"""
Hosea,13,3,"Therefore they shall be like the morning mist or like the dew that goes early away, like the chaff that swirls from the threshing floor or like smoke from a window."
Hosea,13,4,"But I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt; you know no God but me, and besides me there is no savior."
Hosea,13,5,"It was I who knew you in the wilderness, in the land of drought;"
Hosea,13,6,"but when they had grazed, they became full, they were filled, and their heart was lifted up; therefore they forgot me."
Hosea,13,7,So I am to them like a lion; like a leopard I will lurk beside the way.
Hosea,13,8,"I will fall upon them like a bear robbed of her cubs; I will tear open their breast, and there I will devour them like a lion, as a wild beast would rip them open."
Hosea,13,9,"He destroys you, O Israel, for you are against me, against your helper."
Hosea,13,10,"Where now is your king, to save you in all your cities? Where are all your rulers--those of whom you said, ""Give me a king and princes""?"
Hosea,13,11,"I gave you a king in my anger, and I took him away in my wrath."
Hosea,13,12,The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is kept in store.
Hosea,13,13,"The pangs of childbirth come for him, but he is an unwise son, for at the right time he does not present himself at the opening of the womb."
Hosea,13,14,"Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol? Shall I redeem them from Death? O Death, where are your plagues? O Sheol, where is your sting? Compassion is hidden from my eyes."
Hosea,13,15,"Though he may flourish among his brothers, the east wind, the wind of the LORD, shall come, rising from the wilderness, and his fountain shall dry up; his spring shall be parched; it shall strip his treasury of every precious thing."
Hosea,13,16,"Samaria shall bear her guilt, because she has rebelled against her God; they shall fall by the sword; their little ones shall be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women ripped open."
Hosea,14,1,"Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God, for you have stumbled because of your iniquity."
Hosea,14,2,"Take with you words and return to the LORD; say to him, ""Take away all iniquity; accept what is good, and we will pay with bulls the vows of our lips."
Hosea,14,3,"Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride on horses; and we will say no more, 'Our God,' to the work of our hands. In you the orphan finds mercy."""
Hosea,14,4,"I will heal their apostasy; I will love them freely, for my anger has turned from them."
Hosea,14,5,I will be like the dew to Israel; he shall blossom like the lily; he shall take root like the trees of Lebanon;
Hosea,14,6,"his shoots shall spread out; his beauty shall be like the olive, and his fragrance like Lebanon."
Hosea,14,7,They shall return and dwell beneath my shadow; they shall flourish like the grain; they shall blossom like the vine; their fame shall be like the wine of Lebanon.
Hosea,14,8,"O Ephraim, what have I to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after you. I am like an evergreen cypress; from me comes your fruit."
Hosea,14,9,"Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; whoever is discerning, let him know them; for the ways of the LORD are right, and the upright walk in them, but transgressors stumble in them."
Joel,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel:"
Joel,1,2,"Hear this, you elders; give ear, all inhabitants of the land! Has such a thing happened in your days, or in the days of your fathers?"
Joel,1,3,"Tell your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children to another generation."
Joel,1,4,"What the cutting locust left, the swarming locust has eaten. What the swarming locust left, the hopping locust has eaten, and what the hopping locust left, the destroying locust has eaten."
Joel,1,5,"Awake, you drunkards, and weep, and wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine, for it is cut off from your mouth."
Joel,1,6,"For a nation has come up against my land, powerful and beyond number; its teeth are lions' teeth, and it has the fangs of a lioness."
Joel,1,7,It has laid waste my vine and splintered my fig tree; it has stripped off their bark and thrown it down; their branches are made white.
Joel,1,8,Lament like a virgin wearing sackcloth for the bridegroom of her youth.
Joel,1,9,"The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off from the house of the LORD. The priests mourn, the ministers of the LORD."
Joel,1,10,"The fields are destroyed, the ground mourns, because the grain is destroyed, the wine dries up, the oil languishes."
Joel,1,11,"Be ashamed, O tillers of the soil; wail, O vinedressers, for the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field has perished."
Joel,1,12,"The vine dries up; the fig tree languishes. Pomegranate, palm, and apple, all the trees of the field are dried up, and gladness dries up from the children of man."
Joel,1,13,"Put on sackcloth and lament, O priests; wail, O ministers of the altar. Go in, pass the night in sackcloth, O ministers of my God! Because grain offering and drink offering are withheld from the house of your God."
Joel,1,14,"Consecrate a fast; call a solemn assembly. Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD."
Joel,1,15,"Alas for the day! For the day of the LORD is near, and as destruction from the Almighty it comes."
Joel,1,16,"Is not the food cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?"
Joel,1,17,The seed shrivels under the clods; the storehouses are desolate; the granaries are torn down because the grain has dried up.
Joel,1,18,How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are perplexed because there is no pasture for them; even the flocks of sheep suffer.
Joel,1,19,"To you, O LORD, I call. For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and flame has burned all the trees of the field."
Joel,1,20,"Even the beasts of the field pant for you because the water brooks are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness."
Joel,2,1,"Blow a trumpet in Zion; sound an alarm on my holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of the LORD is coming; it is near,"
Joel,2,2,"a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness! Like blackness there is spread upon the mountains a great and powerful people; their like has never been before, nor will be again after them through the years of all generations."
Joel,2,3,"Fire devours before them, and behind them a flame burns. The land is like the garden of Eden before them, but behind them a desolate wilderness, and nothing escapes them."
Joel,2,4,"Their appearance is like the appearance of horses, and like war horses they run."
Joel,2,5,"As with the rumbling of chariots, they leap on the tops of the mountains, like the crackling of a flame of fire devouring the stubble, like a powerful army drawn up for battle."
Joel,2,6,Before them peoples are in anguish; all faces grow pale.
Joel,2,7,Like warriors they charge; like soldiers they scale the wall. They march each on his way; they do not swerve from their paths.
Joel,2,8,They do not jostle one another; each marches in his path; they burst through the weapons and are not halted.
Joel,2,9,"They leap upon the city, they run upon the walls, they climb up into the houses, they enter through the windows like a thief."
Joel,2,10,"The earth quakes before them; the heavens tremble. The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining."
Joel,2,11,"The LORD utters his voice before his army, for his camp is exceedingly great; he who executes his word is powerful. For the day of the LORD is great and very awesome; who can endure it?"
Joel,2,12,"""Yet even now,"" declares the LORD, ""return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning;"
Joel,2,13,"and rend your hearts and not your garments."" Return to the LORD, your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love; and he relents over disaster."
Joel,2,14,"Who knows whether he will not turn and relent, and leave a blessing behind him, a grain offering and a drink offering for the LORD your God?"
Joel,2,15,Blow the trumpet in Zion; consecrate a fast; call a solemn assembly;
Joel,2,16,"gather the people. Consecrate the congregation; assemble the elders; gather the children, even nursing infants. Let the bridegroom leave his room, and the bride her chamber."
Joel,2,17,"Between the vestibule and the altar let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep and say, ""Spare your people, O LORD, and make not your heritage a reproach, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, 'Where is their God?'"""
Joel,2,18,Then the LORD became jealous for his land and had pity on his people.
Joel,2,19,"The LORD answered and said to his people, ""Behold, I am sending to you grain, wine, and oil, and you will be satisfied; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations."
Joel,2,20,"""I will remove the northerner far from you, and drive him into a parched and desolate land, his vanguard into the eastern sea, and his rear guard into the western sea; the stench and foul smell of him will rise, for he has done great things."
Joel,2,21,"""Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice, for the LORD has done great things!"
Joel,2,22,"Fear not, you beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness are green; the tree bears its fruit; the fig tree and vine give their full yield."
Joel,2,23,"""Be glad, O children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God, for he has given the early rain for your vindication; he has poured down for you abundant rain, the early and the latter rain, as before."
Joel,2,24,"""The threshing floors shall be full of grain; the vats shall overflow with wine and oil."
Joel,2,25,"I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent among you."
Joel,2,26,"""You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And my people shall never again be put to shame."
Joel,2,27,"You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God and there is none else. And my people shall never again be put to shame."
Joel,2,28,"""And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions."
Joel,2,29,Even on the male and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit.
Joel,2,30,"""And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke."
Joel,2,31,"The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes."

Joel,3,1,"""For behold, in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,"
Joel,3,2,"I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. And I will enter into judgment with them there, on behalf of my people and my heritage Israel, because they have scattered them among the nations and have divided up my land,"
Joel,3,3,"and have cast lots for my people, and have traded a boy for a prostitute, and have sold a girl for wine and have drunk it."
Joel,3,4,"""What are you to me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Are you paying me back for something? If you are paying me back, I will return your payment on your own head swiftly and speedily."
Joel,3,5,"For you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my rich treasures into your temples."
Joel,3,6,You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks in order to remove them far from their own border.
Joel,3,7,"Behold, I will stir them up from the place to which you have sold them, and I will return your payment on your own head."
Joel,3,8,"I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far away, for the LORD has spoken."""
Joel,3,9,Proclaim this among the nations: Consecrate for war; stir up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near; let them come up.
Joel,3,10,"Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say, ""I am a warrior."""

Joel,3,15,"The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining."
Joel,3,16,"The LORD roars from Zion, and utters his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth quake. But the LORD is a refuge to his people, a stronghold to the people of Israel."
Joel,3,17,"""So you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who dwells in Zion, my holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers shall never again pass through it."
Joel,3,18,"""And in that day the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the streambeds of Judah shall flow with water; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the LORD and water the Valley of Shittim."

Amos,5,12,"For I know how many are your transgressions and how great are your sins--you who afflict the righteous, who take a bribe, and turn aside the needy in the gate."
Amos,5,13,"Therefore he who is prudent will keep silent in such a time, for it is an evil time."
Amos,5,14,"Seek good, and not evil, that you may live; and so the LORD, the God of hosts, will be with you, as you have said."
Amos,5,15,"Hate evil, and love good, and establish justice in the gate; it may be that the LORD, the God of hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph."

Amos,7,2,"When they had finished eating the grass of the land, I said, ""O Lord GOD, please forgive! How can Jacob stand? He is so small!"""
Amos,7,3,"The LORD relented concerning this; ""It shall not be,"" said the LORD."

Amos,7,6,"The LORD relented concerning this; ""This also shall not be,"" said the Lord GOD."

Amos,7,10,"Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, ""Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words."

Amos,7,12,"And Amaziah said to Amos, ""O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there,"

Amos,7,15,"But the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, 'Go, prophesy to my people Israel.'"
Amos,7,16,"Now therefore hear the word of the LORD. ""You say, 'Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of Isaac.'"

Jonah,1,4,"But the LORD hurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship threatened to break up."
Jonah,1,5,"Then the mariners were afraid, and each cried out to his god. And they hurled the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had lain down and was fast asleep."
Jonah,1,6,"So the captain came and said to him, ""What do you mean, you sleeper? Arise, call out to your god! Perhaps the god will give a thought to us, that we may not perish."""
Jonah,1,7,"And they said to one another, ""Come, let us cast lots, that we may know on whose account this evil has come upon us."" So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah."
Jonah,1,8,"Then they said to him, ""Tell us on whose account this evil has come upon us. What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?"""
Jonah,1,9,"And he said to them, ""I am a Hebrew, and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land."""
Jonah,1,10,"Then the men were exceedingly afraid and said to him, ""What is this that you have done!"" For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them."
Jonah,1,11,"Then they said to him, ""What shall we do to you, that the sea may quiet down for us?"" For the sea grew more and more tempestuous."
Jonah,1,12,"He said to them, ""Pick me up and hurl me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you, for I know it is because of me that this great tempest has come upon you."""
Jonah,1,13,"Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get back to dry land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them."
Jonah,1,14,"Therefore they called out to the LORD, ""O LORD, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not on us innocent blood, for you, O LORD, have done as it pleased you."""
Jonah,1,15,"So they picked up Jonah and hurled him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging."
Jonah,1,16,"Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows."
Jonah,1,17,And the LORD appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
Jonah,2,1,"Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish,"
Jonah,2,2,"saying, ""I called out to the LORD, out of my distress, and he answered me; out of the belly of Sheol I cried, and you heard my voice."
Jonah,2,3,"For you cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the flood surrounded me; all your waves and your billows passed over me."
Jonah,2,4,"Then I said, 'I am driven away from your sight; Yet I shall again look upon your holy temple.'"
Jonah,2,5,The waters closed in over me to take my life; the deep surrounded me; weeds were wrapped about my head

Jonah,2,7,"When my life was fainting away, I remembered the LORD, and my prayer came to you, into your holy temple."
Jonah,2,8,Those who pay regard to vain idols forsake their hope of steadfast love.

Jonah,3,2,"""Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it the message that I tell you."""
Jonah,3,3,"So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, three days' journey in breadth."
Jonah,3,4,"Jonah began to go into the city, going a day's journey. And he called out, ""Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!"""
Jonah,3,5,"And the people of Nineveh believed God. They called for a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least of them."
Jonah,3,6,"The word reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes."
Jonah,3,7,"And he issued a proclamation and published through Nineveh, ""By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything. Let them not feed or drink water,"
Jonah,3,8,"but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and let them call out mightily to God. Let everyone turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands."
Jonah,3,9,"Who knows? God may turn and relent and turn from his fierce anger, so that we may not perish."""
Jonah,3,10,"When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it."
Jonah,4,1,"But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry."
Jonah,4,2,"And he prayed to the LORD and said, ""O LORD, is not this what I said when I was yet in my country? That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and relenting from disaster."
Jonah,4,3,"Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live."""
Jonah,4,4,"And the LORD said, ""Do you do well to be angry?"""
Jonah,4,5,"Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city."
Jonah,4,6,"Now the LORD God appointed a plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant."
Jonah,4,7,"But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant, so that it withered."
Jonah,4,8,"When the sun rose, God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he was faint. And he asked that he might die and said, ""It is better for me to die than to live."""
Jonah,4,9,"But God said to Jonah, ""Do you do well to be angry for the plant?"" And he said, ""Yes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die."""
Jonah,4,10,"And the LORD said, ""You pity the plant, for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow, which came into being in a night and perished in a night."
Jonah,4,11,"And should not I pity Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also much cattle?"""
Micah,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem."
Micah,1,2,"Hear, you peoples, all of you; pay attention, O earth, and all that is in it, and let the Lord GOD be a witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple."
Micah,1,3,"For behold, the LORD is coming out of his place, and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth."
Micah,1,4,"And the mountains will melt under him, and the valleys will split open, like wax before the fire, like waters poured down a steep place."
Micah,1,5,All this is for the transgression of Jacob and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what is the high place of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?
Micah,1,6,"Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the open country, a place for planting vineyards, and I will pour down her stones into the valley and uncover her foundations."
Micah,1,7,"All her carved images shall be beaten to pieces, all her wages shall be burned with fire, and all her idols I will lay waste, for from the fee of a prostitute she gathered them, and to the fee of a prostitute they shall return."
Micah,1,8,"For this I will lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked; I will make lamentation like the jackals, and mourning like the ostriches."
Micah,1,9,"For her wound is incurable, and it has come to Judah; it has reached to the gate of my people, to Jerusalem."
Micah,1,10,Tell it not in Gath; weep not at all; in Beth-le-aphrah roll yourselves in the dust.
Micah,1,11,"Pass on your way, inhabitants of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame; the inhabitants of Zaanan do not come out; the lamentation of Beth-ezel shall take away from you its standing place."
Micah,1,12,"For the inhabitants of Maroth wait anxiously for good, because disaster has come down from the LORD to the gate of Jerusalem."
Micah,1,13,"Harness the steeds to the chariots, inhabitants of Lachish; it was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion, for in you were found the transgressions of Israel."
Micah,1,14,Therefore you shall give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath; the houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel.
Micah,1,15,"I will again bring a conqueror to you, inhabitants of Mareshah; the glory of Israel shall come to Adullam."
Micah,1,16,"Make yourselves bald and cut off your hair, for the children of your delight; make yourselves as bald as the eagle, for they shall go from you into exile."
Micah,2,1,"Woe to those who devise wickedness and work evil on their beds! When the morning dawns, they perform it, because it is in the power of their hand."
Micah,2,2,"They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them away; they oppress a man and his house, a man and his inheritance."
Micah,2,3,"Therefore thus says the LORD: behold, against this family I am devising disaster, from which you cannot remove your necks, and you shall not walk haughtily, for it will be a time of disaster."
Micah,2,4,"In that day they shall take up a taunt song against you and moan bitterly, and say, ""We are utterly ruined; he changes the portion of my people; how he removes it from me! To an apostate he allots our fields."""
Micah,2,5,Therefore you will have none to cast the line by lot in the assembly of the LORD.
Micah,2,6,"""Do not preach""--thus they preach--""one should not preach of such things; disgrace will not overtake us."""
Micah,2,7,"Should this be said, O house of Jacob? Has the LORD grown impatient? Are these his deeds? Do not my words do good to him who walks uprightly?"
Micah,2,8,But lately my people have risen up as an enemy; you strip the rich robe from those who pass by trustingly with no thought of war.
Micah,2,9,The women of my people you drive out from their delightful houses; from their young children you take away my splendor forever.
Micah,2,10,"Arise and go, for this is no place to rest, because of uncleanness that destroys with a grievous destruction."
Micah,2,11,"If a man should go about and utter wind and lies, saying, ""I will preach to you of wine and strong drink,"" he would be the preacher for this people!"
Micah,2,12,"I will surely assemble all of you, O Jacob; I will gather the remnant of Israel; I will set them together like sheep in a fold, like a flock in its pasture, a noisy multitude of men."
Micah,2,13,"He who opens the breach goes up before them; they break through and pass the gate, going out by it. Their king passes on before them, the LORD at their head."
Micah,3,1,"And I said: Hear, you heads of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel! Is it not for you to know justice?--"
Micah,3,2,"you who hate the good and love the evil, who tear the skin from off my people and their flesh from off their bones,"
Micah,3,3,"who eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones in pieces and chop them up like meat in a pot, like flesh in a cauldron."
Micah,3,4,"Then they will cry to the LORD, but he will not answer them; he will hide his face from them at that time, because they have made their deeds evil."
Micah,3,5,"Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people astray, who cry ""Peace"" when they have something to eat, but declare war against him who puts nothing into their mouths."
Micah,3,6,"Therefore it shall be night to you, without vision, and darkness to you, without divination. The sun shall go down on the prophets, and the day shall be black over them;"
Micah,3,7,"the seers shall be disgraced, and the diviners put to shame; they shall all cover their lips, for there is no answer from God."
Micah,3,8,"But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the LORD, and with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sin."
Micah,3,9,"Hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel, who detest justice and make crooked all that is straight,"
Micah,3,10,who build Zion with blood and Jerusalem with iniquity.
Micah,3,11,"Its heads give judgment for a bribe; its priests teach for a price; its prophets practice divination for money; yet they lean on the LORD and say, ""Is not the LORD in the midst of us? No disaster shall come upon us."""
Micah,3,12,"Therefore because of you Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height."
Micah,4,1,"It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and it shall be lifted up above the hills; and peoples shall flow to it,"
Micah,4,2,"and many nations shall come, and say: ""Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths."" For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem."
Micah,4,3,"He shall judge between many peoples, and shall decide for strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore;"
Micah,4,4,"but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken."
Micah,4,5,"For all the peoples walk each in the name of its god, but we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever."
Micah,4,6,"In that day, declares the LORD, I will assemble the lame and gather those who have been driven away and those whom I have afflicted;"
Micah,4,7,"and the lame I will make the remnant, and those who were cast off, a strong nation; and the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion from this time forth and forevermore."
Micah,4,8,"And you, O tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, to you shall it come, the former dominion shall come, kingship for the daughter of Jerusalem."
Micah,4,9,"Now why do you cry aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, that pain seized you like a woman in labor?"
Micah,4,10,"Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you shall go out from the city and dwell in the open country; you shall go to Babylon. There you shall be rescued; there the LORD will redeem you from the hand of your enemies."
Micah,4,11,"Now many nations are assembled against you, saying, ""Let her be defiled, and let our eyes gaze upon Zion."""
Micah,4,12,"But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor."
Micah,4,13,"Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs bronze; you shall beat in pieces many peoples; and shall devote their gain to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth."
Micah,5,1,"Now muster your troops, O daughter of troops; siege is laid against us; with a rod they strike the judge of Israel on the cheek."
Micah,5,2,"But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose origin is from of old, from ancient days."
Micah,5,3,Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has given birth; then the rest of his brothers shall return to the people of Israel.
Micah,5,4,"And he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God. And they shall dwell secure, for now he shall be great to the ends of the earth."
Micah,5,5,"And he shall be their peace.When the Assyrian comes into our land and treads in our palaces, then we will raise against him seven shepherds and eight princes of men;"
Micah,5,6,"they shall shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod at its entrances; and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian when he comes into our land and treads within our border."
Micah,5,7,"Then the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples like dew from the LORD, like showers on the grass, which delay not for a man nor wait for the children of man."
Micah,5,8,"And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among the flocks of sheep, which, when it goes through, treads down and tears in pieces, and there is none to deliver."
Micah,5,9,"Your hand shall be lifted up over your adversaries, and all your enemies shall be cut off."
Micah,5,10,"And in that day, declares the LORD, I will cut off your horses from among you and will destroy your chariots;"
Micah,5,11,and I will cut off the cities of your land and throw down all your strongholds;
Micah,5,12,"and I will cut off sorceries from your hand, and you shall have no more tellers of fortunes;"
Micah,5,13,"and I will cut off your carved images and your pillars from among you, and you shall bow down no more to the work of your hands;"
Micah,5,14,and I will root out your Asherah images from among you and destroy your cities.
Micah,5,15,And in anger and wrath I will execute vengeance on the nations that did not obey.
Micah,6,1,"Hear what the LORD says: Arise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice."
Micah,6,2,"Hear, you mountains, the indictment of the LORD, and you enduring foundations of the earth, for the LORD has an indictment against his people, and he will contend with Israel."
Micah,6,3,"""O my people, what have I done to you? How have I wearied you? Answer me!"
Micah,6,4,"For I brought you up from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam."
Micah,6,5,"O my people, remember what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, and what happened from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the saving acts of the LORD."""
Micah,6,6,"""With what shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before God on high? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?"
Micah,6,7,"Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?"""
Micah,6,8,"He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?"
Micah,6,9,"The voice of the LORD cries to the city--and it is sound wisdom to fear your name: ""Hear of the rod and of him who appointed it!"
Micah,6,10,"Can I forget any longer the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is accursed?"
Micah,6,11,Shall I acquit the man with wicked scales and with a bag of deceitful weights?
Micah,6,12,"Your rich men are full of violence; your inhabitants speak lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth."
Micah,6,13,"Therefore I strike you with a grievous blow, making you desolate because of your sins."
Micah,6,14,"You shall eat, but not be satisfied, and there shall be hunger within you; you shall put away, but not preserve, and what you preserve I will give to the sword."
Micah,6,15,"You shall sow, but not reap; you shall tread olives, but not anoint yourselves with oil; you shall tread grapes, but not drink wine."
Micah,6,16,"For you have kept the statutes of Omri, and all the works of the house of Ahab; and you have walked in their counsels, that I may make you a desolation, and your inhabitants a hissing; so you shall bear the scorn of my people."""
Micah,7,1,"Woe is me! For I have become as when the summer fruit has been gathered, as when the grapes have been gleaned: there is no cluster to eat, no first-ripe fig that my soul desires."
Micah,7,2,"The godly has perished from the earth, and there is no one upright among mankind; they all lie in wait for blood, and each hunts the other with a net."
Micah,7,3,"Their hands are on what is evil, to do it well; the prince and the judge ask for a bribe, and the great man utters the evil desire of his soul; thus they weave it together."
Micah,7,4,"The best of them is like a brier, the most upright of them a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen, of your punishment, has come; now their confusion is at hand."
Micah,7,5,Put no trust in a neighbor; have no confidence in a friend; guard the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your arms;
Micah,7,6,"for the son treats the father with contempt, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house."
Micah,7,7,"But as for me, I will look to the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me."
Micah,7,8,"Rejoice not over me, O my enemy; when I fall, I shall rise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD will be a light to me."
Micah,7,9,"I will bear the indignation of the LORD because I have sinned against him, until he pleads my cause and executes judgment for me. He will bring me out to the light; I shall look upon his vindication."
Micah,7,10,"Then my enemy will see, and shame will cover her who said to me, ""Where is the LORD your God?"" My eyes will look upon her; now she will be trampled down like the mire of the streets."
Micah,7,11,A day for the building of your walls! In that day the boundary shall be far extended.
Micah,7,12,"In that day they will come to you, from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt to the River, from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain."
Micah,7,13,"But the earth will be desolate because of its inhabitants, for the fruit of their deeds."
Micah,7,14,"Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, who dwell alone in a forest in the midst of a garden land; let them graze in Bashan and Gilead as in the days of old."
Micah,7,15,"As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt, I will show them marvelous things."
Micah,7,16,The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hands on their mouths; their ears shall be deaf;
Micah,7,17,"they shall lick the dust like a serpent, like the crawling things of the earth; they shall come trembling out of their strongholds; they shall turn in dread to the LORD our God, and they shall be in fear of you."
Micah,7,18,"Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity and passing over transgression for the remnant of his inheritance? He does not retain his anger forever, because he delights in steadfast love."
Micah,7,19,He will again have compassion on us; he will tread our iniquities under foot. You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.
Micah,7,20,"You will show faithfulness to Jacob and steadfast love to Abraham, as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old."
Nahum,1,1,An oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh.
Nahum,1,2,The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD is avenging and wrathful; the LORD takes vengeance on his adversaries and keeps wrath for his enemies.
Nahum,1,3,"The LORD is slow to anger and great in power, and the LORD will by no means clear the guilty. His way is in whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet."
Nahum,1,4,He rebukes the sea and makes it dry; he dries up all the rivers; Bashan and Carmel wither; the bloom of Lebanon withers.
Nahum,1,5,"The mountains quake before him; the hills melt; the earth heaves before him, the world and all who dwell in it."
Nahum,1,6,"Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the heat of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken into pieces by him."
Nahum,1,7,"The LORD is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; he knows those who take refuge in him."
Nahum,1,8,"But with an overflowing flood he will make a complete end of the adversaries, and will pursue his enemies into darkness."
Nahum,1,9,What do you plot against the LORD? He will make a complete end; trouble will not rise up a second time.
Nahum,1,10,"For they are like entangled thorns, like drunkards as they drink; they are consumed like stubble fully dried."
Nahum,1,11,"From you came one who plotted evil against the LORD, a worthless counselor."
Nahum,1,12,"Thus says the LORD, ""Though they are at full strength and many, they will be cut down and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more."
Nahum,1,13,"And now I will break his yoke from off you and will burst your bonds apart."""
Nahum,1,14,"The LORD has given commandment about you: ""No more shall your name be perpetuated; from the house of your gods I will cut off the carved image and the metal image. I will make your grave, for you are vile."""
Nahum,1,15,"Behold, upon the mountains, the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace! Keep your feasts, O Judah; fulfill your vows, for never again shall the worthless pass through you; he is utterly cut off."
Nahum,2,1,The scatterer has come up against you. Man the ramparts; watch the road; dress for battle; collect all your strength.
Nahum,2,2,"For the LORD is restoring the majesty of Jacob as the majesty of Israel, for plunderers have plundered them and ruined their branches."
Nahum,2,3,The shield of his mighty men is red; his soldiers are clothed in scarlet. The chariots come with flashing metal on the day he musters them; the cypress spears are brandished.
Nahum,2,4,The chariots race madly through the streets; they rush to and fro through the squares; they gleam like torches; they dart like lightning.
Nahum,2,5,"He remembers his officers; they stumble as they go, they hasten to the wall; the siege tower is set up."
Nahum,2,6,The river gates are opened; the palace melts away;
Nahum,2,7,"its mistress is stripped; she is carried off, her slave girls lamenting, moaning like doves and beating their breasts."
Nahum,2,8,"Nineveh is like a pool whose waters run away. ""Halt! Halt!"" they cry, but none turns back."
Nahum,2,9,"Plunder the silver, plunder the gold! There is no end of the treasure or of the wealth of all precious things."
Nahum,2,10,Desolate! Desolation and ruin! Hearts melt and knees tremble; anguish is in all loins; all faces grow pale!
Nahum,2,11,"Where is the lions' den, the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion and lioness went, where his cubs were, with none to disturb?"
Nahum,2,12,The lion tore enough for his cubs and strangled prey for his lionesses; he filled his caves with prey and his dens with torn flesh.
Nahum,2,13,"Behold, I am against you, declares the LORD of hosts, and I will burn your chariots in smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall no longer be heard."
Nahum,3,1,"Woe to the bloody city, all full of lies and plunder--no end to the prey!"
Nahum,3,2,"The crack of the whip, and rumble of the wheel, galloping horse and bounding chariot!"
Nahum,3,3,"Horsemen charging, flashing sword and glittering spear, hosts of slain, heaps of corpses, dead bodies without end--they stumble over the bodies!"
Nahum,3,4,"And all for the countless whorings of the prostitute, graceful and of deadly charms, who betrays nations with her whorings, and peoples with her charms."
Nahum,3,5,"Behold, I am against you, declares the LORD of hosts, and will lift up your skirts over your face; and I will make nations look at your nakedness and kingdoms at your shame."
Nahum,3,6,I will throw filth at you and treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle.
Nahum,3,7,"And all who look at you will shrink from you and say, Wasted is Nineveh; who will grieve for her? Where shall I seek comforters for you?"
Nahum,3,8,"Are you better than Thebes that sat by the Nile, with water around her, her rampart a sea, and water her wall?"
Nahum,3,9,"Cush was her strength; Egypt too, and that without limit; Put and the Libyans were her helpers."
Nahum,3,10,"Yet she became an exile; she went into captivity; her infants were dashed in pieces at the head of every street; for her honored men lots were cast, and all her great men were bound in chains."
Nahum,3,11,You also will be drunken; you will go into hiding; you will seek a refuge from the enemy.
Nahum,3,12,All your fortresses are like fig trees with first-ripe figs--if shaken they fall into the mouth of the eater.
Nahum,3,13,"Behold, your troops are women in your midst. The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire has devoured your bars."
Nahum,3,14,Draw water for the siege; strengthen your forts; go into the clay; tread the mortar; take hold of the brick mold!
Nahum,3,15,There will the fire devour you; the sword will cut you off. It will devour you like the locust. Multiply yourselves like the locust; multiply like the grasshopper!
Nahum,3,16,You increased your merchants more than the stars of the heavens. The locust spreads its wings and flies away.
Nahum,3,17,"Your princes are like grasshoppers, your scribes like clouds of locusts settling on the fences in a day of cold--when the sun rises, they fly away; no one knows where they are."
Nahum,3,18,"Your shepherds are asleep, O king of Assyria; your nobles slumber. Your people are scattered on the mountains with none to gather them."
Nahum,3,19,There is no easing your hurt; your wound is grievous. All who hear the news about you clap their hands over you. For upon whom has not come your unceasing evil?
Habakkuk,1,1,The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw.
Habakkuk,1,2,"O LORD, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not hear? Or cry to you ""Violence!"" and you will not save?"
Habakkuk,1,3,"Why do you make me see iniquity, and why do you idly look at wrong? Destruction and violence are before me; strife and contention arise."
Habakkuk,1,4,"So the law is paralyzed, and justice never goes forth. For the wicked surround the righteous; so justice goes forth perverted."
Habakkuk,1,5,"""Look among the nations, and see; wonder and be astounded. For I am doing a work in your days that you would not believe if told."
Habakkuk,1,6,"For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, who march through the breadth of the earth, to seize dwellings not their own."
Habakkuk,1,7,They are dreaded and fearsome; their justice and dignity go forth from themselves.
Habakkuk,1,8,"Their horses are swifter than leopards, more fierce than the evening wolves; their horsemen press proudly on. Their horsemen come from afar; they fly like an eagle swift to devour."
Habakkuk,1,9,"They all come for violence, all their faces forward. They gather captives like sand."
Habakkuk,1,10,"At kings they scoff, and at rulers they laugh. They laugh at every fortress, for they pile up earth and take it."
Habakkuk,1,11,"Then they sweep by like the wind and go on, guilty men, whose own might is their god!"""
Habakkuk,1,12,"Are you not from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. O LORD, you have ordained them as a judgment, and you, O Rock, have established them for reproof."
Habakkuk,1,13,"You who are of purer eyes than to see evil and cannot look at wrong, why do you idly look at traitors and are silent when the wicked swallows up the man more righteous than he?"
Habakkuk,1,14,"You make mankind like the fish of the sea, like crawling things that have no ruler."
Habakkuk,1,15,He brings all of them up with a hook; he drags them out with his net; he gathers them in his dragnet; so he rejoices and is glad.
Habakkuk,1,16,"Therefore he sacrifices to his net and makes offerings to his dragnet; for by them he lives in luxury, and his food is rich."
Habakkuk,1,17,Is he then to keep on emptying his net and mercilessly killing nations forever?
Habakkuk,2,1,"I will take my stand at my watchpost and station myself on the tower, and look out to see what he will say to me, and what I will answer concerning my complaint."
Habakkuk,2,2,"And the LORD answered me: ""Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so he may run who reads it."
Habakkuk,2,3,"For still the vision awaits its appointed time; it hastens to the end--it will not lie. If it seems slow, wait for it; it will surely come; it will not delay."
Habakkuk,2,4,"""Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him, but the righteous shall live by his faith."
Habakkuk,2,5,"""Moreover, wine is a traitor, an arrogant man who is never at rest. His greed is as wide as Sheol; like death he has never enough. He gathers for himself all nations and collects as his own all peoples."""
Habakkuk,2,6,"Shall not all these take up their taunt against him, with scoffing and riddles for him, and say, ""Woe to him who heaps up what is not his own--for how long?--and loads himself with pledges!"""
Habakkuk,2,7,"Will not your debtors suddenly arise, and those awake who will make you tremble? Then you will be spoil for them."
Habakkuk,2,8,"Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder you, for the blood of man and violence to the earth, to cities and all who dwell in them."
Habakkuk,2,9,"""Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house, to set his nest on high, to be safe from the reach of harm!"
Habakkuk,2,10,You have devised shame for your house by cutting off many peoples; you have forfeited your life.
Habakkuk,2,11,"For the stone will cry out from the wall, and the beam from the woodwork respond."
Habakkuk,2,12,"""Woe to him who builds a town with blood and founds a city on iniquity!"
Habakkuk,2,13,"Behold, is it not from the LORD of hosts that peoples labor merely for fire, and nations weary themselves for nothing?"
Habakkuk,2,14,For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.
Habakkuk,2,15,"""Woe to him who makes his neighbors drink--you pour out your wrath and make them drunk, in order to gaze at their nakedness!"
Habakkuk,2,16,"You will have your fill of shame instead of glory. Drink, yourself, and show your uncircumcision! The cup in the LORD's right hand will come around to you, and utter shame will come upon your glory!"
Habakkuk,2,17,"The violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, as will the destruction of the beasts that terrified them, for the blood of man and violence to the earth, to cities and all who dwell in them."
Habakkuk,2,18,"""What profit is an idol when its maker has shaped it, a metal image, a teacher of lies? For its maker trusts in his own creation when he makes speechless idols!"
Habakkuk,2,19,"Woe to him who says to a wooden thing, Awake; to a silent stone, Arise! Can this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in it."
Habakkuk,2,20,"But the LORD is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before him."""
Habakkuk,3,1,"A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth."
Habakkuk,3,2,"O LORD, I have heard the report of you, and your work, O LORD, do I fear. In the midst of the years revive it; in the midst of the years make it known; in wrath remember mercy."
Habakkuk,3,3,"God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. His splendor covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. Selah"
Habakkuk,3,4,His brightness was like the light; rays flashed from his hand; and there he veiled his power.
Habakkuk,3,5,"Before him went pestilence, and plague followed at his heels."
Habakkuk,3,6,He stood and measured the earth; he looked and shook the nations; then the eternal mountains were scattered; the everlasting hills sank low. His were the everlasting ways.
Habakkuk,3,7,I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
Habakkuk,3,8,"Was your wrath against the rivers, O LORD? Was your anger against the rivers, or your indignation against the sea, when you rode on your horses, on your chariot of salvation?"
Habakkuk,3,9,"You stripped the sheath from your bow, calling for many arrows. Selah You split the earth with rivers."
Habakkuk,3,10,The mountains saw you and writhed; the raging waters swept on; the deep gave forth its voice; it lifted its hands on high.
Habakkuk,3,11,"The sun and moon stood still in their place at the light of your arrows as they sped, at the flash of your glittering spear."
Habakkuk,3,12,You marched through the earth in fury; you threshed the nations in anger.

Habakkuk,3,15,"You trampled the sea with your horses, the surging of mighty waters."
Habakkuk,3,16,"I hear, and my body trembles; my lips quiver at the sound; rottenness enters into my bones; my legs tremble beneath me. Yet I will quietly wait for the day of trouble to come upon people who invade us."
Habakkuk,3,17,"Though the fig tree should not blossom, nor fruit be on the vines, the produce of the olive fail and the fields yield no food, the flock be cut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stalls,"

Zechariah,7,3,"saying to the priests of the house of the LORD of hosts and the prophets, ""Should I weep and abstain in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?"""
Zechariah,7,4,Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me:
Zechariah,7,5,"""Say to all the people of the land and the priests, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth month and in the seventh, for these seventy years, was it for me that you fasted?"
Zechariah,7,6,"And when you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves?"
Zechariah,7,7,"Were not these the words that the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, with her cities around her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?"""
Zechariah,7,8,"And the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,"
Zechariah,7,9,"""Thus says the LORD of hosts, Render true judgments, show kindness and mercy to one another,"
Zechariah,7,10,"do not oppress the widow, the fatherless, the sojourner, or the poor, and let none of you devise evil against another in your heart."""
Zechariah,7,11,But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears that they might not hear.
Zechariah,7,12,They made their hearts diamond-hard lest they should hear the law and the words that the LORD of hosts had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore great anger came from the LORD of hosts.
Zechariah,7,13,"""As I called, and they would not hear, so they called, and I would not hear,"" says the LORD of hosts,"
Zechariah,7,14,"""and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations that they had not known. Thus the land they left was desolate, so that no one went to and fro, and the pleasant land was made desolate."""
Zechariah,8,1,"And the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying,"
Zechariah,8,2,"""Thus says the LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath."
Zechariah,8,3,"Thus says the LORD: I have returned to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, and Jerusalem shall be called the faithful city, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts, the holy mountain."
Zechariah,8,4,"Thus says the LORD of hosts: Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of great age."
Zechariah,8,5,And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.
Zechariah,8,6,"Thus says the LORD of hosts: If it is marvelous in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my sight, declares the LORD of hosts?"
Zechariah,8,7,"Thus says the LORD of hosts: behold, I will save my people from the east country and from the west country,"
Zechariah,8,8,"and I will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in faithfulness and in righteousness."""
Zechariah,8,9,"Thus says the LORD of hosts: ""Let your hands be strong, you who in these days have been hearing these words from the mouth of the prophets who were present on the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built."
Zechariah,8,10,"For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for beast, neither was there any safety from the foe for him who went out or came in, for I set every man against his neighbor."
Zechariah,8,11,"But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days, declares the LORD of hosts."
Zechariah,8,12,"For there shall be a sowing of peace. The vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its produce, and the heavens shall give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things."
Zechariah,8,13,"And as you have been a byword of cursing among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing. Fear not, but let your hands be strong."""
Zechariah,8,14,"For thus says the LORD of hosts: ""As I purposed to bring disaster to you when your fathers provoked me to wrath, and I did not relent, says the LORD of hosts,"
Zechariah,8,15,so again have I purposed in these days to bring good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; fear not.
Zechariah,8,16,These are the things that you shall do: Speak the truth to one another; render in your gates judgments that are true and make for peace;
Zechariah,8,17,"do not devise evil in your hearts against one another, and love no false oath, for all these things I hate, declares the LORD."""
Zechariah,8,18,"And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,"
Zechariah,8,19,"""Thus says the LORD of hosts: The fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Judah seasons of joy and gladness and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace."
Zechariah,8,20,"""Thus says the LORD of hosts: Peoples shall yet come, even the inhabitants of many cities."
Zechariah,8,21,"The inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, 'Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD and to seek the LORD of hosts; I myself am going.'"
Zechariah,8,22,Many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.
Zechariah,8,23,"Thus says the LORD of hosts: In those days ten men from the nations of every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, 'Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.'"""
Zechariah,9,1,"The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach and Damascus is its resting place. For the LORD has an eye on mankind and on all the tribes of Israel,"
Zechariah,9,2,"and on Hamath also, which borders on it, Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise."
Zechariah,9,3,"Tyre has built herself a rampart and heaped up silver like dust, and fine gold like the mud of the streets."
Zechariah,9,4,"But behold, the Lord will strip her of her possessions and strike down her power on the sea, and she shall be devoured by fire."
Zechariah,9,5,"Ashkelon shall see it, and be afraid; Gaza too, and shall writhe in anguish; Ekron also, because its hopes are confounded. The king shall perish from Gaza; Ashkelon shall be uninhabited;"
Zechariah,9,6,"a mixed people shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of Philistia."
Zechariah,9,7,"I will take away its blood from its mouth, and its abominations from between its teeth; it too shall be a remnant for our God; it shall be like a clan in Judah, and Ekron shall be like the Jebusites."
Zechariah,9,8,"Then I will encamp at my house as a guard, so that none shall march to and fro; no oppressor shall again march over them, for now I see with my own eyes."
Zechariah,9,9,"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! behold, your king is coming to you; righteous and having salvation is he, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
Zechariah,9,10,"I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the war horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off, and he shall speak peace to the nations; his rule shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth."
Zechariah,9,11,"As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit."
Zechariah,9,12,"Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope; today I declare that I will restore to you double."
Zechariah,9,13,"For I have bent Judah as my bow; I have made Ephraim its arrow. I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and wield you like a warrior's sword."
Zechariah,9,14,"Then the LORD will appear over them, and his arrow will go forth like lightning; the Lord GOD will sound the trumpet and will march forth in the whirlwinds of the south."
Zechariah,9,15,"The LORD of hosts will protect them, and they shall devour, and tread down the sling stones, and they shall drink and roar as if drunk with wine, and be full like a bowl, drenched like the corners of the altar."
Zechariah,9,16,"On that day the LORD their God will save them, as the flock of his people; for like the jewels of a crown they shall shine on his land."
Zechariah,9,17,"For how great is his goodness, and how great his beauty! Grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the young women."
Zechariah,10,1,"Ask rain from the LORD in the season of the spring rain, from the LORD who makes the storm clouds, and he will give them showers of rain, to everyone the vegetation in the field."
Zechariah,10,2,"For the household gods utter nonsense, and the diviners see lies; they tell false dreams and give empty consolation. Therefore the people wander like sheep; they are afflicted for lack of a shepherd."
Zechariah,10,3,"""My anger is hot against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders; for the LORD of hosts cares for his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them like his majestic steed in battle."
Zechariah,10,4,"From him shall come the cornerstone, from him the tent peg, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler--all of them together."
Zechariah,10,5,"They shall be like mighty men in battle, trampling the foe in the mud of the streets; they shall fight because the LORD is with them, and they shall put to shame the riders on horses."
Zechariah,10,6,"""I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph. I will bring them back because I have compassion on them, and they shall be as though I had not rejected them, for I am the LORD their God and I will answer them."
Zechariah,10,7,"Then Ephraim shall become like a mighty warrior, and their hearts shall be glad as with wine. Their children shall see it and be glad; their hearts shall rejoice in the LORD."
Zechariah,10,8,"""I will whistle for them and gather them in, for I have redeemed them, and they shall be as many as they were before."
Zechariah,10,9,"Though I scattered them among the nations, yet in far countries they shall remember me, and with their children they shall live and return."
Zechariah,10,10,"I will bring them home from the land of Egypt, and gather them from Assyria, and I will bring them to the land of Gilead and to Lebanon, till there is no room for them."
Zechariah,10,11,"He shall pass through the sea of troubles and strike down the waves of the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall be dried up. The pride of Assyria shall be laid low, and the scepter of Egypt shall depart."
Zechariah,10,12,"I will make them strong in the LORD, and they shall walk in his name,"" declares the LORD."
Zechariah,11,1,"Open your doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour your cedars!"
Zechariah,11,2,"Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, for the glorious trees are ruined! Wail, oaks of Bashan, for the thick forest has been felled!"
Zechariah,11,3,"The sound of the wail of the shepherds, for their glory is ruined! The sound of the roar of the lions, for the thicket of the Jordan is ruined!"
Zechariah,11,4,"Thus said the LORD my God: ""Become shepherd of the flock doomed to slaughter."
Zechariah,11,5,"Those who buy them slaughter them and go unpunished, and those who sell them say, 'Blessed be the LORD, I have become rich,' and their own shepherds have no pity on them."
Zechariah,11,6,"For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land, declares the LORD. Behold, I will cause each of them to fall into the hand of his neighbor, and each into the hand of his king, and they shall crush the land, and I will deliver none from their hand."""
Zechariah,11,7,"So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep traders. And I took two staffs, one I named Favor, the other I named Union. And I tended the sheep."
Zechariah,11,8,"In one month I destroyed the three shepherds. But I became impatient with them, and they also detested me."
Zechariah,11,9,"So I said, ""I will not be your shepherd. What is to die, let it die. What is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed. And let those who are left devour the flesh of one another."""
Zechariah,11,10,"And I took my staff Favor, and I broke it, annulling the covenant that I had made with all the peoples."
Zechariah,11,11,"So it was annulled on that day, and the sheep traders, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of the LORD."
Zechariah,11,12,"Then I said to them, ""If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them."" And they weighed out as my wages thirty pieces of silver."
Zechariah,11,13,"Then the LORD said to me, ""Throw it to the potter""--the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the LORD, to the potter."
Zechariah,11,14,"Then I broke my second staff Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel."
Zechariah,11,15,"Then the LORD said to me, ""Take once more the equipment of a foolish shepherd."
Zechariah,11,16,"For behold, I am raising up in the land a shepherd who does not care for those being destroyed, or seek the young or heal the maimed or nourish the healthy, but devours the flesh of the fat ones, tearing off even their hoofs."
Zechariah,11,17,"""Woe to my worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! Let his arm be wholly withered, his right eye utterly blinded!"""
Zechariah,12,1,"The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel: Thus declares the LORD, who stretched out the heavens and founded the earth and formed the spirit of man within him:"
Zechariah,12,2,"""Behold, I am about to make Jerusalem a cup of staggering to all the surrounding peoples. The siege of Jerusalem will also be against Judah."
Zechariah,12,3,On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples. All who lift it will surely hurt themselves. And all the nations of the earth will gather against it.
Zechariah,12,4,"On that day, declares the LORD, I will strike every horse with panic, and its rider with madness. But for the sake of the house of Judah I will keep my eyes open, when I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness."
Zechariah,12,5,"Then the clans of Judah shall say to themselves, 'The inhabitants of Jerusalem have strength through the LORD of hosts, their God.'"
Zechariah,12,6,"""On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a blazing pot in the midst of wood, like a flaming torch among sheaves. And they shall devour to the right and to the left all the surrounding peoples, while Jerusalem shall again be inhabited in its place, in Jerusalem."
Zechariah,12,7,"""And the LORD will give salvation to the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not surpass that of Judah."
Zechariah,12,8,"On that day the LORD will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them on that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, like the angel of the LORD, going before them."
Zechariah,12,9,And on that day I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
Zechariah,12,10,"""And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and pleas for mercy, so that, when they look on me, on him whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn."
Zechariah,12,11,On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
Zechariah,12,12,"The land shall mourn, each family by itself: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;"
Zechariah,12,13,"the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves;"
Zechariah,12,14,"and all the families that are left, each by itself, and their wives by themselves."
Zechariah,13,1,"""On that day there shall be a fountain opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and uncleanness."
Zechariah,13,2,"""And on that day, declares the LORD of hosts, I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, so that they shall be remembered no more. And also I will remove from the land the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness."
Zechariah,13,3,"And if anyone again prophesies, his father and mother who bore him will say to him, 'You shall not live, for you speak lies in the name of the LORD.' And his father and mother who bore him shall pierce him through when he prophesies."
Zechariah,13,4,"""On that day every prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies. He will not put on a hairy cloak in order to deceive,"
Zechariah,13,5,"but he will say, 'I am no prophet, I am a worker of the soil, for a man sold me in my youth.'"
Zechariah,13,6,"And if one asks him, 'What are these wounds on your back?' he will say, 'The wounds I received in the house of my friends.'"
Zechariah,13,7,"""Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, against the man who stands next to me,"" declares the LORD of hosts.""Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered; I will turn my hand against the little ones."
Zechariah,13,8,"In the whole land, declares the LORD, two thirds shall be cut off and perish, and one third shall be left alive."
Zechariah,13,9,"And I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested. They will call upon my name, and I will answer them. I will say, 'They are my people'; and they will say, 'The LORD is my God.'"""
Zechariah,14,1,"Behold, a day is coming for the LORD, when the spoil taken from you will be divided in your midst."
Zechariah,14,2,"For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be taken and the houses plundered and the women raped. Half of the city shall go out into exile, but the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city."
Zechariah,14,3,Then the LORD will go out and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle.
Zechariah,14,4,"On that day his feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives that lies before Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives shall be split in two from east to west by a very wide valley, so that one half of the Mount shall move northward, and the other half southward."
Zechariah,14,5,"And you shall flee to the valley of my mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal. And you shall flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come, and all the holy ones with him."
Zechariah,14,6,"On that day there shall be no light, cold, or frost."
Zechariah,14,7,"And there shall be a unique day, which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but at evening time there shall be light."
Zechariah,14,8,"On that day living waters shall flow out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea and half of them to the western sea. It shall continue in summer as in winter."
Zechariah,14,9,And the LORD will be king over all the earth. On that day the LORD will be one and his name one.
Zechariah,14,10,"The whole land shall be turned into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. But Jerusalem shall remain aloft on its site from the Gate of Benjamin to the place of the former gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses."
Zechariah,14,11,"And it shall be inhabited, for there shall never again be a decree of utter destruction. Jerusalem shall dwell in security."
Zechariah,14,12,"And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples that wage war against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths."
Zechariah,14,13,"And on that day a great panic from the LORD shall fall on them, so that each will seize the hand of another, and the hand of the one will be raised against the hand of the other."
Zechariah,14,14,"Even Judah will fight against Jerusalem. And the wealth of all the surrounding nations shall be collected, gold, silver, and garments in great abundance."
Zechariah,14,15,"And a plague like this plague shall fall on the horses, the mules, the camels, the donkeys, and whatever beasts may be in those camps."
Zechariah,14,16,"Then everyone who survives of all the nations that have come against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Booths."
Zechariah,14,17,"And if any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them."
Zechariah,14,18,"And if the family of Egypt does not go up and present themselves, then on them there shall be no rain; there shall be the plague with which the LORD afflicts the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Booths."
Zechariah,14,19,This shall be the punishment to Egypt and the punishment to all the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Booths.
Zechariah,14,20,"And on that day there shall be inscribed on the bells of the horses, ""Holy to the LORD."" And the pots in the house of the LORD shall be as the bowls before the altar."
Zechariah,14,21,"And every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be holy to the LORD of hosts, so that all who sacrifice may come and take of them and boil the meat of the sacrifice in them. And there shall no longer be a trader in the house of the LORD of hosts on that day."
Malachi,1,1,The oracle of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.
Malachi,1,2,"""I have loved you,"" says the LORD. But you say, ""How have you loved us?Is not Esau Jacob's brother?"" declares the LORD. ""Yet I have loved Jacob"
Malachi,1,3,"but Esau I have hated. I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert."""
Malachi,1,4,"If Edom says, ""We are shattered but we will rebuild the ruins,"" the LORD of hosts says, ""They may build, but I will tear down, and they will be called 'the wicked country,' and 'the people with whom the LORD is angry forever.'"""
Malachi,1,5,"Your own eyes shall see this, and you shall say, ""Great is the LORD beyond the border of Israel!"""
Malachi,1,6,"""A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is my fear? says the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. But you say, 'How have we despised your name?'"
Malachi,1,7,"By offering polluted food upon my altar. But you say, 'How have we polluted you?' By saying that the LORD's table may be despised."
Malachi,1,8,"When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that not evil? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that not evil? Present that to your governor; will he accept you or show you favor? says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,1,9,"And now entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With such a gift from your hand, will he show favor to any of you? says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,1,10,"Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says the LORD of hosts, and I will not accept an offering from your hand."
Malachi,1,11,"For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name will be great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering. For my name will be great among the nations, says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,1,12,"But you profane it when you say that the Lord's table is polluted, and its fruit, that is, its food may be despised."
Malachi,1,13,"But you say, 'What a weariness this is,' and you snort at it, says the LORD of hosts. You bring what has been taken by violence or is lame or sick, and this you bring as your offering! Shall I accept that from your hand? says the LORD."
Malachi,1,14,"Cursed be the cheat who has a male in his flock, and vows it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished. For I am a great King, says the LORD of hosts, and my name will be feared among the nations."
Malachi,2,1,"""And now, O priests, this command is for you."
Malachi,2,2,"If you will not listen, if you will not take it to heart to give honor to my name, says the LORD of hosts, then I will send the curse upon you and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart."
Malachi,2,3,"Behold, I will rebuke your offspring, and spread dung on your faces, the dung of your offerings, and you shall be taken away with it."
Malachi,2,4,"So shall you know that I have sent this command to you, that my covenant with Levi may stand, says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,2,5,"My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave them to him. It was a covenant of fear, and he feared me. He stood in awe of my name."
Malachi,2,6,"True instruction was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity."
Malachi,2,7,"For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,2,8,"But you have turned aside from the way. You have caused many to stumble by your instruction. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the LORD of hosts,"
Malachi,2,9,"and so I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you do not keep my ways but show partiality in your instruction."""
Malachi,2,10,"Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us? Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers?"
Malachi,2,11,"Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god."
Malachi,2,12,"May the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob, any descendant of the man who does this, who brings an offering to the LORD of hosts!"
Malachi,2,13,"And this second thing you do. You cover the LORD's altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand."
Malachi,2,14,"But you say, ""Why does he not?"" Because the LORD was witness between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant."
Malachi,2,15,"Did he not make them one, with a portion of the Spirit in their union? And what was the one God seeking? Godly offspring. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and let none of you be faithless to the wife of your youth."
Malachi,2,16,"""For the man who hates and divorces, says the LORD, the God of Israel, covers his garment with violence, says the LORD of hosts. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and do not be faithless."""
Malachi,2,17,"You have wearied the LORD with your words. But you say, ""How have we wearied him?"" By saying, ""Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delights in them."" Or by asking, ""Where is the God of justice?"""
Malachi,3,1,"""Behold, I send my messenger and he will prepare the way before me. And the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,3,2,"But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap."
Malachi,3,3,"He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring offerings in righteousness to the LORD."
Malachi,3,4,Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years.
Malachi,3,5,"""Then I will draw near to you for judgment. I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hired worker in his wages, the widow and the fatherless, against those who thrust aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,3,6,"""For I the LORD do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed."
Malachi,3,7,"From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts. But you say, 'How shall we return?'"
Malachi,3,8,"Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, 'How have we robbed you?' In your tithes and contributions."
Malachi,3,9,"You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you."
Malachi,3,10,"Bring the full tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby put me to the test, says the LORD of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need."
Malachi,3,11,"I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,3,12,"Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,3,13,"""Your words have been hard against me, says the LORD. But you say, 'How have we spoken against you?'"
Malachi,3,14,"You have said, 'It is vain to serve God. What is the profit of our keeping his charge or of walking as in mourning before the LORD of hosts?"
Malachi,3,15,"And now we call the arrogant blessed. Evildoers not only prosper but they put God to the test and they escape.'"""
Malachi,3,16,"Then those who feared the LORD spoke with one another. The LORD paid attention and heard them, and a book of remembrance was written before him of those who feared the LORD and esteemed his name."
Malachi,3,17,"""They shall be mine, says the LORD of hosts, in the day when I make up my treasured possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him."
Malachi,3,18,"Then once more you shall see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him."
Malachi,4,1,"""For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble. The day that is coming shall set them ablaze, says the LORD of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch."
Malachi,4,2,"But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings. You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall."
Malachi,4,3,"And you shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day when I act, says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,4,4,"""Remember the law of my servant Moses, the statutes and rules that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel."
Malachi,4,5,"""Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes."

Matthew,1,1,"The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."
Matthew,1,2,"Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,"
Matthew,1,3,"and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram,"
Matthew,1,4,"and Ram the father of Amminadab, and Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon,"
Matthew,1,5,"and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse,"
Matthew,1,6,"and Jesse the father of David the king.And David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah,"
Matthew,1,7,"and Solomon the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asaph,"
Matthew,1,8,"and Asaph the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah,"
Matthew,1,9,"and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,"
Matthew,1,10,"and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amos, and Amos the father of Josiah,"
Matthew,1,11,"and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon."
Matthew,1,12,"And after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,"
Matthew,1,13,"and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, and Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor,"
Matthew,1,14,"and Azor the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud,"
Matthew,1,15,"and Eliud the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob,"
Matthew,1,16,"and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ."
Matthew,1,17,"So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations."
Matthew,1,18,"Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit."
Matthew,1,19,"And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly."
Matthew,1,20,"But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, ""Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
Matthew,1,21,"She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."""
Matthew,1,22,All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:
Matthew,1,23,"""Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel""(which means, God with us)."
Matthew,1,24,"When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife,"
Matthew,1,25,but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.
Matthew,2,1,"Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem,"
Matthew,2,2,"saying, ""Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him."""
Matthew,2,3,"When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;"
Matthew,2,4,"and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born."
Matthew,2,5,"They told him, ""In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:"
Matthew,2,6,"""'And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'"""
Matthew,2,7,Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared.
Matthew,2,8,"And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, ""Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him."""
Matthew,2,9,"After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was."
Matthew,2,10,"When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy."
Matthew,2,11,"And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh."
Matthew,2,12,"And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way."
Matthew,2,13,"Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, ""Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him."""
Matthew,2,14,And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt
Matthew,2,15,"and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, ""Out of Egypt I called my son."""
Matthew,2,16,"Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men."
Matthew,2,17,Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:
Matthew,2,18,"""A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be comforted, because they are no more."""
Matthew,2,19,"But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,"
Matthew,2,20,"saying, ""Rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."""
Matthew,2,21,And he rose and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
Matthew,2,22,"But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee."
Matthew,2,23,"And he went and lived in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled: ""He shall be called a Nazarene."""
Matthew,3,1,"In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,"
Matthew,3,2,"""Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."""
Matthew,3,3,"For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, ""The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.'"""
Matthew,3,4,"Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey."
Matthew,3,5,"Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him,"
Matthew,3,6,"and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins."
Matthew,3,7,"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, ""You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Matthew,3,8,Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.
Matthew,3,9,"And do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father,' for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham."
Matthew,3,10,Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Matthew,3,11,"""I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire."
Matthew,3,12,"His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."""
Matthew,3,13,"Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him."
Matthew,3,14,"John would have prevented him, saying, ""I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"""
Matthew,3,15,"But Jesus answered him, ""Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness."" Then he consented."
Matthew,3,16,"And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him;"
Matthew,3,17,"and behold, a voice from heaven said, ""This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."""
Matthew,4,1,Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
Matthew,4,2,"And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry."
Matthew,4,3,"And the tempter came and said to him, ""If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."""
Matthew,4,4,"But he answered, ""It is written, ""'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"""
Matthew,4,5,Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple
Matthew,4,6,"and said to him, ""If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, ""'He will command his angels concerning you,'and ""'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"""
Matthew,4,7,"Jesus said to him, ""Again it is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"""
Matthew,4,8,"Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory."
Matthew,4,9,"And he said to him, ""All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me."""
Matthew,4,10,"Then Jesus said to him, ""Be gone, Satan! For it is written, ""'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"""
Matthew,4,11,"Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him."
Matthew,4,12,"Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee."
Matthew,4,13,"And leaving Nazareth he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali,"
Matthew,4,14,so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
Matthew,4,15,"""The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles--"
Matthew,4,16,"the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, on them a light has dawned."""
Matthew,4,17,"From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, ""Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."""
Matthew,4,18,"While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen."
Matthew,4,19,"And he said to them, ""Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."""
Matthew,4,20,Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Matthew,4,21,"And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them."
Matthew,4,22,Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
Matthew,4,23,"And he went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction among the people."
Matthew,4,24,"So his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, those oppressed by demons, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them."
Matthew,4,25,"And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan."
Matthew,5,1,"Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him."
Matthew,5,2,"And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:"
Matthew,5,3,"""Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,5,4,"""Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted."
Matthew,5,5,"""Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."
Matthew,5,6,"""Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied."
Matthew,5,7,"""Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy."
Matthew,5,8,"""Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
Matthew,5,9,"""Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God."
Matthew,5,10,"""Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,5,11,"""Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account."
Matthew,5,12,"Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you."
Matthew,5,13,"""You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet."
Matthew,5,14,"""You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden."
Matthew,5,15,"Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house."
Matthew,5,16,"In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven."
Matthew,5,17,"""Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them."
Matthew,5,18,"For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished."
Matthew,5,19,"Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,5,20,"For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,5,21,"""You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.'"
Matthew,5,22,"But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire."
Matthew,5,23,"So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,"
Matthew,5,24,"leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift."
Matthew,5,25,"Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison."
Matthew,5,26,"Truly, I say to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny."
Matthew,5,27,"""You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'"
Matthew,5,28,But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Matthew,5,29,"If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell."
Matthew,5,30,"And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell."
Matthew,5,31,"""It was also said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.'"
Matthew,5,32,"But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery."
Matthew,5,33,"""Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.'"
Matthew,5,34,"But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,"
Matthew,5,35,"or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King."
Matthew,5,36,"And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black."
Matthew,5,37,Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes from evil.
Matthew,5,38,"""You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'"
Matthew,5,39,"But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also."
Matthew,5,40,"And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well."
Matthew,5,41,"And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles."
Matthew,5,42,"Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you."
Matthew,5,43,"""You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'"
Matthew,5,44,"But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,"
Matthew,5,45,"so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
Matthew,5,46,"For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?"
Matthew,5,47,"And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?"
Matthew,5,48,"You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
Matthew,6,1,"""Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven."
Matthew,6,2,"""Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward."
Matthew,6,3,"But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,"
Matthew,6,4,so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
Matthew,6,5,"""And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward."
Matthew,6,6,"But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you."
Matthew,6,7,"""And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words."
Matthew,6,8,"Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him."
Matthew,6,9,"Pray then like this: ""Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."
Matthew,6,10,"Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
Matthew,6,11,"Give us this day our daily bread,"
Matthew,6,12,"and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors."
Matthew,6,13,"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
Matthew,6,14,"For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you,"
Matthew,6,15,"but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
Matthew,6,16,"""And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward."
Matthew,6,17,"But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,"
Matthew,6,18,that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
Matthew,6,19,"""Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal,"
Matthew,6,20,"but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal."
Matthew,6,21,"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
Matthew,6,22,"""The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light,"
Matthew,6,23,"but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!"
Matthew,6,24,"""No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money."
Matthew,6,25,"""Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?"
Matthew,6,26,"Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?"
Matthew,6,27,And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?
Matthew,6,28,"And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin,"
Matthew,6,29,"yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
Matthew,6,30,"But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?"
Matthew,6,31,"Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'"
Matthew,6,32,"For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all."
Matthew,6,33,"But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."
Matthew,6,34,"""Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble."
Matthew,7,1,"""Judge not, that you be not judged."
Matthew,7,2,"For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you."
Matthew,7,3,"Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?"
Matthew,7,4,"Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when there is the log in your own eye?"
Matthew,7,5,"You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye."
Matthew,7,6,"""Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you."
Matthew,7,7,"""Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."
Matthew,7,8,"For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened."
Matthew,7,9,"Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?"
Matthew,7,10,"Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?"
Matthew,7,11,"If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!"
Matthew,7,12,"""So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets."
Matthew,7,13,"""Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many."
Matthew,7,14,"For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few."
Matthew,7,15,"""Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves."
Matthew,7,16,"You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?"
Matthew,7,17,"So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit."
Matthew,7,18,"A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit."
Matthew,7,19,Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Matthew,7,20,Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.
Matthew,7,21,"""Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."
Matthew,7,22,"On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'"
Matthew,7,23,"And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"
Matthew,7,24,"""Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
Matthew,7,25,"And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock."
Matthew,7,26,And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
Matthew,7,27,"And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it."""
Matthew,7,28,"And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching,"
Matthew,7,29,"for he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes."
Matthew,8,1,"When he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him."
Matthew,8,2,"And behold, a leper came to him and knelt before him, saying, ""Lord, if you will, you can make me clean."""
Matthew,8,3,"And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, ""I will; be clean."" And immediately his leprosy was cleansed."
Matthew,8,4,"And Jesus said to him, ""See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them."""
Matthew,8,5,"When he entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, appealing to him,"
Matthew,8,6,"""Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering terribly."""
Matthew,8,7,"And he said to him, ""I will come and heal him."""
Matthew,8,8,"But the centurion replied, ""Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed."
Matthew,8,9,"For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."""
Matthew,8,10,"When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, ""Truly, I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith."
Matthew,8,11,"I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,"
Matthew,8,12,"while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."""
Matthew,8,13,"And to the centurion Jesus said, ""Go; let it be done for you as you have believed."" And the servant was healed at that very moment."
Matthew,8,14,"And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever."
Matthew,8,15,"He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and began to serve him."
Matthew,8,16,"That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick."
Matthew,8,17,"This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: ""He took our illnesses and bore our diseases."""
Matthew,8,18,"Now when Jesus saw a great crowd around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side."
Matthew,8,19,"And a scribe came up and said to him, ""Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."""
Matthew,8,20,"And Jesus said to him, ""Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."""
Matthew,8,21,"Another of the disciples said to him, ""Lord, let me first go and bury my father."""
Matthew,8,22,"And Jesus said to him, ""Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead."""
Matthew,8,23,"And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him."
Matthew,8,24,"And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep."
Matthew,8,25,"And they went and woke him, saying, ""Save us, Lord; we are perishing."""
Matthew,8,26,"And he said to them, ""Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?"" Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm."
Matthew,8,27,"And the men marveled, saying, ""What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?"""
Matthew,8,28,"And when he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one could pass that way."
Matthew,8,29,"And behold, they cried out, ""What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"""
Matthew,8,30,Now a herd of many pigs was feeding at some distance from them.
Matthew,8,31,"And the demons begged him, saying, ""If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of pigs."""
Matthew,8,32,"And he said to them, ""Go."" So they came out and went into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters."
Matthew,8,33,"The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men."
Matthew,8,34,"And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region."
Matthew,9,1,And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city.
Matthew,9,2,"And behold, some people brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, ""Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven."""
Matthew,9,3,"And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, ""This man is blaspheming."""
Matthew,9,4,"But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, ""Why do you think evil in your hearts?"
Matthew,9,5,"For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?"
Matthew,9,6,"But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins""--he then said to the paralytic--""Rise, pick up your bed and go home."""
Matthew,9,7,And he rose and went home.
Matthew,9,8,"When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men."
Matthew,9,9,"As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, ""Follow me."" And he rose and followed him."
Matthew,9,10,"And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples."
Matthew,9,11,"And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, ""Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"""
Matthew,9,12,"But when he heard it, he said, ""Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
Matthew,9,13,"Go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."""
Matthew,9,14,"Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, ""Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"""
Matthew,9,15,"And Jesus said to them, ""Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast."
Matthew,9,16,"No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made."
Matthew,9,17,"Neither is new wine put into old wineskins. If it is, the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved."""
Matthew,9,18,"While he was saying these things to them, behold, a ruler came in and knelt before him, saying, ""My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."""
Matthew,9,19,"And Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples."
Matthew,9,20,"And behold, a woman who had suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment,"
Matthew,9,21,"for she said to herself, ""If I only touch his garment, I will be made well."""
Matthew,9,22,"Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, ""Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well."" And instantly the woman was made well."
Matthew,9,23,"And when Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,"
Matthew,9,24,"he said, ""Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping."" And they laughed at him."
Matthew,9,25,"But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose."
Matthew,9,26,And the report of this went through all that district.
Matthew,9,27,"And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, ""Have mercy on us, Son of David."""
Matthew,9,28,"When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, ""Do you believe that I am able to do this?"" They said to him, ""Yes, Lord."""
Matthew,9,29,"Then he touched their eyes, saying, ""According to your faith be it done to you."""
Matthew,9,30,"And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, ""See that no one knows about it."""
Matthew,9,31,But they went away and spread his fame through all that district.
Matthew,9,32,"As they were going away, behold, a demon-oppressed man who was mute was brought to him."
Matthew,9,33,"And when the demon had been cast out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, ""Never was anything like this seen in Israel."""
Matthew,9,34,"But the Pharisees said, ""He casts out demons by the prince of demons."""
Matthew,9,35,"And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction."
Matthew,9,36,"When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd."
Matthew,9,37,"Then he said to his disciples, ""The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few;"
Matthew,9,38,"therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest."""
Matthew,10,1,"And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction."
Matthew,10,2,"The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;"
Matthew,10,3,"Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;"
Matthew,10,4,"Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him."
Matthew,10,5,"These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, ""Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans,"
Matthew,10,6,but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew,10,7,"And proclaim as you go, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'"
Matthew,10,8,"Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay."
Matthew,10,9,"Acquire no gold nor silver nor copper for your belts,"
Matthew,10,10,"no bag for your journey, nor two tunics nor sandals nor a staff, for the laborer deserves his food."
Matthew,10,11,"And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it and stay there until you depart."
Matthew,10,12,"As you enter the house, greet it."
Matthew,10,13,"And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you."
Matthew,10,14,"And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town."
Matthew,10,15,"Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town."
Matthew,10,16,"""Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves."
Matthew,10,17,"Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues,"
Matthew,10,18,"and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles."
Matthew,10,19,"When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour."
Matthew,10,20,"For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you."
Matthew,10,21,"Brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death,"
Matthew,10,22,and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
Matthew,10,23,"When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next, for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes."
Matthew,10,24,"""A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master."
Matthew,10,25,"It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household."
Matthew,10,26,"""So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known."
Matthew,10,27,"What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops."
Matthew,10,28,And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Matthew,10,29,Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
Matthew,10,30,But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
Matthew,10,31,"Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows."
Matthew,10,32,"So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven,"
Matthew,10,33,"but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven."
Matthew,10,34,"""Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword."
Matthew,10,35,"For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."
Matthew,10,36,And a person's enemies will be those of his own household.
Matthew,10,37,"Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
Matthew,10,38,And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Matthew,10,39,"Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
Matthew,10,40,"""Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me."
Matthew,10,41,"The one who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and the one who receives a righteous person because he is a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward."
Matthew,10,42,"And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward."""
Matthew,11,1,"When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities."
Matthew,11,2,"Now when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples"
Matthew,11,3,"and said to him, ""Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?"""
Matthew,11,4,"And Jesus answered them, ""Go and tell John what you hear and see:"
Matthew,11,5,"the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them."
Matthew,11,6,"And blessed is the one who is not offended by me."""
Matthew,11,7,"As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: ""What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
Matthew,11,8,"What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses."
Matthew,11,9,"What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet."
Matthew,11,10,"This is he of whom it is written, ""'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'"
Matthew,11,11,"Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
Matthew,11,12,"From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force."
Matthew,11,13,"For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John,"
Matthew,11,14,"and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come."
Matthew,11,15,"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
Matthew,11,16,"""But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates,"
Matthew,11,17,"""'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'"
Matthew,11,18,"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'"
Matthew,11,19,"The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds."""
Matthew,11,20,"Then he began to denounce the cities where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent."
Matthew,11,21,"""Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
Matthew,11,22,"But I tell you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you."
Matthew,11,23,"And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day."
Matthew,11,24,"But I tell you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you."""
Matthew,11,25,"At that time Jesus declared, ""I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children;"
Matthew,11,26,"yes, Father, for such was your gracious will."
Matthew,11,27,"All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."
Matthew,11,28,"Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
Matthew,11,29,"Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."
Matthew,11,30,"For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."""
Matthew,12,1,"At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat."
Matthew,12,2,"But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, ""Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."""
Matthew,12,3,"He said to them, ""Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him:"
Matthew,12,4,"how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?"
Matthew,12,5,Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?
Matthew,12,6,"I tell you, something greater than the temple is here."
Matthew,12,7,"And if you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless."
Matthew,12,8,"For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath."""
Matthew,12,9,He went on from there and entered their synagogue.
Matthew,12,10,"And a man was there with a withered hand. And they asked him, ""Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?""--so that they might accuse him."
Matthew,12,11,"He said to them, ""Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?"
Matthew,12,12,"Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."""
Matthew,12,13,"Then he said to the man, ""Stretch out your hand."" And the man stretched it out, and it was restored, healthy like the other."
Matthew,12,14,"But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him, how to destroy him."
Matthew,12,15,"Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all"
Matthew,12,16,and ordered them not to make him known.
Matthew,12,17,This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
Matthew,12,18,"""Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles."
Matthew,12,19,"He will not quarrel or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets;"
Matthew,12,20,"a bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not quench, until he brings justice to victory;"
Matthew,12,21,"and in his name the Gentiles will hope."""
Matthew,12,22,"Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the man spoke and saw."
Matthew,12,23,"And all the people were amazed, and said, ""Can this be the Son of David?"""
Matthew,12,24,"But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, ""It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons."""
Matthew,12,25,"Knowing their thoughts, he said to them, ""Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand."
Matthew,12,26,"And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?"
Matthew,12,27,"And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges."
Matthew,12,28,"But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you."
Matthew,12,29,"Or how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house."
Matthew,12,30,"Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters."
Matthew,12,31,"Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven."
Matthew,12,32,"And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
Matthew,12,33,"""Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit."
Matthew,12,34,"You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."
Matthew,12,35,"The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil."
Matthew,12,36,"I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak,"
Matthew,12,37,"for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned."""
Matthew,12,38,"Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, ""Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you."""
Matthew,12,39,"But he answered them, ""An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Matthew,12,40,"For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."
Matthew,12,41,"The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here."
Matthew,12,42,"The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here."
Matthew,12,43,"""When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, but finds none."
Matthew,12,44,"Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order."
Matthew,12,45,"Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So also will it be with this evil generation."""
Matthew,12,46,"While he was still speaking to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him."
Matthew,12,48,"But he replied to the man who told him, ""Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"""
Matthew,12,49,"And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, ""Here are my mother and my brothers!"
Matthew,12,50,"For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."""
Matthew,13,1,That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea.
Matthew,13,2,"And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach."
Matthew,13,3,"And he told them many things in parables, saying: ""A sower went out to sow."
Matthew,13,4,"And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them."
Matthew,13,5,"Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil,"
Matthew,13,6,"but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away."
Matthew,13,7,"Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them."
Matthew,13,8,"Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty."
Matthew,13,9,"He who has ears, let him hear."""
Matthew,13,10,"Then the disciples came and said to him, ""Why do you speak to them in parables?"""
Matthew,13,11,"And he answered them, ""To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given."
Matthew,13,12,"For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away."
Matthew,13,13,"This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand."
Matthew,13,14,"Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says: ""'You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive."
Matthew,13,15,"For this people's heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.'"
Matthew,13,16,"But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear."
Matthew,13,17,"Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it."
Matthew,13,18,"""Hear then the parable of the sower:"
Matthew,13,19,"When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path."
Matthew,13,20,"As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy,"
Matthew,13,21,"yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away."
Matthew,13,22,"As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful."
Matthew,13,23,"As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty."""
Matthew,13,24,"He put another parable before them, saying, ""The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field,"
Matthew,13,25,"but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away."
Matthew,13,26,"So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also."
Matthew,13,27,"And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, 'Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?'"
Matthew,13,28,"He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' So the servants said to him, 'Then do you want us to go and gather them?'"
Matthew,13,29,"But he said, 'No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them."
Matthew,13,30,"Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'"""
Matthew,13,31,"He put another parable before them, saying, ""The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field."
Matthew,13,32,"It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches."""
Matthew,13,33,"He told them another parable. ""The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened."""
Matthew,13,34,"All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable."
Matthew,13,35,"This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: ""I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world."""
Matthew,13,36,"Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, ""Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field."""
Matthew,13,37,"He answered, ""The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man."
Matthew,13,38,"The field is the world, and the good seed is the children of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,"
Matthew,13,39,"and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the close of the age, and the reapers are angels."
Matthew,13,40,"Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the close of the age."
Matthew,13,41,"The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers,"
Matthew,13,42,and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew,13,43,"Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear."
Matthew,13,44,"""The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field."
Matthew,13,45,"""Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls,"
Matthew,13,46,"who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it."
Matthew,13,47,"""Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind."
Matthew,13,48,"When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad."
Matthew,13,49,So it will be at the close of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous
Matthew,13,50,and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew,13,51,"""Have you understood all these things?"" They said to him, ""Yes."""
Matthew,13,52,"And he said to them, ""Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old."""
Matthew,13,53,"And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there,"
Matthew,13,54,"and coming to his hometown he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, ""Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?"
Matthew,13,55,Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Matthew,13,56,"And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?"""
Matthew,13,57,"And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, ""A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household."""
Matthew,13,58,"And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief."
Matthew,14,1,"At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus,"
Matthew,14,2,"and he said to his servants, ""This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him."""
Matthew,14,3,"For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife,"
Matthew,14,4,"because John had been saying to him, ""It is not lawful for you to have her."""
Matthew,14,5,"And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet."
Matthew,14,6,"But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod,"
Matthew,14,7,so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
Matthew,14,8,"Prompted by her mother, she said, ""Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter."""
Matthew,14,9,"And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given."
Matthew,14,10,"He sent and had John beheaded in the prison,"
Matthew,14,11,"and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother."
Matthew,14,12,"And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus."
Matthew,14,13,"Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns."
Matthew,14,14,"When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick."
Matthew,14,15,"Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, ""This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves."""
Matthew,14,16,"But Jesus said, ""They need not go away; you give them something to eat."""
Matthew,14,17,"They said to him, ""We have only five loaves here and two fish."""
Matthew,14,18,"And he said, ""Bring them here to me."""
Matthew,14,19,"Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds."
Matthew,14,20,And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over.
Matthew,14,21,"And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children."
Matthew,14,22,"Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds."
Matthew,14,23,"And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,"
Matthew,14,24,"but the boat by this time was a long way from the land, beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them."
Matthew,14,25,"And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea."
Matthew,14,26,"But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, ""It is a ghost!"" and they cried out in fear."
Matthew,14,27,"But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, ""Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid."""
Matthew,14,28,"And Peter answered him, ""Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."""
Matthew,14,29,"He said, ""Come."" So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus."
Matthew,14,30,"But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, ""Lord, save me."""
Matthew,14,31,"Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, ""O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"""
Matthew,14,32,"And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased."
Matthew,14,33,"And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, ""Truly you are the Son of God."""
Matthew,14,34,"And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret."
Matthew,14,35,"And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent around to all that region and brought to him all who were sick"
Matthew,14,36,and implored him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well.
Matthew,15,1,"Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said,"
Matthew,15,2,"""Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat."""
Matthew,15,3,"He answered them, ""And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?"
Matthew,15,4,"For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.'"
Matthew,15,5,"But you say, 'If anyone tells his father or his mother, What you would have gained from me is given to God,"
Matthew,15,6,he need not honor his father.' So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God.
Matthew,15,7,"You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said:"
Matthew,15,8,"""'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me;"
Matthew,15,9,"in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'"""
Matthew,15,10,"And he called the people to him and said to them, ""Hear and understand:"
Matthew,15,11,"it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person."""
Matthew,15,12,"Then the disciples came and said to him, ""Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?"""
Matthew,15,13,"He answered, ""Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up."
Matthew,15,14,"Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit."""
Matthew,15,15,"But Peter said to him, ""Explain the parable to us."""
Matthew,15,16,"And he said, ""Are you also still without understanding?"
Matthew,15,17,Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled?
Matthew,15,18,"But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person."
Matthew,15,19,"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander."
Matthew,15,20,"These are what defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone."""
Matthew,15,21,And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew,15,22,"And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, ""Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon."""
Matthew,15,23,"But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, ""Send her away, for she is crying out after us."""
Matthew,15,24,"He answered, ""I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."""
Matthew,15,25,"But she came and knelt before him, saying, ""Lord, help me."""
Matthew,15,26,"And he answered, ""It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."""
Matthew,15,27,"She said, ""Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."""
Matthew,15,28,"Then Jesus answered her, ""O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire."" And her daughter was healed instantly."
Matthew,15,29,Jesus went on from there and walked beside the Sea of Galilee. And he went up on the mountain and sat down there.
Matthew,15,30,"And great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and they put them at his feet, and he healed them,"
Matthew,15,31,"so that the crowd wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel."
Matthew,15,32,"Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, ""I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. And I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."""
Matthew,15,33,"And the disciples said to him, ""Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd?"""
Matthew,15,34,"And Jesus said to them, ""How many loaves do you have?"" They said, ""Seven, and a few small fish."""
Matthew,15,35,"And directing the crowd to sit down on the ground,"
Matthew,15,36,"he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds."
Matthew,15,37,And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over.
Matthew,15,38,"Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children."
Matthew,15,39,"And after sending away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan."
Matthew,16,1,"And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven."
Matthew,16,2,"He answered them, ""When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'"
Matthew,16,3,"And in the morning, 'It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times."
Matthew,16,4,"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah."" So he left them and departed."
Matthew,16,5,"When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to bring any bread."
Matthew,16,6,"Jesus said to them, ""Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."""
Matthew,16,7,"And they began discussing it among themselves, saying, ""We brought no bread."""
Matthew,16,8,"But Jesus, aware of this, said, ""O you of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread?"
Matthew,16,9,"Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?"
Matthew,16,10,"Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?"
Matthew,16,11,"How is it that you fail to understand that I did not speak about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."""
Matthew,16,12,"Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
Matthew,16,13,"Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, ""Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"""
Matthew,16,14,"And they said, ""Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."""
Matthew,16,15,"He said to them, ""But who do you say that I am?"""
Matthew,16,16,"Simon Peter replied, ""You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."""
Matthew,16,17,"And Jesus answered him, ""Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
Matthew,16,18,"And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
Matthew,16,19,"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."""
Matthew,16,20,Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.
Matthew,16,21,"From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised."
Matthew,16,22,"And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, ""Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you."""
Matthew,16,23,"But he turned and said to Peter, ""Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."""
Matthew,16,24,"Then Jesus told his disciples, ""If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
Matthew,16,25,"For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
Matthew,16,26,For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what shall a man give in return for his life?
Matthew,16,27,"For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay each person according to what he has done."
Matthew,16,28,"Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."""
Matthew,17,1,"And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves."
Matthew,17,2,"And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light."
Matthew,17,3,"And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him."
Matthew,17,4,"And Peter said to Jesus, ""Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah."""
Matthew,17,5,"He was still speaking when, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, ""This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him."""
Matthew,17,6,"When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified."
Matthew,17,7,"But Jesus came and touched them, saying, ""Rise, and have no fear."""
Matthew,17,8,"And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only."
Matthew,17,9,"And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, ""Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."""
Matthew,17,10,"And the disciples asked him, ""Then why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?"""
Matthew,17,11,"He answered, ""Elijah does come, and he will restore all things."
Matthew,17,12,"But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands."""
Matthew,17,13,Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.
Matthew,17,14,"And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and, kneeling before him,"
Matthew,17,15,"said, ""Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly. For often he falls into the fire, and often into the water."
Matthew,17,16,"And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him."""
Matthew,17,17,"And Jesus answered, ""O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me."""
Matthew,17,18,"And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was healed instantly."
Matthew,17,19,"Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, ""Why could we not cast it out?"""
Matthew,17,20,"He said to them, ""Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you."""
Matthew,17,21,See Footnote
Matthew,17,22,"As they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, ""The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men,"
Matthew,17,23,"and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day."" And they were greatly distressed."
Matthew,17,24,"When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the half-shekel tax went up to Peter and said, ""Does your teacher not pay the tax?"""
Matthew,17,25,"He said, ""Yes."" And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, ""What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tax? From their sons or from others?"""
Matthew,17,26,"And when he said, ""From others,"" Jesus said to him, ""Then the sons are free."
Matthew,17,27,"However, not to give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel. Take that and give it to them for me and for yourself."""
Matthew,18,1,"At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, ""Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"""
Matthew,18,2,"And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them"
Matthew,18,3,"and said, ""Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,18,4,Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew,18,5,"""Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me,"
Matthew,18,6,"but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea."
Matthew,18,7,"""Woe to the world for temptations to sin! For it is necessary that temptations come, but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes!"
Matthew,18,8,"And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire."
Matthew,18,9,"And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire."
Matthew,18,10,"""See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
Matthew,18,11,See Footnote
Matthew,18,12,"What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray?"
Matthew,18,13,"And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray."
Matthew,18,14,So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
Matthew,18,15,"""If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."
Matthew,18,16,"But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses."
Matthew,18,17,"If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector."

Matthew,18,20,"For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them."""
Matthew,18,21,"Then Peter came up and said to him, ""Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?"""
Matthew,18,22,"Jesus said to him, ""I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven."
Matthew,18,23,"""Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants."
Matthew,18,24,"When he began to settle, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents."
Matthew,18,25,"And since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made."
Matthew,18,26,"So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.'"
Matthew,18,27,"And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt."

Matthew,18,29,"So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you.'"
Matthew,18,30,He refused and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt.
Matthew,18,31,"When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all that had taken place."
Matthew,18,32,"Then his master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me."

Matthew,19,5,"and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh'?"
Matthew,19,6,"So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate."""
Matthew,19,7,"They said to him, ""Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?"""

Matthew,21,4,"This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying,"

Matthew,21,6,The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.
Matthew,21,7,"They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them."
Matthew,21,8,"Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road."
Matthew,21,9,"And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, ""Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"""
Matthew,21,10,"And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, ""Who is this?"""
Matthew,21,11,"And the crowds said, ""This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee."""
Matthew,21,12,"And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons."

Matthew,21,16,"and they said to him, ""Do you hear what these are saying?"" And Jesus said to them, ""Yes; have you never read, ""'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?"""
Matthew,21,17,"And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there."
Matthew,21,18,"In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he became hungry."
Matthew,21,19,"And seeing a fig tree by the wayside, he went to it and found nothing on it but only leaves. And he said to it, ""May no fruit ever come from you again!"" And the fig tree withered at once."
Matthew,21,20,"When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, ""How did the fig tree wither at once?"""
Matthew,21,21,"And Jesus answered them, ""Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen."
Matthew,21,22,"And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith."""
Matthew,21,23,"And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, ""By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?"""
Matthew,21,24,"Jesus answered them, ""I also will ask you one question, and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things."
Matthew,21,25,"The baptism of John, from where did it come? From heaven or from man?"" And they discussed it among themselves, saying, ""If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
Matthew,21,26,"But if we say, 'From man,' we are afraid of the crowd, for they all hold that John was a prophet."""
Matthew,21,27,"So they answered Jesus, ""We do not know."" And he said to them, ""Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
Matthew,21,28,"""What do you think? A man had two sons. And he went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.'"
Matthew,21,29,"And he answered, 'I will not,' but afterward he changed his mind and went."

Matthew,21,31,"Which of the two did the will of his father?"" They said, ""The first."" Jesus said to them, ""Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you."
Matthew,21,32,"For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him."
Matthew,21,33,"""Hear another parable. There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants, and went into another country."
Matthew,21,34,"When the season for fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit."
Matthew,21,35,"And the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another."

Matthew,21,45,"When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them."
Matthew,21,46,"And although they were seeking to arrest him, they feared the crowds, because they held him to be a prophet."
Matthew,22,1,"And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying,"
Matthew,22,2,"""The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son,"
Matthew,22,3,"and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come."
Matthew,22,4,"Again he sent other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
Matthew,22,5,"But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business,"
Matthew,22,6,"while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them."
Matthew,22,7,"The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city."
Matthew,22,8,"Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy."
Matthew,22,9,Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.'

Matthew,22,17,"Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"""
Matthew,22,18,"But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, ""Why put me to the test, you hypocrites?"

Matthew,22,21,"They said, ""Caesar's."" Then he said to them, ""Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."""
Matthew,22,22,"When they heard it, they marveled. And they left him and went away."
Matthew,22,23,"The same day Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question,"

Matthew,22,26,"So too the second and third, down to the seventh."
Matthew,22,27,"After them all, the woman died."
Matthew,22,28,"In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her."""
Matthew,22,29,"But Jesus answered them, ""You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God."

Matthew,22,31,"And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God:"
Matthew,22,32,"'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead, but of the living."""
Matthew,22,33,"And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching."

Matthew,22,39,And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
Matthew,22,40,"On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets."""
Matthew,22,41,"Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,"
Matthew,22,42,"saying, ""What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?"" They said to him, ""The son of David."""

Matthew,22,46,"And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions."

Matthew,23,5,"They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long,"
Matthew,23,6,and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues
Matthew,23,7,and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others.
Matthew,23,8,"But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers."
Matthew,23,9,"And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven."
Matthew,23,10,"Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ."

Matthew,23,15,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves."
Matthew,23,16,"""Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.'"
Matthew,23,17,"You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred?"
Matthew,23,18,"And you say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath.'"
Matthew,23,19,"You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?"
Matthew,23,20,So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
Matthew,23,21,And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it.
Matthew,23,22,And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.
Matthew,23,23,"""Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others."

Matthew,23,25,"""Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence."

Matthew,23,27,"""Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness."

Matthew,23,31,Thus you witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.

Matthew,24,6,"And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet."
Matthew,24,7,"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places."
Matthew,24,8,All these are but the beginning of the birth pains.
Matthew,24,9,"""Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake."
Matthew,24,10,And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another.
Matthew,24,11,And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.
Matthew,24,12,"And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold."
Matthew,24,13,But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
Matthew,24,14,"And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come."
Matthew,24,15,"""So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),"

Matthew,24,18,and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.
Matthew,24,19,And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days!
Matthew,24,20,Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath.
Matthew,24,21,"For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be."
Matthew,24,22,"And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short."
Matthew,24,23,"Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it."

Matthew,24,39,"and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man."
Matthew,24,40,Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left.
Matthew,24,41,Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left.

Matthew,25,4,but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.
Matthew,25,5,"As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept."
Matthew,25,6,"But at midnight there was a cry, 'Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.'"

Matthew,25,16,"He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more."
Matthew,25,17,So also he who had the two talents made two talents more.
Matthew,25,18,But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money.
Matthew,25,19,Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them.
Matthew,25,20,"And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.'"
Matthew,25,21,"His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.'"

Matthew,25,23,"His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.'"
Matthew,25,24,"He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed,"

Matthew,25,26,"But his master answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed and gather where I scattered no seed?"
Matthew,25,27,"Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest."
Matthew,25,28,So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.
Matthew,25,29,"For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away."
Matthew,25,30,And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'

Matthew,25,33,"And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left."
Matthew,25,34,"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."
Matthew,25,35,"For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me,"

Matthew,25,44,"Then they also will answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?'"
Matthew,25,45,"Then he will answer them, saying, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.'"

Matthew,26,9,"For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor."""
Matthew,26,10,"But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, ""Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me."
Matthew,26,11,"For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me."
Matthew,26,12,"In pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial."
Matthew,26,13,"Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her."""
Matthew,26,14,"Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests"
Matthew,26,15,"and said, ""What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?"" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver."
Matthew,26,16,And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.
Matthew,26,17,"Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, ""Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?"""
Matthew,26,18,"He said, ""Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The Teacher says, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"""
Matthew,26,19,"And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover."
Matthew,26,20,"When it was evening, he reclined at table with the twelve."
Matthew,26,21,"And as they were eating, he said, ""Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me."""
Matthew,26,22,"And they were very sorrowful and began to say to him one after another, ""Is it I, Lord?"""
Matthew,26,23,"He answered, ""He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me."
Matthew,26,24,"The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born."""
Matthew,26,25,"Judas, who would betray him, answered, ""Is it I, Rabbi?"" He said to him, ""You have said so."""
Matthew,26,26,"Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, ""Take, eat; this is my body."""
Matthew,26,27,"And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, ""Drink of it, all of you,"
Matthew,26,28,"for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."
Matthew,26,29,"I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."""
Matthew,26,30,"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives."
Matthew,26,31,"Then Jesus said to them, ""You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
Matthew,26,32,"But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee."""
Matthew,26,33,"Peter answered him, ""Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away."""
Matthew,26,34,"Jesus said to him, ""Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."""
Matthew,26,35,"Peter said to him, ""Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you!"" And all the disciples said the same."
Matthew,26,36,"Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, ""Sit here, while I go over there and pray."""
Matthew,26,37,"And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled."
Matthew,26,38,"Then he said to them, ""My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me."""
Matthew,26,39,"And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, ""My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."""
Matthew,26,40,"And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, ""So, could you not watch with me one hour?"
Matthew,26,41,"Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."""
Matthew,26,42,"Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, ""My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done."""
Matthew,26,43,"And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy."
Matthew,26,44,"So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again."
Matthew,26,45,"Then he came to the disciples and said to them, ""Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Matthew,26,46,"Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand."""
Matthew,26,47,"While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people."
Matthew,26,48,"Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, ""The one I will kiss is the man; seize him."""
Matthew,26,49,"And he came up to Jesus at once and said, ""Greetings, Rabbi!"" And he kissed him."
Matthew,26,50,"Jesus said to him, ""Friend, do what you came to do."" Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him."
Matthew,26,51,"And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear."
Matthew,26,52,"Then Jesus said to him, ""Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Matthew,26,53,"Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?"
Matthew,26,54,"But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?"""
Matthew,26,55,"At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, ""Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me."
Matthew,26,56,"But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled."" Then all the disciples left him and fled."
Matthew,26,57,"Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered."
Matthew,26,58,"And Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end."
Matthew,26,59,"Now the chief priests and the whole Council were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death,"
Matthew,26,60,"but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward"
Matthew,26,61,"and said, ""This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.'"""
Matthew,26,62,"And the high priest stood up and said, ""Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?"""
Matthew,26,63,"But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, ""I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."""
Matthew,26,64,"Jesus said to him, ""You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven."""
Matthew,26,65,"Then the high priest tore his robes and said, ""He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy."
Matthew,26,66,"What is your judgment?"" They answered, ""He deserves death."""
Matthew,26,67,"Then they spit in his face and struck him. And some slapped him,"
Matthew,26,68,"saying, ""Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?"""
Matthew,26,69,"Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, ""You also were with Jesus the Galilean."""
Matthew,26,70,"But he denied it before them all, saying, ""I do not know what you mean."""
Matthew,26,71,"And when he went out to the entrance, another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, ""This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."""
Matthew,26,72,"And again he denied it with an oath: ""I do not know the man."""
Matthew,26,73,"After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, ""Certainly you too are one of them, for your accent betrays you."""
Matthew,26,74,"Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, ""I do not know the man."" And immediately the rooster crowed."
Matthew,26,75,"And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, ""Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."" And he went out and wept bitterly."
Matthew,27,1,"When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death."
Matthew,27,2,And they bound him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor.
Matthew,27,3,"Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,"
Matthew,27,4,"saying, ""I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."" They said, ""What is that to us? See to it yourself."""
Matthew,27,5,"And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself."
Matthew,27,6,"But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, ""It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money."""
Matthew,27,7,So they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field as a burial place for strangers.
Matthew,27,8,Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
Matthew,27,9,"Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, ""And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel,"
Matthew,27,10,"and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me."""
Matthew,27,11,"Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, ""Are you the King of the Jews?"" Jesus said, ""You have said so."""
Matthew,27,12,"But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer."
Matthew,27,13,"Then Pilate said to him, ""Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"""
Matthew,27,14,"But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed."
Matthew,27,15,Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted.
Matthew,27,16,And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
Matthew,27,17,"So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, ""Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"""
Matthew,27,18,For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up.
Matthew,27,19,"Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, ""Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream."""
Matthew,27,20,Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.
Matthew,27,21,"The governor again said to them, ""Which of the two do you want me to release for you?"" And they said, ""Barabbas."""
Matthew,27,22,"Pilate said to them, ""Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?"" They all said, ""Let him be crucified!"""
Matthew,27,23,"And he said, ""Why, what evil has he done?"" But they shouted all the more, ""Let him be crucified!"""
Matthew,27,24,"So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, ""I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves."""
Matthew,27,25,"And all the people answered, ""His blood be on us and on our children!"""
Matthew,27,26,"Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified."
Matthew,27,27,"Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor's headquarters, and they gathered the whole battalion before him."
Matthew,27,28,"And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,"
Matthew,27,29,"and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, ""Hail, King of the Jews!"""
Matthew,27,30,And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head.
Matthew,27,31,"And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him."
Matthew,27,32,"As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to carry his cross."
Matthew,27,33,"And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull),"
Matthew,27,34,"they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it."
Matthew,27,35,"And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots."
Matthew,27,36,Then they sat down and kept watch over him there.
Matthew,27,37,"And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, ""This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."""
Matthew,27,38,"Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left."
Matthew,27,39,"And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads"
Matthew,27,40,"and saying, ""You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross."""
Matthew,27,41,"So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,"
Matthew,27,42,"""He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him."
Matthew,27,43,"He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"""
Matthew,27,44,And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.
Matthew,27,45,Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
Matthew,27,46,"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, ""Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?"" that is, ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"""
Matthew,27,47,"And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, ""This man is calling Elijah."""
Matthew,27,48,"And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink."
Matthew,27,49,"But the others said, ""Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him."""
Matthew,27,50,And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.
Matthew,27,51,"And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split."
Matthew,27,52,"The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,"
Matthew,27,53,and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many.
Matthew,27,54,"When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, ""Truly this was the Son of God!"""
Matthew,27,55,"There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,"
Matthew,27,56,among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
Matthew,27,57,"When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus."
Matthew,27,58,He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
Matthew,27,59,And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud
Matthew,27,60,"and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away."
Matthew,27,61,"Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb."
Matthew,27,62,"Next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate"
Matthew,27,63,"and said, ""Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, 'After three days I will rise.'"
Matthew,27,64,"Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last fraud will be worse than the first."""
Matthew,27,65,"Pilate said to them, ""You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can."""
Matthew,27,66,So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.
Matthew,28,1,"Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb."
Matthew,28,2,"And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it."
Matthew,28,3,"His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow."
Matthew,28,4,And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men.
Matthew,28,5,"But the angel said to the women, ""Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified."
Matthew,28,6,"He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay."
Matthew,28,7,"Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you."""
Matthew,28,8,"So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples."
Matthew,28,9,"And behold, Jesus met them and said, ""Greetings!"" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him."
Matthew,28,10,"Then Jesus said to them, ""Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me."""
Matthew,28,11,"While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place."
Matthew,28,12,"And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers"
Matthew,28,13,"and said, ""Tell people, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.'"
Matthew,28,14,"And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."""
Matthew,28,15,So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.
Matthew,28,16,"Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them."
Matthew,28,17,"And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted."
Matthew,28,18,"And Jesus came and said to them, ""All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Matthew,28,19,"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,"
Matthew,28,20,"teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."""
Mark,1,1,"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God."
Mark,1,2,"As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, ""Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way,"
Mark,1,3,"the voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,'"""
Mark,1,4,"John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins."
Mark,1,5,"And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins."
Mark,1,6,Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey.
Mark,1,7,"And he preached, saying, ""After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie."
Mark,1,8,"I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."""
Mark,1,9,In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
Mark,1,10,"And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens opening and the Spirit descending on him like a dove."
Mark,1,11,"And a voice came from heaven, ""You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."""
Mark,1,12,The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.
Mark,1,13,"And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him."
Mark,1,14,"Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God,"
Mark,1,15,"and saying, ""The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."""
Mark,1,16,"Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen."
Mark,1,17,"And Jesus said to them, ""Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men."""
Mark,1,18,And immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Mark,1,19,"And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets."
Mark,1,20,"And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him."
Mark,1,21,"And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching."
Mark,1,22,"And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes."
Mark,1,23,"And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,"
Mark,1,24,"""What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God."""
Mark,1,25,"But Jesus rebuked him, saying, ""Be silent, and come out of him!"""
Mark,1,26,"And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him."
Mark,1,27,"And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, ""What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."""
Mark,1,28,And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.
Mark,1,29,"And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John."
Mark,1,30,"Now Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her."
Mark,1,31,"And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them."
Mark,1,32,That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons.
Mark,1,33,And the whole city was gathered together at the door.
Mark,1,34,"And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him."
Mark,1,35,"And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed."
Mark,1,36,"And Simon and those who were with him searched for him,"
Mark,1,37,"and they found him and said to him, ""Everyone is looking for you."""
Mark,1,38,"And he said to them, ""Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out."""
Mark,1,39,"And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons."
Mark,1,40,"And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, ""If you will, you can make me clean."""
Mark,1,41,"Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, ""I will; be clean."""
Mark,1,42,"And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean."
Mark,1,43,"And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once,"
Mark,1,44,"and said to him, ""See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them."""
Mark,1,45,"But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter."
Mark,2,1,"And when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home."
Mark,2,2,"And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was preaching the word to them."
Mark,2,3,"And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men."
Mark,2,4,"And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay."
Mark,2,5,"And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, ""My son, your sins are forgiven."""
Mark,2,6,"Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts,"
Mark,2,7,"""Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"""
Mark,2,8,"And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, ""Why do you question these things in your hearts?"
Mark,2,9,"Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise, take up your bed and walk'?"
Mark,2,10,"But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins""--he said to the paralytic--"
Mark,2,11,"""I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home."""
Mark,2,12,"And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, ""We never saw anything like this!"""
Mark,2,13,"He went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them."
Mark,2,14,"And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, ""Follow me."" And he rose and followed him."
Mark,2,15,"And as he reclined at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him."
Mark,2,16,"And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, ""Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"""
Mark,2,17,"And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, ""Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."""
Mark,2,18,"Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And people came and said to him, ""Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"""
Mark,2,19,"And Jesus said to them, ""Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
Mark,2,20,"The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day."
Mark,2,21,"No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made."
Mark,2,22,"And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins--and the wine is destroyed, and so are the skins. But new wine is for fresh wineskins."""
Mark,2,23,"One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields, and as they made their way, his disciples began to pluck heads of grain."
Mark,2,24,"And the Pharisees were saying to him, ""Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"""
Mark,2,25,"And he said to them, ""Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him:"
Mark,2,26,"how he entered the house of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?"""
Mark,2,27,"And he said to them, ""The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
Mark,2,28,"So the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."""
Mark,3,1,"Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there with a withered hand."
Mark,3,2,"And they watched Jesus, to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him."
Mark,3,3,"And he said to the man with the withered hand, ""Come here."""
Mark,3,4,"And he said to them, ""Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?"" But they were silent."
Mark,3,5,"And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, ""Stretch out your hand."" He stretched it out, and his hand was restored."
Mark,3,6,"The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him."
Mark,3,7,"Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd followed, from Galilee and Judea"
Mark,3,8,"and Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon. When the great crowd heard all that he was doing, they came to him."
Mark,3,9,"And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they crush him,"
Mark,3,10,"for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed around him to touch him."
Mark,3,11,"And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, ""You are the Son of God."""
Mark,3,12,And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.
Mark,3,13,"And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him."
Mark,3,14,And he appointed twelve (whom he also named apostles) so that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach
Mark,3,15,and have authority to cast out demons.
Mark,3,16,He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);
Mark,3,17,"James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder);"
Mark,3,18,"Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,"
Mark,3,19,"and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him."
Mark,3,20,"Then he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat."
Mark,3,21,"And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, ""He is out of his mind."""
Mark,3,22,"And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, ""He is possessed by Beelzebul,"" and ""by the prince of demons he casts out the demons."""
Mark,3,23,"And he called them to him and said to them in parables, ""How can Satan cast out Satan?"
Mark,3,24,"If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."
Mark,3,25,"And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand."
Mark,3,26,"And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end."
Mark,3,27,"But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. Then indeed he may plunder his house."
Mark,3,28,"""Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter,"
Mark,3,29,"but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin""--"
Mark,3,30,"for they had said, ""He has an unclean spirit."""
Mark,3,31,"And his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside they sent to him and called him."
Mark,3,32,"And a crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, ""Your mother and your brothers are outside, seeking you."""
Mark,3,33,"And he answered them, ""Who are my mother and my brothers?"""
Mark,3,34,"And looking about at those who sat around him, he said, ""Here are my mother and my brothers!"
Mark,3,35,"Whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother."""
Mark,4,1,"Again he began to teach beside the sea. And a very large crowd gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea, and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land."
Mark,4,2,"And he was teaching them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them:"
Mark,4,3,"""Listen! A sower went out to sow."
Mark,4,4,"And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it."
Mark,4,5,"Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil."
Mark,4,6,"And when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root, it withered away."
Mark,4,7,"Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain."
Mark,4,8,"And other seeds fell into good soil and produced grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold."""
Mark,4,9,"And he said, ""He who has ears to hear, let him hear."""
Mark,4,10,"And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables."
Mark,4,11,"And he said to them, ""To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables,"
Mark,4,12,"so that ""they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand, lest they should turn and be forgiven."""
Mark,4,13,"And he said to them, ""Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?"
Mark,4,14,The sower sows the word.
Mark,4,15,"And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them."
Mark,4,16,"And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: the ones who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy."
Mark,4,17,"And they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away."
Mark,4,18,"And others are the ones sown among thorns. They are those who hear the word,"
Mark,4,19,"but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful."
Mark,4,20,"But those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold."""
Mark,4,21,"And he said to them, ""Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket, or under a bed, and not on a stand?"
Mark,4,22,For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret except to come to light.
Mark,4,23,"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."""
Mark,4,24,"And he said to them, ""Pay attention to what you hear: with the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and still more will be added to you."
Mark,4,25,"For to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away."""
Mark,4,26,"And he said, ""The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground."
Mark,4,27,"He sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows; he knows not how."
Mark,4,28,"The earth produces by itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear."
Mark,4,29,"But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come."""
Mark,4,30,"And he said, ""With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it?"
Mark,4,31,"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown on the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth,"
Mark,4,32,"yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade."""
Mark,4,33,"With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it."
Mark,4,34,"He did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own disciples he explained everything."
Mark,4,35,"On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, ""Let us go across to the other side."""
Mark,4,36,"And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. And other boats were with him."
Mark,4,37,"And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already filling."
Mark,4,38,"But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. And they woke him and said to him, ""Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?"""
Mark,4,39,"And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, ""Peace! Be still!"" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm."
Mark,4,40,"He said to them, ""Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?"""
Mark,4,41,"And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, ""Who then is this, that even wind and sea obey him?"""
Mark,5,1,"They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes."
Mark,5,2,"And when Jesus had stepped out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit."
Mark,5,3,"He lived among the tombs. And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain,"
Mark,5,4,"for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he wrenched the chains apart, and he broke the shackles in pieces. No one had the strength to subdue him."
Mark,5,5,Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and bruising himself with stones.
Mark,5,6,"And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before him."
Mark,5,7,"And crying out with a loud voice, he said, ""What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me."""
Mark,5,8,"For he was saying to him, ""Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"""
Mark,5,9,"And Jesus asked him, ""What is your name?"" He replied, ""My name is Legion, for we are many."""
Mark,5,10,And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country.
Mark,5,11,"Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside,"
Mark,5,12,"and they begged him, saying, ""Send us to the pigs; let us enter them."""
Mark,5,13,"So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered the pigs, and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned in the sea."
Mark,5,14,The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened.
Mark,5,15,"And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man, the one who had had the legion, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid."
Mark,5,16,And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs.
Mark,5,17,And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their region.
Mark,5,18,"As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him."
Mark,5,19,"And he did not permit him but said to him, ""Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."""
Mark,5,20,"And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled."
Mark,5,21,"And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him, and he was beside the sea."
Mark,5,22,"Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and seeing him, he fell at his feet"
Mark,5,23,"and implored him earnestly, saying, ""My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live."""
Mark,5,24,And he went with him.And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him.
Mark,5,25,"And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years,"
Mark,5,26,"and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse."
Mark,5,27,She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment.
Mark,5,28,"For she said, ""If I touch even his garments, I will be made well."""
Mark,5,29,"And immediately the flow of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease."
Mark,5,30,"And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, immediately turned about in the crowd and said, ""Who touched my garments?"""
Mark,5,31,"And his disciples said to him, ""You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, 'Who touched me?'"""
Mark,5,32,And he looked around to see who had done it.
Mark,5,33,"But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him and told him the whole truth."
Mark,5,34,"And he said to her, ""Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease."""
Mark,5,35,"While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler's house some who said, ""Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?"""
Mark,5,36,"But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, ""Do not fear, only believe."""
Mark,5,37,And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James.
Mark,5,38,"They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and Jesus saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly."
Mark,5,39,"And when he had entered, he said to them, ""Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but sleeping."""
Mark,5,40,And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside and took the child's father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was.
Mark,5,41,"Taking her by the hand he said to her, ""Talitha cumi,"" which means, ""Little girl, I say to you, arise."""
Mark,5,42,"And immediately the girl got up and began walking (for she was twelve years of age), and they were immediately overcome with amazement."
Mark,5,43,"And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat."
Mark,6,1,"He went away from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him."
Mark,6,2,"And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, ""Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands?"
Mark,6,3,"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?"" And they took offense at him."
Mark,6,4,"And Jesus said to them, ""A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household."""
Mark,6,5,"And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them."
Mark,6,6,And he marveled because of their unbelief.And he went about among the villages teaching.
Mark,6,7,"And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits."
Mark,6,8,"He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in their belts--"
Mark,6,9,but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics.
Mark,6,10,"And he said to them, ""Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there."
Mark,6,11,"And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them."""
Mark,6,12,So they went out and proclaimed that people should repent.
Mark,6,13,And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.
Mark,6,14,"King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, ""John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him."""
Mark,6,15,"But others said, ""He is Elijah."" And others said, ""He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old."""
Mark,6,16,"But when Herod heard of it, he said, ""John, whom I beheaded, has been raised."""
Mark,6,17,"For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her."
Mark,6,18,"For John had been saying to Herod, ""It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."""
Mark,6,19,"And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not,"
Mark,6,20,"for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly."
Mark,6,21,But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.
Mark,6,22,"For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, ""Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you."""
Mark,6,23,"And he vowed to her, ""Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."""
Mark,6,24,"And she went out and said to her mother, ""For what should I ask?"" And she said, ""The head of John the Baptist."""
Mark,6,25,"And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, ""I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter."""
Mark,6,26,"And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her."
Mark,6,27,And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. He went and beheaded him in the prison
Mark,6,28,"and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother."
Mark,6,29,"When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb."
Mark,6,30,The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught.
Mark,6,31,"And he said to them, ""Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while."" For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat."
Mark,6,32,And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves.
Mark,6,33,"Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them."
Mark,6,34,"When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things."
Mark,6,35,"And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, ""This is a desolate place, and the hour is now late."
Mark,6,36,"Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."""
Mark,6,37,"But he answered them, ""You give them something to eat."" And they said to him, ""Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?"""
Mark,6,38,"And he said to them, ""How many loaves do you have? Go and see."" And when they had found out, they said, ""Five, and two fish."""
Mark,6,39,Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.
Mark,6,40,"So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties."
Mark,6,41,And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And he divided the two fish among them all.
Mark,6,42,And they all ate and were satisfied.
Mark,6,43,And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.
Mark,6,44,And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.
Mark,6,45,"Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd."
Mark,6,46,"And after he had taken leave of them, he went up on the mountain to pray."
Mark,6,47,"And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land."
Mark,6,48,"And he saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them,"
Mark,6,49,"but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out,"
Mark,6,50,"for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, ""Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid."""
Mark,6,51,"And he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded,"
Mark,6,52,"for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened."
Mark,6,53,"When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore."
Mark,6,54,"And when they got out of the boat, the people immediately recognized him"
Mark,6,55,and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick people on their beds to wherever they heard he was.
Mark,6,56,"And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or countryside, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well."
Mark,7,1,"Now when the Pharisees gathered to him, with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem,"
Mark,7,2,"they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed."
Mark,7,3,"(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands, holding to the tradition of the elders,"
Mark,7,4,"and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions that they observe, such as the washing of cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches. )"
Mark,7,5,"And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, ""Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?"""
Mark,7,6,"And he said to them, ""Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, ""'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me;"
Mark,7,7,"in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'"
Mark,7,8,"You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men."""
Mark,7,9,"And he said to them, ""You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish your tradition!"
Mark,7,10,"For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.'"
Mark,7,11,"But you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother, Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban' (that is, given to God)--"
Mark,7,12,"then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother,"
Mark,7,13,"thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And many such things you do."""
Mark,7,14,"And he called the people to him again and said to them, ""Hear me, all of you, and understand:"
Mark,7,15,"There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him."""
Mark,7,16,See Footnote
Mark,7,17,"And when he had entered the house and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable."
Mark,7,18,"And he said to them, ""Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him,"
Mark,7,19,"since it enters not his heart but his stomach, and is expelled?"" (Thus he declared all foods clean.)"
Mark,7,20,"And he said, ""What comes out of a person is what defiles him."
Mark,7,21,"For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,"
Mark,7,22,"coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness."
Mark,7,23,"All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person."""
Mark,7,24,"And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know, yet he could not be hidden."
Mark,7,25,But immediately a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell down at his feet.
Mark,7,26,"Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter."
Mark,7,27,"And he said to her, ""Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."""
Mark,7,28,"But she answered him, ""Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."""
Mark,7,29,"And he said to her, ""For this statement you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter."""
Mark,7,30,And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone.
Mark,7,31,"Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis."
Mark,7,32,"And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had a speech impediment, and they begged him to lay his hand on him."
Mark,7,33,"And taking him aside from the crowd privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting touched his tongue."
Mark,7,34,"And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, ""Ephphatha,"" that is, ""Be opened."""
Mark,7,35,"And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly."
Mark,7,36,"And Jesus charged them to tell no one. But the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it."
Mark,7,37,"And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, ""He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."""
Mark,8,1,"In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, he called his disciples to him and said to them,"
Mark,8,2,"""I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat."
Mark,8,3,"And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way. And some of them have come from far away."""
Mark,8,4,"And his disciples answered him, ""How can one feed these people with bread here in this desolate place?"""
Mark,8,5,"And he asked them, ""How many loaves do you have?"" They said, ""Seven."""
Mark,8,6,"And he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd."
Mark,8,7,"And they had a few small fish. And having blessed them, he said that these also should be set before them."
Mark,8,8,"And they ate and were satisfied. And they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full."
Mark,8,9,And there were about four thousand people. And he sent them away.
Mark,8,10,And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.
Mark,8,11,"The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him."
Mark,8,12,"And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, ""Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation."""
Mark,8,13,"And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side."
Mark,8,14,"Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat."
Mark,8,15,"And he cautioned them, saying, ""Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod."""
Mark,8,16,And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread.
Mark,8,17,"And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, ""Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?"
Mark,8,18,"Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?"
Mark,8,19,"When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?"" They said to him, ""Twelve."""
Mark,8,20,"""And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?"" And they said to him, ""Seven."""
Mark,8,21,"And he said to them, ""Do you not yet understand?"""
Mark,8,22,And they came to Bethsaida. And some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him.
Mark,8,23,"And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village, and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him, ""Do you see anything?"""
Mark,8,24,"And he looked up and said, ""I see men, but they look like trees, walking."""
Mark,8,25,"Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again; and he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly."
Mark,8,26,"And he sent him to his home, saying, ""Do not even enter the village."""
Mark,8,27,"And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, ""Who do people say that I am?"""
Mark,8,28,"And they told him, ""John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets."""
Mark,8,29,"And he asked them, ""But who do you say that I am?"" Peter answered him, ""You are the Christ."""
Mark,8,30,And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him.
Mark,8,31,"And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again."
Mark,8,32,And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
Mark,8,33,"But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, ""Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."""
Mark,8,34,"And he called to him the crowd with his disciples and said to them, ""If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
Mark,8,35,"For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it."
Mark,8,36,For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?
Mark,8,37,For what can a man give in return for his life?
Mark,8,38,"For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."""
Mark,9,1,"And he said to them, ""Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power."""
Mark,9,2,"And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them,"

Mark,14,15,"And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us."""
Mark,14,16,"And the disciples set out and went to the city and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover."
Mark,14,17,"And when it was evening, he came with the twelve."
Mark,14,18,"And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, ""Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me."""
Mark,14,19,"They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, ""Is it I?"""
Mark,14,20,"He said to them, ""It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me."
Mark,14,21,"For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born."""
Mark,14,22,"And as they were eating, he took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, ""Take; this is my body."""
Mark,14,23,"And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it."
Mark,14,24,"And he said to them, ""This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many."
Mark,14,25,"Truly, I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."""
Mark,14,26,"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives."
Mark,14,27,"And Jesus said to them, ""You will all fall away, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'"
Mark,14,28,"But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee."""
Mark,14,29,"Peter said to him, ""Even though they all fall away, I will not."""
Mark,14,30,"And Jesus said to him, ""Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."""
Mark,14,31,"But he said emphatically, ""If I must die with you, I will not deny you."" And they all said the same."
Mark,14,32,"And they went to a place called Gethsemane. And he said to his disciples, ""Sit here while I pray."""
Mark,14,33,"And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled."
Mark,14,34,"And he said to them, ""My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch."""
Mark,14,35,"And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him."
Mark,14,36,"And he said, ""Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."""
Mark,14,37,"And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, ""Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?"
Mark,14,38,"Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."""
Mark,14,39,"And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words."
Mark,14,40,"And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they did not know what to answer him."
Mark,14,41,"And he came the third time and said to them, ""Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Mark,14,42,"Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand."""
Mark,14,43,"And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders."
Mark,14,44,"Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, ""The one I will kiss is the man. Seize him and lead him away under guard."""
Mark,14,45,"And when he came, he went up to him at once and said, ""Rabbi!"" And he kissed him."
Mark,14,46,And they laid hands on him and seized him.
Mark,14,47,But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.
Mark,14,48,"And Jesus said to them, ""Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?"
Mark,14,49,"Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But let the Scriptures be fulfilled."""
Mark,14,50,And they all left him and fled.
Mark,14,51,"And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body. And they seized him,"
Mark,14,52,but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.
Mark,14,53,And they led Jesus to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together.
Mark,14,54,"And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting with the guards and warming himself at the fire."
Mark,14,55,"Now the chief priests and the whole Council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none."
Mark,14,56,"For many bore false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree."
Mark,14,57,"And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,"
Mark,14,58,"""We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.'"""
Mark,14,59,Yet even about this their testimony did not agree.
Mark,14,60,"And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, ""Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?"""
Mark,14,61,"But he remained silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, ""Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"""
Mark,14,62,"And Jesus said, ""I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."""
Mark,14,63,"And the high priest tore his garments and said, ""What further witnesses do we need?"
Mark,14,64,"You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?"" And they all condemned him as deserving death."
Mark,14,65,"And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him, saying to him, ""Prophesy!"" And the guards received him with blows."
Mark,14,66,"And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came,"
Mark,14,67,"and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, ""You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus."""
Mark,14,68,"But he denied it, saying, ""I neither know nor understand what you mean."" And he went out into the gateway and the rooster crowed."
Mark,14,69,"And the servant girl saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, ""This man is one of them."""
Mark,14,70,"But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders again said to Peter, ""Certainly you are one of them, for you are a Galilean."""
Mark,14,71,"But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, ""I do not know this man of whom you speak."""
Mark,14,72,"And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, ""Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."" And he broke down and wept."
Mark,15,1,"And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole Council. And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate."
Mark,15,2,"And Pilate asked him, ""Are you the King of the Jews?"" And he answered him, ""You have said so."""
Mark,15,3,And the chief priests accused him of many things.
Mark,15,4,"And Pilate again asked him, ""Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you."""
Mark,15,5,"But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed."
Mark,15,6,Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked.
Mark,15,7,"And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas."
Mark,15,8,And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them.
Mark,15,9,"And he answered them, saying, ""Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"""
Mark,15,10,For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up.
Mark,15,11,But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead.
Mark,15,12,"And Pilate again said to them, ""Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?"""
Mark,15,13,"And they cried out again, ""Crucify him."""
Mark,15,14,"And Pilate said to them, ""Why, what evil has he done?"" But they shouted all the more, ""Crucify him."""
Mark,15,15,"So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified."
Mark,15,16,"And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the governor's headquarters), and they called together the whole battalion."
Mark,15,17,"And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him."
Mark,15,18,"And they began to salute him, ""Hail, King of the Jews!"""
Mark,15,19,And they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him.
Mark,15,20,"And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him."
Mark,15,21,"And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross."
Mark,15,22,And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull).
Mark,15,23,"And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it."
Mark,15,24,"And they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take."
Mark,15,25,And it was the third hour when they crucified him.
Mark,15,26,"And the inscription of the charge against him read, ""The King of the Jews."""
Mark,15,27,"And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left."
Mark,15,28,See Footnote
Mark,15,29,"And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, ""Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,"
Mark,15,30,"save yourself, and come down from the cross!"""
Mark,15,31,"So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, ""He saved others; he cannot save himself."
Mark,15,32,"Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe."" Those who were crucified with him also reviled him."
Mark,15,33,"And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour."
Mark,15,34,"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, ""Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?"" which means, ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"""
Mark,15,35,"And some of the bystanders hearing it said, ""Behold, he is calling Elijah."""
Mark,15,36,"And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, ""Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down."""
Mark,15,37,And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last.
Mark,15,38,"And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom."
Mark,15,39,"And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, ""Truly this man was the Son of God!"""
Mark,15,40,"There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome."
Mark,15,41,"When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him, and there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem."
Mark,15,42,"And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,"
Mark,15,43,"Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the Council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus."
Mark,15,44,"Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died. And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead."
Mark,15,45,"And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph."
Mark,15,46,"And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb."
Mark,15,47,Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
Mark,16,1,"When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him."
Mark,16,2,"And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb."
Mark,16,3,"And they were saying to one another, ""Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?"""
Mark,16,4,"And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back--it was very large."
Mark,16,5,"And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed."
Mark,16,6,"And he said to them, ""Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him."
Mark,16,7,"But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you."""
Mark,16,8,"And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid. [Some of the earliest manuscripts do not include 16:9-20.]"
Mark,16,9,"[[Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons."
Mark,16,10,"She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept."
Mark,16,11,"But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it."
Mark,16,12,"After these things he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country."
Mark,16,13,"And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them."
Mark,16,14,"Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen."
Mark,16,15,"And he said to them, ""Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation."
Mark,16,16,"Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned."
Mark,16,17,And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
Mark,16,18,"they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover."""
Mark,16,19,"So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God."

Luke,2,42,"And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom."
Luke,2,43,"And when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it,"
Luke,2,44,"but supposing him to be in the group they went a day's journey, but then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances,"
Luke,2,45,"and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him."
Luke,2,46,"After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions."
Luke,2,47,And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
Luke,2,48,"And when his parents saw him, they were astonished. And his mother said to him, ""Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress."""
Luke,2,49,"And he said to them, ""Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?"""
Luke,2,50,And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them.
Luke,2,51,And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was submissive to them. And his mother treasured up all these things in her heart.
Luke,2,52,And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.
Luke,3,1,"In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,"
Luke,3,2,"during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness."
Luke,3,3,"And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins."
Luke,3,4,"As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, ""The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
Luke,3,5,"Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places shall become level ways,"
Luke,3,6,"and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'"""
Luke,3,7,"He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, ""You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Luke,3,8,"Bear fruits in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham."
Luke,3,9,"Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."""
Luke,3,10,"And the crowds asked him, ""What then shall we do?"""
Luke,3,11,"And he answered them, ""Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise."""
Luke,3,12,"Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, ""Teacher, what shall we do?"""
Luke,3,13,"And he said to them, ""Collect no more than you are authorized to do."""
Luke,3,14,"Soldiers also asked him, ""And we, what shall we do?"" And he said to them, ""Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation, and be content with your wages."""
Luke,3,15,"As the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ,"
Luke,3,16,"John answered them all, saying, ""I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire."
Luke,3,17,"His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."""
Luke,3,18,So with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people.
Luke,3,19,"But Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done,"
Luke,3,20,"added this to them all, that he locked up John in prison."
Luke,3,21,"Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened,"
Luke,3,22,"and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, ""You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."""
Luke,3,23,"Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,"

Luke,3,38,"the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God."
Luke,4,1,"And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness"
Luke,4,2,"for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days. And when they were ended, he was hungry."
Luke,4,3,"The devil said to him, ""If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread."""
Luke,4,4,"And Jesus answered him, ""It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone.'"""
Luke,4,5,"And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time,"
Luke,4,6,"and said to him, ""To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will."
Luke,4,7,"If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours."""
Luke,4,8,"And Jesus answered him, ""It is written, ""'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.'"""
Luke,4,9,"And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, ""If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,"
Luke,4,10,"for it is written, ""'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,'"
Luke,4,11,"and ""'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"""
Luke,4,12,"And Jesus answered him, ""It is said, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"""
Luke,4,13,"And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time."
Luke,4,14,"And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and a report about him went out through all the surrounding country."
Luke,4,15,"And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all."
Luke,4,16,"And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as was his custom, he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and he stood up to read."
Luke,4,17,"And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,"
Luke,4,18,"""The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed,"
Luke,4,19,"to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."""
Luke,4,20,And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.
Luke,4,21,"And he began to say to them, ""Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing."""
Luke,4,22,"And all spoke well of him and marveled at the gracious words that were coming from his mouth. And they said, ""Is not this Joseph's son?"""
Luke,4,23,"And he said to them, ""Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, 'Physician, heal yourself.' What we have heard you did at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well."""
Luke,4,24,"And he said, ""Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown."
Luke,4,25,"But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were shut up three years and six months, and a great famine came over all the land,"
Luke,4,26,"and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow."
Luke,4,27,"And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian."""
Luke,4,28,"When they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath."
Luke,4,29,"And they rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff."
Luke,4,30,"But passing through their midst, he went away."
Luke,4,31,"And he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the Sabbath,"
Luke,4,32,"and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word possessed authority."
Luke,4,33,"And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,"
Luke,4,34,"""Ha! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God."""
Luke,4,35,"But Jesus rebuked him, saying, ""Be silent and come out of him!"" And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm."
Luke,4,36,"And they were all amazed and said to one another, ""What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!"""
Luke,4,37,And reports about him went out into every place in the surrounding region.
Luke,4,38,"And he arose and left the synagogue and entered Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was ill with a high fever, and they appealed to him on her behalf."
Luke,4,39,"And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately she rose and began to serve them."
Luke,4,40,"Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to him, and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them."
Luke,4,41,"And demons also came out of many, crying, ""You are the Son of God!"" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ."
Luke,4,42,"And when it was day, he departed and went into a desolate place. And the people sought him and came to him, and would have kept him from leaving them,"
Luke,4,43,"but he said to them, ""I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well; for I was sent for this purpose."""
Luke,4,44,And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
Luke,5,1,"On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret,"
Luke,5,2,"and he saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets."
Luke,5,3,"Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat."
Luke,5,4,"And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, ""Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch."""
Luke,5,5,"And Simon answered, ""Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets."""
Luke,5,6,"And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking."
Luke,5,7,"They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink."
Luke,5,8,"But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, ""Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord."""
Luke,5,9,"For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken,"
Luke,5,10,"and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, ""Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men."""
Luke,5,11,"And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him."
Luke,5,12,"While he was in one of the cities, there came a man full of leprosy. And when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, ""Lord, if you will, you can make me clean."""
Luke,5,13,"And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, ""I will; be clean."" And immediately the leprosy left him."
Luke,5,14,"And he charged him to tell no one, but ""go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a proof to them."""
Luke,5,15,"But now even more the report about him went abroad, and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities."
Luke,5,16,But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray.
Luke,5,17,"On one of those days, as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with him to heal."
Luke,5,18,"And behold, some men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus,"
Luke,5,19,"but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus."
Luke,5,20,"And when he saw their faith, he said, ""Man, your sins are forgiven you."""
Luke,5,21,"And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, ""Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"""
Luke,5,22,"When Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, ""Why do you question in your hearts?"
Luke,5,23,"Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?"
Luke,5,24,"But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins""--he said to the man who was paralyzed--""I say to you, rise, pick up your bed and go home."""
Luke,5,25,"And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, glorifying God."
Luke,5,26,"And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, ""We have seen extraordinary things today."""
Luke,5,27,"After this he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax booth. And he said to him, ""Follow me."""
Luke,5,28,"And leaving everything, he rose and followed him."
Luke,5,29,"And Levi made him a great feast in his house, and there was a large company of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them."
Luke,5,30,"And the Pharisees and their scribes grumbled at his disciples, saying, ""Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"""
Luke,5,31,"And Jesus answered them, ""Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
Luke,5,32,"I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance."""
Luke,5,33,"And they said to him, ""The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink."""
Luke,5,34,"And Jesus said to them, ""Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them?"
Luke,5,35,"The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days."""
Luke,5,36,"He also told them a parable: ""No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. If he does, he will tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old."
Luke,5,37,"And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed."
Luke,5,38,But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
Luke,5,39,"And no one after drinking old wine desires new, for he says, 'The old is good.'"""
Luke,6,1,"On a Sabbath, while he was going through the grainfields, his disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands."
Luke,6,2,"But some of the Pharisees said, ""Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?"""
Luke,6,3,"And Jesus answered them, ""Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him:"
Luke,6,4,"how he entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those with him?"""
Luke,6,5,"And he said to them, ""The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath."""
Luke,6,6,"On another Sabbath, he entered the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was withered."
Luke,6,7,"And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find a reason to accuse him."
Luke,6,8,"But he knew their thoughts, and he said to the man with the withered hand, ""Come and stand here."" And he rose and stood there."
Luke,6,9,"And Jesus said to them, ""I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to destroy it?"""
Luke,6,10,"And after looking around at them all he said to him, ""Stretch out your hand."" And he did so, and his hand was restored."
Luke,6,11,But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.
Luke,6,12,"In these days he went out to the mountain to pray, and all night he continued in prayer to God."
Luke,6,13,"And when day came, he called his disciples and chose from them twelve, whom he named apostles:"
Luke,6,14,"Simon, whom he named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip, and Bartholomew,"
Luke,6,15,"and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot,"
Luke,6,16,"and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor."
Luke,6,17,"And he came down with them and stood on a level place, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon,"
Luke,6,18,who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured.
Luke,6,19,"And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power came out from him and healed them all."
Luke,6,20,"And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said:""Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God."
Luke,6,21,"""Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you shall be satisfied.""Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh."
Luke,6,22,"""Blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man!"
Luke,6,23,"Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the prophets."
Luke,6,24,"""But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation."
Luke,6,25,"""Woe to you who are full now, for you shall be hungry.""Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep."
Luke,6,26,"""Woe to you, when all people speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the false prophets."
Luke,6,27,"""But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,"
Luke,6,28,"bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you."
Luke,6,29,"To one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also, and from one who takes away your cloak do not withhold your tunic either."
Luke,6,30,"Give to everyone who begs from you, and from one who takes away your goods do not demand them back."
Luke,6,31,"And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them."
Luke,6,32,"""If you love those who love you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them."
Luke,6,33,"And if you do good to those who do good to you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners do the same."
Luke,6,34,"And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to get back the same amount."
Luke,6,35,"But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil."
Luke,6,36,"Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful."
Luke,6,37,"""Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven;"
Luke,6,38,"give, and it will be given to you. Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap. For with the measure you use it will be measured back to you."""
Luke,6,39,"He also told them a parable: ""Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?"
Luke,6,40,"A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher."
Luke,6,41,"Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?"
Luke,6,42,"How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye."
Luke,6,43,"""For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit,"
Luke,6,44,"for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thornbushes, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush."
Luke,6,45,"The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks."
Luke,6,46,"""Why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and not do what I tell you?"
Luke,6,47,"Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like:"
Luke,6,48,"he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built."
Luke,6,49,"But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the stream broke against it, immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great."""
Luke,7,1,"After he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum."
Luke,7,2,"Now a centurion had a servant who was sick and at the point of death, who was highly valued by him."
Luke,7,3,"When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his servant."
Luke,7,4,"And when they came to Jesus, they pleaded with him earnestly, saying, ""He is worthy to have you do this for him,"
Luke,7,5,"for he loves our nation, and he is the one who built us our synagogue."""
Luke,7,6,"And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, ""Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof."
Luke,7,7,"Therefore I did not presume to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed."
Luke,7,8,"For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."""
Luke,7,9,"When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, said, ""I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith."""
Luke,7,10,"And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well."
Luke,7,11,"Soon afterward he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a great crowd went with him."
Luke,7,12,"As he drew near to the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow, and a considerable crowd from the town was with her."
Luke,7,13,"And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, ""Do not weep."""
Luke,7,14,"Then he came up and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, ""Young man, I say to you, arise."""
Luke,7,15,"And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother."
Luke,7,16,"Fear seized them all, and they glorified God, saying, ""A great prophet has arisen among us!"" and ""God has visited his people!"""
Luke,7,17,And this report about him spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country.
Luke,7,18,"The disciples of John reported all these things to him. And John,"
Luke,7,19,"calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to the Lord, saying, ""Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?"""
Luke,7,20,"And when the men had come to him, they said, ""John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, 'Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?'"""
Luke,7,21,"In that hour he healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and on many who were blind he bestowed sight."
Luke,7,22,"And he answered them, ""Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them."
Luke,7,23,"And blessed is the one who is not offended by me."""
Luke,7,24,"When John's messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: ""What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
Luke,7,25,"What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are dressed in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' courts."
Luke,7,26,"What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet."
Luke,7,27,"This is he of whom it is written, ""'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'"
Luke,7,28,"I tell you, among those born of women none is greater than John. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."""
Luke,7,29,"(When all the people heard this, and the tax collectors too, they declared God just, having been baptized with the baptism of John,"
Luke,7,30,"but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)"
Luke,7,31,"""To what then shall I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like?"
Luke,7,32,"They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, ""'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.'"
Luke,7,33,"For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'"
Luke,7,34,"The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'"
Luke,7,35,"Yet wisdom is justified by all her children."""
Luke,7,36,"One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee's house and took his place at the table."
Luke,7,37,"And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment,"
Luke,7,38,"and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment."
Luke,7,39,"Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, ""If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner."""
Luke,7,40,"And Jesus answering said to him, ""Simon, I have something to say to you."" And he answered, ""Say it, Teacher."""
Luke,7,41,"""A certain moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty."
Luke,7,42,"When they could not pay, he cancelled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more?"""
Luke,7,43,"Simon answered, ""The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt."" And he said to him, ""You have judged rightly."""
Luke,7,44,"Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, ""Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair."
Luke,7,45,"You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet."
Luke,7,46,"You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment."
Luke,7,47,"Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven--for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little."""
Luke,7,48,"And he said to her, ""Your sins are forgiven."""
Luke,7,49,"Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, ""Who is this, who even forgives sins?"""
Luke,7,50,"And he said to the woman, ""Your faith has saved you; go in peace."""
Luke,8,1,"Soon afterward he went on through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him,"
Luke,8,2,"and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,"
Luke,8,3,"and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's household manager, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their means."
Luke,8,4,"And when a great crowd was gathering and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable:"
Luke,8,5,"""A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the air devoured it."
Luke,8,6,"And some fell on the rock, and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture."
Luke,8,7,"And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it."
Luke,8,8,"And some fell into good soil and grew and yielded a hundredfold."" As he said these things, he called out, ""He who has ears to hear, let him hear."""
Luke,8,9,"And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant,"
Luke,8,10,"he said, ""To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so that 'seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.'"
Luke,8,11,Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
Luke,8,12,"The ones along the path are those who have heard. Then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved."
Luke,8,13,"And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy. But these have no root; they believe for a while, and in time of testing fall away."
Luke,8,14,"And as for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature."
Luke,8,15,"As for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bear fruit with patience."
Luke,8,16,"""No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light."
Luke,8,17,"For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light."
Luke,8,18,"Take care then how you hear, for to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away."""
Luke,8,19,"Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd."
Luke,8,20,"And he was told, ""Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you."""
Luke,8,21,"But he answered them, ""My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it."""
Luke,8,22,"One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, ""Let us go across to the other side of the lake."" So they set out,"
Luke,8,23,"and as they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water and were in danger."
Luke,8,24,"And they went and woke him, saying, ""Master, Master, we are perishing!"" And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves, and they ceased, and there was a calm."
Luke,8,25,"He said to them, ""Where is your faith?"" And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, ""Who then is this, that he commands even winds and water, and they obey him?"""
Luke,8,26,"Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee."
Luke,8,27,"When Jesus had stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he had not lived in a house but among the tombs."
Luke,8,28,"When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him and said with a loud voice, ""What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me."""
Luke,8,29,"For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert.)"
Luke,8,30,"Jesus then asked him, ""What is your name?"" And he said, ""Legion,"" for many demons had entered him."
Luke,8,31,And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss.
Luke,8,32,"Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them permission."
Luke,8,33,"Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned."
Luke,8,34,"When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country."
Luke,8,35,"Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid."
Luke,8,36,And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed.
Luke,8,37,"Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned."
Luke,8,38,"The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,"
Luke,8,39,"""Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you."" And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him."
Luke,8,40,"Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him."
Luke,8,41,"And there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue. And falling at Jesus' feet, he implored him to come to his house,"
Luke,8,42,"for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying.As Jesus went, the people pressed around him."
Luke,8,43,"And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and though she had spent all her living on physicians, she could not be healed by anyone."
Luke,8,44,"She came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, and immediately her discharge of blood ceased."
Luke,8,45,"And Jesus said, ""Who was it that touched me?"" When all denied it, Peter said, ""Master, the crowds surround you and are pressing in on you!"""
Luke,8,46,"But Jesus said, ""Someone touched me, for I perceive that power has gone out from me."""
Luke,8,47,"And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed."
Luke,8,48,"And he said to her, ""Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace."""
Luke,8,49,"While he was still speaking, someone from the ruler's house came and said, ""Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more."""
Luke,8,50,"But Jesus on hearing this answered him, ""Do not fear; only believe, and she will be well."""
Luke,8,51,"And when he came to the house, he allowed no one to enter with him, except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child."
Luke,8,52,"And all were weeping and mourning for her, but he said, ""Do not weep, for she is not dead but sleeping."""
Luke,8,53,"And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead."
Luke,8,54,"But taking her by the hand he called, saying, ""Child, arise."""
Luke,8,55,"And her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he directed that something should be given her to eat."
Luke,8,56,"And her parents were amazed, but he charged them to tell no one what had happened."
Luke,9,1,"And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases,"
Luke,9,2,and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal.
Luke,9,3,"And he said to them, ""Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics."
Luke,9,4,"And whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart."
Luke,9,5,"And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them."""
Luke,9,6,"And they departed and went through the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere."
Luke,9,7,"Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,"
Luke,9,8,"by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen."
Luke,9,9,"Herod said, ""John I beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?"" And he sought to see him."
Luke,9,10,On their return the apostles told him all that they had done. And he took them and withdrew apart to a town called Bethsaida.
Luke,9,11,"When the crowds learned it, they followed him, and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God and cured those who had need of healing."
Luke,9,12,"Now the day began to wear away, and the twelve came and said to him, ""Send the crowd away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and get provisions, for we are here in a desolate place."""
Luke,9,13,"But he said to them, ""You give them something to eat."" They said, ""We have no more than five loaves and two fish--unless we are to go and buy food for all these people."""
Luke,9,14,"For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, ""Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each."""
Luke,9,15,"And they did so, and had them all sit down."
Luke,9,16,"And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing over them. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd."
Luke,9,17,"And they all ate and were satisfied. And what was left over was picked up, twelve baskets of broken pieces."
Luke,9,18,"Now it happened that as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him. And he asked them, ""Who do the crowds say that I am?"""
Luke,9,19,"And they answered, ""John the Baptist. But others say, Elijah, and others, that one of the prophets of old has risen."""
Luke,9,20,"Then he said to them, ""But who do you say that I am?"" And Peter answered, ""The Christ of God."""
Luke,9,21,"And he strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one,"
Luke,9,22,"saying, ""The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised."""
Luke,9,23,"And he said to all, ""If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me."
Luke,9,24,"For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it."
Luke,9,25,For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?
Luke,9,26,"For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels."
Luke,9,27,"But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God."""
Luke,9,28,Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray.
Luke,9,29,"And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became dazzling white."
Luke,9,30,"And behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah,"
Luke,9,31,"who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem."
Luke,9,32,"Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him."
Luke,9,33,"And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, ""Master, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah""--not knowing what he said."
Luke,9,34,"As he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud."
Luke,9,35,"And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, ""This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to him!"""
Luke,9,36,"And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen."
Luke,9,37,"On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him."
Luke,9,38,"And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, ""Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child."
Luke,9,39,"And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out. It convulses him so that he foams at the mouth; and shatters him, and will hardly leave him."
Luke,9,40,"And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not."""
Luke,9,41,"Jesus answered, ""O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."""
Luke,9,42,"While he was coming, the demon threw him to the ground and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father."
Luke,9,43,"And all were astonished at the majesty of God.But while they were all marveling at everything he was doing, Jesus said to his disciples,"
Luke,9,44,"""Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men."""
Luke,9,45,"But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, so that they might not perceive it. And they were afraid to ask him about this saying."
Luke,9,46,An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest.
Luke,9,47,"But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and put him by his side"
Luke,9,48,"and said to them, ""Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great."""
Luke,9,49,"John answered, ""Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not follow with us."""
Luke,9,50,"But Jesus said to him, ""Do not stop him, for the one who is not against you is for you."""
Luke,9,51,"When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem."
Luke,9,52,"And he sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make preparations for him."
Luke,9,53,"But the people did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem."
Luke,9,54,"And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, ""Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?"""
Luke,9,55,But he turned and rebuked them.
Luke,9,56,And they went on to another village.
Luke,9,57,"As they were going along the road, someone said to him, ""I will follow you wherever you go."""
Luke,9,58,"And Jesus said to him, ""Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."""
Luke,9,59,"To another he said, ""Follow me."" But he said, ""Lord, let me first go and bury my father."""
Luke,9,60,"And Jesus said to him, ""Leave the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God."""
Luke,9,61,"Yet another said, ""I will follow you, Lord, but let me first say farewell to those at my home."""
Luke,9,62,"Jesus said to him, ""No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God."""
Luke,10,1,"After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to go."
Luke,10,2,"And he said to them, ""The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest."
Luke,10,3,"Go your way; behold, I am sending you out as lambs in the midst of wolves."
Luke,10,4,"Carry no moneybag, no knapsack, no sandals, and greet no one on the road."
Luke,10,5,"Whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house!'"
Luke,10,6,"And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if not, it will return to you."
Luke,10,7,"And remain in the same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer deserves his wages. Do not go from house to house."
Luke,10,8,"Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you."
Luke,10,9,"Heal the sick in it and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'"
Luke,10,10,"But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you, go into its streets and say,"
Luke,10,11,"'Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.'"
Luke,10,12,"I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town."
Luke,10,13,"""Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
Luke,10,14,But it will be more bearable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
Luke,10,15,"And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades."
Luke,10,16,"""The one who hears you hears me, and the one who rejects you rejects me, and the one who rejects me rejects him who sent me."""
Luke,10,17,"The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, ""Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!"""
Luke,10,18,"And he said to them, ""I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven."
Luke,10,19,"Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you."
Luke,10,20,"Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."""
Luke,10,21,"In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, ""I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will."
Luke,10,22,"All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."""
Luke,10,23,"Then turning to the disciples he said privately, ""Blessed are the eyes that see what you see!"
Luke,10,24,"For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it."""
Luke,10,25,"And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, ""Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"""
Luke,10,26,"He said to him, ""What is written in the Law? How do you read it?"""
Luke,10,27,"And he answered, ""You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself."""
Luke,10,28,"And he said to him, ""You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live."""
Luke,10,29,"But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, ""And who is my neighbor?"""
Luke,10,30,"Jesus replied, ""A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead."
Luke,10,31,"Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side."
Luke,10,32,"So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side."
Luke,10,33,"But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion."
Luke,10,34,"He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him."
Luke,10,35,"And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, 'Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.'"
Luke,10,36,"Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?"""
Luke,10,37,"He said, ""The one who showed him mercy."" And Jesus said to him, ""You go, and do likewise."""
Luke,10,38,"Now as they went on their way, Jesus entered a village. And a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house."
Luke,10,39,"And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching."
Luke,10,40,"But Martha was distracted with much serving. And she went up to him and said, ""Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me."""
Luke,10,41,"But the Lord answered her, ""Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,"
Luke,10,42,"but one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her."""
Luke,11,1,"Now Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, ""Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples."""
Luke,11,2,"And he said to them, ""When you pray, say: ""Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come."
Luke,11,3,"Give us each day our daily bread,"
Luke,11,4,"and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation."""
Luke,11,5,"And he said to them, ""Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves,"
Luke,11,6,"for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him';"
Luke,11,7,"and he will answer from within, 'Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything'?"
Luke,11,8,"I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence he will rise and give him whatever he needs."
Luke,11,9,"And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."
Luke,11,10,"For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened."
Luke,11,11,"What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent;"
Luke,11,12,"or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?"
Luke,11,13,"If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"""
Luke,11,14,"Now he was casting out a demon that was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke, and the people marveled."
Luke,11,15,"But some of them said, ""He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons,"""
Luke,11,16,"while others, to test him, kept seeking from him a sign from heaven."
Luke,11,17,"But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, ""Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household falls."
Luke,11,18,"And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul."
Luke,11,19,"And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges."
Luke,11,20,"But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you."
Luke,11,21,"When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are safe;"
Luke,11,22,"but when one stronger than he attacks him and overcomes him, he takes away his armor in which he trusted and divides his spoil."
Luke,11,23,"Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters."
Luke,11,24,"""When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and finding none it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.'"
Luke,11,25,"And when it comes, it finds the house swept and put in order."
Luke,11,26,"Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And the last state of that person is worse than the first."""
Luke,11,27,"As he said these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, ""Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts at which you nursed!"""
Luke,11,28,"But he said, ""Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!"""
Luke,11,29,"When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, ""This generation is an evil generation. It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah."
Luke,11,30,"For as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation."
Luke,11,31,"The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here."
Luke,11,32,"The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here."
Luke,11,33,"""No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light."
Luke,11,34,"Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light, but when it is bad, your body is full of darkness."
Luke,11,35,Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness.
Luke,11,36,"If then your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly bright, as when a lamp with its rays gives you light."""
Luke,11,37,"While Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him, so he went in and reclined at table."
Luke,11,38,The Pharisee was astonished to see that he did not first wash before dinner.
Luke,11,39,"And the Lord said to him, ""Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness."
Luke,11,40,You fools! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also?
Luke,11,41,"But give as alms those things that are within, and behold, everything is clean for you."
Luke,11,42,"""But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others."
Luke,11,43,Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seat in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.
Luke,11,44,"Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves, and people walk over them without knowing it."""
Luke,11,45,"One of the lawyers answered him, ""Teacher, in saying these things you insult us also."""
Luke,11,46,"And he said, ""Woe to you lawyers also! For you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers."
Luke,11,47,Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed.
Luke,11,48,"So you are witnesses and you consent to the deeds of your fathers, for they killed them, and you build their tombs."
Luke,11,49,"Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,'"
Luke,11,50,"so that the blood of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation,"
Luke,11,51,"from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation."
Luke,11,52,"Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering."""
Luke,11,53,"As he went away from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him hard and to provoke him to speak about many things,"
Luke,11,54,"lying in wait for him, to catch him in something he might say."
Luke,12,1,"In the meantime, when so many thousands of the people had gathered together that they were trampling one another, he began to say to his disciples first, ""Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."
Luke,12,2,"Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known."
Luke,12,3,"Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed on the housetops."
Luke,12,4,"""I tell you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they can do."
Luke,12,5,"But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him!"
Luke,12,6,Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God.
Luke,12,7,"Why, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows."
Luke,12,8,"""And I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God,"
Luke,12,9,but the one who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God.
Luke,12,10,"And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven."
Luke,12,11,"And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious about how you should defend yourself or what you should say,"
Luke,12,12,"for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say."""
Luke,12,13,"Someone in the crowd said to him, ""Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."""
Luke,12,14,"But he said to him, ""Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?"""
Luke,12,15,"And he said to them, ""Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions."""
Luke,12,16,"And he told them a parable, saying, ""The land of a rich man produced plentifully,"
Luke,12,17,"and he thought to himself, 'What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?'"
Luke,12,18,"And he said, 'I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods."
Luke,12,19,"And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.'"
Luke,12,20,"But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?'"
Luke,12,21,"So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God."""
Luke,12,22,"And he said to his disciples, ""Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat, nor about your body, what you will put on."
Luke,12,23,"For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing."
Luke,12,24,"Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds!"
Luke,12,25,And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?
Luke,12,26,"If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are you anxious about the rest?"
Luke,12,27,"Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
Luke,12,28,"But if God so clothes the grass, which is alive in the field today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith!"
Luke,12,29,"And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor be worried."
Luke,12,30,"For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them."
Luke,12,31,"Instead, seek his kingdom, and these things will be added to you."
Luke,12,32,"""Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."
Luke,12,33,"Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys."
Luke,12,34,"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
Luke,12,35,"""Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning,"
Luke,12,36,"and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks."
Luke,12,37,"Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them."
Luke,12,38,"If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants!"
Luke,12,39,"But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into."
Luke,12,40,"You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect."""
Luke,12,41,"Peter said, ""Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for all?"""
Luke,12,42,"And the Lord said, ""Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper time?"
Luke,12,43,Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.
Luke,12,44,"Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions."
Luke,12,45,"But if that servant says to himself, 'My master is delayed in coming,' and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk,"
Luke,12,46,"the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful."
Luke,12,47,"And that servant who knew his master's will but did not get ready or act according to his will, will receive a severe beating."
Luke,12,48,"But the one who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, will receive a light beating. Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more."
Luke,12,49,"""I came to cast fire on the earth, and would that it were already kindled!"
Luke,12,50,"I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how great is my distress until it is accomplished!"
Luke,12,51,"Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division."
Luke,12,52,"For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three."
Luke,12,53,"They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."""
Luke,12,54,"He also said to the crowds, ""When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, 'A shower is coming.' And so it happens."
Luke,12,55,"And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, 'There will be scorching heat,' and it happens."
Luke,12,56,"You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky, but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?"
Luke,12,57,"""And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?"
Luke,12,58,"As you go with your accuser before the magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer put you in prison."
Luke,12,59,"I tell you, you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny."""
Luke,13,1,There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
Luke,13,2,"And he answered them, ""Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way?"
Luke,13,3,"No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."
Luke,13,4,Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem?
Luke,13,5,"No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."""
Luke,13,6,"And he told this parable: ""A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none."
Luke,13,7,"And he said to the vinedresser, 'Look, for three years now I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. Cut it down. Why should it use up the ground?'"
Luke,13,8,"And he answered him, 'Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure."
Luke,13,9,"Then if it should bear fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.'"""
Luke,13,10,Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
Luke,13,11,And there was a woman who had had a disabling spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not fully straighten herself.
Luke,13,12,"When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, ""Woman, you are freed from your disability."""
Luke,13,13,"And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and she glorified God."
Luke,13,14,"But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the people, ""There are six days in which work ought to be done. Come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day."""
Luke,13,15,"Then the Lord answered him, ""You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it?"
Luke,13,16,"And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?"""
Luke,13,17,"As he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame, and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him."
Luke,13,18,"He said therefore, ""What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?"
Luke,13,19,"It is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air made nests in its branches."""
Luke,13,20,"And again he said, ""To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?"
Luke,13,21,"It is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened."""
Luke,13,22,"He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem."
Luke,13,23,"And someone said to him, ""Lord, will those who are saved be few?"" And he said to them,"
Luke,13,24,"""Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able."
Luke,13,25,"When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us,' then he will answer you, 'I do not know where you come from.'"
Luke,13,26,"Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.'"
Luke,13,27,"But he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!'"
Luke,13,28,"In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out."
Luke,13,29,"And people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God."
Luke,13,30,"And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last."""
Luke,13,31,"At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him, ""Get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you."""
Luke,13,32,"And he said to them, ""Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I finish my course."
Luke,13,33,"Nevertheless, I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the day following, for it cannot be that a prophet should perish away from Jerusalem.'"
Luke,13,34,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!"
Luke,13,35,"Behold, your house is forsaken. And I tell you, you will not see me until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"""
Luke,14,1,"One Sabbath, when he went to dine at the house of a ruler of the Pharisees, they were watching him carefully."
Luke,14,2,"And behold, there was a man before him who had dropsy."
Luke,14,3,"And Jesus responded to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, ""Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?"""
Luke,14,4,But they remained silent. Then he took him and healed him and sent him away.
Luke,14,5,"And he said to them, ""Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?"""
Luke,14,6,And they could not reply to these things.
Luke,14,7,"Now he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the places of honor, saying to them,"
Luke,14,8,"""When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him,"
Luke,14,9,"and he who invited you both will come and say to you, 'Give your place to this person,' and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place."
Luke,14,10,"But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you."
Luke,14,11,"For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."""
Luke,14,12,"He said also to the man who had invited him, ""When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid."
Luke,14,13,"But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,"
Luke,14,14,"and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just."""
Luke,14,15,"When one of those who reclined at table with him heard these things, he said to him, ""Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!"""
Luke,14,16,"But he said to him, ""A man once gave a great banquet and invited many."
Luke,14,17,"And at the time for the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, 'Come, for everything is now ready.'"
Luke,14,18,"But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. Please have me excused.'"
Luke,14,19,"And another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to examine them. Please have me excused.'"
Luke,14,20,"And another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.'"
Luke,14,21,"So the servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant, 'Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor and crippled and blind and lame.'"
Luke,14,22,"And the servant said, 'Sir, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.'"
Luke,14,23,"And the master said to the servant, 'Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled."
Luke,14,24,"For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet.'"""
Luke,14,25,"Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them,"
Luke,14,26,"""If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple."
Luke,14,27,Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.
Luke,14,28,"For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?"
Luke,14,29,"Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him,"
Luke,14,30,"saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'"
Luke,14,31,"Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?"
Luke,14,32,"And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace."
Luke,14,33,"So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple."
Luke,14,34,"""Salt is good, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored?"
Luke,14,35,"It is of no use either for the soil or for the manure pile. It is thrown away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."""
Luke,15,1,Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him.
Luke,15,2,"And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, ""This man receives sinners and eats with them."""
Luke,15,3,So he told them this parable:
Luke,15,4,"""What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it?"
Luke,15,5,"And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing."
Luke,15,6,"And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.'"
Luke,15,7,"Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance."
Luke,15,8,"""Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it?"
Luke,15,9,"And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.'"
Luke,15,10,"Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents."""
Luke,15,11,"And he said, ""There was a man who had two sons."
Luke,15,12,"And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of property that is coming to me.' And he divided his property between them."
Luke,15,13,"Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in reckless living."
Luke,15,14,"And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need."
Luke,15,15,"So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs."
Luke,15,16,"And he was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything."
Luke,15,17,"""But when he came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger!"
Luke,15,18,"I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, ""Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you."
Luke,15,19,"I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants.""'"
Luke,15,20,"And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him."
Luke,15,21,"And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'"
Luke,15,22,"But the father said to his servants, 'Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet."
Luke,15,23,"And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate."
Luke,15,24,"For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.' And they began to celebrate."
Luke,15,25,"""Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing."
Luke,15,26,And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.
Luke,15,27,"And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.'"
Luke,15,28,"But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him,"
Luke,15,29,"but he answered his father, 'Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends."
Luke,15,30,"But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!'"
Luke,15,31,"And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours."
Luke,15,32,"It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.'"""
Luke,16,1,"He also said to the disciples, ""There was a rich man who had a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions."
Luke,16,2,"And he called him and said to him, 'What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.'"
Luke,16,3,"And the manager said to himself, 'What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg."
Luke,16,4,"I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses.'"
Luke,16,5,"So, summoning his master's debtors one by one, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'"
Luke,16,6,"He said, 'A hundred measures of oil.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'"
Luke,16,7,"Then he said to another, 'And how much do you owe?' He said, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'"
Luke,16,8,The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light.
Luke,16,9,"And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings."
Luke,16,10,"""One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much."
Luke,16,11,"If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?"
Luke,16,12,"And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?"
Luke,16,13,"No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money."""
Luke,16,14,"The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him."
Luke,16,15,"And he said to them, ""You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God."
Luke,16,16,"""The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone forces his way into it."
Luke,16,17,But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void.
Luke,16,18,"""Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery."
Luke,16,19,"""There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day."
Luke,16,20,"And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores,"
Luke,16,21,"who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores."
Luke,16,22,"The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried,"
Luke,16,23,"and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side."
Luke,16,24,"And he called out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.'"
Luke,16,25,"But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish."
Luke,16,26,"And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.'"
Luke,16,27,"And he said, 'Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house--"
Luke,16,28,"for I have five brothers--so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.'"
Luke,16,29,"But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.'"
Luke,16,30,"And he said, 'No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'"
Luke,16,31,"He said to him, 'If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.'"""
Luke,17,1,"And he said to his disciples, ""Temptations to sin are sure to come, but woe to the one through whom they come!"
Luke,17,2,It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin.
Luke,17,3,"Pay attention to yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him,"
Luke,17,4,"and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him."""
Luke,17,5,"The apostles said to the Lord, ""Increase our faith!"""
Luke,17,6,"And the Lord said, ""If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you."
Luke,17,7,"""Will any one of you who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come at once and recline at table'?"
Luke,17,8,"Will he not rather say to him, 'Prepare supper for me, and dress properly, and serve me while I eat and drink, and afterward you will eat and drink'?"
Luke,17,9,Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded?
Luke,17,10,"So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.'"""
Luke,17,11,On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee.
Luke,17,12,"And as he entered a village, he was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance"
Luke,17,13,"and lifted up their voices, saying, ""Jesus, Master, have mercy on us."""
Luke,17,14,"When he saw them he said to them, ""Go and show yourselves to the priests."" And as they went they were cleansed."
Luke,17,15,"Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice;"
Luke,17,16,"and he fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan."
Luke,17,17,"Then Jesus answered, ""Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine?"
Luke,17,18,"Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?"""
Luke,17,19,"And he said to him, ""Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well."""
Luke,17,20,"Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, ""The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed,"
Luke,17,21,"nor will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or 'There!' for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you."""
Luke,17,22,"And he said to the disciples, ""The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it."
Luke,17,23,"And they will say to you, 'Look, there!' or 'Look, here!' Do not go out or follow them."
Luke,17,24,"For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day."
Luke,17,25,But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
Luke,17,26,"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man."
Luke,17,27,"They were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all."
Luke,17,28,"Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot--they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building,"
Luke,17,29,"but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them all--"
Luke,17,30,so will it be on the day when the Son of Man is revealed.
Luke,17,31,"On that day, let the one who is on the housetop, with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away, and likewise let the one who is in the field not turn back."
Luke,17,32,Remember Lot's wife.
Luke,17,33,"Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will keep it."
Luke,17,34,"I tell you, in that night there will be two in one bed. One will be taken and the other left."
Luke,17,35,"There will be two women grinding together. One will be taken and the other left."""

Luke,17,37,"And they said to him, ""Where, Lord?"" He said to them, ""Where the corpse is, there the vultures will gather."""
Luke,18,1,And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.
Luke,18,2,"He said, ""In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man."
Luke,18,3,"And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, 'Give me justice against my adversary.'"
Luke,18,4,"For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I neither fear God nor respect man,"
Luke,18,5,"yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming.'"""
Luke,18,6,"And the Lord said, ""Hear what the unrighteous judge says."
Luke,18,7,"And will not God give justice to his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them?"
Luke,18,8,"I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?"""
Luke,18,9,"He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt:"
Luke,18,10,"""Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector."
Luke,18,11,"The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector."
Luke,18,12,I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.'
Luke,18,13,"But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!'"
Luke,18,14,"I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted."""
Luke,18,15,"Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them. And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them."
Luke,18,16,"But Jesus called them to him, saying, ""Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God."
Luke,18,17,"Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it."""
Luke,18,18,"And a ruler asked him, ""Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"""
Luke,18,19,"And Jesus said to him, ""Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone."
Luke,18,20,"You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.'"""
Luke,18,21,"And he said, ""All these I have kept from my youth."""
Luke,18,22,"When Jesus heard this, he said to him, ""One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."""
Luke,18,23,"But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich."
Luke,18,24,"Jesus, looking at him with sadness, said, ""How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!"
Luke,18,25,"For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."""
Luke,18,26,"Those who heard it said, ""Then who can be saved?"""
Luke,18,27,"But he said, ""What is impossible with men is possible with God."""
Luke,18,28,"And Peter said, ""See, we have left our homes and followed you."""
Luke,18,29,"And he said to them, ""Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,"
Luke,18,30,"who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life."""
Luke,18,31,"And taking the twelve, he said to them, ""See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished."
Luke,18,32,For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon.
Luke,18,33,"And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise."""
Luke,18,34,"But they understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said."
Luke,18,35,"As he drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging."
Luke,18,36,"And hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant."
Luke,18,37,"They told him, ""Jesus of Nazareth is passing by."""
Luke,18,38,"And he cried out, ""Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"""
Luke,18,39,"And those who were in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, ""Son of David, have mercy on me!"""
Luke,18,40,"And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him,"
Luke,18,41,"""What do you want me to do for you?"" He said, ""Lord, let me recover my sight."""
Luke,18,42,"And Jesus said to him, ""Recover your sight; your faith has made you well."""
Luke,18,43,"And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God."
Luke,19,1,He entered Jericho and was passing through.
Luke,19,2,And there was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was rich.
Luke,19,3,"And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was small of stature."
Luke,19,4,"So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way."
Luke,19,5,"And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, ""Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today."""
Luke,19,6,So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully.
Luke,19,7,"And when they saw it, they all grumbled, ""He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner."""
Luke,19,8,"And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, ""Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold."""
Luke,19,9,"And Jesus said to him, ""Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham."
Luke,19,10,"For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost."""
Luke,19,11,"As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately."
Luke,19,12,"He said therefore, ""A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return."
Luke,19,13,"Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas, and said to them, 'Engage in business until I come.'"
Luke,19,14,"But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to reign over us.'"
Luke,19,15,"When he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by doing business."
Luke,19,16,"The first came before him, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.'"
Luke,19,17,"And he said to him, 'Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.'"
Luke,19,18,"And the second came, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made five minas.'"
Luke,19,19,"And he said to him, 'And you are to be over five cities.'"
Luke,19,20,"Then another came, saying, 'Lord, here is your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief;"
Luke,19,21,"for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man. You take what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.'"
Luke,19,22,"He said to him, 'I will condemn you with your own words, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?"
Luke,19,23,"Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I might have collected it with interest?'"
Luke,19,24,"And he said to those who stood by, 'Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.'"
Luke,19,25,"And they said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas!'"
Luke,19,26,"'I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away."
Luke,19,27,"But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter them before me.'"""
Luke,19,28,"And when he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem."
Luke,19,29,"When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,"
Luke,19,30,"saying, ""Go into the village in front of you, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it here."
Luke,19,31,"If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' you shall say this: 'The Lord has need of it.'"""
Luke,19,32,So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them.
Luke,19,33,"And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, ""Why are you untying the colt?"""
Luke,19,34,"And they said, ""The Lord has need of it."""
Luke,19,35,"And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it."
Luke,19,36,"And as he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road."
Luke,19,37,"As he was drawing near--already on the way down the Mount of Olives--the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen,"
Luke,19,38,"saying, ""Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"""
Luke,19,39,"And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, ""Teacher, rebuke your disciples."""
Luke,19,40,"He answered, ""I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out."""
Luke,19,41,"And when he drew near and saw the city, he wept over it,"
Luke,19,42,"saying, ""Would that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes."
Luke,19,43,"For the days will come upon you, when your enemies will set up a barricade around you and surround you and hem you in on every side"
Luke,19,44,"and tear you down to the ground, you and your children within you. And they will not leave one stone upon another in you, because you did not know the time of your visitation."""
Luke,19,45,"And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold,"
Luke,19,46,"saying to them, ""It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers."""
Luke,19,47,"And he was teaching daily in the temple. The chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people were seeking to destroy him,"
Luke,19,48,"but they did not find anything they could do, for all the people were hanging on his words."
Luke,20,1,"One day, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up"
Luke,20,2,"and said to him, ""Tell us by what authority you do these things, or who it is that gave you this authority."""
Luke,20,3,"He answered them, ""I also will ask you a question. Now tell me,"
Luke,20,4,"Was the baptism of John from heaven or from man?"""
Luke,20,5,"And they discussed it with one another, saying, ""If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why did you not believe him?'"
Luke,20,6,"But if we say, 'From man,' all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet."""
Luke,20,7,So they answered that they did not know where it came from.
Luke,20,8,"And Jesus said to them, ""Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."""
Luke,20,9,"And he began to tell the people this parable: ""A man planted a vineyard and let it out to tenants and went into another country for a long while."
Luke,20,10,"When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed."
Luke,20,11,"And he sent another servant. But they also beat and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed."
Luke,20,12,And he sent yet a third. This one also they wounded and cast out.
Luke,20,13,"Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.'"
Luke,20,14,"But when the tenants saw him, they said to themselves, 'This is the heir. Let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.'"
Luke,20,15,And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
Luke,20,16,"He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others."" When they heard this, they said, ""Surely not!"""
Luke,20,17,"But he looked directly at them and said, ""What then is this that is written: ""'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'?"
Luke,20,18,"Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him."""
Luke,20,19,"The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that very hour, for they perceived that he had told this parable against them, but they feared the people."
Luke,20,20,"So they watched him and sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might catch him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor."
Luke,20,21,"So they asked him, ""Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and show no partiality, but truly teach the way of God."
Luke,20,22,"Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?"""
Luke,20,23,"But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them,"
Luke,20,24,"""Show me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?"" They said, ""Caesar's."""
Luke,20,25,"He said to them, ""Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."""
Luke,20,26,"And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him in what he said, but marveling at his answer they became silent."
Luke,20,27,"There came to him some Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection,"
Luke,20,28,"and they asked him a question, saying, ""Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother."
Luke,20,29,"Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without children."
Luke,20,30,And the second
Luke,20,31,"and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died."
Luke,20,32,Afterward the woman also died.
Luke,20,33,"In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife."""
Luke,20,34,"And Jesus said to them, ""The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,"
Luke,20,35,"but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,"
Luke,20,36,"for they cannot die anymore, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection."
Luke,20,37,"But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob."
Luke,20,38,"Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him."""
Luke,20,39,"Then some of the scribes answered, ""Teacher, you have spoken well."""
Luke,20,40,For they no longer dared to ask him any question.
Luke,20,41,"But he said to them, ""How can they say that the Christ is David's son?"
Luke,20,42,"For David himself says in the Book of Psalms, ""'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,"
Luke,20,43,until I make your enemies your footstool.'
Luke,20,44,"David thus calls him Lord, so how is he his son?"""
Luke,20,45,"And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,"
Luke,20,46,"""Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,"
Luke,20,47,"who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation."""
Luke,21,1,"Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box,"
Luke,21,2,and he saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins.
Luke,21,3,"And he said, ""Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them."
Luke,21,4,"For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on."""
Luke,21,5,"And while some were speaking of the temple, how it was adorned with noble stones and offerings, he said,"
Luke,21,6,"""As for these things that you see, the days will come when there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down."""
Luke,21,7,"And they asked him, ""Teacher, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?"""
Luke,21,8,"And he said, ""See that you are not led astray. For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!' and, 'The time is at hand!' Do not go after them."
Luke,21,9,"And when you hear of wars and tumults, do not be terrified, for these things must first take place, but the end will not be at once."""
Luke,21,10,"Then he said to them, ""Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom."
Luke,21,11,"There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences. And there will be terrors and great signs from heaven."
Luke,21,12,"But before all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake."
Luke,21,13,This will be your opportunity to bear witness.
Luke,21,14,"Settle it therefore in your minds not to meditate beforehand how to answer,"
Luke,21,15,"for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict."
Luke,21,16,"You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you they will put to death."
Luke,21,17,You will be hated by all for my name's sake.
Luke,21,18,But not a hair of your head will perish.
Luke,21,19,By your endurance you will gain your lives.
Luke,21,20,"""But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near."
Luke,21,21,"Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it,"
Luke,21,22,"for these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written."
Luke,21,23,Alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress upon the earth and wrath against this people.
Luke,21,24,"They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive among all nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled."
Luke,21,25,"""And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves,"
Luke,21,26,people fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world. For the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
Luke,21,27,And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
Luke,21,28,"Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."""
Luke,21,29,"And he told them a parable: ""Look at the fig tree, and all the trees."
Luke,21,30,"As soon as they come out in leaf, you see for yourselves and know that the summer is already near."
Luke,21,31,"So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near."
Luke,21,32,"Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all has taken place."
Luke,21,33,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away."
Luke,21,34,"""But watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap."
Luke,21,35,For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth.
Luke,21,36,"But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man."""
Luke,21,37,"And every day he was teaching in the temple, but at night he went out and lodged on the mount called Olivet."
Luke,21,38,And early in the morning all the people came to him in the temple to hear him.
Luke,22,1,"Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called the Passover."
Luke,22,2,"And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put him to death, for they feared the people."
Luke,22,3,"Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve."
Luke,22,4,He went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them.
Luke,22,5,"And they were glad, and agreed to give him money."
Luke,22,6,So he consented and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of a crowd.
Luke,22,7,"Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed."
Luke,22,8,"So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, ""Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it."""
Luke,22,9,"They said to him, ""Where will you have us prepare it?"""
Luke,22,10,"He said to them, ""Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters"
Luke,22,11,"and tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'"
Luke,22,12,"And he will show you a large upper room furnished; prepare it there."""
Luke,22,13,"And they went and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover."
Luke,22,14,"And when the hour came, he reclined at table, and the apostles with him."
Luke,22,15,"And he said to them, ""I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer."
Luke,22,16,"For I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."""
Luke,22,17,"And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said, ""Take this, and divide it among yourselves."
Luke,22,18,"For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."""
Luke,22,19,"And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, ""This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."""
Luke,22,20,"And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, ""This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood."
Luke,22,21,"But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table."
Luke,22,22,"For the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!"""
Luke,22,23,"And they began to question one another, which of them it could be who was going to do this."
Luke,22,24,"A dispute also arose among them, as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest."
Luke,22,25,"And he said to them, ""The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors."
Luke,22,26,"But not so with you. Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves."
Luke,22,27,"For who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am among you as the one who serves."
Luke,22,28,"""You are those who have stayed with me in my trials,"
Luke,22,29,"and I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom,"
Luke,22,30,that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Luke,22,31,"""Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat,"

Luke,22,34,"Jesus said, ""I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, until you deny three times that you know me."""
Luke,22,35,"And he said to them, ""When I sent you out with no moneybag or knapsack or sandals, did you lack anything?"" They said, ""Nothing."""
Luke,22,36,"He said to them, ""But now let the one who has a moneybag take it, and likewise a knapsack. And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one."
Luke,22,37,"For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors.' For what is written about me has its fulfillment."""
Luke,22,38,"And they said, ""Look, Lord, here are two swords."" And he said to them, ""It is enough."""
Luke,22,39,"And he came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him."
Luke,22,40,"And when he came to the place, he said to them, ""Pray that you may not enter into temptation."""
Luke,22,41,"And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed,"
Luke,22,42,"saying, ""Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."""
Luke,22,43,"And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him."
Luke,22,44,And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
Luke,22,45,"And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow,"
Luke,22,46,"and he said to them, ""Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation."""
Luke,22,47,"While he was still speaking, there came a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him,"
Luke,22,48,"but Jesus said to him, ""Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?"""
Luke,22,49,"And when those who were around him saw what would follow, they said, ""Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"""
Luke,22,50,And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
Luke,22,51,"But Jesus said, ""No more of this!"" And he touched his ear and healed him."
Luke,22,52,"Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders, who had come out against him, ""Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?"
Luke,22,53,"When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."""
Luke,22,54,"Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house, and Peter was following at a distance."
Luke,22,55,"And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them."
Luke,22,56,"Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said, ""This man also was with him."""
Luke,22,57,"But he denied it, saying, ""Woman, I do not know him."""
Luke,22,58,"And a little later someone else saw him and said, ""You also are one of them."" But Peter said, ""Man, I am not."""
Luke,22,59,"And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, ""Certainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean."""
Luke,22,60,"But Peter said, ""Man, I do not know what you are talking about."" And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed."
Luke,22,61,"And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, ""Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times."""
Luke,22,62,And he went out and wept bitterly.
Luke,22,63,Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking him as they beat him.
Luke,22,64,"They also blindfolded him and kept asking him, ""Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?"""
Luke,22,65,"And they said many other things against him, blaspheming him."
Luke,22,66,"When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes. And they led him away to their council, and they said,"
Luke,22,67,"""If you are the Christ, tell us."" But he said to them, ""If I tell you, you will not believe,"
Luke,22,68,"and if I ask you, you will not answer."
Luke,22,69,"But from now on the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God."""
Luke,22,70,"So they all said, ""Are you the Son of God, then?"" And he said to them, ""You say that I am."""
Luke,22,71,"Then they said, ""What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips."""
Luke,23,1,Then the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate.
Luke,23,2,"And they began to accuse him, saying, ""We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king."""
Luke,23,3,"And Pilate asked him, ""Are you the King of the Jews?"" And he answered him, ""You have said so."""
Luke,23,4,"Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, ""I find no guilt in this man."""
Luke,23,5,"But they were urgent, saying, ""He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place."""
Luke,23,6,"When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean."
Luke,23,7,"And when he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time."
Luke,23,8,"When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him."
Luke,23,9,"So he questioned him at some length, but he made no answer."
Luke,23,10,"The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him."
Luke,23,11,"And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him. Then, arraying him in splendid clothing, he sent him back to Pilate."
Luke,23,12,"And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other."
Luke,23,13,"Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,"
Luke,23,14,"and said to them, ""You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people. And after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him."
Luke,23,15,"Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Look, nothing deserving death has been done by him."
Luke,23,16,"I will therefore punish and release him."""
Luke,23,17,See Footnote
Luke,23,18,"But they all cried out together, ""Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas""--"
Luke,23,19,a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city and for murder.
Luke,23,20,"Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus,"
Luke,23,21,"but they kept shouting, ""Crucify, crucify him!"""
Luke,23,22,"A third time he said to them, ""Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no guilt deserving death. I will therefore punish and release him."""
Luke,23,23,"But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed."
Luke,23,24,So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.
Luke,23,25,"He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus over to their will."
Luke,23,26,"And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus."
Luke,23,27,And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting for him.
Luke,23,28,"But turning to them Jesus said, ""Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children."
Luke,23,29,"For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!'"
Luke,23,30,"Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.'"
Luke,23,31,"For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?"""
Luke,23,32,"Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him."
Luke,23,33,"And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left."
Luke,23,34,"And Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."" And they cast lots to divide his garments."
Luke,23,35,"And the people stood by, watching, but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, ""He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!"""
Luke,23,36,"The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine"
Luke,23,37,"and saying, ""If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"""
Luke,23,38,"There was also an inscription over him, ""This is the King of the Jews."""
Luke,23,39,"One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, ""Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!"""
Luke,23,40,"But the other rebuked him, saying, ""Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?"
Luke,23,41,"And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong."""
Luke,23,42,"And he said, ""Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."""
Luke,23,43,"And he said to him, ""Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise."""
Luke,23,44,"It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour,"
Luke,23,45,while the sun's light failed. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.
Luke,23,46,"Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, ""Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!"" And having said this he breathed his last."
Luke,23,47,"Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, saying, ""Certainly this man was innocent!"""
Luke,23,48,"And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts."
Luke,23,49,And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance watching these things.
Luke,23,50,"Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish town of Arimathea. He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man,"
Luke,23,51,who had not consented to their decision and action; and he was looking for the kingdom of God.
Luke,23,52,This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Luke,23,53,"Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and laid him in a tomb cut in stone, where no one had ever yet been laid."
Luke,23,54,"It was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was beginning."
Luke,23,55,The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid.
Luke,23,56,Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments.On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
Luke,24,1,"But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared."
Luke,24,2,"And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,"
Luke,24,3,but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
Luke,24,4,"While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel."
Luke,24,5,"And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, ""Why do you seek the living among the dead?"
Luke,24,6,"He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,"
Luke,24,7,"that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise."""
Luke,24,8,"And they remembered his words,"
Luke,24,9,and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
Luke,24,10,"Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles,"
Luke,24,11,"but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them."
Luke,24,12,"But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened."
Luke,24,13,"That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem,"
Luke,24,14,and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.
Luke,24,15,"While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them."
Luke,24,16,But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
Luke,24,17,"And he said to them, ""What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?"" And they stood still, looking sad."
Luke,24,18,"Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, ""Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?"""
Luke,24,19,"And he said to them, ""What things?"" And they said to him, ""Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,"
Luke,24,20,"and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him."
Luke,24,21,"But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened."
Luke,24,22,"Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning,"
Luke,24,23,"and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive."
Luke,24,24,"Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see."""
Luke,24,25,"And he said to them, ""O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!"
Luke,24,26,"Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?"""
Luke,24,27,"And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself."
Luke,24,28,"So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther,"
Luke,24,29,"but they urged him strongly, saying, ""Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent."" So he went in to stay with them."
Luke,24,30,"When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them."
Luke,24,31,"And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight."
Luke,24,32,"They said to each other, ""Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?"""
Luke,24,33,"And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,"
Luke,24,34,"saying, ""The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"""
Luke,24,35,"Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread."
Luke,24,36,"As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, ""Peace to you!"""
Luke,24,37,But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit.
Luke,24,38,"And he said to them, ""Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?"
Luke,24,39,"See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have."""
Luke,24,40,"And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet."
Luke,24,41,"And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, ""Have you anything here to eat?"""
Luke,24,42,"They gave him a piece of broiled fish,"
Luke,24,43,and he took it and ate before them.
Luke,24,44,"Then he said to them, ""These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled."""
Luke,24,45,"Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,"
Luke,24,46,"and said to them, ""Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead,"
Luke,24,47,"and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem."
Luke,24,48,You are witnesses of these things.
Luke,24,49,"And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."""
Luke,24,50,"Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them."
Luke,24,51,"While he blessed them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven."
Luke,24,52,"And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,"
Luke,24,53,and were continually in the temple blessing God.
John,1,1,"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
John,1,2,He was in the beginning with God.
John,1,3,"All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made."
John,1,4,"In him was life, and the life was the light of men."
John,1,5,"The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."
John,1,6,"There was a man sent from God, whose name was John."
John,1,7,"He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him."
John,1,8,"He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light."
John,1,9,"The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world."
John,1,10,"He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him."
John,1,11,"He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him."
John,1,12,"But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,"
John,1,13,"who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God."
John,1,14,"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth."
John,1,15,"(John bore witness about him, and cried out, ""This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.'"")"
John,1,16,"And from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace."
John,1,17,For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
John,1,18,"No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known."
John,1,19,"And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, ""Who are you?"""
John,1,20,"He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, ""I am not the Christ."""
John,1,21,"And they asked him, ""What then? Are you Elijah?"" He said, ""I am not.Are you the Prophet?"" And he answered, ""No."""
John,1,22,"So they said to him, ""Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"""
John,1,23,"He said, ""I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as the prophet Isaiah said."""
John,1,24,(Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.)
John,1,25,"They asked him, ""Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"""
John,1,26,"John answered them, ""I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know,"
John,1,27,"even he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie."""
John,1,28,"These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing."
John,1,29,"The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, ""Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"
John,1,30,"This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.'"
John,1,31,"I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel."""
John,1,32,"And John bore witness: ""I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him."
John,1,33,"I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, 'He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'"
John,1,34,"And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."""
John,1,35,"The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples,"
John,1,36,"and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, ""Behold, the Lamb of God!"""
John,1,37,"The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus."
John,1,38,"Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, ""What are you seeking?"" And they said to him, ""Rabbi"" (which means Teacher), ""where are you staying?"""
John,1,39,"He said to them, ""Come and you will see."" So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour."
John,1,40,"One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother."
John,1,41,"He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, ""We have found the Messiah"" (which means Christ)."
John,1,42,"He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, ""So you are Simon the son of John? You shall be called Cephas"" (which means Peter )."
John,1,43,"The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, ""Follow me."""
John,1,44,"Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter."
John,1,45,"Philip found Nathanael and said to him, ""We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."""
John,1,46,"Nathanael said to him, ""Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"" Philip said to him, ""Come and see."""
John,1,47,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, ""Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!"""
John,1,48,"Nathanael said to him, ""How do you know me?"" Jesus answered him, ""Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."""
John,1,49,"Nathanael answered him, ""Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"""
John,1,50,"Jesus answered him, ""Because I said to you, 'I saw you under the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than these."""
John,1,51,"And he said to him, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."""
John,2,1,"On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there."
John,2,2,Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples.
John,2,3,"When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, ""They have no wine."""
John,2,4,"And Jesus said to her, ""Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come."""
John,2,5,"His mother said to the servants, ""Do whatever he tells you."""
John,2,6,"Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons."
John,2,7,"Jesus said to the servants, ""Fill the jars with water."" And they filled them up to the brim."
John,2,8,"And he said to them, ""Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast."" So they took it."
John,2,9,"When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom"
John,2,10,"and said to him, ""Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now."""
John,2,11,"This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him."
John,2,12,"After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days."
John,2,13,"The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
John,2,14,"In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there."
John,2,15,"And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables."
John,2,16,"And he told those who sold the pigeons, ""Take these things away; do not make my Father's house a house of trade."""
John,2,17,"His disciples remembered that it was written, ""Zeal for your house will consume me."""
John,2,18,"So the Jews said to him, ""What sign do you show us for doing these things?"""
John,2,19,"Jesus answered them, ""Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."""
John,2,20,"The Jews then said, ""It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?"""
John,2,21,But he was speaking about the temple of his body.
John,2,22,"When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken."
John,2,23,"Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing."
John,2,24,"But Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people"
John,2,25,"and needed no one to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man."
John,3,1,"Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews."
John,3,2,"This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, ""Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him."""
John,3,3,"Jesus answered him, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."""
John,3,4,"Nicodemus said to him, ""How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?"""
John,3,5,"Jesus answered, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God."
John,3,6,"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
John,3,7,"Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'"
John,3,8,"The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit."""
John,3,9,"Nicodemus said to him, ""How can these things be?"""
John,3,10,"Jesus answered him, ""Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things?"
John,3,11,"Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony."
John,3,12,"If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?"
John,3,13,"No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man."
John,3,14,"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,"
John,3,15,that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.
John,3,16,"""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."
John,3,17,"For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him."
John,3,18,"Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God."
John,3,19,"And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil."
John,3,20,"For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed."
John,3,21,"But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been carried out in God."""
John,3,22,"After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, and he remained there with them and was baptizing."
John,3,23,"John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming and being baptized"
John,3,24,(for John had not yet been put in prison).
John,3,25,Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew over purification.
John,3,26,"And they came to John and said to him, ""Rabbi, he who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you bore witness--look, he is baptizing, and all are going to him."""
John,3,27,"John answered, ""A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven."
John,3,28,"You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.'"
John,3,29,"The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. Therefore this joy of mine is now complete."
John,3,30,"He must increase, but I must decrease."""
John,3,31,He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks in an earthly way. He who comes from heaven is above all.
John,3,32,"He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony."
John,3,33,"Whoever receives his testimony sets his seal to this, that God is true."
John,3,34,"For he whom God has sent utters the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure."
John,3,35,The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.
John,3,36,"Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him."
John,4,1,Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
John,4,2,"(although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples),"
John,4,3,he left Judea and departed again for Galilee.
John,4,4,And he had to pass through Samaria.
John,4,5,"So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph."
John,4,6,"Jacob's well was there; so Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey, was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour."
John,4,7,"There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, ""Give me a drink."""
John,4,8,(For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.)
John,4,9,"The Samaritan woman said to him, ""How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?"" (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)"
John,4,10,"Jesus answered her, ""If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."""
John,4,11,"The woman said to him, ""Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?"
John,4,12,"Are you greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock."""
John,4,13,"Jesus said to her, ""Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again,"
John,4,14,"but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty forever. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."""
John,4,15,"The woman said to him, ""Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water."""
John,4,16,"Jesus said to her, ""Go, call your husband, and come here."""
John,4,17,"The woman answered him, ""I have no husband."" Jesus said to her, ""You are right in saying, 'I have no husband';"
John,4,18,"for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true."""
John,4,19,"The woman said to him, ""Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet."
John,4,20,"Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship."""
John,4,21,"Jesus said to her, ""Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father."
John,4,22,"You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews."
John,4,23,"But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him."
John,4,24,"God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."""
John,4,25,"The woman said to him, ""I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things."""
John,4,26,"Jesus said to her, ""I who speak to you am he."""
John,4,27,"Just then his disciples came back. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, ""What do you seek?"" or, ""Why are you talking with her?"""
John,4,28,"So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people,"
John,4,29,"""Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?"""
John,4,30,They went out of the town and were coming to him.
John,4,31,"Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, ""Rabbi, eat."""
John,4,32,"But he said to them, ""I have food to eat that you do not know about."""
John,4,33,"So the disciples said to one another, ""Has anyone brought him something to eat?"""
John,4,34,"Jesus said to them, ""My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work."
John,4,35,"Do you not say, 'There are yet four months, then comes the harvest'? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest."
John,4,36,"Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together."
John,4,37,"For here the saying holds true, 'One sows and another reaps.'"
John,4,38,"I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor."""
John,4,39,"Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, ""He told me all that I ever did."""
John,4,40,"So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days."
John,4,41,And many more believed because of his word.
John,4,42,"They said to the woman, ""It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world."""
John,4,43,After the two days he departed for Galilee.
John,4,44,(For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.)
John,4,45,"So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast. For they too had gone to the feast."
John,4,46,"So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill."
John,4,47,"When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death."
John,4,48,"So Jesus said to him, ""Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe."""
John,4,49,"The official said to him, ""Sir, come down before my child dies."""
John,4,50,"Jesus said to him, ""Go; your son will live."" The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way."
John,4,51,"As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering."
John,4,52,"So he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, ""Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."""
John,4,53,"The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, ""Your son will live."" And he himself believed, and all his household."
John,4,54,This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.
John,5,1,"After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
John,5,2,"Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, in Aramaic called Bethesda, which has five roofed colonnades."
John,5,3,"In these lay a multitude of invalids--blind, lame, and paralyzed."
John,5,4,See Footnote
John,5,5,One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
John,5,6,"When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him, ""Do you want to be healed?"""
John,5,7,"The sick man answered him, ""Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am going another steps down before me."""
John,5,8,"Jesus said to him, ""Get up, take up your bed, and walk."""
John,5,9,"And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked.Now that day was the Sabbath."
John,5,10,"So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, ""It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed."""
John,5,11,"But he answered them, ""The man who healed me, that man said to me, 'Take up your bed, and walk.'"""
John,5,12,"They asked him, ""Who is the man who said to you, 'Take up your bed and walk'?"""
John,5,13,"Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place."
John,5,14,"Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, ""See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you."""
John,5,15,The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.
John,5,16,"And this was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath."
John,5,17,"But Jesus answered them, ""My Father is working until now, and I am working."""
John,5,18,"This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God."
John,5,19,"So Jesus said to them, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise."
John,5,20,"For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel."
John,5,21,"For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will."
John,5,22,"The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,"
John,5,23,"that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him."
John,5,24,"Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life."
John,5,25,"""Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live."
John,5,26,"For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself."
John,5,27,"And he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man."
John,5,28,"Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice"
John,5,29,"and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment."
John,5,30,"""I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me."
John,5,31,"If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not deemed true."
John,5,32,"There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true."
John,5,33,"You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth."
John,5,34,"Not that the testimony that I receive is from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved."
John,5,35,"He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light."
John,5,36,"But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father has sent me."
John,5,37,"And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. His voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen,"
John,5,38,"and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom he has sent."
John,5,39,"You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me,"
John,5,40,yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.
John,5,41,I do not receive glory from people.
John,5,42,But I know that you do not have the love of God within you.
John,5,43,"I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him."
John,5,44,"How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?"
John,5,45,"Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope."
John,5,46,"If you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me."
John,5,47,"But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"""
John,6,1,"After this Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias."
John,6,2,"And a large crowd was following him, because they saw the signs that he was doing on the sick."
John,6,3,"Jesus went up on the mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples."
John,6,4,"Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand."
John,6,5,"Lifting up his eyes, then, and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward him, Jesus said to Philip, ""Where are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?"""
John,6,6,"He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he would do."
John,6,7,"Philip answered him, ""Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little."""
John,6,8,"One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,"
John,6,9,"""There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are they for so many?"""
John,6,10,"Jesus said, ""Have the people sit down."" Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, about five thousand in number."
John,6,11,"Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated. So also the fish, as much as they wanted."
John,6,12,"And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, ""Gather up the leftover fragments, that nothing may be lost."""
John,6,13,"So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves, left by those who had eaten."
John,6,14,"When the people saw the sign that he had done, they said, ""This is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world!"""
John,6,15,"Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself."
John,6,16,"When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,"
John,6,17,"got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them."
John,6,18,The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing.
John,6,19,"When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were frightened."
John,6,20,"But he said to them, ""It is I; do not be afraid."""
John,6,21,"Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going."
John,6,22,"On the next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone."
John,6,23,Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
John,6,24,"So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus."
John,6,25,"When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, ""Rabbi, when did you come here?"""
John,6,26,"Jesus answered them, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves."
John,6,27,"Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For on him God the Father has set his seal."""
John,6,28,"Then they said to him, ""What must we do, to be doing the works of God?"""
John,6,29,"Jesus answered them, ""This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent."""
John,6,30,"So they said to him, ""Then what sign do you do, that we may see and believe you? What work do you perform?"
John,6,31,"Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"""
John,6,32,"Jesus then said to them, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven."
John,6,33,"For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."""
John,6,34,"They said to him, ""Sir, give us this bread always."""
John,6,35,"Jesus said to them, ""I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst."
John,6,36,But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.
John,6,37,"All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out."
John,6,38,"For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me."
John,6,39,"And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day."
John,6,40,"For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day."""
John,6,41,"So the Jews grumbled about him, because he said, ""I am the bread that came down from heaven."""
John,6,42,"They said, ""Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, 'I have come down from heaven'?"""
John,6,43,"Jesus answered them, ""Do not grumble among yourselves."
John,6,44,No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day.
John,6,45,"It is written in the Prophets, 'And they will all be taught by God.' Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me--"
John,6,46,not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father.
John,6,47,"Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life."
John,6,48,I am the bread of life.
John,6,49,"Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died."
John,6,50,"This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die."
John,6,51,"I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."""
John,6,52,"The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, ""How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"""
John,6,53,"So Jesus said to them, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you."
John,6,54,"Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day."
John,6,55,"For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink."
John,6,56,"Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him."
John,6,57,"As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me."
John,6,58,"This is the bread that came down from heaven, not as the fathers ate and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever."""
John,6,59,"Jesus said these things in the synagogue, as he taught at Capernaum."
John,6,60,"When many of his disciples heard it, they said, ""This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?"""
John,6,61,"But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, ""Do you take offense at this?"
John,6,62,Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?
John,6,63,It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.
John,6,64,"But there are some of you who do not believe."" (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.)"
John,6,65,"And he said, ""This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father."""
John,6,66,After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him.
John,6,67,"So Jesus said to the Twelve, ""Do you want to go away as well?"""
John,6,68,"Simon Peter answered him, ""Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life,"
John,6,69,"and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God."""
John,6,70,"Jesus answered them, ""Did I not choose you, the Twelve? And yet one of you is a devil."""
John,6,71,"He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the Twelve, was going to betray him."
John,7,1,"After this Jesus went about in Galilee. He would not go about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him."
John,7,2,Now the Jews' Feast of Booths was at hand.
John,7,3,"So his brothers said to him, ""Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples also may see the works you are doing."
John,7,4,"For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world."""
John,7,5,For not even his brothers believed in him.
John,7,6,"Jesus said to them, ""My time has not yet come, but your time is always here."
John,7,7,"The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil."
John,7,8,"You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come."""
John,7,9,"After saying this, he remained in Galilee."
John,7,10,"But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private."
John,7,11,"The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, ""Where is he?"""
John,7,12,"And there was much muttering about him among the people. While some said, ""He is a good man,"" others said, ""No, he is leading the people astray."""
John,7,13,Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.
John,7,14,About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching.
John,7,15,"The Jews therefore marveled, saying, ""How is it that this man has learning, when he has never studied?"""
John,7,16,"So Jesus answered them, ""My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me."
John,7,17,"If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority."
John,7,18,"The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory, but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood."
John,7,19,"Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?"""
John,7,20,"The crowd answered, ""You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?"""
John,7,21,"Jesus answered them, ""I did one deed, and you all marvel at it."
John,7,22,"Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath."
John,7,23,"If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well?"
John,7,24,"Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment."""
John,7,25,"Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, ""Is not this the man whom they seek to kill?"
John,7,26,"And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ?"
John,7,27,"But we know where this man comes from, and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from."""
John,7,28,"So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, ""You know me, and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord. He who sent me is true, and him you do not know."
John,7,29,"I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me."""
John,7,30,"So they were seeking to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come."
John,7,31,"Yet many of the people believed in him. They said, ""When the Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man has done?"""
John,7,32,"The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him."
John,7,33,"Jesus then said, ""I will be with you a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me."
John,7,34,"You will seek me and you will not find me. Where I am you cannot come."""
John,7,35,"The Jews said to one another, ""Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?"
John,7,36,"What does he mean by saying, 'You will seek me and you will not find me,' and, 'Where I am you cannot come'?"""
John,7,37,"On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, ""If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink."
John,7,38,"Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, 'Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.'"""
John,7,39,"Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified."
John,7,40,"When they heard these words, some of the people said, ""This really is the Prophet."""
John,7,41,"Others said, ""This is the Christ."" But some said, ""Is the Christ to come from Galilee?"
John,7,42,"Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the offspring of David, and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was?"""
John,7,43,So there was a division among the people over him.
John,7,44,"Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him."
John,7,45,"The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, ""Why did you not bring him?"""
John,7,46,"The officers answered, ""No one ever spoke like this man!"""
John,7,47,"The Pharisees answered them, ""Have you also been deceived?"
John,7,48,Have any of the authorities or the Pharisees believed in him?
John,7,49,"But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed."""
John,7,50,"Nicodemus, who had gone to him before, and who was one of them, said to them,"
John,7,51,"""Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?"""
John,7,52,"They replied, ""Are you from Galilee too? Search and see that no prophet arises from Galilee."" [The earliest manuscripts do not include John 7:53-8:11]"
John,7,53,"[[They went each to his own house,"
John,8,1,but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
John,8,2,"Early in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them."
John,8,3,"The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst"
John,8,4,"they said to him, ""Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery."
John,8,5,"Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?"""
John,8,6,"This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground."
John,8,7,"And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, ""Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her."""
John,8,8,And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground.
John,8,9,"But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him."
John,8,10,"Jesus stood up and said to her, ""Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"""
John,8,11,"She said, ""No one, Lord."" And Jesus said, ""Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.""]]"
John,8,12,"Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, ""I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."""
John,8,13,"So the Pharisees said to him, ""You are bearing witness about yourself; your testimony is not true."""
John,8,14,"Jesus answered, ""Even if I do bear witness about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going, but you do not know where I come from or where I am going."
John,8,15,You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.
John,8,16,"Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for it is not I alone who judge, but I and the Father who sent me."
John,8,17,In your Law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.
John,8,18,"I am the one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me."""
John,8,19,"They said to him therefore, ""Where is your Father?"" Jesus answered, ""You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also."""
John,8,20,"These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come."
John,8,21,"So he said to them again, ""I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come."""
John,8,22,"So the Jews said, ""Will he kill himself, since he says, 'Where I am going, you cannot come'?"""
John,8,23,"He said to them, ""You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world."
John,8,24,"I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins."""
John,8,25,"So they said to him, ""Who are you?"" Jesus said to them, ""Just what I have been telling you from the beginning."
John,8,26,"I have much to say about you and much to judge, but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him."""
John,8,27,They did not understand that he had been speaking to them about the Father.
John,8,28,"So Jesus said to them, ""When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority, but speak just as the Father taught me."
John,8,29,"And he who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him."""
John,8,30,"As he was saying these things, many believed in him."
John,8,31,"So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, ""If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples,"
John,8,32,"and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."""
John,8,33,"They answered him, ""We are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How is it that you say, 'You will become free'?"""
John,8,34,"Jesus answered them, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin."
John,8,35,The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever.
John,8,36,"So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed."
John,8,37,I know that you are offspring of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me because my word finds no place in you.
John,8,38,"I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father."""
John,8,39,"They answered him, ""Abraham is our father."" Jesus said to them, ""If you were Abraham's children, you would be doing what Abraham did,"
John,8,40,"but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did."
John,8,41,"You are doing what your father did."" They said to him, ""We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father--even God."""
John,8,42,"Jesus said to them, ""If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but He sent me."
John,8,43,Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word.
John,8,44,"You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies."
John,8,45,"But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me."
John,8,46,"Which one of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?"
John,8,47,"Whoever is of God hears the words of God. The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God."""
John,8,48,"The Jews answered him, ""Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?"""
John,8,49,"Jesus answered, ""I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me."
John,8,50,"Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge."
John,8,51,"Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death."""
John,8,52,"The Jews said to him, ""Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as did the prophets, yet you say, 'If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.'"
John,8,53,"Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?"""
John,8,54,"Jesus answered, ""If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, 'He is our God.'"
John,8,55,"But you have not known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word."
John,8,56,"Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad."""
John,8,57,"So the Jews said to him, ""You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?"""
John,8,58,"Jesus said to them, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am."""
John,8,59,"So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple."
John,9,1,"As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth."
John,9,2,"And his disciples asked him, ""Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"""
John,9,3,"Jesus answered, ""It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him."
John,9,4,"We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work."
John,9,5,"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."""
John,9,6,"Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then he anointed the man's eyes with the mud"
John,9,7,"and said to him, ""Go, wash in the pool of Siloam"" (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing."
John,9,8,"The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying, ""Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?"""
John,9,9,"Some said, ""It is he."" Others said, ""No, but he is like him."" He kept saying, ""I am the man."""
John,9,10,"So they said to him, ""Then how were your eyes opened?"""
John,9,11,"He answered, ""The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' So I went and washed and received my sight."""
John,9,12,"They said to him, ""Where is he?"" He said, ""I do not know."""
John,9,13,They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.
John,9,14,Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
John,9,15,"So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, ""He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see."""
John,9,16,"Some of the Pharisees said, ""This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath."" But others said, ""How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?"" And there was a division among them."
John,9,17,"So they said again to the blind man, ""What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?"" He said, ""He is a prophet."""
John,9,18,"The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight"
John,9,19,"and asked them, ""Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"""
John,9,20,"His parents answered, ""We know that this is our son and that he was born blind."
John,9,21,"But how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself."""
John,9,22,"(His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.)"
John,9,23,"Therefore his parents said, ""He is of age; ask him."""
John,9,24,"So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, ""Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner."""
John,9,25,"He answered, ""Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see."""
John,9,26,"They said to him, ""What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"""
John,9,27,"He answered them, ""I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?"""
John,9,28,"And they reviled him, saying, ""You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses."
John,9,29,"We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from."""
John,9,30,"The man answered, ""Why, this is an amazing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes."
John,9,31,"We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him."
John,9,32,Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.
John,9,33,"If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."""
John,9,34,"They answered him, ""You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?"" And they cast him out."
John,9,35,"Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, ""Do you believe in the Son of Man?"""
John,9,36,"He answered, ""And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?"""
John,9,37,"Jesus said to him, ""You have seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you."""
John,9,38,"He said, ""Lord, I believe,"" and he worshiped him."
John,9,39,"Jesus said, ""For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind."""
John,9,40,"Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things, and said to him, ""Are we also blind?"""
John,9,41,"Jesus said to them, ""If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, 'We see,' your guilt remains."
John,10,1,"""Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber."
John,10,2,But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
John,10,3,"To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out."
John,10,4,"When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice."
John,10,5,"A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers."""
John,10,6,"This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them."
John,10,7,"So Jesus again said to them, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep."
John,10,8,"All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them."
John,10,9,"I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture."
John,10,10,The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.
John,10,11,I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
John,10,12,"He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them."
John,10,13,He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.
John,10,14,"I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,"
John,10,15,just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.
John,10,16,"And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd."
John,10,17,"For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again."
John,10,18,"No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father."""
John,10,19,There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.
John,10,20,"Many of them said, ""He has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him?"""
John,10,21,"Others said, ""These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"""
John,10,22,"At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter,"
John,10,23,"and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon."
John,10,24,"So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, ""How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."""
John,10,25,"Jesus answered them, ""I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me,"
John,10,26,but you do not believe because you are not part of my flock.
John,10,27,"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me."
John,10,28,"I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand."
John,10,29,"My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand."
John,10,30,"I and the Father are one."""
John,10,31,The Jews picked up stones again to stone him.
John,10,32,"Jesus answered them, ""I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?"""
John,10,33,"The Jews answered him, ""It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God."""
John,10,34,"Jesus answered them, ""Is it not written in your Law, 'I said, you are gods'?"
John,10,35,If he called them gods to whom the word of God came--and Scripture cannot be broken--
John,10,36,"do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?"
John,10,37,"If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me;"
John,10,38,"but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father."""
John,10,39,"Again they sought to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands."
John,10,40,"He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and there he remained."
John,10,41,"And many came to him. And they said, ""John did no sign, but everything that John said about this man was true."""
John,10,42,And many believed in him there.
John,11,1,"Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha."
John,11,2,"It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill."
John,11,3,"So the sisters sent to him, saying, ""Lord, he whom you love is ill."""
John,11,4,"But when Jesus heard it he said, ""This illness does not lead to death. It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it."""
John,11,5,Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
John,11,6,"So, when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was."
John,11,7,"Then after this he said to the disciples, ""Let us go to Judea again."""
John,11,8,"The disciples said to him, ""Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?"""
John,11,9,"Jesus answered, ""Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world."
John,11,10,"But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."""
John,11,11,"After saying these things, he said to them, ""Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him."""
John,11,12,"The disciples said to him, ""Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."""
John,11,13,"Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep."
John,11,14,"Then Jesus told them plainly, ""Lazarus has died,"
John,11,15,"and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him."""
John,11,16,"So Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, ""Let us also go, that we may die with him."""
John,11,17,"Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days."
John,11,18,"Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off,"
John,11,19,and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.
John,11,20,"So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary remained seated in the house."
John,11,21,"Martha said to Jesus, ""Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."
John,11,22,"But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you."""
John,11,23,"Jesus said to her, ""Your brother will rise again."""
John,11,24,"Martha said to him, ""I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day."""
John,11,25,"Jesus said to her, ""I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live,"
John,11,26,"and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?"""
John,11,27,"She said to him, ""Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world."""
John,11,28,"When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in private, ""The Teacher is here and is calling for you."""
John,11,29,"And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him."
John,11,30,"Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him."
John,11,31,"When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there."
John,11,32,"Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, ""Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."""
John,11,33,"When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled."
John,11,34,"And he said, ""Where have you laid him?"" They said to him, ""Lord, come and see."""
John,11,35,Jesus wept.
John,11,36,"So the Jews said, ""See how he loved him!"""
John,11,37,"But some of them said, ""Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this man from dying?"""
John,11,38,"Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it."
John,11,39,"Jesus said, ""Take away the stone."" Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, ""Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days."""
John,11,40,"Jesus said to her, ""Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?"""
John,11,41,"So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, ""Father, I thank you that you have heard me."
John,11,42,"I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me."""
John,11,43,"When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, ""Lazarus, come out."""
John,11,44,"The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, ""Unbind him, and let him go."""
John,11,45,"Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him,"
John,11,46,but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
John,11,47,"So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Council and said, ""What are we to do? For this man performs many signs."
John,11,48,"If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."""
John,11,49,"But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, ""You know nothing at all."
John,11,50,"Nor do you understand that it is better for you that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish."""
John,11,51,"He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,"
John,11,52,"and not for the nation only, but also to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad."
John,11,53,So from that day on they made plans to put him to death.
John,11,54,"Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there to the region near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, and there he stayed with the disciples."
John,11,55,"Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves."
John,11,56,"They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, ""What do you think? That he will not come to the feast at all?"""
John,11,57,"Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should let them know, so that they might arrest him."
John,12,1,"Six days before the Passover, Jesus therefore came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead."
John,12,2,"So they gave a dinner for him there. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at the table."
John,12,3,"Mary therefore took a pound of expensive ointment made from pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume."
John,12,4,"But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was about to betray him), said,"
John,12,5,"""Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"""
John,12,6,"He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it."
John,12,7,"Jesus said, ""Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my burial."
John,12,8,"The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me."""
John,12,9,"When the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, they came, not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead."
John,12,10,"So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well,"
John,12,11,because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.
John,12,12,The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
John,12,13,"So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, ""Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!"""
John,12,14,"And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,"
John,12,15,"""Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey's colt!"""
John,12,16,"His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him."
John,12,17,The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness.
John,12,18,The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign.
John,12,19,"So the Pharisees said to one another, ""You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the world has gone after him."""
John,12,20,Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks.
John,12,21,"So these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, ""Sir, we wish to see Jesus."""
John,12,22,Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.
John,12,23,"And Jesus answered them, ""The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified."
John,12,24,"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."
John,12,25,"Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life."
John,12,26,"If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him."
John,12,27,"""Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? But for this purpose I have come to this hour."
John,12,28,"Father, glorify your name."" Then a voice came from heaven: ""I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again."""
John,12,29,"The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, ""An angel has spoken to him."""
John,12,30,"Jesus answered, ""This voice has come for your sake, not mine."
John,12,31,Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out.
John,12,32,"And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself."""
John,12,33,He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die.
John,12,34,"So the crowd answered him, ""We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?"""
John,12,35,"So Jesus said to them, ""The light is among you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going."
John,12,36,"While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.""When Jesus had said these things, he departed and hid himself from them."
John,12,37,"Though he had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in him,"
John,12,38,"so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: ""Lord, who has believed what he heard from us, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"""
John,12,39,"Therefore they could not believe. For again Isaiah said,"
John,12,40,"""He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I would heal them."""
John,12,41,Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke of him.
John,12,42,"Nevertheless, many even of the authorities believed in him, but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue;"
John,12,43,for they loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God.
John,12,44,"And Jesus cried out and said, ""Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me."
John,12,45,And whoever sees me sees him who sent me.
John,12,46,"I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness."
John,12,47,"If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world."
John,12,48,The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.
John,12,49,"For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment--what to say and what to speak."
John,12,50,"And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has told me."""
John,13,1,"Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end."
John,13,2,"During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,"
John,13,3,"Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God,"
John,13,4,"rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist."
John,13,5,Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
John,13,6,"He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, ""Lord, do you wash my feet?"""
John,13,7,"Jesus answered him, ""What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand."""
John,13,8,"Peter said to him, ""You shall never wash my feet."" Jesus answered him, ""If I do not wash you, you have no share with me."""
John,13,9,"Simon Peter said to him, ""Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!"""
John,13,10,"Jesus said to him, ""The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you."""
John,13,11,"For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, ""Not all of you are clean."""
John,13,12,"When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, ""Do you understand what I have done to you?"
John,13,13,"You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am."
John,13,14,"If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet."
John,13,15,"For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you."
John,13,16,"Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him."
John,13,17,"If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them."
John,13,18,"I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But the Scripture will be fulfilled, 'He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.'"
John,13,19,"I am telling you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place you may believe that I am he."
John,13,20,"Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me."""
John,13,21,"After saying these things, Jesus was troubled in his spirit, and testified, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me."""
John,13,22,"The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke."
John,13,23,"One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table close to Jesus,"
John,13,24,so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking.
John,13,25,"So that disciple, leaning back against Jesus, said to him, ""Lord, who is it?"""
John,13,26,"Jesus answered, ""It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it."" So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot."
John,13,27,"Then after he had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, ""What you are going to do, do quickly."""
John,13,28,Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.
John,13,29,"Some thought that, because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, ""Buy what we need for the feast,"" or that he should give something to the poor."
John,13,30,"So, after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night."
John,13,31,"When he had gone out, Jesus said, ""Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him."
John,13,32,"If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once."
John,13,33,"Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, 'Where I am going you cannot come.'"
John,13,34,"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another."
John,13,35,"By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."""
John,13,36,"Simon Peter said to him, ""Lord, where are you going?"" Jesus answered him, ""Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but you will follow afterward."""
John,13,37,"Peter said to him, ""Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."""
John,13,38,"Jesus answered, ""Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times."
John,14,1,"""Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me."
John,14,2,"In my Father's house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?"
John,14,3,"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also."
John,14,4,"And you know the way to where I am going."""
John,14,5,"Thomas said to him, ""Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?"""
John,14,6,"Jesus said to him, ""I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."
John,14,7,"If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him."""
John,14,8,"Philip said to him, ""Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us."""
John,14,9,"Jesus said to him, ""Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?"
John,14,10,"Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his works."
John,14,11,"Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves."
John,14,12,"""Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father."
John,14,13,"Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son."
John,14,14,"If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it."
John,14,15,"""If you love me, you will keep my commandments."
John,14,16,"And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever,"
John,14,17,"even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you."
John,14,18,"""I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you."
John,14,19,"Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live."
John,14,20,"In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you."
John,14,21,"Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him."""
John,14,22,"Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, ""Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?"""
John,14,23,"Jesus answered him, ""If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him."
John,14,24,Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me.
John,14,25,"""These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you."
John,14,26,"But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you."
John,14,27,"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid."
John,14,28,"You heard me say to you, 'I am going away, and I will come to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I."
John,14,29,"And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place you may believe."
John,14,30,"I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no claim on me,"
John,14,31,"but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise, let us go from here."
John,15,1,"""I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser."
John,15,2,"Every branch of mine that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit."
John,15,3,Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.
John,15,4,"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me."
John,15,5,"I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing."
John,15,6,"If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned."
John,15,7,"If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."
John,15,8,"By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples."
John,15,9,"As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love."
John,15,10,"If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love."
John,15,11,"These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full."
John,15,12,"""This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you."
John,15,13,"Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends."
John,15,14,You are my friends if you do what I command you.
John,15,15,"No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you."
John,15,16,"You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you."
John,15,17,"These things I command you, so that you will love one another."
John,15,18,"""If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you."
John,15,19,"If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you."
John,15,20,"Remember the word that I said to you: 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours."
John,15,21,"But all these things they will do to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me."
John,15,22,"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin."
John,15,23,Whoever hates me hates my Father also.
John,15,24,"If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin, but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father."
John,15,25,But the word that is written in their Law must be fulfilled: 'They hated me without a cause.'
John,15,26,"""But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me."
John,15,27,"And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning."
John,16,1,"""I have said all these things to you to keep you from falling away."
John,16,2,"They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God."
John,16,3,"And they will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me."
John,16,4,"But I have said these things to you, that when their hour comes you may remember that I told them to you. ""I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you."
John,16,5,"But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'"
John,16,6,"But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart."
John,16,7,"Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you."
John,16,8,"And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment:"
John,16,9,"concerning sin, because they do not believe in me;"
John,16,10,"concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer;"
John,16,11,"concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged."
John,16,12,"""I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now."
John,16,13,"When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come."
John,16,14,"He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you."
John,16,15,All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.
John,16,16,"""A little while, and you will see me no longer; and again a little while, and you will see me."""
John,16,17,"So some of his disciples said to one another, ""What is this that he says to us, 'A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me'; and, 'because I am going to the Father'?"""
John,16,18,"So they were saying, ""What does he mean by 'a little while'? We do not know what he is talking about."""
John,16,19,"Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, ""Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, 'A little while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me'?"
John,16,20,"Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy."
John,16,21,"When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come, but when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world."
John,16,22,"So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you."
John,16,23,"In that day you will ask nothing of me. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you."
John,16,24,"Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full."
John,16,25,"""I have said these things to you in figures of speech. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech but will tell you plainly about the Father."
John,16,26,"In that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf;"
John,16,27,"for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God."
John,16,28,"I came from the Father and have come into the world, and now I am leaving the world and going to the Father."""
John,16,29,"His disciples said, ""Ah, now you are speaking plainly and not using figurative speech!"
John,16,30,"Now we know that you know all things and do not need anyone to question you; this is why we believe that you came from God."""
John,16,31,"Jesus answered them, ""Do you now believe?"
John,16,32,"Behold, the hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home, and will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me."
John,16,33,"I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world."""
John,17,1,"When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, ""Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you,"
John,17,2,"since you have given him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him."
John,17,3,"And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent."
John,17,4,"I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do."
John,17,5,"And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed."
John,17,6,"""I have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world. Yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word."
John,17,7,Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you.
John,17,8,"For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me."
John,17,9,"I am praying for them. I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours."
John,17,10,"All mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them."
John,17,11,"And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one."
John,17,12,"While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled."
John,17,13,"But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves."
John,17,14,"I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world."
John,17,15,"I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one."
John,17,16,"They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world."
John,17,17,Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.
John,17,18,"As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world."
John,17,19,"And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth."
John,17,20,"""I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word,"
John,17,21,"that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me."
John,17,22,"The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one,"
John,17,23,"I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me."
John,17,24,"Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world."
John,17,25,"O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me."
John,17,26,"I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them."""
John,18,1,"When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered."
John,18,2,"Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples."
John,18,3,"So Judas, having procured a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons."
John,18,4,"Then Jesus, knowing all that would happen to him, came forward and said to them, ""Whom do you seek?"""
John,18,5,"They answered him, ""Jesus of Nazareth."" Jesus said to them, ""I am he."" Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them."
John,18,6,"When Jesus said to them, ""I am he,"" they drew back and fell to the ground."
John,18,7,"So he asked them again, ""Whom do you seek?"" And they said, ""Jesus of Nazareth."""
John,18,8,"Jesus answered, ""I told you that I am he. So, if you seek me, let these men go."""
John,18,9,"This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken: ""Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one."""
John,18,10,"Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.)"
John,18,11,"So Jesus said to Peter, ""Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?"""
John,18,12,So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him.
John,18,13,"First they led him to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year."
John,18,14,It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people.
John,18,15,"Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest,"
John,18,16,"but Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door, and brought Peter in."
John,18,17,"The servant girl at the door said to Peter, ""You also are not one of this man's disciples, are you?"" He said, ""I am not."""
John,18,18,"Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself."
John,18,19,The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.
John,18,20,"Jesus answered him, ""I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret."
John,18,21,"Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them; they know what I said."""
John,18,22,"When he had said these things, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, ""Is that how you answer the high priest?"""
John,18,23,"Jesus answered him, ""If what I said is wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said is right, why do you strike me?"""
John,18,24,Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
John,18,25,"Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, ""You also are not one of his disciples, are you?"" He denied it and said, ""I am not."""
John,18,26,"One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, ""Did I not see you in the garden with him?"""
John,18,27,"Peter again denied it, and at once a rooster crowed."
John,18,28,"Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the governor's headquarters. It was early morning. They themselves did not enter the governor's headquarters, so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover."
John,18,29,"So Pilate went outside to them and said, ""What accusation do you bring against this man?"""
John,18,30,"They answered him, ""If this man were not doing evil, we would not have delivered him over to you."""
John,18,31,"Pilate said to them, ""Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law."" The Jews said to him, ""It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death."""
John,18,32,This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to show by what kind of death he was going to die.
John,18,33,"So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him, ""Are you the King of the Jews?"""
John,18,34,"Jesus answered, ""Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?"""
John,18,35,"Pilate answered, ""Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?"""
John,18,36,"Jesus answered, ""My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world."""
John,18,37,"Then Pilate said to him, ""So you are a king?"" Jesus answered, ""You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world--to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice."""
John,18,38,"Pilate said to him, ""What is truth?""After he had said this, he went back outside to the Jews and told them, ""I find no guilt in him."
John,18,39,"But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"""
John,18,40,"They cried out again, ""Not this man, but Barabbas!"" Now Barabbas was a robber."
John,19,1,Then Pilate took Jesus and flogged him.
John,19,2,And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple robe.
John,19,3,"They came up to him, saying, ""Hail, King of the Jews!"" and struck him with their hands."
John,19,4,"Pilate went out again and said to them, ""See, I am bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no guilt in him."""
John,19,5,"So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, ""Behold the man!"""
John,19,6,"When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, ""Crucify him, crucify him!"" Pilate said to them, ""Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him."""
John,19,7,"The Jews answered him, ""We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has made himself the Son of God."""
John,19,8,"When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid."
John,19,9,"He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus, ""Where are you from?"" But Jesus gave him no answer."
John,19,10,"So Pilate said to him, ""You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?"""
John,19,11,"Jesus answered him, ""You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin."""
John,19,12,"From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, ""If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar."""
John,19,13,"So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, and in Aramaic Gabbatha."
John,19,14,"Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, ""Behold your King!"""
John,19,15,"They cried out, ""Away with him, away with him, crucify him!"" Pilate said to them, ""Shall I crucify your King?"" The chief priests answered,.We have no king but Caesar."""
John,19,16,"So he delivered him over to them to be crucified.So they took Jesus,"
John,19,17,"and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called the place of a skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha."
John,19,18,"There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them."
John,19,19,"Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, ""Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."""
John,19,20,"Many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek."
John,19,21,"So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, ""Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but rather, 'This man said, I am King of the Jews.'"""
John,19,22,"Pilate answered, ""What I have written I have written."""
John,19,23,"When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom,"
John,19,24,"so they said to one another, ""Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be."" This was to fulfill the Scripture which says, ""They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots.""So the soldiers did these things,"
John,19,25,"but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene."
John,19,26,"When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, ""Woman, behold, your son!"""
John,19,27,"Then he said to the disciple, ""Behold, your mother!"" And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home."
John,19,28,"After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), ""I thirst."""
John,19,29,"A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth."
John,19,30,"When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, ""It is finished,"" and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit."
John,19,31,"Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away."
John,19,32,"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him."
John,19,33,"But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs."
John,19,34,"But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water."
John,19,35,"He who saw it has borne witness--his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth--that you also may believe."
John,19,36,"For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: ""Not one of his bones will be broken."""
John,19,37,"And again another Scripture says, ""They will look on him whom they have pierced."""
John,19,38,"After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body."
John,19,39,"Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight."
John,19,40,"So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews."
John,19,41,"Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid."
John,19,42,"So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there."
John,20,1,"Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb."
John,20,2,"So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, ""They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him."""
John,20,3,"So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb."
John,20,4,"Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first."
John,20,5,"And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in."
John,20,6,"Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there,"
John,20,7,"and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus' head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself."
John,20,8,"Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed;"
John,20,9,"for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead."
John,20,10,Then the disciples went back to their homes.
John,20,11,"But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb."
John,20,12,"And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet."
John,20,13,"They said to her, ""Woman, why are you weeping?"" She said to them, ""They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him."""
John,20,14,"Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus."
John,20,15,"Jesus said to her, ""Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?"" Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, ""Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away."""
John,20,16,"Jesus said to her, ""Mary."" She turned and said to him in Aramaic, ""Rabboni!"" (which means Teacher)."
John,20,17,"Jesus said to her, ""Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"""
John,20,18,"Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, ""I have seen the Lord""--and that he had said these things to her."
John,20,19,"On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, ""Peace be with you."""
John,20,20,"When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord."
John,20,21,"Jesus said to them again, ""Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you."""
John,20,22,"And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, ""Receive the Holy Spirit."
John,20,23,"If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven; if you withhold forgiveness from anyone, it is withheld."""
John,20,24,"Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came."
John,20,25,"So the other disciples told him, ""We have seen the Lord."" But he said to them, ""Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe."""
John,20,26,"Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, ""Peace be with you."""
John,20,27,"Then he said to Thomas, ""Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe."""
John,20,28,"Thomas answered him, ""My Lord and my God!"""
John,20,29,"Jesus said to him, ""Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."""
John,20,30,"Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;"
John,20,31,"but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name."
John,21,1,"After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way."
John,21,2,"Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together."
John,21,3,"Simon Peter said to them, ""I am going fishing."" They said to him, ""We will go with you."" They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing."
John,21,4,"Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus."
John,21,5,"Jesus said to them, ""Children, do you have any fish?"" They answered him, ""No."""
John,21,6,"He said to them, ""Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some."" So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish."
John,21,7,"That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, ""It is the Lord!"" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work, and threw himself into the sea."
John,21,8,"The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off."
John,21,9,"When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread."
John,21,10,"Jesus said to them, ""Bring some of the fish that you have just caught."""
John,21,11,"So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn."
John,21,12,"Jesus said to them, ""Come and have breakfast."" Now none of the disciples dared ask him, ""Who are you?"" They knew it was the Lord."
John,21,13,"Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish."
John,21,14,This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.
John,21,15,"When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, ""Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?"" He said to him, ""Yes, Lord; you know that I love you."" He said to him, ""Feed my lambs."""
John,21,16,"He said to him a second time, ""Simon, son of John, do you love me?"" He said to him, ""Yes, Lord; you know that I love you."" He said to him, ""Tend my sheep."""
John,21,17,"He said to him the third time, ""Simon, son of John, do you love me?"" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, ""Do you love me?"" and he said to him, ""Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you."" Jesus said to him, ""Feed my sheep."
John,21,18,"Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go."""
John,21,19,"(This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, ""Follow me."""
John,21,20,"Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who had been reclining at table close to him and had said, ""Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?"""
John,21,21,"When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, ""Lord, what about this man?"""
John,21,22,"Jesus said to him, ""If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!"""
John,21,23,"So the saying spread abroad among the brothers that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, ""If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?"""
John,21,24,"This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true."
John,21,25,"Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written."
Acts,1,1,"In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach,"
Acts,1,2,"until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen."
Acts,1,3,"To them he presented himself alive after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God."
Acts,1,4,"And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, ""you heard from me;"
Acts,1,5,"for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now."""
Acts,1,6,"So when they had come together, they asked him, ""Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"""
Acts,1,7,"He said to them, ""It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority."
Acts,1,8,"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth."""
Acts,1,9,"And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight."
Acts,1,10,"And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes,"
Acts,1,11,"and said, ""Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven."""
Acts,1,12,"Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away."
Acts,1,13,"And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James."
Acts,1,14,"All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers."
Acts,1,15,"In those days Peter stood up among the brothers (the company of persons was in all about 120) and said,"
Acts,1,16,"""Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus."
Acts,1,17,"For he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry."""
Acts,1,18,"(Now this man bought a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out."
Acts,1,19,"And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)"
Acts,1,20,"""For it is written in the Book of Psalms, ""'May his camp become desolate, and let there be no one to dwell in it';and ""'Let another take his office.'"
Acts,1,21,"So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,"
Acts,1,22,"beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us--one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection."""
Acts,1,23,"And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias."
Acts,1,24,"And they prayed and said, ""You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen"
Acts,1,25,"to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place."""
Acts,1,26,"And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles."
Acts,2,1,"When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place."
Acts,2,2,"And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting."
Acts,2,3,And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them.
Acts,2,4,And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.
Acts,2,5,"Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven."
Acts,2,6,"And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one was hearing them speak in his own language."
Acts,2,7,"And they were amazed and astonished, saying, ""Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?"
Acts,2,8,"And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language?"
Acts,2,9,"Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,"
Acts,2,10,"Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome,"
Acts,2,11,"both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians--we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God."""
Acts,2,12,"And all were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, ""What does this mean?"""
Acts,2,13,"But others mocking said, ""They are filled with new wine."""
Acts,2,14,"But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them, ""Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words."
Acts,2,15,"For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day."
Acts,2,16,But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel:
Acts,2,17,"""'And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;"
Acts,2,18,"even on my male servants and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy."
Acts,2,19,"And I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke;"
Acts,2,20,"the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day."
Acts,2,21,And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.'
Acts,2,22,"""Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know--"
Acts,2,23,"this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men."
Acts,2,24,"God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it."
Acts,2,25,"For David says concerning him, ""'I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;"
Acts,2,26,"therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope."
Acts,2,27,"For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One see corruption."
Acts,2,28,You have made known to me the paths of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.'
Acts,2,29,"""Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day."
Acts,2,30,"Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne,"
Acts,2,31,"he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption."
Acts,2,32,"This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses."
Acts,2,33,"Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing."
Acts,2,34,"For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, ""'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,"
Acts,2,35,until I make your enemies your footstool.'
Acts,2,36,"Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."""
Acts,2,37,"Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, ""Brothers, what shall we do?"""
Acts,2,38,"And Peter said to them, ""Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."
Acts,2,39,"For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself."""
Acts,2,40,"And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, ""Save yourselves from this crooked generation."""
Acts,2,41,"So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls."
Acts,2,42,"And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers."
Acts,2,43,"And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles."
Acts,2,44,And all who believed were together and had all things in common.
Acts,2,45,"And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need."
Acts,2,46,"And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts,"
Acts,2,47,praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.
Acts,3,1,"Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour."
Acts,3,2,"And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple that is called the Beautiful Gate to ask alms of those entering the temple."
Acts,3,3,"Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms."
Acts,3,4,"And Peter directed his gaze at him, as did John, and said, ""Look at us."""
Acts,3,5,"And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them."
Acts,3,6,"But Peter said, ""I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!"""
Acts,3,7,"And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong."
Acts,3,8,"And leaping up he stood and began to walk, and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God."
Acts,3,9,"And all the people saw him walking and praising God,"
Acts,3,10,"and recognized him as the one who sat at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, asking for alms. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him."
Acts,3,11,"While he clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon's, astounded."
Acts,3,12,"And when Peter saw it he addressed the people: ""Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we have made him walk?"
Acts,3,13,"The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him."
Acts,3,14,"But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,"
Acts,3,15,"and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses."
Acts,3,16,"And his name--by faith in his name--has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all."
Acts,3,17,"""And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers."
Acts,3,18,"But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled."
Acts,3,19,"Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out,"
Acts,3,20,"that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus,"
Acts,3,21,whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago.
Acts,3,22,"Moses said, 'The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you."
Acts,3,23,And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people.'
Acts,3,24,"And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came after him, also proclaimed these days."
Acts,3,25,"You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, 'And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.'"
Acts,3,26,"God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness."""
Acts,4,1,"And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,"
Acts,4,2,greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
Acts,4,3,"And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening."
Acts,4,4,"But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand."
Acts,4,5,"On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem,"
Acts,4,6,"with Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family."
Acts,4,7,"And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, ""By what power or by what name did you do this?"""
Acts,4,8,"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, ""Rulers of the people and elders,"
Acts,4,9,"if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,"
Acts,4,10,"let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead--by him this man is standing before you well."
Acts,4,11,"This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone."
Acts,4,12,"And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."""
Acts,4,13,"Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they were astonished. And they recognized that they had been with Jesus."
Acts,4,14,"But seeing the man who was healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition."
Acts,4,15,"But when they had commanded them to leave the council, they conferred with one another,"
Acts,4,16,"saying, ""What shall we do with these men? For that a notable sign has been performed through them is evident to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it."
Acts,4,17,"But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name."""
Acts,4,18,So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
Acts,4,19,"But Peter and John answered them, ""Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge,"
Acts,4,20,"for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard."""
Acts,4,21,"And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people, for all were praising God for what had happened."
Acts,4,22,For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old.
Acts,4,23,"When they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them."
Acts,4,24,"And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, ""Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them,"
Acts,4,25,"who through the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by the Holy Spirit, ""'Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples plot in vain?"
Acts,4,26,"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against his Anointed'--"
Acts,4,27,"for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,"
Acts,4,28,to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.
Acts,4,29,"And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness,"
Acts,4,30,"while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus."""
Acts,4,31,"And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness."
Acts,4,32,"Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common."
Acts,4,33,"And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all."
Acts,4,34,"There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold"
Acts,4,35,"and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need."
Acts,4,36,"Thus Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barnabas (which means son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus,"
Acts,4,37,sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.
Acts,5,1,"But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,"
Acts,5,2,and with his wife's knowledge he kept back for himself some of the proceeds and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles' feet.
Acts,5,3,"But Peter said, ""Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land?"
Acts,5,4,"While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God."""
Acts,5,5,"When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last. And great fear came upon all who heard of it."
Acts,5,6,The young men rose and wrapped him up and carried him out and buried him.
Acts,5,7,"After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened."
Acts,5,8,"And Peter said to her, ""Tell me whether you sold the land for so much."" And she said, ""Yes, for so much."""
Acts,5,9,"But Peter said to her, ""How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."""
Acts,5,10,"Immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband."
Acts,5,11,And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things.
Acts,5,12,Now many signs and wonders were regularly done among the people by the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon's Portico.
Acts,5,13,"None of the rest dared join them, but the people held them in high esteem."
Acts,5,14,"And more than ever believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women,"
Acts,5,15,"so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats, that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them."
Acts,5,16,"The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed."
Acts,5,17,"But the high priest rose up, and all who were with him (that is, the party of the Sadducees), and filled with jealousy"
Acts,5,18,they arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison.
Acts,5,19,"But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said,"
Acts,5,20,"""Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life."""
Acts,5,21,"And when they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach.Now when the high priest came, and those who were with him, they called together the council and all the senate of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought."
Acts,5,22,"But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, so they returned and reported,"
Acts,5,23,"""We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them we found no one inside."""
Acts,5,24,"Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them, wondering what this would come to."
Acts,5,25,"And someone came and told them, ""Look! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people."""
Acts,5,26,"Then the captain with the officers went and brought them, but not by force, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people."
Acts,5,27,"And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them,"
Acts,5,28,"saying, ""We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us."""
Acts,5,29,"But Peter and the apostles answered, ""We must obey God rather than men."
Acts,5,30,"The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree."
Acts,5,31,"God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins."
Acts,5,32,"And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."""
Acts,5,33,"When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them."
Acts,5,34,"But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in honor by all the people, stood up and gave orders to put the men outside for a little while."
Acts,5,35,"And he said to them, ""Men of Israel, take care what you are about to do with these men."
Acts,5,36,"For before these days Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing."
Acts,5,37,"After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him. He too perished, and all who followed him were scattered."
Acts,5,38,"So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or this undertaking is of man, it will fail;"
Acts,5,39,"but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You might even be found opposing God!"" So they took his advice,"
Acts,5,40,"and when they had called in the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go."
Acts,5,41,"Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name."
Acts,5,42,"And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ."
Acts,6,1,"Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint by the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution."
Acts,6,2,"And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said, ""It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables."
Acts,6,3,"Therefore, brothers, pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint to this duty."
Acts,6,4,"But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word."""
Acts,6,5,"And what they said pleased the whole gathering, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch."
Acts,6,6,"These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands on them."
Acts,6,7,"And the word of God continued to increase, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith."
Acts,6,8,"And Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people."
Acts,6,9,"Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen."
Acts,6,10,But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.
Acts,6,11,"Then they secretly instigated men who said, ""We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God."""
Acts,6,12,"And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council,"
Acts,6,13,"and they set up false witnesses who said, ""This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law,"
Acts,6,14,"for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us."""
Acts,6,15,"And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel."
Acts,7,1,"And the high priest said, ""Are these things so?"""
Acts,7,2,"And Stephen said:""Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,"
Acts,7,3,"and said to him, 'Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you.'"
Acts,7,4,"Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living."
Acts,7,5,"Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot's length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child."
Acts,7,6,"And God spoke to this effect--that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years."
Acts,7,7,"'But I will judge the nation that they serve,' said God, 'and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.'"
Acts,7,8,"And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs."
Acts,7,9,"""And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him"
Acts,7,10,"and rescued him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household."
Acts,7,11,"Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food."
Acts,7,12,"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers on their first visit."
Acts,7,13,"And on the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh."
Acts,7,14,"And Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in all."
Acts,7,15,"And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, he and our fathers,"
Acts,7,16,and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
Acts,7,17,"""But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt"
Acts,7,18,until there arose over Egypt another king who did not know Joseph.
Acts,7,19,"He dealt shrewdly with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, so that they would not be kept alive."
Acts,7,20,"At this time Moses was born; and he was beautiful in God's sight. And he was brought up for three months in his father's house,"
Acts,7,21,"and when he was exposed, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son."
Acts,7,22,"And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds."
Acts,7,23,"""When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel."
Acts,7,24,"And seeing one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian."
Acts,7,25,"He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand."
Acts,7,26,"And on the following day he appeared to them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, 'Men, you are brothers. Why do you wrong each other?'"
Acts,7,27,"But the man who was wronging his neighbor thrust him aside, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?"
Acts,7,28,Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'
Acts,7,29,"At this retort Moses fled and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons."
Acts,7,30,"""Now when forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush."
Acts,7,31,"When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and as he drew near to look, there came the voice of the Lord:"
Acts,7,32,"'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.' And Moses trembled and did not dare to look."
Acts,7,33,"Then the Lord said to him, 'Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."
Acts,7,34,"I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.'"
Acts,7,35,"""This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'--this man God sent as both ruler and redeemer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush."
Acts,7,36,"This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years."
Acts,7,37,"This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, 'God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers.'"
Acts,7,38,"This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. He received living oracles to give to us."
Acts,7,39,"Our fathers refused to obey him, but thrust him aside, and in their hearts they turned to Egypt,"
Acts,7,40,"saying to Aaron, 'Make for us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'"
Acts,7,41,"And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and were rejoicing in the works of their hands."
Acts,7,42,"But God turned away and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: ""'Did you bring to me slain beasts and sacrifices, during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?"
Acts,7,43,"You took up the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Rephan, the images that you made to worship; and I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.'"
Acts,7,44,"""Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, just as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it, according to the pattern that he had seen."
Acts,7,45,"Our fathers in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our fathers. So it was until the days of David,"
Acts,7,46,who found favor in the sight of God and asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
Acts,7,47,But it was Solomon who built a house for him.
Acts,7,48,"Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made by hands, as the prophet says,"
Acts,7,49,"""'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is the place of my rest?"
Acts,7,50,Did not my hand make all these things?'
Acts,7,51,"""You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you."
Acts,7,52,"Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered,"
Acts,7,53,"you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it."""
Acts,7,54,"Now when they heard these things they were enraged, and they ground their teeth at him."
Acts,7,55,"But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God."
Acts,7,56,"And he said, ""Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God."""
Acts,7,57,But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together at him.
Acts,7,58,Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.
Acts,7,59,"And as they were stoning Stephen, he called out, ""Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."""
Acts,7,60,"And falling to his knees he cried out with a loud voice, ""Lord, do not hold this sin against them."" And when he had said this, he fell asleep."
Acts,8,1,"And Saul approved of his execution.And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles."
Acts,8,2,Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him.
Acts,8,3,"But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison."
Acts,8,4,Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word.
Acts,8,5,Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ.
Acts,8,6,And the crowds with one accord paid attention to what was being said by Philip when they heard him and saw the signs that he did.
Acts,8,7,"For unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, crying with a loud voice, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed."
Acts,8,8,So there was much joy in that city.
Acts,8,9,"But there was a man named Simon, who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was somebody great."
Acts,8,10,"They all paid attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, ""This man is the power of God that is called Great."""
Acts,8,11,And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.
Acts,8,12,"But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women."
Acts,8,13,"Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed."
Acts,8,14,"Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,"
Acts,8,15,"who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,"
Acts,8,16,"for he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
Acts,8,17,Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.
Acts,8,18,"Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,"
Acts,8,19,"saying, ""Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."""
Acts,8,20,"But Peter said to him, ""May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!"
Acts,8,21,"You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God."
Acts,8,22,"Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you."
Acts,8,23,"For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity."""
Acts,8,24,"And Simon answered, ""Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me."""
Acts,8,25,"Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans."
Acts,8,26,"Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, ""Rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza."" This is a desert place."
Acts,8,27,"And he rose and went. And there was an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship"
Acts,8,28,"and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah."
Acts,8,29,"And the Spirit said to Philip, ""Go over and join this chariot."""
Acts,8,30,"So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, ""Do you understand what you are reading?"""
Acts,8,31,"And he said, ""How can I, unless someone guides me?"" And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him."
Acts,8,32,"Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this: ""Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he opens not his mouth."
Acts,8,33,"In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth."""
Acts,8,34,"And the eunuch said to Philip, ""About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?"""
Acts,8,35,"Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus."
Acts,8,36,"And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, ""See, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?"""
Acts,8,37,See Footnote
Acts,8,38,"And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him."
Acts,8,39,"And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing."
Acts,8,40,"But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea."
Acts,9,1,"But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest"
Acts,9,2,"and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem."
Acts,9,3,"Now as he went on his way, he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him."
Acts,9,4,"And falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him, ""Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"""
Acts,9,5,"And he said, ""Who are you, Lord?"" And he said, ""I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting."
Acts,9,6,"But rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do."""
Acts,9,7,"The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one."
Acts,9,8,"Saul rose from the ground, and although his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus."
Acts,9,9,"And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank."
Acts,9,10,"Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, ""Ananias."" And he said, ""Here I am, Lord."""
Acts,9,11,"And the Lord said to him, ""Rise and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying,"
Acts,9,12,"and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight."""
Acts,9,13,"But Ananias answered, ""Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem."
Acts,9,14,"And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name."""
Acts,9,15,"But the Lord said to him, ""Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel."
Acts,9,16,"For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name."""
Acts,9,17,"So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, ""Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."""
Acts,9,18,"And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized;"
Acts,9,19,"and taking food, he was strengthened.For some days he was with the disciples at Damascus."
Acts,9,20,"And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, ""He is the Son of God."""
Acts,9,21,"And all who heard him were amazed and said, ""Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name? And has he not come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests?"""
Acts,9,22,"But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ."
Acts,9,23,"When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,"
Acts,9,24,"but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night in order to kill him,"
Acts,9,25,"but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket."
Acts,9,26,"And when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples. And they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple."
Acts,9,27,"But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus."
Acts,9,28,"So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord."
Acts,9,29,And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists. But they were seeking to kill him.
Acts,9,30,"And when the brothers learned this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus."
Acts,9,31,"So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it multiplied."
Acts,9,32,"Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda."
Acts,9,33,"There he found a man named Aeneas, bedridden for eight years, who was paralyzed."
Acts,9,34,"And Peter said to him, ""Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed."" And immediately he rose."
Acts,9,35,"And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord."
Acts,9,36,"Now there was in Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which, translated, means Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity."
Acts,9,37,"In those days she became ill and died, and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room."
Acts,9,38,"Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, ""Please come to us without delay."""
Acts,9,39,"So Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them."
Acts,9,40,"But Peter put them all outside, and knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body he said, ""Tabitha, arise."" And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up."
Acts,9,41,"And he gave her his hand and raised her up. Then calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive."
Acts,9,42,"And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord."
Acts,9,43,"And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner."
Acts,10,1,"At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort,"
Acts,10,2,"a devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms generously to the people, and prayed continually to God."
Acts,10,3,"About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in and say to him, ""Cornelius."""
Acts,10,4,"And he stared at him in terror and said, ""What is it, Lord?"" And he said to him, ""Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God."
Acts,10,5,And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter.
Acts,10,6,"He is lodging with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside."""
Acts,10,7,"When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him,"
Acts,10,8,"and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa."
Acts,10,9,"The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray."
Acts,10,10,"And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance"
Acts,10,11,"and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth."
Acts,10,12,In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air.
Acts,10,13,"And there came a voice to him: ""Rise, Peter; kill and eat."""
Acts,10,14,"But Peter said, ""By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean."""
Acts,10,15,"And the voice came to him again a second time, ""What God has made clean, do not call common."""
Acts,10,16,"This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven."
Acts,10,17,"Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood at the gate"
Acts,10,18,and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there.
Acts,10,19,"And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, ""Behold, three men are looking for you."
Acts,10,20,"Rise and go down and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them."""
Acts,10,21,"And Peter went down to the men and said, ""I am the one you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?"""
Acts,10,22,"And they said, ""Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say."""
Acts,10,23,"So he invited them in to be his guests.The next day he rose and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him."
Acts,10,24,And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
Acts,10,25,"When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him."
Acts,10,26,"But Peter lifted him up, saying, ""Stand up; I too am a man."""
Acts,10,27,"And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered."
Acts,10,28,"And he said to them, ""You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean."
Acts,10,29,"So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me."""
Acts,10,30,"And Cornelius said, ""Four days ago, about this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing"
Acts,10,31,"and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God."
Acts,10,32,"Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.'"
Acts,10,33,"So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord."""
Acts,10,34,"So Peter opened his mouth and said: ""Truly I understand that God shows no partiality,"
Acts,10,35,but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.
Acts,10,36,"As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all),"
Acts,10,37,"you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed:"
Acts,10,38,"how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him."
Acts,10,39,"And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree,"
Acts,10,40,"but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear,"
Acts,10,41,"not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead."
Acts,10,42,And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.
Acts,10,43,"To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name."""
Acts,10,44,"While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word."
Acts,10,45,"And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles."
Acts,10,46,"For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared,"
Acts,10,47,"""Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?"""
Acts,10,48,And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.
Acts,11,1,Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
Acts,11,2,"So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him, saying,"
Acts,11,3,"""You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them."""
Acts,11,4,But Peter began and explained it to them in order:
Acts,11,5,"""I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me."
Acts,11,6,"Looking at it closely, I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air."
Acts,11,7,"And I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter; kill and eat.'"
Acts,11,8,"But I said, 'By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'"
Acts,11,9,"But the voice answered a second time from heaven, 'What God has made clean, do not call common.'"
Acts,11,10,"This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven."
Acts,11,11,"And behold, at that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesarea."
Acts,11,12,"And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house."
Acts,11,13,"And he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say, 'Send to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter;"
Acts,11,14,"he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.'"
Acts,11,15,"As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning."
Acts,11,16,"And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'"
Acts,11,17,"If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God's way?"""
Acts,11,18,"When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, ""Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life."""
Acts,11,19,"Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews."
Acts,11,20,"But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus."
Acts,11,21,"And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord."
Acts,11,22,"The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch."
Acts,11,23,"When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose,"
Acts,11,24,"for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord."
Acts,11,25,"So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,"
Acts,11,26,"and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians."
Acts,11,27,Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
Acts,11,28,And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world (this took place in the days of Claudius).
Acts,11,29,"So the disciples determined, everyone according to his ability, to send relief to the brothers living in Judea."
Acts,11,30,"And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul."
Acts,12,1,About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church.
Acts,12,2,"He killed James the brother of John with the sword,"
Acts,12,3,"and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread."
Acts,12,4,"And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people."
Acts,12,5,"So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church."
Acts,12,6,"Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison."
Acts,12,7,"And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, ""Get up quickly."" And the chains fell off his hands."
Acts,12,8,"And the angel said to him, ""Dress yourself and put on your sandals."" And he did so. And he said to him, ""Wrap your cloak around you and follow me."""
Acts,12,9,"And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision."
Acts,12,10,"When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them of its own accord, and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel left him."
Acts,12,11,"When Peter came to himself, he said, ""Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting."""
Acts,12,12,"When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying."
Acts,12,13,"And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer."
Acts,12,14,"Recognizing Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and reported that Peter was standing at the gate."
Acts,12,15,"They said to her, ""You are out of your mind."" But she kept insisting that it was so, and they kept saying, ""It is his angel!"""
Acts,12,16,"But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed."
Acts,12,17,"But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, ""Tell these things to James and to the brothers."" Then he departed and went to another place."
Acts,12,18,"Now when day came, there was no little disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter."
Acts,12,19,"And after Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent time there."
Acts,12,20,"Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they came to him with one accord, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food."
Acts,12,21,"On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and delivered an oration to them."
Acts,12,22,"And the people were shouting, ""The voice of a god, and not of a man!"""
Acts,12,23,"Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last."
Acts,12,24,But the word of God increased and multiplied.
Acts,12,25,"And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had completed their service, bringing with them John, whose other name was Mark."
Acts,13,1,"Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a member of the court of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul."
Acts,13,2,"While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, ""Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."""
Acts,13,3,Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.
Acts,13,4,"So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus."
Acts,13,5,"When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John to assist them."
Acts,13,6,"When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus."
Acts,13,7,"He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God."
Acts,13,8,"But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith."
Acts,13,9,"But Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him"
Acts,13,10,"and said, ""You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?"
Acts,13,11,"And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time."" Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand."
Acts,13,12,"Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord."
Acts,13,13,"Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem,"
Acts,13,14,but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.
Acts,13,15,"After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them, saying, ""Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it."""
Acts,13,16,"So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said:""Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen."
Acts,13,17,"The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it."
Acts,13,18,And for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.
Acts,13,19,"And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance."
Acts,13,20,All this took about 450 years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
Acts,13,21,"Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years."
Acts,13,22,"And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, 'I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.'"
Acts,13,23,"Of this man's offspring God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised."
Acts,13,24,"Before his coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel."
Acts,13,25,"And as John was finishing his course, he said, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but behold, after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'"
Acts,13,26,"""Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation."
Acts,13,27,"For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him."
Acts,13,28,"And though they found in him no guilt worthy of death, they asked Pilate to have him executed."
Acts,13,29,"And when they had carried out all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb."
Acts,13,30,"But God raised him from the dead,"
Acts,13,31,"and for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people."
Acts,13,32,"And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers,"
Acts,13,33,"this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm, ""'You are my Son, today I have begotten you.'"
Acts,13,34,"And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way, ""'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'"
Acts,13,35,"Therefore he says also in another psalm, ""'You will not let your Holy One see corruption.'"
Acts,13,36,"For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption,"
Acts,13,37,but he whom God raised up did not see corruption.
Acts,13,38,"Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything"
Acts,13,39,from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.
Acts,13,40,"Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the Prophets should come about:"
Acts,13,41,"""'Look, you scoffers, be astounded and perish; for I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will not believe, even if one tells it to you.'"""
Acts,13,42,"As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told them the next Sabbath."
Acts,13,43,"And after the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who, as they spoke with them, urged them to continue in the grace of God."
Acts,13,44,The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
Acts,13,45,"But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, reviling him."
Acts,13,46,"And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, ""It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it aside and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles."
Acts,13,47,"For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, ""'I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'"""
Acts,13,48,"And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed."
Acts,13,49,And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region.
Acts,13,50,"But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district."
Acts,13,51,But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium.
Acts,13,52,And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
Acts,14,1,Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed.
Acts,14,2,But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.
Acts,14,3,"So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands."
Acts,14,4,But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews and some with the apostles.
Acts,14,5,"When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to mistreat them and to stone them,"
Acts,14,6,"they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding country,"
Acts,14,7,and there they continued to preach the gospel.
Acts,14,8,Now at Lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet. He was crippled from birth and had never walked.
Acts,14,9,"He listened to Paul speaking. And Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well,"
Acts,14,10,"said in a loud voice, ""Stand upright on your feet."" And he sprang up and began walking."
Acts,14,11,"And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, ""The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!"""
Acts,14,12,"Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker."
Acts,14,13,"And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds."
Acts,14,14,"But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd, crying out,"
Acts,14,15,"""Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men, of like nature with you, and we bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them."
Acts,14,16,In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.
Acts,14,17,"Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness."""
Acts,14,18,Even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.
Acts,14,19,"But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead."
Acts,14,20,"But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city, and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe."
Acts,14,21,"When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,"
Acts,14,22,"strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God."
Acts,14,23,"And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed."
Acts,14,24,Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.
Acts,14,25,"And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia,"
Acts,14,26,"and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had fulfilled."
Acts,14,27,"And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles."
Acts,14,28,And they remained no little time with the disciples.
Acts,15,1,"But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, ""Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."""
Acts,15,2,"And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question."
Acts,15,3,"So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the brothers."
Acts,15,4,"When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with them."
Acts,15,5,"But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up and said, ""It is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses."""
Acts,15,6,The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter.
Acts,15,7,"And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, ""Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe."
Acts,15,8,"And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us,"
Acts,15,9,"and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith."
Acts,15,10,"Now, therefore, why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?"
Acts,15,11,"But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will."""
Acts,15,12,"And all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles."
Acts,15,13,"After they finished speaking, James replied, ""Brothers, listen to me."
Acts,15,14,"Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take from them a people for his name."
Acts,15,15,"And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written,"
Acts,15,16,"""'After this I will return, and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will restore it,"
Acts,15,17,"that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord, who makes these things"
Acts,15,18,known from of old.'
Acts,15,19,"Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God,"
Acts,15,20,"but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood."
Acts,15,21,"For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues."""
Acts,15,22,"Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers,"
Acts,15,23,"with the following letter: ""The brothers, both the apostles and the elders, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings."
Acts,15,24,"Since we have heard that some persons have gone out from us and troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions,"
Acts,15,25,"it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,"
Acts,15,26,men who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts,15,27,"We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth."
Acts,15,28,For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements:
Acts,15,29,"that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell."""
Acts,15,30,"So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter."
Acts,15,31,"And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement."
Acts,15,32,"And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words."
Acts,15,33,"And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them."
Acts,15,34,See Footnote
Acts,15,35,"But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also."
Acts,15,36,"And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, ""Let us return and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are."""
Acts,15,37,Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark.
Acts,15,38,But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.
Acts,15,39,"And there arose a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus,"
Acts,15,40,"but Paul chose Silas and departed, having been commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord."
Acts,15,41,"And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches."
Acts,16,1,"Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek."
Acts,16,2,He was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium.
Acts,16,3,"Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek."
Acts,16,4,"As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem."
Acts,16,5,"So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily."
Acts,16,6,"And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia."
Acts,16,7,"And when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them."
Acts,16,8,"So, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas."
Acts,16,9,"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, ""Come over to Macedonia and help us."""
Acts,16,10,"And when Paul had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them."
Acts,16,11,"So, setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis,"
Acts,16,12,"and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days."
Acts,16,13,"And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together."
Acts,16,14,"One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul."
Acts,16,15,"And after she was baptized, and her household as well, she urged us, saying, ""If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay."" And she prevailed upon us."
Acts,16,16,"As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling."
Acts,16,17,"She followed Paul and us, crying out, ""These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation."""
