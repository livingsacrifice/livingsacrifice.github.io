2 Chronicles,1,3,And Solomon and all the assembly [a united nation] with him went to the high place that was at Gibeon for the Tent of Meeting of God which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness was there [where the Canaanites had habitually worshiped].

2 Chronicles,1,6,Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the Lord at the Tent of Meeting and offered 1000 burnt offerings on it.
2 Chronicles,1,7,That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him Ask what I shall give you.
2 Chronicles,1,8,And Solomon said to God You have shown great mercy and loving-kindness to David my father and have made me king in his place.
2 Chronicles,1,9,Now O Lord God let Your promise to David my father be fulfilled for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
2 Chronicles,1,10,Give me now wisdom and knowledge to go out and come in before this people for who can rule this Your people who are so great?
2 Chronicles,1,11,God replied to Solomon Because this was in your heart and you have not asked for riches possessions honor and glory or the life of your foes or even for long life but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may rule and judge My people over whom I have made you king
2 Chronicles,1,12,Wisdom and knowledge are granted you. And I will give you riches possessions honor and glory such as none of the kings had before you and none after you shall have their equal.
2 Chronicles,1,13,Then Solomon came from the high place at Gibeon from before the Tent of Meeting to Jerusalem. And he reigned over Israel.

2 Chronicles,2,5,The house which I am to build is great for our God is greater than all gods.
2 Chronicles,2,6,But who is able to build Him a house since heaven even highest heaven cannot contain Him? Who am I to build Him a house except as a place to burn incense in worship before Him?
2 Chronicles,2,7,Now therefore send a man skilled to work in gold silver bronze and iron and in purple crimson and blue colors who is a trained engraver to work with the skilled men who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem whom David my father provided.
2 Chronicles,2,8,Send me also from Lebanon cedar cypress and algum timber for I know your servants can skillfully cut timber in Lebanon; and my servants will be with your servants

2 Chronicles,5,7,And the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the Lord to its place to the sanctuary of the house into the Holy of Holies under the wings of the cherubim;
2 Chronicles,5,8,For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark making a covering above the ark and its poles.
2 Chronicles,5,9,And they drew out the poles of the ark so that the ends of the poles protruding from the ark were visible from the front of the Holy of Holies but were not visible from without. It is there to this day.
2 Chronicles,5,10,There was nothing in the ark except the two tables [the Ten Commandments] which Moses put in it at Mount Horeb when the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites when they came out of Egypt.
2 Chronicles,5,11,And when the priests had come out of the Holy Place--for all the priests present had sanctified themselves separating themselves from everything that defiles without regard to their divisions;
2 Chronicles,5,12,And all the Levites who were singers--all of those of Asaph Heman and Jeduthun with their sons and kinsmen arrayed in fine linen having cymbals harps and lyres--stood at the east end of the altar and with them 120 priests blowing trumpets;
2 Chronicles,5,13,And when the trumpeters and singers were joined in unison making one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and other instruments for song and praised the Lord saying For He is good for His mercy and loving-kindness endure forever then the house of the Lord was filled with a cloud
2 Chronicles,5,14,So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord filled the house of God.
2 Chronicles,6,1,THEN SOLOMON said The Lord has said that He would dwell in the thick darkness;
2 Chronicles,6,2,I have built You a house [in which the dark Holy of Holies seems] a [fitting] abode for You a place for You to dwell in forever.
2 Chronicles,6,3,And the king turned his face and blessed all the assembly of Israel and they all stood.
2 Chronicles,6,4,And he said Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel Who has fulfilled with His hands what He promised with His mouth to David my father saying
2 Chronicles,6,5,Since the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build a house in that My Name might be there neither chose I any man to be a ruler over My people Israel;
2 Chronicles,6,6,But I have chosen Jerusalem that My Name [and the symbol of My presence] might be there and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.
2 Chronicles,6,7,Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the Name and renown of the Lord the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,6,8,But the Lord said to David my father Since it was in your heart to build a house for My Name and renown you did well that it was in your heart.
2 Chronicles,6,9,Yet you shall not build the house but your son who shall be born to you--he shall build the house for My Name.
2 Chronicles,6,10,The Lord therefore has performed His word that He has spoken for I have risen up in the place of David my father and sit on the throne of Israel as the Lord promised and have built the house for the Name of the Lord the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,6,11,In it have I put the ark [the symbol of His presence] in which is the covenant of the Lord [the Ten Commandments] which He made with the people of Israel.
2 Chronicles,6,12,And Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread forth his hands.
2 Chronicles,6,13,For he had made a bronze scaffold five cubits square and three cubits high and had set it in the midst of the court; upon it he stood and he knelt upon his knees before all the assembly of Israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven
2 Chronicles,6,14,And said O Lord God of Israel there is no God like You in the heavens or in the earth keeping covenant and showing mercy and loving-kindness to Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts
2 Chronicles,6,15,You Who have kept Your promises to my father David and fulfilled with Your hand what You spoke with Your mouth as it is today.
2 Chronicles,6,16,Now therefore O Lord God of Israel keep with Your servant David my father that which You promised him saying There shall not fail a man in My sight to sit on the throne of Israel provided your children are careful to walk in My law as you David have walked before Me.
2 Chronicles,6,17,Now then O Lord God of Israel let Your word to Your servant David be verified.
2 Chronicles,6,18,But will God actually dwell with men on the earth? Behold heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You; how much less this house which I have built!
2 Chronicles,6,19,Yet have respect for the prayer of Your servant and for his supplication O Lord my God to listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant prays before You
2 Chronicles,6,20,That Your eyes may be open upon this house day and night toward the place in which You have said You would put Your Name [and the symbol of your presence] to listen to and heed the prayer which Your servant prays facing this place.
2 Chronicles,6,21,So listen to and heed the requests of Your servant and Your people Israel which they shall make facing this place. Hear from Your dwelling place heaven; and when You hear forgive.
2 Chronicles,6,22,If a man sins against his neighbor and he is required to take an oath and the oath comes before Your altar in this house
2 Chronicles,6,23,Then hear from heaven and do; and judge Your servants requiting the wicked by bringing his conduct upon his own head and justifying the [uncompromisingly] righteous by giving him according to his righteousness (his uprightness and right standing with God).
2 Chronicles,6,24,If Your people Israel have been defeated before the enemy because they have sinned against You and shall return confess Your name [and You Yourself] and pray and make supplication before You in this house
2 Chronicles,6,25,Then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel and bring them again to the land which You gave to them and their fathers.
2 Chronicles,6,26,When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because Your people have sinned against You yet if they pray toward this place confess your name [and You Yourself ] and turn from their sin when You afflict them
2 Chronicles,6,27,Then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants [all of ] Your people Israel when You have taught them the good way in which they should walk. And send rain upon Your land which You have given to Your people for an inheritance.
2 Chronicles,6,28,If there is famine in the land if there is pestilence blight mildew locusts or caterpillars if their enemies besiege them in any of their cities whatever plague or sickness there may be
2 Chronicles,6,29,Then whatever prayer or supplication any man or all of Your people Israel shall make--each knowing his own affliction and his own sorrow and stretching out his hands toward this house--
2 Chronicles,6,30,Then hear from heaven Your dwelling place and forgive and render to every man according to all his ways whose heart You know; for You You only know men's hearts
2 Chronicles,6,31,That they may fear You and walk in Your ways as long as they live in the land which You gave to our fathers.
2 Chronicles,6,32,Also concerning the stranger who is not of Your people Israel but has come from a far country for Your great name's sake and Your mighty power and Your outstretched arm--if he comes and prays toward this house
2 Chronicles,6,33,Hear from heaven from Your dwelling place and do all for which the stranger calls to You that all peoples of the earth may know Your name and fear You [reverently and worshipfully] as do Your people Israel and may know that this house which I have built is called by Your Name.
2 Chronicles,6,34,If Your people go out to war against their enemies by the way that You send them and they pray to You facing this city [Jerusalem] which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your Name
2 Chronicles,6,35,Then hear from heaven their prayer and supplication and maintain their cause.
2 Chronicles,6,36,If they sin against You--for there is no man who does not sin--and You are angry with them and give them to enemies who take them captive to a land far or near;
2 Chronicles,6,37,Yet if they repent in the land to which they have been carried captive and turn and pray there saying We have sinned we have done wrong and have dealt wickedly;
2 Chronicles,6,38,If they return to You with all their heart and soul in the land of their captivity and pray facing their land which You gave to their fathers and toward the city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your Name;
2 Chronicles,6,39,Then hear from heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and supplications and maintain their cause; and forgive Your people who have sinned against You.
2 Chronicles,6,40,Now O my God I beseech You let Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer offered in this temple.
2 Chronicles,6,41,So now arise O Lord God and come into Your resting place You and the ark of Your strength and power. Let Your priests O Lord God be clothed with salvation and let Your saints (Your zealous ones) rejoice in good and in Your goodness.
2 Chronicles,6,42,O Lord God turn not away the face of [me] Your anointed one; [earnestly] remember Your good deeds mercy and steadfast love for David Your servant.
2 Chronicles,7,1,WHEN SOLOMON had finished praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the house.
2 Chronicles,7,2,The priests could not enter the house of the Lord because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's house.
2 Chronicles,7,3,And when all the people of Israel saw how the fire came down and the glory of the Lord upon the house they bowed with their faces upon the pavement and worshiped and praised the Lord saying For He is good for His mercy and loving-kindness endure forever.
2 Chronicles,7,4,Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the Lord.
2 Chronicles,7,5,King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22000 oxen and 120000 sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated God's house.
2 Chronicles,7,6,The priests stood at their posts and the Levites also with instruments of music to the Lord which King David had made to praise and give thanks to the Lord--for His mercy and loving-kindness endure forever--whenever David praised through their ministry; the priests blew trumpets before them and all Israel stood.
2 Chronicles,7,7,Moreover Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the bronze altar which [he] had made was not sufficient to receive the burnt offerings the cereal offerings and the fat.
2 Chronicles,7,8,At that time Solomon held the feast for seven days and all Israel with him a very great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt.
2 Chronicles,7,9,The eighth day they made a solemn assembly for they had kept the dedication of the altar and the feast each for seven days.
2 Chronicles,7,10,And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their homes glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the Lord had shown to David to Solomon and to Israel His people.
2 Chronicles,7,11,Thus Solomon finished the Lord's house and the king's house; all that [he] had planned to do in the Lord's house and his own house he accomplished successfully.
2 Chronicles,7,12,And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night and said to him: I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice.
2 Chronicles,7,13,If I shut up heaven so no rain falls or if I command locusts to devour the land or if I send pestilence among My people
2 Chronicles,7,14,If My people who are called by My name shall humble themselves pray seek crave and require of necessity My face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven forgive their sin and heal their land.
2 Chronicles,7,15,Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to prayer offered in this place.
2 Chronicles,7,16,For I have chosen and sanctified (set apart for holy use) this house that My Name may be here forever and My eyes and My heart will be here perpetually.
2 Chronicles,7,17,As for you [Solomon] if you will walk before me as David your father walked and do all I have commanded you and observe My statutes and My ordinances
2 Chronicles,7,18,Then I will establish the throne of your kingdom as I covenanted with David your father saying There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.
2 Chronicles,7,19,But if you [people] turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you and go and serve other gods and worship them
2 Chronicles,7,20,Then will I pluck [Israel] up by the roots out of My land which I have given [them]; and this house which I have hallowed for My Name will I cast out of My sight and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations.
2 Chronicles,7,21,And this house which was so high shall be an astonishment to everyone passing it and they will say Why has the Lord done thus to this land and to this house?
2 Chronicles,7,22,Then men will say Because they forsook the Lord the God of their fathers Who brought them out of Egypt and they laid hold of other gods and worshiped and served them; therefore has He brought all this evil upon them.
2 Chronicles,8,1,AT THE end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the house of the Lord and his own house
2 Chronicles,8,2,The cities which Huram had given to [him] Solomon rebuilt and fortified and caused the Israelites to dwell there.
2 Chronicles,8,3,And Solomon took Hamath-zobah.
2 Chronicles,8,4,He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all his store cities in Hamath.
2 Chronicles,8,5,Also he built Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon fortified cities with walls gates and bars
2 Chronicles,8,6,And Baalath and all the store cities [he] had and all the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem in Lebanon and in all his dominion.
2 Chronicles,8,7,All the people who were left of the Hittites Amorites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites who were not of Israel
2 Chronicles,8,8,But descendants of those who were left in the land whom the Israelites had not destroyed--of them Solomon made a levy for forced labor to this day.
2 Chronicles,8,9,But of the Israelites Solomon made no slaves for his work; but they were men of war chiefs of his captains and captains of his chariots and horsemen.
2 Chronicles,8,10,These were the chiefs of King Solomon's officers 250 in authority over the people.
2 Chronicles,8,11,Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh out of the City of David into the house he had built for her for he said My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel because the places are holy to which the ark of the Lord has come.
2 Chronicles,8,12,Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the Lord on the Lord's altar which he had built before the [temple] porch or vestibule
2 Chronicles,8,13,A certain number every day offering as Moses commanded for the Sabbaths the New Moons and the solemn feast days three times in the year--the Feasts of Unleavened Bread of Weeks and of Tabernacles.
2 Chronicles,8,14,And he appointed as ordered by David his father the divisions of the priests for their service and the Levites to their offices to praise and to serve before the priests as the duty of every day required and the gatekeepers also by their divisions at every gate; for so had David the man of God commanded.
2 Chronicles,8,15,And they did not turn from the command of the king to the priests and Levites in any respect or concerning the treasuries.
2 Chronicles,8,16,Thus all the work of Solomon was prepared from the day the foundation of the Lord's house was laid until it was finished. So the house of the Lord was completed.
2 Chronicles,8,17,Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the shore of the [Red] Sea in the land of Edom.
2 Chronicles,8,18,And Huram sent him by his servants ships and servants familiar with the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir and took from there 450 talents of gold and brought them to King Solomon.
2 Chronicles,9,1,WHEN THE queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions accompanied by very many attendants and camels bearing spices much gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon she talked with him of all that was on her mind.
2 Chronicles,9,2,And Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from [him] which he was unable to make clear to her.
2 Chronicles,9,3,And when the queen of Sheba had seen Solomon's wisdom the house he had built
2 Chronicles,9,4,The food of his table the seating of his officials the [standing at] attention of his servants their apparel his cupbearers also and their apparel and his burnt offerings which he offered at the house of the Lord there was no more spirit in her.
2 Chronicles,9,5,She said to the king The report which I heard in my own land of your acts and sayings and of your wisdom was true
2 Chronicles,9,6,But I did not believe their words until I came and my eyes had seen it. Behold the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me; you surpass the fame that I heard of you.
2 Chronicles,9,7,Happy are your wives and men and happy are these your servants who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom!
2 Chronicles,9,8,Blessed be the Lord your God Who delighted in you and set you on His throne to be king for the Lord your God! Because your God loved Israel and would establish them forever He made you king over them to do justice and righteousness.
2 Chronicles,9,9,She gave the king 120 talents of gold a very large quantity of spices and precious stones; such spice was not anywhere as that which the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.
2 Chronicles,9,10,The servants of Huram and [those] of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir also brought algum trees and precious stones.
2 Chronicles,9,11,The king made of the algum trees terraces or walks to the house of the Lord and to the king's palace and lyres and harps for the singers; none such had ever been seen before in the land of Judah.
2 Chronicles,9,12,And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire whatever she asked besides what she had brought to the king. So she with her servants returned to her own land.
2 Chronicles,9,13,Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents
2 Chronicles,9,14,Besides what traders and merchants brought; and all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2 Chronicles,9,15,And King Solomon made 200 large shields or bucklers of beaten gold; 600 shekels of beaten gold went into each shield.
2 Chronicles,9,16,And he made 300 shields of beaten gold with 300 shekels of gold spread on each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
2 Chronicles,9,17,Moreover [he] made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold.
2 Chronicles,9,18,There were six steps to the throne and a gold footstool attached to the throne and arms on each side of the seat with two lions standing beside the arms.
2 Chronicles,9,19,And twelve lions stood there one on either end of each of the six steps. The like of it was never made in any kingdom before.
2 Chronicles,9,20,King Solomon's drinking vessels were all of gold and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; silver was not counted as anything in the days of Solomon.
2 Chronicles,9,21,For the king's ships went to Tarshish with Huram's servants; once every three years the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold silver ivory apes and peacocks.
2 Chronicles,9,22,King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
2 Chronicles,9,23,And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom which God had put into his mind.
2 Chronicles,9,24,And every man brought his tribute: silver and gold articles robes armor spices horses and mules so much year by year.
2 Chronicles,9,25,Solomon had 4000 stalls for horses and chariots and 12000 horsemen stationed in chariot cities or at Jerusalem with the king.
2 Chronicles,9,26,And he ruled over all the kings from the [Euphrates] River to the land of Philistia and to the frontier of Egypt.
2 Chronicles,9,27,The king made silver in Jerusalem as common as stones and cedar wood as plentiful as sycamore trees in the lowlands.
2 Chronicles,9,28,And they imported horses for Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.
2 Chronicles,9,29,Now the rest of the acts of Solomon from first to last are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
2 Chronicles,9,30,Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
2 Chronicles,9,31,Then Solomon slept with his fathers; he was buried in the city of David his father. Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles,10,1,REHOBOAM WENT to Shechem for all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king.
2 Chronicles,10,2,Jeroboam the son of Nebat was in Egypt where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon when he heard about the new king; so Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
2 Chronicles,10,3,And the people sent for him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came to Rehoboam saying
2 Chronicles,10,4,Your father [King Solomon] made our yoke grievous. So now make lighter the grievous service of your father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us and we will serve you.
2 Chronicles,10,5,Rehoboam replied Come again to me after three days. And the people departed.
2 Chronicles,10,6,King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men who stood before Solomon his father while he was alive saying What counsel do you give me in reply to the people?
2 Chronicles,10,7,And they answered him If you are kind to [these] people and please them and speak good words to them they will be your servants forever.
2 Chronicles,10,8,But the king forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men who were brought up with him and stood before him.
2 Chronicles,10,9,And he said to them What answer do you advise that we give to the demand of [these] people Make the yoke your father put upon us lighter?
2 Chronicles,10,10,The young men who were brought up with him said to him Tell the people who said to you Your father made our yoke heavy but you make it lighter: My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.
2 Chronicles,10,11,For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips but I will chastise you with scorpions.
2 Chronicles,10,12,The third day Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam as he had said.
2 Chronicles,10,13,And the king answered them harshly forsaking the counsel of the old men
2 Chronicles,10,14,And answered them after the advice of the young men saying My father made your yoke heavy but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips but I will chastise you with scorpions.
2 Chronicles,10,15,So the king did not heed the people for it was brought about of God that the Lord might perform His word which He spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
2 Chronicles,10,16,And when all Israel saw that the king would not listen to and heed them they answered [him] What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to your tents O Israel! Now David [tribe of Judah] see to your own house [under your tyrant King Rehoboam]! So all Israel went to their homes.
2 Chronicles,10,17,But as for the Israelites who dwelt in Judah's cities Rehoboam ruled over them.
2 Chronicles,10,18,Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram who was over the forced labor and the Israelites stoned him and he died. But King Rehoboam hastened to get up to his royal chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,10,19,And Israel has rebelled against the house of David to this day.
2 Chronicles,11,1,AND WHEN Rehoboam came to Jerusalem he assembled of the house of Judah and Benjamin 180000 chosen warriors to fight against [the ten rebellious tribes of] Israel to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
2 Chronicles,11,2,But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah the man of God saying
2 Chronicles,11,3,Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin
2 Chronicles,11,4,Thus says the Lord: You shall not go up or fight against your brethren. Return every man to his house for this thing is from Me. And they obeyed the Lord and returned from going against Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles,11,5,Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem and built cities for defense in Judah.
2 Chronicles,11,6,He built Bethlehem Etam Tekoa
2 Chronicles,11,7,Beth-zur Soco Adullam
2 Chronicles,11,8,Gath Mareshah Ziph
2 Chronicles,11,9,Adoraim Lachish Azekah
2 Chronicles,11,10,Zorah Aijalon and Hebron which are fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.
2 Chronicles,11,11,He fortified the strongholds and put captains in them with stores of food oil and vintage fruits.
2 Chronicles,11,12,And in each city he put shields and spears and made them very strong. So he held Judah and Benjamin.
2 Chronicles,11,13,And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel came over to Rehoboam from wherever they lived.
2 Chronicles,11,14,For the Levites left their suburbs and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them out from executing the priest's office to the Lord.
2 Chronicles,11,15,And he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the [idols of demon] he-goats and calves he had made.
2 Chronicles,11,16,And after them out of all the tribes of Israel there came to Jerusalem those who set their hearts to seek and inquire of the Lord the God of Israel to sacrifice to the Lord the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles,11,17,So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and upheld Rehoboam son of Solomon for three years; for they walked in the ways of David and Solomon for three years.
2 Chronicles,11,18,Rehoboam took as wife Mahalath whose father was Jerimoth son of David; her mother was Abihail daughter of Eliab son of Jesse.
2 Chronicles,11,19,She bore him sons: Jeush Shamariah and Zaham.
2 Chronicles,11,20,And after her he took Maacah daughter [granddaughter] of Absalom who bore him Abijah Attai Ziza and Shelomith.
2 Chronicles,11,21,And Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter [granddaughter] of Absalom more than all his wives and concubines--for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines and he had twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
2 Chronicles,11,22,And Rehoboam made Abijah son of Maacah the chief prince among his brethren for he intended to make him king.
2 Chronicles,11,23,And he dealt understandingly and dispersed his children throughout all Judah and Benjamin to every fortified city. He gave them abundant supplies and he sought many wives for them.
2 Chronicles,12,1,WHEN REHOBOAM had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself he forsook the law of the Lord and all Israel with him.
2 Chronicles,12,2,And in the fifth year of King Rehoboam because they had transgressed and been unfaithful to the Lord Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem
2 Chronicles,12,3,With 1200 chariots and 60000 horsemen and the people were without number who came with him from Egypt--the Libyans Sukkiim and Ethiopians.
2 Chronicles,12,4,And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came on to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,12,5,Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak and said to them Thus says the Lord: You have forsaken Me so I have abandoned you into the hands of Shishak.
2 Chronicles,12,6,Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said The Lord is righteous.
2 Chronicles,12,7,And when the Lord saw that they humbled themselves the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah saying They have humbled themselves so I will not destroy them but I will grant them some deliverance; and My wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
2 Chronicles,12,8,Nevertheless they shall be his servants that they may know [the difference between] My service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
2 Chronicles,12,9,So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem; he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and of the king's house. He took everything. He took away also the shields of gold Solomon had made.
2 Chronicles,12,10,Instead of them King Rehoboam made shields of bronze and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard who kept the door of the king's house.
2 Chronicles,12,11,And whenever the king entered the Lord's house the guards came and got the shields of bronze and brought them again into the guard chamber.
2 Chronicles,12,12,When Rehoboam humbled himself the wrath of the Lord turned from him so as not to destroy him entirely; also in Judah conditions were good.
2 Chronicles,12,13,So King Rehoboam established and strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem the city in which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put His Name [and the symbol of His presence]. His mother was Naamah an Ammonitess.
2 Chronicles,12,14,And he did evil because he did not set his heart to seek (inquire of yearn for) the Lord with all his desire.
2 Chronicles,12,15,Now the acts of Rehoboam from first to last are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer regarding genealogies? There were wars between Rehoboam of Judah and Jeroboam of Israel continually.
2 Chronicles,12,16,And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the City of David; and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles,13,1,IN THE eighteenth year of King Jeroboam Abijah began to reign over Judah.
2 Chronicles,13,2,He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Micaiah daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam of Israel.
2 Chronicles,13,3,And Abijah prepared for battle with an army of valiant men of war 400000 chosen men. Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with 800000 chosen men mighty men of valor.
2 Chronicles,13,4,And Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the hill country of Ephraim and said Hear me O Jeroboam and all Israel!
2 Chronicles,13,5,Ought you not to know that the Lord the God of Israel gave the kingship over Israel to David forever even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
2 Chronicles,13,6,Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat a servant of Solomon son of David rose up and rebelled against his lord [the king].
2 Chronicles,13,7,And there gathered to him worthless men base fellows who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam son of Solomon when Rehoboam was young [as king] irresolute and inexperienced and did not withstand them with firmness and strength.
2 Chronicles,13,8,And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the Lord which is in the hands of the sons of David because you are a great multitude and you have with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made for you for gods.
2 Chronicles,13,9,Have you not driven out the priests of the Lord the sons of Aaron and the Levites and made priests for yourselves like the peoples of other lands? So whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of idols that are not gods.
2 Chronicles,13,10,But as for us the Lord is our God and we have not forsaken Him. We have priests ministering to the Lord who are sons of Aaron and Levites for their service.
2 Chronicles,13,11,They offer to the Lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and incense of sweet spices; they set in order the showbread on the table of pure gold and attend to the golden lampstand that its lamps may be lighted every evening. For we keep the charge of the Lord our God but you have forsaken Him.
2 Chronicles,13,12,Behold God Himself is with us at our head and His priests with their battle trumpets to sound an alarm against you. O Israelites fight not against the Lord the God of your fathers for you cannot prosper.
2 Chronicles,13,13,But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come around them from behind so his troops were before Judah and the ambush behind.
2 Chronicles,13,14,When Judah looked behold the battle was before and behind; and they cried to the Lord and the priests blew the trumpets.
2 Chronicles,13,15,Then the men of Judah gave a shout; and as they shouted God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
2 Chronicles,13,16,And the Israelites fled before Judah and God delivered them into their hands.
2 Chronicles,13,17,And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter so there fell of Israel 500000 chosen men.
2 Chronicles,13,18,Thus the Israelites were brought low at that time and the people of Judah prevailed because they relied upon the Lord the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles,13,19,And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took some cities from him Bethel Jeshanah and Ephraim (Ephron) with their towns.
2 Chronicles,13,20,Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah. And the Lord smote him and he died.
2 Chronicles,13,21,But Abijah became mighty. He married fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
2 Chronicles,13,22,And the rest of the acts of Abijah his ways and his sayings are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.
2 Chronicles,14,1,SO ABIJAH slept with his fathers and they buried him in the City of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was at rest for ten years.
2 Chronicles,14,2,And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God.
2 Chronicles,14,3,He took away the foreign altars and high places and broke down the idol pillars or obelisks and cut down the Asherim [symbols of the goddess Asherah]
2 Chronicles,14,4,And commanded Judah to seek the Lord the God of their fathers [to inquire of and for Him and crave Him as a vital necessity] and to obey the law and the commandment.
2 Chronicles,14,5,Also Asa took out of all the cities of Judah the idolatrous high places and the incense altars. And the kingdom had rest under his reign.
2 Chronicles,14,6,And he built fortified cities in Judah for the land had rest. He had no war in those years for the Lord gave him peace.
2 Chronicles,14,7,Therefore he said to Judah Let us build these cities and surround them with walls towers gates and bars. The land is still ours because we sought the Lord our God; we have sought Him [yearning for Him with all our desire] and He has given us rest and peace on every side. So they built and prospered.
2 Chronicles,14,8,Asa had an army of 300000 men out of Judah who bore bucklers and spears and 280000 out of Benjamin who bore shields and drew bows all mighty men of courage.
2 Chronicles,14,9,There came out against Judah Zerah the Ethiopian with a host of a million [that is too many to be numbered] and 300 chariots and came as far as Mareshah.
2 Chronicles,14,10,Then Asa went out against him and they set up their lines of battle in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
2 Chronicles,14,11,Asa cried to the Lord his God O Lord there is none besides You to help and it makes no difference to You whether the one You help is mighty or powerless. Help us O Lord our God! For we rely on You and we go against this multitude in Your name. O Lord You are our God; let no man prevail against You!
2 Chronicles,14,12,So the Lord smote the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah and the Ethiopians fled.
2 Chronicles,14,13,Asa and the people with him pursued them to Gerar; and the Ethiopians were overthrown so that none remained alive; for they were destroyed before the Lord and His host who carried away very much booty.
2 Chronicles,14,14,And they smote all the cities round about Gerar for the fear of the Lord came upon them. They plundered all the cities for there was much plunder in them.
2 Chronicles,14,15,They smote also the cattle encampments and carried away sheep in abundance and camels; and they returned to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,15,1,THE SPIRIT of God came upon Azariah son of Oded.
2 Chronicles,15,2,And he went out to meet Asa and said to him Hear me Asa and all Judah and Benjamin: the Lord is with you while you are with Him. If you seek Him [inquiring for and of Him craving Him as your soul's first necessity] He will be found by you; but if you [become indifferent and] forsake Him He will forsake you.
2 Chronicles,15,3,Now for a long time Israel was without the true God without a teaching priest and without law.
2 Chronicles,15,4,But when they in their trouble turned to the Lord the God of Israel and [in desperation earnestly] sought Him He was found by them.
2 Chronicles,15,5,And in those times there was no peace to him who went out nor to him who came in but great and vexing afflictions and disturbances were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.
2 Chronicles,15,6,Nation was broke in pieces against nation and city against city for God vexed and troubled them with all sorts of adversity.
2 Chronicles,15,7,Be strong therefore and let not your hands be weak and slack for your work shall be rewarded.
2 Chronicles,15,8,And when Asa heard these words the prophecy of Oded the prophet he took courage and put away the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities which he had taken in the hill country of Ephraim; and he repaired the altar [of burnt offering] of the Lord which was in front of the porch or vestibule [of the house] of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,15,9,And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin and the strangers with them out of Ephraim Manasseh and Simeon for they came over to Asa out of Israel in large numbers when they saw that the Lord his God was with him.
2 Chronicles,15,10,So they gathered at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
2 Chronicles,15,11,And they sacrificed to the Lord on that day from the spoil which they had brought--700 oxen and 7000 sheep.
2 Chronicles,15,12,And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord the God of their fathers and to yearn for Him with all their heart's desire and with all their soul;
2 Chronicles,15,13,And that whoever would not seek the Lord the God of Israel should be put to death whether young or old man or woman.
2 Chronicles,15,14,They took an oath to the Lord with a loud voice with shouting with trumpets and with cornets.
2 Chronicles,15,15,And all Judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him [yearning for Him] with their whole desire and He was found by them. And the Lord gave them rest and peace round about.
2 Chronicles,15,16,Also Maacah King Asa's mother he removed from being queen mother because she had made an abominable image for [the goddess] Asherah. Asa cut down her idol crushed it and burned it at the brook Kidron.
2 Chronicles,15,17,But the high places were not taken out of Israel. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was blameless all his days.
2 Chronicles,15,18,And he brought into the house of God the things that his father [Abijah] had dedicated and those he himself had dedicated--silver and gold and vessels.
2 Chronicles,15,19,And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.
2 Chronicles,16,1,IN THE thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built (fortified) Ramah intending to intercept anyone going out or coming in to Asa king of Judah.
2 Chronicles,16,2,Then Asa brought silver and gold out of the treasuries of the house of the Lord and of the king's house and sent them to Ben-hadad king of Syria who dwelt at Damascus saying
2 Chronicles,16,3,Let there be a league between me and you as was between my father and your father. Behold I am sending you silver and gold; go break your league with Baasha king of Israel that he may withdraw from me.
2 Chronicles,16,4,And Ben-hadad hearkened to King Asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon Dan Abel-maim and all the store cities of Naphtali.
2 Chronicles,16,5,And when Baasha heard it he stopped building Ramah and let his work cease.
2 Chronicles,16,6,Then King Asa took all Judah and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had been building and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.
2 Chronicles,16,7,At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him Because you relied on the king of Syria and not on the Lord your God the army of the king of Syria has escaped you.
2 Chronicles,16,8,Were not the Ethiopians and Libyans a huge host with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied then on the Lord He gave them into your hand.
2 Chronicles,16,9,For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show Himself strong in behalf of those whose hearts are blameless toward Him. You have done foolishly in this; therefore from now on you shall have wars.
2 Chronicles,16,10,Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in prison [in the stocks] for he was enraged with him because of this. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.
2 Chronicles,16,11,The acts of Asa from first to last are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles,16,12,In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet--until his disease became very severe; yet in his disease he did not seek the Lord but relied on the physicians.
2 Chronicles,16,13,And Asa slept with his fathers dying in the forty-first year of his reign.
2 Chronicles,16,14,And they buried him in his own tomb which he had hewn out for himself in the City of David and they laid him on a bier which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds [of spices] prepared by the perfumers' art; and they made a very great burning [of spices] in his honor.
2 Chronicles,17,1,JEHOSHAPHAT HIS son reigned in Asa's stead and strengthened himself against Israel.
2 Chronicles,17,2,And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had taken.
2 Chronicles,17,3,The Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the first ways of his father [David]. He did not seek the Baals
2 Chronicles,17,4,But sought and yearned with all his desire for the Lord the God of his father and walked in His commandments and not after the ways of Israel.
2 Chronicles,17,5,Therefore the Lord established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat and he had great riches and honor.
2 Chronicles,17,6,His heart was cheered and his courage was high in the ways of the Lord; moreover he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.
2 Chronicles,17,7,Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes Ben-hail Obadiah Zechariah Nethanel and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah;
2 Chronicles,17,8,And with them were the Levites--Shemaiah Nethaniah Zebadiah Asahel Shemiramoth Jehonathan Adonijah Tobijah and Tob-adonijah; and with these Levites were the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
2 Chronicles,17,9,And they taught in Judah and had the Book of the Law of the Lord with them; they went about throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.
2 Chronicles,17,10,And a terror from the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.
2 Chronicles,17,11,And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and tribute silver and the Arabs brought him flocks: 7700 each of rams and of he-goats.
2 Chronicles,17,12,And Jehoshaphat became very great. He built in Judah fortresses and store cities
2 Chronicles,17,13,And he had many works in the cities of Judah and soldiers mighty men of courage in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,17,14,This was the number of them by their fathers' houses: Of Judah the captains of thousands: Adnah the chief with 300000 mighty men of valor;
2 Chronicles,17,15,Next to him was Jehohanan the captain with 280000;
2 Chronicles,17,16,And next to him Amasiah son of Zichri who willingly offered himself to the Lord with 200000 mighty men of valor.
2 Chronicles,17,17,Of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor with 200000 men armed with bow and shield;
2 Chronicles,17,18,Next to him was Jehozabad with 180000 armed for war.
2 Chronicles,17,19,These were in the king's service besides those [he] had placed in fortified cities throughout all Judah.
2 Chronicles,18,1,NOW JEHOSHAPHAT had great riches and honor but was allied [by marriage] with Ahab.
2 Chronicles,18,2,After some years he went down to Ahab in Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people with him and persuaded him to go up with him against Ramoth-gilead.
2 Chronicles,18,3,Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead? He answered I am as you are and my people as your people; we will be with you in the war.
2 Chronicles,18,4,And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel Inquire first I pray you for the word of the Lord today.
2 Chronicles,18,5,So King [Ahab] of Israel gathered together the prophets 400 men and said to them Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle or shall I forbear? And they said Go up for God will deliver it into the king's hand.
2 Chronicles,18,6,But Jehoshaphat said Is there not another prophet of the Lord here by whom we may inquire?
2 Chronicles,18,7,King [Ahab] of Israel said to Jehoshaphat There is another man Micaiah son of Imla by whom we may inquire of the Lord but I hate him for he never has prophesied good for me but always evil. And Jehoshaphat said Let not the king say so.
2 Chronicles,18,8,And King [Ahab] of Israel called for one of his officers and said Bring quickly Micaiah son of Imla.
2 Chronicles,18,9,The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat each on his throne arrayed in their robes; they were sitting in an open place [at the threshing floor] at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; all the prophets were prophesying before them.
2 Chronicles,18,10,And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah had made himself horns of iron and said Thus says the Lord: With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.
2 Chronicles,18,11,All the prophets prophesied so saying Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper; the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand.
2 Chronicles,18,12,The messenger who went to call Micaiah said to him Behold the words of the prophets foretell good to the king with one accord. So let your word be like one of them and speak favorably.
2 Chronicles,18,13,But Micaiah said As the Lord lives what my God says that will I speak.
2 Chronicles,18,14,And when he had come to the king King [Ahab] said to him Micaiah shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle or shall I forbear? And he said Go up and prosper and they shall be delivered into your hand.
2 Chronicles,18,15,And the king said to him How many times shall I warn you to tell nothing but the truth to me in the name of the Lord?
2 Chronicles,18,16,Then Micaiah said I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd and the Lord said These have no master. Let each return to his house in peace.
2 Chronicles,18,17,And King [Ahab] of Israel said to Jehoshaphat Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good to me but evil?
2 Chronicles,18,18,[Micaiah] said Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on His throne and all the host of heaven standing at His right hand and His left.
2 Chronicles,18,19,And the Lord said Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said this thing and another that.
2 Chronicles,18,20,Then there came a spirit and stood before the Lord and said I will entice him. The Lord said to him By what means?
2 Chronicles,18,21,And he said I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets. And the Lord said You shall entice him and also succeed. Go forth and do so.

2 Chronicles,22,10,But when Athaliah mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the royal family of Judah.
2 Chronicles,22,11,But Jehosheba the daughter of the king took Joash [infant] son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king's sons who were to be slain and she put him and his nurse in a bedchamber.

2 Chronicles,23,7,And the Levites shall surround the young king every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes into the house [breaking through the ranks of the guard to get near Joash] shall be put to death. But you be with the king when he comes in [from the temple chamber where he is hiding] and when he goes out.
2 Chronicles,23,8,So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest had commanded; and took every man his men who were to resume duty on the Sabbath with those who were to go out on the Sabbath for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss the divisions [of priests and Levites].
2 Chronicles,23,9,Also Jehoiada the priest gave the captains of hundreds spears bucklers and shields that had been King David's which were in the house of God.
2 Chronicles,23,10,And he set all the people as a guard for the king every man having his weapon (missile) in his hand from the right side to the left side of the temple around the altar and the temple.

Athaliah rent her clothes and cried Treason! Treason!
2 Chronicles,23,14,Then Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were over the army Bring her out between the ranks and whoever follows her let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said Do not slay her in the Lord's house.
2 Chronicles,23,15,So they made way for Athaliah and she went into the entrance of the Horse Gate of the king's house; there they slew her.
2 Chronicles,23,16,Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself all the people and the king that they should be the Lord's people.
2 Chronicles,23,17,Then all the people went to the house of Baal tore it down and broke its altars and its images in pieces and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
2 Chronicles,23,18,Also Jehoiada appointed the offices and officers [for the care] of the house of the Lord under the direction of the Levitical priests whom David had distributed [in his day] in the house of the Lord to offer the burnt offerings of the Lord as written in the Law of Moses with rejoicing and singing as ordered by David.

2 Chronicles,23,21,So all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been slain with the sword.
2 Chronicles,24,1,JOASH WAS seven years old when he began his forty-year reign in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah of Beersheba.
2 Chronicles,24,2,And Joash did what was right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada the priest [his uncle].
2 Chronicles,24,3,And Jehoiada took for him two wives and he had sons and daughters.
2 Chronicles,24,4,After this Joash decided to repair the Lord's house.
2 Chronicles,24,5,He gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them Go out to the cities of Judah and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year; and see that you hasten the matter. But the Levites did not hasten it.
2 Chronicles,24,6,So the king called for Jehoiada the high priest and said to him Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax authorized by Moses the servant of the Lord and of the assembly of Israel for the Tent of the Testimony?
2 Chronicles,24,7,For the sons of Athaliah that wicked woman had broken into the house of God and also had used for the Baals all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,24,8,And at the king's command they made a chest and set it outside the gate of the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,24,9,And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem to bring in for the Lord the tax that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.
2 Chronicles,24,10,And all the princes and people rejoiced and brought their tax and dropped it into the chest until they had finished.
2 Chronicles,24,11,When the Levites brought the chest to the king's office and whenever they saw that there was much money the king's secretary and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day and collected money in abundance.
2 Chronicles,24,12,And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the temple service; and they hired masons and carpenters and also those who worked in iron and bronze to repair the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,24,13,So the workmen labored and the work of repairing went forward in their hands; and they set up the house of God according to its design and strengthened it.
2 Chronicles,24,14,When they had finished it they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; from it were made utensils for the Lord's house vessels for ministering and for offerings and cups and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the Lord continually all the days of Jehoiada.
2 Chronicles,24,15,But Jehoiada became old and full of [the handicaps of great] age and he died. He was 130 years old at his death.
2 Chronicles,24,16,They buried him in the City of David among the kings because he had done good in Israel and toward God and His house.
2 Chronicles,24,17,Now after the death of Jehoiada [the priest who had hidden Joash] the princes of Judah came and made obeisance to King Joash; then the king hearkened to them.
2 Chronicles,24,18,They forsook the house of the Lord the God of their fathers and served the Asherim and idols; and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for their sin (guilt).
2 Chronicles,24,19,Yet [God] sent prophets to them to bring them again to the Lord; these testified against them but they would not listen.
2 Chronicles,24,20,Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest who stood over the people and he said to them Thus says God: Why do you transgress the commandments of the Lord so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the Lord He also has forsaken you.
2 Chronicles,24,21,They conspired against Zechariah the priest and stoned him at the command of the king in the court of the Lord's house!
2 Chronicles,24,22,Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada Zechariah's father had done him but slew his son. And when [Zechariah the priest] was dying he said May the Lord see and avenge!
2 Chronicles,24,23,At the end of the year the army of Syria came up against Joash. They came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the princes from among the people and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus.
2 Chronicles,24,24,Though the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men the Lord delivered a very great host into their hands because Joash and Judah had forsaken the Lord the God of their fathers. So the Syrians executed judgment against Joash.
2 Chronicles,24,25,And when they had departed from Joash leaving him very ill his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest and they slew him on his bed. So he died and they buried him in the City of David but not in the tombs of the kings.
2 Chronicles,24,26,The conspirators against Joash were Zabad son of Shimeath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabitess.
2 Chronicles,24,27,Now concerning his sons and the greatness of the prophecies uttered against him and the rebuilding of the house of God they are written in the commentary on the Book of Kings. And Amaziah his [Joash's] son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles,25,1,AMAZIAH WAS twenty-five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,25,2,He did right in the Lord's sight but not with a perfect or blameless heart.
2 Chronicles,25,3,When his kingdom was firmly established he slew his servants who had killed the king his father.
2 Chronicles,25,4,But he did not slay their children; he did as it is written in the Law in the Book of Moses where the Lord commanded The fathers shall not die for the children or the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.
2 Chronicles,25,5,Amaziah assembled the men of Judah and set them by fathers' houses under commanders of thousands and of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He numbered them from twenty years old and over and found them to be 300000 choice men fit for war and able to handle spear and shield.
2 Chronicles,25,6,He hired also 100000 mighty men of valor from Israel for 100 talents of silver.
2 Chronicles,25,7,But a man of God came to him saying O king do not let all this army of Ephraimites of Israel go with you [of Judah] for the Lord is not with you
2 Chronicles,25,8,For if you go [in spite of warning] no matter how strong you are for battle God will cast you down before the enemy for God has power to help and to cast down.
2 Chronicles,25,9,And Amaziah said to the man of God But what shall we do about the 100 talents which I have given to the army of Israel? The man of God answered The Lord is able to give you much more than this.
2 Chronicles,25,10,So Amaziah discharged the army that came to him from Ephraim to go home. So their anger was greatly kindled against Judah; they returned home in fierce wrath.
2 Chronicles,25,11,And Amaziah took courage and led forth his people to the Valley of Salt and smote 10000 of the men of Seir [Edom].
2 Chronicles,25,12,Another 10000 the men of Judah captured alive and brought them to the top of a crag and cast them down from it and they were all dashed to pieces.
2 Chronicles,25,13,But the soldiers of the band which Amaziah sent back not allowing them to go with him to battle fell upon the cities of Judah from Samaria even to Beth-horon and smote 3000 [men] and took much spoil.
2 Chronicles,25,14,After Amaziah came back from the slaughter of the Edomites he brought their gods and set them up to be his gods and bowed before them and burned incense to them.
2 Chronicles,25,15,So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Amaziah and He sent to him a prophet who said Why have you sought after the gods of the people which could not deliver their own people out of your hand?
2 Chronicles,25,16,As he was talking the king said to him Have we made you the king's counselor? Stop it! Why should you be put to death? The prophet stopped but said I know that God has determined to destroy you because you have done this and ignored my counsel.
2 Chronicles,25,17,Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu king of Israel saying Come [to battle] let us look one another in the face.
2 Chronicles,25,18,Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah saying A little thistle in Lebanon sent to a great cedar in Lebanon saying Give your daughter to my son as wife. And a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle.
2 Chronicles,25,19,You say See [I] have smitten Edom! Your heart lifts you up to boast. Stay at home; why should you meddle [and court disaster] so you will fall and Judah with you?
2 Chronicles,25,20,But Amaziah would not hear for it came from God that He might deliver Judah into the hands of their enemies because they sought after the gods of Edom.
2 Chronicles,25,21,So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at Beth-shemesh of Judah.
2 Chronicles,25,22,And Judah was defeated before Israel and they fled every man to his tent.
2 Chronicles,25,23,And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz at Beth-shemesh and brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate 400 cubits.
2 Chronicles,25,24,And he took all the gold the silver and all the vessels found in God's house with [the doorkeeper] Obed-edom and the treasures of the king's house and hostages also and returned to Samaria.

2 Chronicles,25,28,And they brought him upon horses and buried him with his fathers in the City of [David in] Judah.

2 Chronicles,26,10,Also he built towers in the wilderness and hewed out many cisterns for he had much livestock both in the lowlands and in the tableland. And he had farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile fields [of Carmel] for he loved farming.

2 Chronicles,26,15,In Jerusalem he made machines invented by skillful men to be on the towers and the [corner] bulwarks with which to shoot arrows and great stones. And his fame spread far for he was marvelously helped till he was strong.
2 Chronicles,26,16,But when [King Uzziah] was strong he became proud to his destruction; and he trespassed against the Lord his God for he went into the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense.
2 Chronicles,26,17,And Azariah the priest went in after him and with him eighty priests of the Lord men of courage.
2 Chronicles,26,18,They opposed King Uzziah and said to him It is not for you Uzziah to burn incense to the Lord but for the priests the sons of Aaron who are set apart to burn incense. Withdraw from the sanctuary; you have trespassed and that will not be to your credit and honor before the Lord God.
2 Chronicles,26,19,Then Uzziah was enraged and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense. And while he was enraged with the priests leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord beside the incense altar.

2 Chronicles,27,6,So Jotham grew mighty for he ordered his ways in the sight of the Lord his God.
2 Chronicles,27,7,Now the rest of Jotham's acts and all his wars and his ways behold they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
2 Chronicles,27,8,He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

2 Chronicles,28,3,And he burned incense in the Valley of Ben-hinnom [son of Hinnom] and burned his sons as an offering after the abominable customs of the [heathen] nations whom the Lord drove out before the Israelites.
2 Chronicles,28,4,He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places on the hills and under every green tree.
2 Chronicles,28,5,Therefore the Lord his God gave Ahaz into the power of the king of Syria who defeated him and carried away a great multitude of the Jews as captives taking them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hands of the king of Israel who smote Judah with a great slaughter.

2 Chronicles,28,10,And now you intend to suppress the people of Judah and Jerusalem both men and women as your slaves. But are not you yourselves guilty of crimes against the Lord your God?
2 Chronicles,28,11,Now hear me therefore and set the prisoners free again whom you have taken captive of your kinsmen for the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon you.
2 Chronicles,28,12,Then certain of the heads of the Ephraimites [Israel]--Azariah son of Johanan Berechiah son of Meshillemoth Jehizkiah son of Shallum and Amasa son of Hadlai--stood up against those returning from the war
2 Chronicles,28,13,And said You shall not bring the captives in here; we are guilty before the Lord already and what you intend will add more to our sins and our guilt. For our trespass (guilt) is great and there is fierce anger against Israel.
2 Chronicles,28,14,So the armed men [of Israel] left the captives and the spoil [of Judah] before the princes and all the assembly.
2 Chronicles,28,15,And the men who have been mentioned by name rose up and took the captives and with the spoil they clothed all who were naked among them; and having clothed them shod them given them food and drink anointed them [as was a host's duty] and carried all the feeble of them upon donkeys they brought them to Jericho the City of Palm Trees to their brethren.

2 Chronicles,28,20,So Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came to him and distressed him without strengthening him.
2 Chronicles,28,21,For Ahaz took [treasure] from the house of the Lord and out of the house of the king and from the princes and gave it as tribute to the king of Assyria but it did not help Ahaz.
2 Chronicles,28,22,In the time of his distress he became still more unfaithful to the Lord--this same King Ahaz.
2 Chronicles,28,23,For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him for he said Since the gods of the kings of Syria helped them I will sacrifice to them that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel.

2 Chronicles,29,5,And said to them Levites hear me! Now sanctify (purify and make free from sin) yourselves and the house of the Lord the God of your fathers and carry out the filth from the Holy Place.
2 Chronicles,29,6,For our fathers have trespassed and have done what was evil in the sight of the Lord our God and they have forsaken Him and have turned away their faces from the dwelling place of the Lord and have turned their backs.
2 Chronicles,29,7,Also they have closed the doors of the porch and put out the lamps and they have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the place holy to the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,29,8,Therefore the wrath of the Lord was upon Judah and Jerusalem and He has delivered them to be a terror and a cause of trembling to be an astonishment and a hissing as you see with your own eyes.
2 Chronicles,29,9,For behold our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.

2 Chronicles,29,16,The priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord to cleanse it and brought out all the uncleanness they found in the temple of the Lord into the court of the Lord's house. And the Levites carried it out to the brook Kidron.
2 Chronicles,29,17,They began on the first day of the first month and on the eighth day they came to the porch of the Lord. Then for eight days they sanctified the house of the Lord and on the sixteenth day they finished.
2 Chronicles,29,18,Then they went to King Hezekiah and said We have cleansed all the house of the Lord and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils and the showbread table with all its utensils.
2 Chronicles,29,19,Moreover all the utensils which King Ahaz in his reign cast away when he was transgressing [faithless] we have made ready and sanctified; and behold they are before the altar of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,29,20,Then King Hezekiah rose early and gathered the officials of the city and went up to the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,29,21,They brought seven each of bulls rams lambs and he-goats for a sin offering for the kingdom the sanctuary and Judah. He commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the Lord's altar.
2 Chronicles,29,22,So they killed the bulls and the priests received the blood and dashed it against the altar. Likewise when they had killed the rams and then the lambs they dashed the blood against the altar.
2 Chronicles,29,23,Then the he-goats for the sin offering were brought before the king and the assembly and they laid their hands on them.
2 Chronicles,29,24,The priests killed them and made a sin offering with their blood upon the altar to make atonement for all Israel for the king commanded that the burnt offering and sin offering be made for all Israel.
2 Chronicles,29,25,Hezekiah stationed the Levites in the Lord's house with cymbals harps and lyres as David [his forefather] and Gad the king's seer and Nathan the prophet had commanded; for the commandment was from the Lord through His prophets.
2 Chronicles,29,26,The Levites stood with the instruments of David and the priests with the trumpets.
2 Chronicles,29,27,Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began the song of the Lord began also with the trumpets and with the instruments ordained by King David of Israel.
2 Chronicles,29,28,And all the congregation worshiped the singers sang and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.
2 Chronicles,29,29,When they had stopped offering the king and all present with him bowed themselves and worshiped.
2 Chronicles,29,30,Also King Hezekiah and the princes ordered the Levites to sing praises to the Lord with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness and bowed themselves and worshiped.
2 Chronicles,29,31,Then Hezekiah said Now you have consecrated yourselves to the Lord; come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the Lord. And the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.
2 Chronicles,29,32,And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was 70 bulls 100 rams and 200 lambs. All these were for a burnt offering to the Lord.
2 Chronicles,29,33,And the consecrated things were 600 oxen and 3000 sheep.
2 Chronicles,29,34,But the priests were too few and could not skin all the burnt offerings. So until the other priests had sanctified themselves their Levite kinsmen helped them until the work was done for the Levites were more upright in heart than the priests in sanctifying themselves.
2 Chronicles,29,35,Also the burnt offerings were in abundance with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the Lord's house was set in order.
2 Chronicles,29,36,Thus Hezekiah rejoiced and all the people because of what God had prepared for the people for it was done suddenly.
2 Chronicles,30,1,HEZEKIAH SENT to all Israel [as well as] Judah and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh to come to the Lord's house at Jerusalem to keep the Passover to the Lord the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,30,2,For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem took counsel to keep the Passover in the second month.
2 Chronicles,30,3,For they could not keep it at the set time because not enough priests had sanctified themselves neither had the people assembled in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,30,4,The new time pleased the king and all the assembly.
2 Chronicles,30,5,So they decreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel from Beersheba to Dan that the people should come to keep the Passover to the Lord the God of Israel at Jerusalem. For they had not kept it collectively as prescribed for a long time.
2 Chronicles,30,6,So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah as the king commanded saying O Israelites return to the Lord the God of Abraham Isaac and Israel that He may return to those left of you who escaped out of the hands of the kings of Assyria.
2 Chronicles,30,7,Do not be like your fathers and brethren who were unfaithful to the Lord the God of their fathers so that He gave them up to desolation [to be an astonishment] as you see.
2 Chronicles,30,8,Now be not stiff-necked as your fathers were but yield yourselves to the Lord and come to His sanctuary which He has sanctified forever and serve the Lord your God that His fierce anger may turn away from you.
2 Chronicles,30,9,For if you return to the Lord your brethren and your children shall find compassion with their captors and return to this land. For the Lord your God is gracious and merciful and He will not turn away His face from you if you return to Him.
2 Chronicles,30,10,So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even to Zebulun but the people laughed them to scorn and mocked them.
2 Chronicles,30,11,Yet a few of Asher Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,30,12,Also the hand of God came upon Judah to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,30,13,And many people came to Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month a very great assembly.
2 Chronicles,30,14,They rose up and took away the altars [to idols] that were in Jerusalem and all the altars and utensils for incense [to the gods] they took away and threw into the Kidron Valley [dumping place for the ashes of such abominations].
2 Chronicles,30,15,Then they killed the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were ashamed and sanctified themselves and brought burnt offerings to the Lord's house.
2 Chronicles,30,16,They stood in their accustomed places as directed in the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests threw [against the altar] the blood they received from the hand of the Levites.
2 Chronicles,30,17,For many were in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves [become clean and free from all sin]. So the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all who were not clean in order to make them holy to the Lord.
2 Chronicles,30,18,For a multitude of the people many from Ephraim Manasseh Issachar and Zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet they ate the Passover otherwise than Moses directed. For Hezekiah had prayed for them saying May the good Lord pardon everyone
2 Chronicles,30,19,Who sets his heart to seek and yearn for God--the Lord the God of his fathers--even though not complying with the purification regulations of the sanctuary.
2 Chronicles,30,20,And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah and healed the people.
2 Chronicles,30,21,And the Israelites who were in Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy. The Levites and priests praised the Lord day by day singing with instruments of much volume to the Lord.
2 Chronicles,30,22,Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who had good understanding in the Lord's work. So the people ate the seven-day appointed feast offering peace offerings making confession [and giving thanks] to the Lord the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles,30,23,And the whole assembly took counsel to prolong the feast another seven days; and they kept it another seven days with joy.
2 Chronicles,30,24,For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly 1000 young bulls and 7000 sheep and the princes gave 1000 young bulls and 10000 sheep. And a great number of priests sanctified themselves [for service].
2 Chronicles,30,25,All the assembly of Judah with the priests the Levites and all the assembly who with the sojourners came from the land of Israel to dwell in Judah rejoiced.
2 Chronicles,30,26,So there was great joy in Jerusalem for since the time of Solomon son of David king of Israel there was nothing like this in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,30,27,Then the priests and Levites arose and blessed the people; and their voice was heard and their prayer came up to [God's] holy habitation in heaven.
2 Chronicles,31,1,NOW WHEN all this was finished all Israel present there went out to the cities of Judah and broke in pieces the pillars or obelisks cut down the Asherim and threw down the high places [of idolatry] and the altars in all Judah and Benjamin in Ephraim and Manasseh until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the Israelites returned to their own cities every man to his possession.
2 Chronicles,31,2,And Hezekiah appointed the priests and the Levites after their divisions each man according to his service the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings to minister to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the camp of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,31,3,King Hezekiah's personal contribution was for the burnt offerings: [those] of morning and evening for the Sabbaths for the New Moons and for the appointed feasts as written in the Law of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,31,4,He commanded the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and Levites that they might [be free to] give themselves to the Law of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,31,5,As soon as the command went abroad the Israelites gave in abundance the firstfruits of grain vintage fruit oil honey and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything.
2 Chronicles,31,6,The people of Israel and Judah who lived in Judah's cities also brought the tithe of cattle and sheep and of the dedicated things which were consecrated to the Lord their God and they laid them in heaps.
2 Chronicles,31,7,In the third month [at the end of wheat harvest] they began to lay the foundation or beginning of the heaps and finished them in the seventh month.
2 Chronicles,31,8,When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps they blessed the Lord and His people Israel.
2 Chronicles,31,9,Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and Levites about the heaps.
2 Chronicles,31,10,Azariah the high priest of the house of Zadok answered him Since the people began to bring the offerings into the Lord's house we have eaten and have plenty left for the Lord has blessed His people and what is left is this great store.
2 Chronicles,31,11,Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare chambers [for storage] in the house of the Lord and they prepared them
2 Chronicles,31,12,And brought in the offerings tithes and dedicated things faithfully. Conaniah the Levite was in charge of them and Shimei his brother came next.
2 Chronicles,31,13,And Jehiel Azaziah Nahath Asahel Jerimoth Jozabad Eliel Ismachiah Mahath and Benaiah were overseers directed by Conaniah and Shimei his brother at the appointment of King Hezekiah and Azariah the chief officer of the house of God.
2 Chronicles,31,14,Kore son of Imnah the Levite keeper of the East Gate was over the freewill offerings to God to apportion the contributions of the Lord and the most holy things.
2 Chronicles,31,15,Under him were Eden Miniamin Jeshua Shemaiah Amariah and Shecaniah in the priests' cities in their office of trust faithfully to give to their brethren by divisions to great and small alike
2 Chronicles,31,16,Except those [Levites] registered as males from three years old and upward--who were consecrated to the temple service [in Jerusalem for their daily portion] as the duty of every day required for their service according to their offices by their divisions.
2 Chronicles,31,17,The registration of the priests was according to their fathers' houses; that of the Levites from twenty years old and upward was according to their offices by their divisions;
2 Chronicles,31,18,Also there was the registration of all their little ones their wives and their older sons and daughters through all the congregation. For in their office of trust they cleansed themselves and set themselves apart in holiness.
2 Chronicles,31,19,Also for the sons of Aaron the priests who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities or in every city there were men who were mentioned by name to give portions to all the males among the priests and to all who were registered among the Levites.
2 Chronicles,31,20,Hezekiah did this throughout all Judah and he did what was good right and faithful before the Lord his God.
2 Chronicles,31,21,And every work that he began in the service of the house of God in keeping with the law and the commandments to seek his God [inquiring of and yearning for Him] he did with all his heart and he prospered.
2 Chronicles,32,1,AFTER THESE things and this loyalty Sennacherib king of Assyria came invaded Judah and encamped against the fortified cities thinking to take them.
2 Chronicles,32,2,When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and intended to fight against Jerusalem
2 Chronicles,32,3,He decided with his officers and his mighty men to stop up the waters of the fountains which were outside the city [by enclosing them with masonry and concealing them] and they helped him.
2 Chronicles,32,4,So many people gathered and they stopped up all the springs and the brook which flowed through the land saying Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?
2 Chronicles,32,5,Also Hezekiah took courage and built up all the wall that was broken and raised towers upon it and he built another wall outside and strengthened the Millo in the City of David and made weapons and shields in abundance.
2 Chronicles,32,6,And he set captains of war over the people and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city and spoke encouragingly to them saying
2 Chronicles,32,7,Be strong and courageous. Be not afraid or dismayed before the king of Assyria and all the horde that is with him for there is Another with us greater than [all those] with him.
2 Chronicles,32,8,With him is an arm of flesh but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles. And the people relied on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
2 Chronicles,32,9,And this Sennacherib king of Assyria while he himself with all his forces was before Lachish sent his servants to Jerusalem to Hezekiah king of Judah and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem saying
2 Chronicles,32,10,Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria: On what do you trust that you remain in the strongholds in Jerusalem?
2 Chronicles,32,11,Is not Hezekiah leading you on in order to let you die by famine and thirst saying The Lord our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
2 Chronicles,32,12,Has not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem You shall worship before one altar and burn incense upon it?
2 Chronicles,32,13,Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands in any way able to deliver their lands out of my hand?
2 Chronicles,32,14,Who among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed was able to deliver his people out of my hand that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
2 Chronicles,32,15,So now do not let Hezekiah deceive or mislead you in this way and do not believe him for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand!
2 Chronicles,32,16,And his servants said still more against the Lord God and against His servant Hezekiah.
2 Chronicles,32,17,The Assyrian king also wrote letters insulting the Lord the God of Israel and speaking against Him saying As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of my hand so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver His people out of my hand.
2 Chronicles,32,18,And they shouted it loudly in the Jewish language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall to frighten and terrify them that they might take the city.
2 Chronicles,32,19,And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as they spoke of the gods of the peoples of the earth which are the work of the hands of men.
2 Chronicles,32,20,For this cause Hezekiah the king and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed and cried to heaven.
2 Chronicles,32,21,And the Lord sent an angel who cut off all the mighty warriors and commanders and officers in the camp of the king of Assyria. So the Assyrian king returned with shamed face to his own land. And when he came into the house of his god they who were his own offspring slew him there with the sword.
2 Chronicles,32,22,Thus the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and from the hand of all his enemies and He guided them on every side.
2 Chronicles,32,23,And many brought gifts to Jerusalem to the Lord and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah; so from then on he was magnified in the sight of all nations.
2 Chronicles,32,24,In those days Hezekiah was sick to the point of death; and he prayed to the Lord and He answered him and gave him a sign.
2 Chronicles,32,25,But Hezekiah did not make return [to the Lord] according to the benefit done to him for his heart became proud [at such a spectacular response to his prayer]; therefore there was wrath upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,32,26,But Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
2 Chronicles,32,27,And Hezekiah had very great wealth and honor and he made for himself treasuries for silver gold precious stones spices shields and all kinds of attractive vessels
2 Chronicles,32,28,Storehouses also for the increase of grain vintage fruits and oil and stalls for all kinds of cattle and sheepfolds.
2 Chronicles,32,29,Moreover he provided for himself cities and flocks and herds in abundance for God had given him very great possessions.
2 Chronicles,32,30,This same Hezekiah also closed the upper springs of Gihon and directed the waters down to the west side of the City of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
2 Chronicles,32,31,And so in the matter of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon who were sent to him to inquire about the wonder that was done in the land God left him to himself to try him that He might know all that was in his heart.
2 Chronicles,32,32,Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his good deeds behold they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz and in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles,32,33,And Hezekiah slept with his fathers and was buried in the ascent of the tombs of the descendants of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles,33,1,MANASSEH WAS twelve years old when he began to reign and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,33,2,But he did evil in the Lord's sight like the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord drove out before the Israelites.
2 Chronicles,33,3,For he built again the [idolatrous] high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down and he reared altars for the Baals and made the Asherim and worshiped all the hosts of the heavens and served them.
2 Chronicles,33,4,Also he built [heathen] altars in the Lord's house of which the Lord had said In Jerusalem shall My Name be forever.
2 Chronicles,33,5,He built altars for all the hosts of the heavens in the two courts of the Lord's house.
2 Chronicles,33,6,And he burned his children as an offering [to his god] in the Valley of Ben-hinnom [son of Hinnom] and practiced soothsaying augury and sorcery and dealt with mediums and wizards. He did much evil in the sight of the Lord provoking Him to anger.
2 Chronicles,33,7,And he set a carved image the idol which he had made in the house of God of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son In this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel will I put My Name [and Presence] forever;
2 Chronicles,33,8,And I will no more remove Israel from the land which I appointed for your fathers if they will only take heed to do all that I have commanded them the whole law the statutes and the ordinances given through Moses.
2 Chronicles,33,9,So Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the heathen whom the Lord had destroyed before the Israelites.
2 Chronicles,33,10,The Lord spoke to Manasseh and to his people but they would not hearken.
2 Chronicles,33,11,So the Lord brought against them the commanders of the host of the king of Assyria who took Manasseh with hooks and in fetters and brought him to Babylon.
2 Chronicles,33,12,When he was in affliction he besought the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
2 Chronicles,33,13,He prayed to Him and God entreated by him heard his supplication and brought him again to Jerusalem to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord is God.
2 Chronicles,33,14,And he built an outer wall to the City of David west of Gihon in the valley to the entrance of the Fish Gate and ran it around Ophel raising it to a very great height; and he put commanders of the army in all the fortified cities of Judah.
2 Chronicles,33,15,And he took away the foreign gods and the idol out of the house of the Lord and all the altars that he had built on the mount of the house of the Lord and in Jerusalem; and he cast them out of the city.
2 Chronicles,33,16,And he restored the Lord's altar and sacrificed on it offerings of peace and of thanksgiving; and he commanded Judah to serve the Lord the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,33,17,Yet the people still sacrificed in the high places but only to the Lord their God.
2 Chronicles,33,18,Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and his prayer to his God and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the Lord the God of Israel behold they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel.
2 Chronicles,33,19,His prayer and how God heard him and all his sins and unfaithfulness and the sites on which he built high places and set up the Asherim and graven images before he humbled himself behold they are written in the Chronicles of the Seers.
2 Chronicles,33,20,So Manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in his own house [garden]. And Amon his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles,33,21,Amon was twenty-two years old when he began his two-year reign in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,33,22,But he did evil in the sight of the Lord as did Manasseh his father; for Amon sacrificed to all the images which Manasseh his father had made and served them
2 Chronicles,33,23,And he did not humble himself before the Lord as Manasseh his father [finally] did; but Amon trespassed and became more and more guilty.
2 Chronicles,33,24,And his servants conspired against him and killed him in his own house.
2 Chronicles,33,25,But the people of the land slew all those who had conspired against King Amon and they made Josiah his son king in his stead.
2 Chronicles,34,1,JOSIAH WAS eight years old when he began his thirty-one-year reign in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,34,2,He did right in the sight of the Lord and walked in the ways of David his father [forefather] and turned aside neither to the right hand nor to the left.
2 Chronicles,34,3,For in the eighth year of his reign while he was yet young [sixteen] he began to seek after and yearn for the God of David his father [forefather]; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places the Asherim and the carved and molten images.
2 Chronicles,34,4,They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence; the sun-images that were high above them he hewed down; the Asherim and the graven images and the molten images he broke in pieces and made dust of them and strewed it upon the graves of those who sacrificed to them.
2 Chronicles,34,5,Josiah burned the bones of the [idolatrous] priests upon their altars and so cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,34,6,So he did in the cities of Manasseh Ephraim and Simeon even to Naphtali in their ruins round about [with their axes]
2 Chronicles,34,7,He broke down the altars and the Asherim and beat the graven images into powder and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,34,8,In the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign when he had purged the land and the [Lord's] house he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah and Maaseiah governor of the city and Joah son of Joahaz the recorder to repair the house of the Lord his God.
2 Chronicles,34,9,When they came to Hilkiah the high priest they delivered the money that had been brought into the house of God which the Levites who kept the doors had collected from Manasseh Ephraim all the remnant of Israel and from all Judah Benjamin and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,34,10,They delivered it to the workmen who had oversight of the Lord's house who gave it to repair and restore the temple:
2 Chronicles,34,11,To the carpenters and builders to buy hewn stone and timber for couplings and beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed [by neglect].
2 Chronicles,34,12,The men did the work faithfully. Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah Levites of the sons of Merari and Zechariah and Meshullam of the sons of the Kohathites. The Levites--all who were skillful with instruments of music--
2 Chronicles,34,13,Also had oversight of the burden bearers and all who did work in any kind of service; and some of the Levites were scribes officials and gatekeepers.
2 Chronicles,34,14,When they were bringing out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the Lord given by Moses.
2 Chronicles,34,15,Hilkiah told Shaphan the scribe I have found the Book of the Law in the Lord's house. And [he] gave the book to Shaphan.
2 Chronicles,34,16,Shaphan took the book to King Josiah but [first] reported to him All that was committed to your servants they are doing.
2 Chronicles,34,17,They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of the Lord and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen.
2 Chronicles,34,18,Then Shaphan the scribe said to the king Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
2 Chronicles,34,19,When King Josiah had heard the words of the Law he rent his clothes.
2 Chronicles,34,20,And the king commanded Hilkiah Ahikam son of Shaphan Abdon son of Micah Shaphan the scribe and Asaiah a servant of the king saying
2 Chronicles,34,21,Go inquire of the Lord for me and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah about the words of the book that is found. For great is the Lord's wrath that is poured out on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord to do according to all that is written in this book.
2 Chronicles,34,22,And Hilkiah and they whom the king had appointed went to Huldah the prophetess the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath the son of Hasrah keeper of the wardrobe. She dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter. They spoke to her to that effect.
2 Chronicles,34,23,And she answered them Thus says the Lord the God of Israel: Tell the man who sent you to me
2 Chronicles,34,24,Thus says the Lord: Behold I will bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.
2 Chronicles,34,25,Because they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore My wrath shall be poured out upon this place and shall not be quenched.
2 Chronicles,34,26,But say to King Josiah of Judah who sent you to inquire of the Lord Thus says the Lord the God of Israel concerning the words which you have heard:
2 Chronicles,34,27,Because your heart was tender and penitent and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and its inhabitants and humbled yourself before Me and rent your clothes and wept before Me I have heard you says the Lord.
2 Chronicles,34,28,Behold I will gather you to your fathers and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace and your eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this place and its inhabitants. So they brought the king word again.
2 Chronicles,34,29,Then King Josiah sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,34,30,And [he] went up into the house of the Lord as did all the men of Judah the inhabitants of Jerusalem the priests the Levites and all the people great and small; and he [the king] read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant that was found in the Lord's house.
2 Chronicles,34,31,Then the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the Lord--to walk after the Lord and to keep His commandments His testimonies and His statutes with all his heart and with all his soul to perform the words of the covenant that are written in this book.
2 Chronicles,34,32,And he caused all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand in confirmation of it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles,34,33,Josiah removed all the [idolatrous] abominations from all the territory that belonged to the Israelites and made all who were in Israel serve the Lord their God. All his days they did not turn from following the Lord the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles,35,1,JOSIAH KEPT the Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem; they killed the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month.
2 Chronicles,35,2,He appointed the priests to their positions and encouraged them in the service of the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,35,3,To the Levites who taught all Israel and were holy to the Lord he said: Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon son of David king of Israel built; it shall no longer be a burden carried on your shoulders. Now serve the Lord your God and His people Israel.
2 Chronicles,35,4,Prepare yourselves according to your fathers' houses by your divisions after the directions of David king of Israel and of Solomon his son.
2 Chronicles,35,5,And stand in the holy court of the priests according to the sections of the fathers' families of your kinsmen the common people and let there be a section of the Levites [to attend] to each division of the families of the people.
2 Chronicles,35,6,Kill the Passover lambs and sanctify yourselves and prepare for your brethren to do according to the word of the Lord by Moses.
2 Chronicles,35,7,Then Josiah contributed to the lay people lambs and kids of the flock as Passover offerings for all who were present to the number of 30000 and 3000 young bulls--all from the king's possessions.
2 Chronicles,35,8,And his princes gave for a freewill offering to the people to the priests and the Levites. Hilkiah Zechariah and Jehiel chief officers of God's house gave the priests for the Passover offerings 2600 [lambs and kids] and 300 bulls.
2 Chronicles,35,9,Conaniah also and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brothers and Hashabiah Jeiel and Jozabad chiefs of the Levites gave to the Levites for Passover offerings 5000 [lambs and kids] and 500 bulls.
2 Chronicles,35,10,When the service was ready the priests stood in their place and the Levites in their divisions as the king commanded.
2 Chronicles,35,11,They killed the Passover lambs and the priests sprinkled the blood they received from the Levites who skinned the animals.
2 Chronicles,35,12,Then they removed the burnt offerings that they might distribute them according to the divisions of the lay families to offer to the Lord as directed in the Book of Moses. And so they did with the bulls.
2 Chronicles,35,13,And they roasted the Passover lambs with fire according to the ordinance; and they cooked the holy offerings in pots in caldrons and in pans and carried them quickly to all the people.
2 Chronicles,35,14,Afterward [the Levites] prepared for themselves and the priests because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy in offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night; so the Levites prepared for themselves and also for the priests the sons of Aaron.
2 Chronicles,35,15,The singers the sons of Asaph were in their places according to the command of David Asaph Heman and Jeduthun the king's seer. And the gatekeepers were at every gate; they did not need to leave their service for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
2 Chronicles,35,16,So all the Lord's service was prepared the same day to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the Lord's altar as King Josiah commanded.
2 Chronicles,35,17,And the Israelites who were present kept the Passover at that time and the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
2 Chronicles,35,18,No Passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet even by any of the kings of Israel as was kept by Josiah and the priests the Levites and all Judah and Israel who were present and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,35,19,In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.
2 Chronicles,35,20,After all this when Josiah had prepared the temple Neco king of Egypt went out to fight against Carchemish on the Euphrates and Josiah went out against him.
2 Chronicles,35,21,But [Neco] sent ambassadors to [Josiah] saying What have I to do with you you king of Judah? I come not against you this day but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to make haste. Refrain from opposing God Who is with me lest He destroy you.
2 Chronicles,35,22,Yet Josiah would not turn away from him but disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not heed the words of Neco from the mouth of God but came to fight with him in the valley of Megiddo.
2 Chronicles,35,23,And the archers shot King Josiah and the king said to his servants Take me away for I am severely wounded.
2 Chronicles,35,24,So his servants took him out of the chariot and put him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
2 Chronicles,35,25,Jeremiah gave a lament for Josiah and all the singing men and women have spoken of Josiah in their laments to this day. They made them an ordinance in Israel; behold they are written in the Laments.
2 Chronicles,35,26,Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his deeds according to what is written in the Law of the Lord
2 Chronicles,35,27,And his acts from first to last behold they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
2 Chronicles,36,1,THEN THE people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,36,2,Jehoahaz was [then] twenty-three years old; he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,36,3,Then the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
2 Chronicles,36,4,And the king of Egypt made Eliakim Jehoahaz' brother king over Judah and Jerusalem and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Jehoahaz his brother and carried him to Egypt.
2 Chronicles,36,5,Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. He did evil in the sight of the Lord his God.
2 Chronicles,36,6,Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and bound him in fetters to take him to Babylon.
2 Chronicles,36,7,Nebuchadnezzar also took some of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon and put them in his temple or palace there.
2 Chronicles,36,8,Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and the abominations which he did and what was found against him behold they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles,36,9,Jehoiachin was eight[een] years old then; he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did evil in the Lord's sight.
2 Chronicles,36,10,In the spring King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon with the precious vessels of the house of the Lord and made Zedekiah the [boy's] brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,36,11,Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,36,12,He did evil in the sight of the Lord his God and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet who spoke at the dictation of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,36,13,He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar who made him swear by God. He stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the Lord the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,36,14,Also all the chiefs of the priests and the people trespassed greatly in accord with all the abominations of the heathen and they polluted the house of the Lord which He had hallowed in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,36,15,And the Lord the God of their fathers sent to them persistently by His messengers because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place.
2 Chronicles,36,16,But they kept mocking the messengers of God and despising His words and scoffing at His prophets till the wrath of the Lord rose against His people till there was no remedy or healing.
2 Chronicles,36,17,Therefore He brought against them the king of the Chaldeans who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion on young man or virgin old man or hoary-headed; He gave them all into his hand.
2 Chronicles,36,18,And all the vessels of the house of God great and small and the treasures of the Lord's house of the king and of his princes all these he brought to Babylon.
2 Chronicles,36,19,And they burned God's house and broke down Jerusalem's wall and burned all its palaces with fire and destroyed all its choice vessels.
2 Chronicles,36,20,Those who had escaped from the sword he took away to Babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the kingdom of Persia was established there
2 Chronicles,36,21,To fulfill the Lord's word by Jeremiah till the land had enjoyed its sabbaths; for as long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath to fulfill seventy years.
2 Chronicles,36,22,Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing:
2 Chronicles,36,23,Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth the Lord the God of heaven has given me and He has charged me to build Him a house in Jerusalem which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all His people may the Lord his God be with him and let him go up [to Jerusalem].
Ezra,1,1,NOW IN the first year of Cyrus king of Persia [almost seventy years after the first Jewish captives were taken to Babylon] that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might begin to be accomplished the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing:
Ezra,1,2,Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: The Lord the God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and He has charged me to build Him a house at Jerusalem in Judah.
Ezra,1,3,Whoever is among you of all His people may his God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem in Judah and re build the house of the Lord the God of Israel in Jerusalem; He is God.
Ezra,1,4,And in any place where a survivor [of the Babylonian captivity of the Jews] sojourns let the men of that place assist him with silver and gold with goods and beasts besides freewill offerings for the house of God in Jerusalem.
Ezra,1,5,Then rose up the heads of the fathers' houses of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and Levites with all those whose spirits God had stirred up to go up to re build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem.
Ezra,1,6,And all those who were around them aided them with vessels of silver with gold goods beasts and precious things besides all that was willingly and freely offered.
Ezra,1,7,Also Cyrus the king brought out the vessels of the house of the Lord which Nebuchadnezzar had brought from Jerusalem [when he took that city] and had put in the house of his gods.
Ezra,1,8,These Cyrus king of Persia directed Mithredath the treasurer to bring forth and count out to Sheshbazzar [who is Zerubbabel recognized as the legitimate heir to the throne of David] the prince of Judah.
Ezra,1,9,And they numbered: 30 basins of gold; 1000 basins of silver; 29 sacrificial dishes;
Ezra,1,10,Of gold bowls 30; another sort of silver bowl 410; and other vessels 1000.
Ezra,1,11,All the vessels of gold and of silver were 5400. All these Sheshbazzar [the governor] brought with the people of the captivity from Babylon to Jerusalem.
Ezra,2,1,NOW THESE are the people of the province [of Judah] who went up out of the captivity of those exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon but who came again to Jerusalem and Judah everyone to his own city.

Ezra,2,61,And of the sons of the priests: the sons of Habaiah of Hakkoz and of Barzillai who had taken a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the [noted] Gileadite and had assumed their name.
Ezra,2,62,These sought their names among those enrolled in the genealogies but they were not found; so they were excluded from the priesthood as [ceremonially] unclean.
Ezra,2,63,[Zerubbabel] the governor told them they should not eat of the most holy things [the priests' food] until there should be a priest with Urim and Thummim [who by consulting these articles in his breastplate could know God's will in the matter].

Ezra,3,1,WHEN THE seventh month came and the Israelites were in the towns the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem.
Ezra,3,2,Then stood up Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brethren the priests and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his brethren and they built the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings upon it as it is written in the instructions of Moses the man of God.
Ezra,3,3,And they set the altar [in its place] upon its base for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the countries; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the Lord morning and evening.
Ezra,3,4,They kept also the Feast of Tabernacles as it is written and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the ordinances as each day's duty required
Ezra,3,5,And after that the continual burnt offering the offering at the New Moon and at all the appointed feasts of the Lord and the offerings of everyone who made a freewill offering to the Lord.
Ezra,3,6,From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the Lord but the foundation of the temple of the Lord was not yet laid.
Ezra,3,7,They gave money also to the masons and to the carpenters and gave food drink and oil to the Sidonians and the Tyrians to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the seaport of Joppa according to the grant they had from Cyrus king of Persia.
Ezra,3,8,In the second year of their coming to God's house at Jerusalem in the second month Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak made a beginning with the rest of their brethren--the priests and Levites and all who had come to Jerusalem out of the captivity. They appointed the Levites from twenty years old and upward to oversee the work of the Lord's house.
Ezra,3,9,Then Jeshua with his sons and his kinsmen Kadmiel and his sons sons of Judah together took the oversight of the workmen in the house of God--the sons of Henadad with their sons and Levite kinsmen.
Ezra,3,10,And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord the priests stood in their vestments with trumpets and the Levite sons of Asaph with their cymbals to praise the Lord after the order of David king of Israel.
Ezra,3,11,They sang responsively praising and giving thanks to the Lord saying For He is good for His mercy and loving-kindness endure forever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the Lord because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid!
Ezra,3,12,But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' houses old men who had seen the first house [Solomon's temple] when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice though many shouted aloud for joy.
Ezra,3,13,So the people could not distinguish the shout of joy from the sound of the weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the sound was heard far off.
Ezra,4,1,NOW WHEN [the Samaritans] the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles from the captivity were building a temple to the Lord the God of Israel
Ezra,4,2,They came to Zerubbabel [now governor] and to the heads of the fathers' houses and said Let us build with you for we seek and worship your God as you do and we have sacrificed to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria who brought us here.
Ezra,4,3,But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of fathers' houses of Israel said to them You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves will together build to the Lord the God of Israel as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.
Ezra,4,4,Then [the Samaritans] the people of the land [continually] weakened the hands of the people of Judah and troubled and terrified them in building
Ezra,4,5,And hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose and plans all the days of Cyrus king of Persia even until the reign of Darius [II] king of Persia.
Ezra,4,6,And in the reign of Ahasuerus [or Xerxes] in the beginning of his reign [the Samaritans] wrote to him an accusation against the [returned] inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
Ezra,4,7,Later in the days of King Artaxerxes Bishlam Mithredath Tabeel and the rest of their associates wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the letter was written in the Syrian or Aramaic script and interpreted in that language.
Ezra,4,8,Rehum the [Persian] commander [of the Samaritans] and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king of this sort--
Ezra,4,9,Then wrote Rehum the [Persian] commander Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their associates--the Dinaites the Apharsathchites the Tarpelites the Apharsites the Archevites the Babylonians the Susanchites the Dehaites the Elamites
Ezra,4,10,And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar deported and settled in the city of Samaria and the rest of the country beyond [west of] the Euphrates River and so forth.
Ezra,4,11,This is a copy of the letter which they sent to King Artaxerxes: Your servants the men beyond [that is west of] the River [Euphrates] and so forth.
Ezra,4,12,Be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from you to us have come to Jerusalem. This rebellious and bad city they are rebuilding and have restored its walls and repaired the foundations.
Ezra,4,13,Be it known now to the king that if this city is rebuilt and the walls finished then they will not pay tribute custom or toll and the royal revenue will be diminished.
Ezra,4,14,Now because we eat the salt of the king's palace and it is not proper for us to witness the king's discredit therefore we send to inform the king
Ezra,4,15,In order that a search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers in which you will learn that this is a rebellious city hurtful to kings and provinces and that sedition was stirred up in it of old. That is why [it] was laid waste.
Ezra,4,16,We declare to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls finished it will mean that you will have no portion on this side of the [Euphrates] River.
Ezra,4,17,Then the king sent an answer: To Rehum the [Persian] official to Shimshai the scribe to the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria and in the rest of the country beyond the River: Greetings.
Ezra,4,18,The letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me.
Ezra,4,19,I commanded and search has been made and it is found that this city [Jerusalem] of old time has made insurrection against kings and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it.
Ezra,4,20,There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem who have ruled over all countries beyond [west of] the [Euphrates] River and tribute custom and toll were paid to them.
Ezra,4,21,Therefore give a decree to make these men stop that this city not be rebuilt until a command is given by me.
Ezra,4,22,Be sure that you do this. Why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
Ezra,4,23,When the copy of King Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum Shimshai the scribe and their companions they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews and by force and power made them cease.
Ezra,4,24,Then the work on the house of God in Jerusalem stopped. It stopped until the second year of Darius [I] king of Persia.
Ezra,5,1,NOW THE prophets Haggai and Zechariah son [grandson] of Iddo prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel Whose [Spirit] was upon them.
Ezra,5,2,Then rose up Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel [heir to the throne of Judah] and Jeshua son of Jozadak and began to build the house of God in Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God [Haggai and Zechariah] helping them.
Ezra,5,3,Then Tattenai governor on the west side of the [Euphrates] River and Shethar-bozenai and their companions came to them and said Who authorized you to build this house and to restore this wall?
Ezra,5,4,Then we told them [in reply] the names of the men who were building this building.
Ezra,5,5,But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews so the enemy could not make them stop until the matter came before Darius [I] and an answer was returned by letter concerning it.
Ezra,5,6,This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai governor on this side of the River and Shethar-bozenai and his associates the Apharsachites who were on this [west] side of the River sent to Darius [I] the king.
Ezra,5,7,They wrote: To Darius the king: All peace.
Ezra,5,8,Be it known to the king that we went to the province of Judah to the house of the great God. It is being built with huge stones with timber laid in the walls; this work goes on with diligence and care and prospers in their hands.
Ezra,5,9,Then we asked those elders Who authorized you to build this house and restore these walls?
Ezra,5,10,We asked their names also that we might record the names of the men at their head and notify you.
Ezra,5,11,They replied We are servants of the God of heaven and earth rebuilding the house which was erected and finished many years ago by a great king of Israel.
Ezra,5,12,But after our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon the Chaldean who destroyed this house and carried the people away into Babylon.
Ezra,5,13,But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon the same King Cyrus made a decree to rebuild this house of God.
Ezra,5,14,And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon and delivered to a man named Sheshbazzar whom he had made governor.
Ezra,5,15,And King Cyrus said to him Go take these vessels to Jerusalem and carry them into the temple and let the house of God be built upon its site.
Ezra,5,16,Then came this Sheshbazzar and laid the foundation of the house of God in Jerusalem; and since that time until now it has been in the process of being rebuilt and is not completed yet.
Ezra,5,17,So now if it seems good to the king let a search be made in the royal archives there in Babylon to see if it is true that King Cyrus issued a decree to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send us his pleasure in this matter.
Ezra,6,1,THEN KING Darius [I] decreed and a search was made in Babylonia in the house where the treasured records were stored.
Ezra,6,2,And at Ecbatana in the capital in the province of Media a scroll was found on which this was recorded:
Ezra,6,3,In the first year of King Cyrus [he] made a decree: Concerning the house of God in Jerusalem let the house the place where they offer sacrifices be built and let its foundations be strongly laid its height and its breadth each 60 cubits
Ezra,6,4,With three courses of great stones and one course of new timber. Let the cost be paid from the royal treasury.
Ezra,6,5,Also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon be restored and brought back to the temple in Jerusalem each put in its place in the house of God.
Ezra,6,6,Now therefore Tattenai governor of the province [west of] the River Shethar-bozenai and your associates the Apharsachites who are [west of] the River keep far away from there.
Ezra,6,7,Leave the work on this house of God alone; let the governor and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its site.
Ezra,6,8,Moreover I make a decree as to what you shall do for these elders of the Jews for the rebuilding of this house of God: the cost is to be paid in full to these men at once from the king's revenue the tribute of the province [west of] the River that they may not be hindered.
Ezra,6,9,And all they need including young bulls rams and lambs for the burnt offerings to the God of heaven and wheat salt wine and oil according to the word of the priests at Jerusalem let it be given them each day without fail
Ezra,6,10,That they may offer pleasing sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
Ezra,6,11,Also I make a decree that whoever shall change or infringe on this order let a beam be pulled from his house and erected; then let him be fastened to it and let his house be made a dunghill for this.
Ezra,6,12,May the God Who has caused His Name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples who put forth their hands to alter this or to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I Darius make a decree; let it be executed speedily and exactly.
Ezra,6,13,Then Tattenai governor of the province this side of the River with Shethar-bozenai and their associates diligently did what King Darius had decreed.
Ezra,6,14,And the elders of the Jews built and prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo. They finished their building as commanded by the God of Israel and by decree of Cyrus and Darius and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
Ezra,6,15,And this house was finished on the third day of the month of Adar in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
Ezra,6,16,And the Israelites--the priests the Levites and the rest of the returned exiles--celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy.
Ezra,6,17,They offered at the dedication of this house of God 100 young bulls 200 rams 400 lambs and for a sin offering for all Israel 12 he-goats according to the number of Israel's tribes.
Ezra,6,18,And they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their courses for the service of God at Jerusalem as it is written in the Book of Moses.
Ezra,6,19,The returned exiles kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
Ezra,6,20,For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were clean. So they killed the Passover lamb for all the returned exiles for their brother priests and for themselves.
Ezra,6,21,It was eaten by the Israelites who had returned from exile and by all who had joined them and separated themselves from the pollutions of the peoples of the land to seek the Lord the God of Israel.
Ezra,6,22,They kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with joy for the Lord had made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria [referring to Darius king of Persia] to them so that he strengthened their hands in the work of the house of God the God of Israel.
Ezra,7,1,NOW AFTER this in the reign of Artaxerxes [son of Xerxes or Ahasuerus] king of Persia Ezra son of Seraiah the son of Azariah the son of Hilkiah
Ezra,7,2,The son of Shallum the son of Zadok the son of Ahitub
Ezra,7,3,The son of Amariah the son of Azariah the son of Meraioth
Ezra,7,4,The son of Zerahiah the son of Uzzi the son of Bukki
Ezra,7,5,The son of Abishua the son of Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the chief priest--
Ezra,7,6,This Ezra went up from Babylon. He was a skilled scribe in the five books of Moses which the Lord the God of Israel had given. And the king granted him all he asked for the hand of the Lord his God was upon him.
Ezra,7,7,And also some of the Israelites with some of the priests and Levites the singers and gatekeepers and the temple servants went up [from Babylon] to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
Ezra,7,8,Ezra came to Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king.
Ezra,7,9,On the first of the first month he started out from Babylon and on the first of the fifth month he arrived in Jerusalem for upon him was the good hand of his God.
Ezra,7,10,For Ezra had prepared and set his heart to seek the Law of the Lord [to inquire for it and of it to require and yearn for it] and to do and teach in Israel its statutes and its ordinances.
Ezra,7,11,Now this is the copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest the scribe even a scribe [occupied with] the words of the commands of the Lord and of His statutes to Israel:
Ezra,7,12,Artaxerxes king of kings to Ezra the priest scribe of the instructions of the God of heaven: Greetings.
Ezra,7,13,I make a decree that all of the people of Israel and of their priests and Levites in my realm who offer freely to go up to Jerusalem may go with you.
Ezra,7,14,For you are sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem according to the instruction of your God which is in your hand
Ezra,7,15,And to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel Whose dwelling is in Jerusalem
Ezra,7,16,And all the silver and gold that you may find in all the province of Babylonia with the freewill offerings of the people and of the priests offered willingly for the house of their God in Jerusalem.
Ezra,7,17,Therefore you shall with all speed and exactness buy with this money young bulls rams lambs with their cereal offerings and drink offerings and offer them on the altar of the house of your God in Jerusalem.
Ezra,7,18,And whatever shall seem good to you and to your brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold that do after the will of your God.
Ezra,7,19,The vessels also that are given to you for the service of the house of your God those deliver before the God of Jerusalem.
Ezra,7,20,And whatever more shall be needful for the house of your God which you shall have occasion to provide provide it out of the king's treasury.
Ezra,7,21,And I Artaxerxes the king make a decree to all the treasurers in the province beyond the [Euphrates] River that whatever Ezra the priest the scribe of the instructions of the God of heaven shall require of you it shall be done exactly and at once--
Ezra,7,22,Up to 100 talents of silver 100 measures of wheat 100 baths of wine 100 baths of oil and salt not specified.
Ezra,7,23,Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven let it be done diligently and honorably for the house of the God of heaven lest His wrath be against the realm of the king and his sons.
Ezra,7,24,Also we notify you that as to any of the priests and Levites singers gatekeepers temple servants or other servants of this house of God it shall not be lawful to impose tribute custom or toll on them.
Ezra,7,25,You Ezra after the wisdom of your God which is [in His instructions] in your hand set magistrates and judges who may judge all the people [west] of the River; choose those who know the instructions of your God and teach him who does not know them.
Ezra,7,26,And whoever will not do the law of your God and the law of the king let judgment be executed upon him exactly and speedily whether it be unto death or banishment or confiscation of goods or imprisonment.
Ezra,7,27,Blessed be the Lord the God of our fathers [said Ezra] Who put such a thing as this into the king's heart to beautify the house of the Lord in Jerusalem
Ezra,7,28,And Who has extended His mercy and steadfast love to me before the king his counselors and all the king's mighty officers. I was strengthened and encouraged for the hand of the Lord my God was upon me and I gathered together outstanding men of Israel to go with me to Jerusalem.
Ezra,8,1,THESE ARE the heads of their fathers' houses and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylonia in the reign of King Artaxerxes:
Ezra,8,2,Of the sons of Phinehas Gershom; of Ithamar Daniel; of David Hattush
Ezra,8,3,Of the sons of Shecaniah; of the sons of Parosh Zechariah and with him were registered 150 men by genealogy;
Ezra,8,4,Of the sons of Pahath-moab Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah with 200 men;
Ezra,8,5,Of the sons of Zattu Shecaniah son of Jahaziel with 300 men;
Ezra,8,6,Of the sons of Adin Ebed son of Jonathan with 50 men;
Ezra,8,7,Of the sons of Elam Jeshaiah son of Athaliah with 70 men;
Ezra,8,8,Of the sons of Shephatiah Zebadiah son of Michael with 80 men;
Ezra,8,9,Of the sons of Joab Obadiah son of Jehiel with 218 men;
Ezra,8,10,Of the sons of [Bani] Shelomith son of Josiphiah with 160 men;
Ezra,8,11,Of the sons of Bebai Zechariah son of Bebai with 28 men;
Ezra,8,12,Of the sons of Azgad Johanan son of Hakkatan with 110 men;
Ezra,8,13,Of the sons of Adonikam the last to come their names are Eliphelet Jeuel and Shemaiah with 60 men;
Ezra,8,14,Of the sons of Bigvai Uthai and Zabbud [Zaccur] with 70 men.
Ezra,8,15,I [Ezra] gathered them together at the river that runs to Ahava and there we encamped three days. I reviewed the people and the priests and found no Levites.
Ezra,8,16,Then I sent for Eliezer Ariel Shemaiah Elnathan Jarib Elnathan Nathan Zechariah Meshullam who were chief men and also for Joiarib and Elnathanwho were teachers.
Ezra,8,17,And I sent them to Iddo the leading man at the place Casiphia telling them to say to Iddo and his brethren the Nethinim [temple servants] at the place Casiphia Bring to us servants for the house of our God.
Ezra,8,18,And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding of the sons of Mahli son of Levi the son of Israel named Sherebiah with his sons and his kinsmen 18;
Ezra,8,19,And Hashabiah and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari with his kinsmen and their sons 20;
Ezra,8,20,Also 220 of the Nethinim whose forefathers David and the officials had set apart [with their descendants] to attend the Levites. They were all mentioned by name.
Ezra,8,21,Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river Ahava that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from Him a straight and right way for us our little ones and all our possessions.
Ezra,8,22,For I was ashamed to request of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemy along the way because we had told the king The hand of our God is upon all them for good who seek Him but His power and His wrath are against all those who forsake Him.
Ezra,8,23,So we fasted and besought our God for this and He heard our entreaty.
Ezra,8,24,Then I set apart twelve leading priests Sherebiah Hashabiah and ten of their kinsmen
Ezra,8,25,And weighed out to them the silver the gold and the vessels the offering for the house of our God which the king his counselors his lords and all Israel there present had offered.
Ezra,8,26,I weighed into their hands 650 talents of silver and silver vessels valued at 100 talents and 100 talents of gold;
Ezra,8,27,Also 20 basins of gold worth 1000 darics and two vessels of fine bright bronze precious as gold.
Ezra,8,28,And I said to them You are holy to the Lord the vessels are holy also and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the Lord the God of your fathers.
Ezra,8,29,Guard and keep them until you weigh them before the chief priests and Levites and heads of the fathers' houses of Israel in Jerusalem in the chambers of the house of the Lord.
Ezra,8,30,So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver the gold and the vessels to bring them to Jerusalem into the house of our God.
Ezra,8,31,We left the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us and He delivered us from the enemy and those who lay in wait by the way.
Ezra,8,32,And we came to Jerusalem and [had been] there three days.
Ezra,8,33,On the fourth day the silver the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hands of Meremoth the priest son of Uriah and with him was Eleazar son of Phinehas and with them were Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui--the Levites.
Ezra,8,34,Every piece was counted and weighed and all the weight was recorded at once.
Ezra,8,35,Also those returned exiles whose parents had been carried into captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve young bulls for all Israel ninety-six rams seventy-seven lambs and twelve he-goats for a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to the Lord.
Ezra,8,36,And they delivered the king's commissions to the king's lieutenants and to the governors west of the River and they aided the people and God's house.
Ezra,9,1,AFTERWARD THE officials came to me and said The Israelites and the priests and Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands but have committed the abominations of the Canaanites Hittites Perizzites Jebusites Ammonites Moabites Egyptians and Amorites.
Ezra,9,2,For they have taken as wives some of their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy offspring have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands. Indeed the officials and chief men have been foremost in this wicked act and direct violation [of God's will].
Ezra,9,3,When I heard this I rent my undergarment and my mantle I pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled.
Ezra,9,4,Then all those who trembled at the words of the God of Israel because of the offensive violation of His will by the returned exiles gathered around me as I sat astounded until the evening sacrifice.
Ezra,9,5,At the evening sacrifice I arose from my depression and having rent my undergarment and my mantle I fell on my knees and spread out my hands to the Lord my God
Ezra,9,6,Saying O my God I am ashamed and blush to lift my face to You my God for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads and our guilt has mounted to the heavens.
Ezra,9,7,Since the days of our fathers we have been exceedingly guilty; and for our willfulness we our kings and our priests have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands to the sword captivity plundering and utter shame as it is today.
Ezra,9,8,And now for a brief moment grace has been shown us by the Lord our God Who has left us a remnant to escape and has given us a secure hold in His holy place that our God may brighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
Ezra,9,9,For we are bondmen; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage but has extended mercy and steadfast love to us before the kings of Persia to give us some reviving to set up the house of our God to repair its ruins and to give us a wall [of protection] in Judah and Jerusalem.
Ezra,9,10,Now O our God what can we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commands
Ezra,9,11,Which You have commanded by Your servants the prophets saying The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land with the pollutions of the peoples of the lands through their abominations which have filled it from one end to the other with their filthiness.
Ezra,9,12,Therefore do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons; and never seek their peace or prosperity that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it as an inheritance to your children always.
Ezra,9,13,And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt seeing that You our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserved and have given us such a remnant
Ezra,9,14,Shall we break Your commandments again and intermarry with the peoples who practice these abominations? Would You not be angry with us till You had consumed us so that there would be no remnant nor any to escape?
Ezra,9,15,O Lord the God of Israel You are rigidly just and righteous for we are left a remnant that is escaped as it is this day. Behold we are before You in our guilt for none can stand before You because of this.
Ezra,10,1,NOW WHILE Ezra prayed and made confession weeping and casting himself down before the house of God there gathered to him out of Israel a very great assembly of men women and children; for the people wept bitterly.
Ezra,10,2,And Shecaniah [II] son of Jehiel [one of the congregation] of the sons of Elam said to Ezra: We have broken faith and dealt treacherously against our God and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land; yet now there is still hope for Israel in spite of this thing.
Ezra,10,3,Therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the foreign wives and their children according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the command of our God; and let it be done according to the Law.
Ezra,10,4,Arise for it is your duty and we are with you. Be strong and brave and do it.
Ezra,10,5,Then Ezra arose and made the chiefs of the priests the Levites and all Israel swear that they would do as had been said. So they took the oath.
Ezra,10,6,Then Ezra came from before the house of God and went into the lodging place of Jehohanan son of Eliashib [for the night]. There he ate no bread and drank no water for he mourned over the returned exiles' faithlessness [and violation of God's law].
Ezra,10,7,And proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the returned exiles that they should assemble in Jerusalem
Ezra,10,8,And that whoever did not come within three days by order of the officials and the elders all his property should be forfeited and he himself banned from the assembly of the exiles.
Ezra,10,9,Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered at Jerusalem within three days. It was the twentieth day of the ninth month and all the people sat in the open space before the house of God trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain.
Ezra,10,10,And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them You have acted wickedly and broken faith [with God] and have married foreign (heathen) women increasing the guilt of Israel.
Ezra,10,11,So now make confession and give thanks to the Lord the God of your fathers [for not consuming you] and do His will. Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from [your] foreign (heathen) wives.
Ezra,10,12,Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice As you have said so must we do.
Ezra,10,13,But the people are many and it is a time of heavy rain; we cannot stand outside. Nor can this work be done in a day or two for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.
Ezra,10,14,Let our officials stand for the whole assembly; let all in our cities who have foreign wives come by appointment and with each group the elders of that city and its judges until the fierce wrath of our God over this matter is turned away from us.
Ezra,10,15,Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah opposed this and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them.
Ezra,10,16,Then the returned exiles did so. Ezra the priest and certain heads of fathers' houses were selected according to their fathers' houses each of them by name; and they sat down on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter.
Ezra,10,17,And by the first day of the first month they had come to the end of the cases of the men married to foreign wives.
Ezra,10,18,Of the sons of the priests who had married non-Jewish women were found: of the sons of Jeshua [the high priest] son of Jozadak and his brethren: Maaseiah Eliezer Jarib and Gedaliah.
Ezra,10,19,They solemnly vowed to put away their [heathen] wives and being guilty [each] offered a ram of the flock for [his] guilt.
Ezra,10,20,Of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.
Ezra,10,21,Of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah Elijah Shemaiah Jehiel and Uzziah.
Ezra,10,22,Of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai Maaseiah Ishmael Nethanel Jozabad and Elasah.
Ezra,10,23,Of the Levites: Jozabad Shimei Kelaiah (Kelita) Pethahiah Judah and Eliezer.

Nehemiah,1,1,THE WORDS or story of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah: Now in the month of Chislev in the twentieth year [of the Persian king] as I was in the castle of Shushan
Nehemiah,1,2,Hanani one of my kinsmen came with certain men from Judah and I asked them about the surviving Jews who had escaped exile and about Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,1,3,And they said to me The remnant there in the province who escaped exile are in great trouble and reproach; the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its [fortified] gates are destroyed by fire.
Nehemiah,1,4,When I heard this I sat down and wept and mourned for days and fasted and prayed [constantly] before the God of heaven
Nehemiah,1,5,And I said O Lord God of heaven the great and terrible God Who keeps covenant loving-kindness and mercy for those who love Him and keep His commandments
Nehemiah,1,6,Let Your ear now be attentive and Your eyes open to listen to the prayer of Your servant which I pray before You day and night for the Israelites Your servants confessing the sins of the Israelites which we have sinned against You. Yes I and my father's house have sinned.
Nehemiah,1,7,We have acted very corruptly against You and have not kept the commandments statutes and ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses.
Nehemiah,1,8,Remember [earnestly] what You commanded Your servant Moses: If you transgress and are unfaithful I will scatter you abroad among the nations;
Nehemiah,1,9,But if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them though your outcasts were in the farthest part of the heavens [the expanse of outer space] yet will I gather them from there and will bring them to the place in which I have chosen to set My Name.
Nehemiah,1,10,Now these are Your servants and Your people whom You have redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand.
Nehemiah,1,11,O Lord let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and the prayer of Your servants who delight to revere and fear Your name (Your nature and attributes); and prosper I pray You Your servant this day and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was cupbearer to the king.
Nehemiah,2,1,IN THE month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes when wine was before him I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad before in his presence.
Nehemiah,2,2,So the king said to me Why do you look sad since you are not sick? This is nothing but sorrow of heart. Then I was very much afraid
Nehemiah,2,3,And said to the king Let the king live forever! Why should I not be sad faced when the city the place of my fathers' sepulchers lies waste and its [fortified] gates are consumed by fire?
Nehemiah,2,4,The king said to me For what do you ask? So I prayed to the God of heaven.
Nehemiah,2,5,And I said to [him] If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in your sight I ask that you will send me to Judah to the city of my fathers' sepulchers that I may rebuild it.
Nehemiah,2,6,The king beside whom the queen was sitting asked me How long will your journey take and when will you return? So it pleased [him] to send me; and I set him a time.
Nehemiah,2,7,Also I said to the king If it pleases the king let letters be given me for the governors beyond the [Euphrates] River that they may let me pass through to Judah
Nehemiah,2,8,And a letter to Asaph keeper of the king's forest or park that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress of the temple and for the city wall and for the house that I shall occupy. And the king granted what I asked for the good hand of my God was upon me.
Nehemiah,2,9,Then I came to the governors beyond the River and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.
Nehemiah,2,10,When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant the Ammonite heard this it distressed them exceedingly that a man had come to inquire for and require the good and prosperity of the Israelites.
Nehemiah,2,11,So I came to Jerusalem and had been there three days.
Nehemiah,2,12,Then I arose in the night I and a few men with me. And I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. No beast was with me except the one I rode.
Nehemiah,2,13,I went out by night by the Valley Gate toward the Dragon's Well and to the Dung Gate and inspected the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which had been destroyed by fire.
Nehemiah,2,14,I passed over to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.
Nehemiah,2,15,So [gradually] I went up by the brook [Kidron] in the night and inspected the wall; then I turned back and entered [the city] by the Valley Gate and so returned.
Nehemiah,2,16,And the magistrates knew not where I went or what I did; nor had I yet told the Jews the priests the nobles the officials or the rest who did the work.
Nehemiah,2,17,Then I said to them You see the bad situation we are in--how Jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates are burned with fire. Come let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we may no longer be a disgrace.
Nehemiah,2,18,Then I told them of the hand of my God which was upon me for good and also the words that the king had spoken to me. And they said Let us rise up and build! So they strengthened their hands for the good work.
Nehemiah,2,19,But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant the Ammonite and Geshem the Arab heard of it they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said What is this thing you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?
Nehemiah,2,20,I answered them The God of heaven will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build but you have no portion or right or memorial in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,3,1,THEN ELIASHIB the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests and built the Sheep Gate. They consecrated it and set up its doors; they consecrated it even to the Tower of Hammeah or the Hundred as far as the Tower of Hananel.
Nehemiah,3,2,And next to him [Eliashib] the men of Jericho built. Next to [them] Zaccur son of Imri built.

Nehemiah,3,14,The Dung Gate was repaired by Malchijah son of Rechab the ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem. He rebuilt it and set its doors its bolts and its bars.
Nehemiah,3,15,The Fountain Gate was repaired by Shallum son of Col-hozeh ruler of the district of Mizpah. He rebuilt and covered it and set up its doors its bolts and its bars and the wall of the Pool of Shelah (Siloam) by the King's Garden as far as the stairs that go down [the eastern slope] from the [portion of Jerusalem known as] the City of David.

Nehemiah,3,25,Palal son of Uzai repaired opposite the angular turn of the wall and the tower which stands out from the upper house of the king by the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah son of Parosh
Nehemiah,3,26,And the servants of the priests dwelling on Ophel [the hill south of the temple] repaired to opposite the Water Gate on the east and the projecting tower.
Nehemiah,3,27,After them the Tekoites repaired another portion opposite the great projecting tower to the wall of Ophel.

Nehemiah,3,32,And from the ascent and upper room of the corner to the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and merchants repaired.
Nehemiah,4,1,BUT WHEN Sanballat heard that we were building the wall he was angry and in a great rage and he ridiculed the Jews.
Nehemiah,4,2,And he said before his brethren and the army of Samaria What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore things [at will and by themselves]? Will they [try to bribe their God] with sacrifices? Will they finish up in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish seeing they are burned?
Nehemiah,4,3,Now Tobiah the Ammonite was near him and he said What they build--if a fox climbs upon it he will break down their stone wall.
Nehemiah,4,4,[And Nehemiah prayed] Hear O our God for we are despised. Turn their taunts upon their own heads and give them for a prey in a land of their captivity.
Nehemiah,4,5,Cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out before You for they have vexed [with alarm] the builders and provoked You.
Nehemiah,4,6,So we built the wall and all [of it] was joined together to half its height for the people had a heart and mind to work.
Nehemiah,4,7,But when Sanballat Tobiah the Arabians Ammonites and Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were going up and that the breaches were being closed they were very angry.
Nehemiah,4,8,And they all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem to injure and cause confusion and failure in it.
Nehemiah,4,9,But because of them we made our prayer to our God and set a watch against them day and night.
Nehemiah,4,10,And [the leaders of] Judah said The strength of the burden bearers is weakening and there is much rubbish; we are not able to work on the wall.
Nehemiah,4,11,And our enemies said They will not know or see till we come into their midst and kill them and stop the work.
Nehemiah,4,12,And when the Jews who lived near them came they said to us ten times You must return [to guard our little villages]; from all places where they dwell they will be upon us.
Nehemiah,4,13,So I set [armed men] behind the wall in places where it was least protected; I even thus used the people as families with their swords spears and bows.
Nehemiah,4,14,I looked [them over] and rose up and said to the nobles and officials and the other people Do not be afraid of the enemy; [earnestly] remember the Lord and imprint Him [on your minds] great and terrible and [take from Him courage to] fight for your brethren your sons your daughters your wives and your homes.
Nehemiah,4,15,And when our enemies heard that their plot was known to us and that God had frustrated their purpose we all returned to the wall everyone to his work.
Nehemiah,4,16,And from that time forth half of my servants worked at the task and the other half held the spears shields bows and coats of mail; and the leaders stood behind all the house of Judah.
Nehemiah,4,17,Those who built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves so that everyone worked with one hand and held a weapon with the other hand
Nehemiah,4,18,And every builder had his sword girded by his side and so worked. And he who sounded the trumpet was at my side.
Nehemiah,4,19,And I said to the nobles and officials and the rest of the people The work is great and scattered and we are separated on the wall one far from another.
Nehemiah,4,20,In whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.
Nehemiah,4,21,So we labored at the work while half of them held the spears from dawn until the stars came out.
Nehemiah,4,22,At that time also I said to the people Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem that at night they may be a guard to us and a laborer during the day.
Nehemiah,4,23,So none of us--I my kinsmen my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me--took off our clothes; each kept his weapon [in his hand for days].
Nehemiah,5,1,NOW THERE arose a great cry of the [poor] people and of their wives [driven to borrowing] against their Jewish brethren [the few who could afford to lend].
Nehemiah,5,2,For some said We our sons and daughters are many; therefore allow us to take grain that we may eat and live! If we are not given grain let us take it!
Nehemiah,5,3,Also some said We are mortgaging our lands vineyards and houses to buy grain because of the scarcity.
Nehemiah,5,4,Others said We have borrowed money on our fields and vineyards to pay the [Persian] king's heavy tax.
Nehemiah,5,5,Although our flesh is the same as that of our brethren and our children are as theirs yet we are forced to sell our children as slaves; some of our daughters have already been thus sold and we are powerless to redeem them for others have our lands and vineyards.
Nehemiah,5,6,I [Nehemiah] was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
Nehemiah,5,7,I thought it over and then rebuked the nobles and officials. I told them You are exacting interest from your own kinsmen. And I held a great assembly against them.
Nehemiah,5,8,I said to them We according to our ability have bought back our Jewish brethren who were sold to the nations; but will you even sell your brethren that they may be sold to us? Then they were silent and found not a word to say.
Nehemiah,5,9,Also I said What you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God to prevent the taunts and reproach of the nations our enemies?
Nehemiah,5,10,I my brethren and my servants are lending them money and grain. Let us stop this forbidden interest!
Nehemiah,5,11,Return this very day to them their fields vineyards olive groves and houses and also a hundredth of all the money grain new wine and oil that you have exacted from them.
Nehemiah,5,12,Then they said We will restore these and require nothing from them. We will do as you say. Then I called the priests and took an oath of the lenders that they would do according to this promise.
Nehemiah,5,13,I shook out my lap and said So may God shake out every man from his house and from [the exercise and fruits of] his labor who does not keep this promise! So may he be shaken out and emptied. And all the assembly said Amen and praised the Lord. And the people did according to this promise.
Nehemiah,5,14,Also in the twelve years after I was appointed to be their governor in Judah from the twentieth to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes neither I nor my kin ate the food allowed to [me] the governor.
Nehemiah,5,15,But the former governors lived at the expense of the people and took from them food and wine besides forty shekels of silver [a large monthly official salary]; yes even their servants assumed authority over the people. But I did not so because of my [reverent] fear of God.
Nehemiah,5,16,I also held fast to the work on this wall; and we bought no land. And all my servants were gathered there for the work.
Nehemiah,5,17,And there were at my table 150 Jews and officials besides those who came to us from the nations about us.
Nehemiah,5,18,Now these were prepared for each day: one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine. Yet for all this I did not demand [my rights] the food allowed me as governor for the [tribute] bondage was heavy upon this people.
Nehemiah,5,19,O my God [earnestly] remember me for good for all I have done for this people.
Nehemiah,6,1,NOW WHEN Sanballat Tobiah Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies heard that I had built the wall and that there was no breach left in it although at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates
Nehemiah,6,2,Sanballat and Geshem sent to me saying Come let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they intended to do me harm.
Nehemiah,6,3,And I sent messengers to them saying I am doing a great work and cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave to come down to you?
Nehemiah,6,4,They sent to me four times this way and I answered them as before.
Nehemiah,6,5,Then Sanballat sent his servant to me again the fifth time with an open letter.
Nehemiah,6,6,In it was written: It is reported among the neighboring nations and Gashmu says it that you and the Jews plan to rebel; therefore you are building the wall that you may be their king according to the report.
Nehemiah,6,7,Also you have set up prophets to announce concerning you in Jerusalem There is a king in Judah. And now this will be reported to the [Persian] king. So come now and let us take counsel together.
Nehemiah,6,8,I replied to him No such things as you say have been done; you are inventing them out of your own heart and mind.
Nehemiah,6,9,For they all wanted to frighten us thinking Their hands will be so weak that the work will not be done. But now strengthen my hands!
Nehemiah,6,10,I went into the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel who was shut up. He said Let us meet together in the house of God within the temple and let us shut the doors of the temple for they are coming to kill you--at night they are coming to kill you.
Nehemiah,6,11,But I said Should such a man as I flee? And what man such as I could go into the temple [where only the priests are allowed to go] and yet live? I will not go in.
Nehemiah,6,12,And behold I saw that God had not sent him but he made this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
Nehemiah,6,13,He was hired that I should be made afraid and do as he said and sin that they might have matter for an evil report with which to taunt and reproach me.
Nehemiah,6,14,My God think on Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works and on the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have put me in fear.
Nehemiah,6,15,So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul in fifty-two days.
Nehemiah,6,16,When all our enemies heard of it all the nations around us feared and fell far in their own esteem for they saw that this work was done by our God.
Nehemiah,6,17,Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah and Tobiah's letters came to them.
Nehemiah,6,18,For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.
Nehemiah,6,19,Also they spoke of [Tobiah's] good deeds before me and told him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.
Nehemiah,7,1,NOW WHEN the wall was built and I had set up the doors and the gatekeepers singers and Levites had been appointed
Nehemiah,7,2,I gave my brother Hanani with Hananiah the ruler of the castle charge over Jerusalem for Hananiah was a more faithful and God-fearing man than many.
Nehemiah,7,3,I said to them Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while the watchmen are still on guard let them shut and bar the doors. Appoint guards from the people of Jerusalem each to his watch [on the wall] and each opposite his own house.
Nehemiah,7,4,Now the city was wide and large but the people in it were few and their houses were not yet built.
Nehemiah,7,5,And my God put it into my mind and heart to assemble the nobles the officers and the people that they might be counted by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of those who came [from Babylon] at the first and found written in it:
Nehemiah,7,6,These are the people of the province who came up out of the captivity of those exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away; they returned to Jerusalem and to Judah each to his town

Nehemiah,7,72,What the rest of the people gave was 20000 darics of gold 2000 minas of silver and 67 priests' garments.
Nehemiah,7,73,So the priests the Levites the gatekeepers the singers some of the people the Nethinim [the temple servants] along with all Israel dwelt in their towns and were in them when the seventh month came.
Nehemiah,8,1,THEN ALL the people gathered together as one man in the broad place before the Water Gate; and they asked Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses which the Lord had given to Israel.
Nehemiah,8,2,And Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly of both men and women and all who could hear with understanding on the first of the seventh month.
Nehemiah,8,3,He read from it facing the broad place before the Water Gate from early morning until noon in the presence of the men and women and those who could understand; and all the people were attentive to the Book of the Law.
Nehemiah,8,4,Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden pulpit which they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah Shema Anaiah Uriah Hilkiah and Maaseiah on his right hand; and on his left hand Pedaiah Mishael Malchijah Hashum Hashbaddana Zechariah and Meshullam.
Nehemiah,8,5,Ezra opened the book in sight of all the people for he was standing above them; and when he opened it all the people stood up.
Nehemiah,8,6,And Ezra blessed the Lord the great God. And all the people answered Amen Amen lifting up their hands; and they bowed their heads and worshiped the Lord with faces to the ground.
Nehemiah,8,7,Also Jeshua Bani Sherebiah Jamin Akkub Shabbethai Hodiah Maaseiah Kelita Azariah Jozabad Hanan Pelaiah--the Levites--helped the people to understand the Law and the people [remained] in their place.
Nehemiah,8,8,So they read from the Book of the Law of God distinctly faithfully amplifying and giving the sense so that [the people] understood the reading.
Nehemiah,8,9,And Nehemiah who was the governor and Ezra the priest and scribe and the Levites who taught the people said to all of them This day is holy to the Lord your God; mourn not nor weep. For all the people wept when they heard the words of the Law.
Nehemiah,8,10,Then [Ezra] told them Go your way eat the fat drink the sweet drink and send portions to him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. And be not grieved and depressed for the joy of the Lord is your strength and stronghold.
Nehemiah,8,11,So the Levites quieted all the people saying Be still for the day is holy. And do not be grieved and sad.
Nehemiah,8,12,And all the people went their way to eat drink send portions and make great rejoicing for they had understood the words that were declared to them.
Nehemiah,8,13,On the second day all the heads of fathers' houses with the priests and Levites gathered to Ezra the scribe to study and understand the words of divine instruction.
Nehemiah,8,14,And they found written in the law which the Lord had commanded through Moses that the Israelites should dwell in booths during the feast of the seventh month
Nehemiah,8,15,And that they should publish and proclaim in all their towns and in Jerusalem saying Go out to the hills and bring branches of olive wild olive myrtle palm and other leafy trees to make booths as it is written.
Nehemiah,8,16,So the people went out and brought them and made themselves booths each on the roof of his house and in their courts and the courts of God's house and in the squares of the Water Gate and the Gate of Ephraim.
Nehemiah,8,17,All the assembly of returned exiles made booths and dwelt in them; for since the days of Jeshua (Joshua) son of Nun up to that day the Israelites had not done so. And there was very great rejoicing.
Nehemiah,8,18,Also day by day from the first day to the last Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They kept the feast for seven days; the eighth day was a [closing] solemn assembly according to the ordinance.
Nehemiah,9,1,NOW ON the twenty-fourth day of this month the Israelites were assembled with fasting and in sackcloth and with earth upon their heads.
Nehemiah,9,2,And the Israelites separated themselves from all foreigners and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.
Nehemiah,9,3,And they stood in their place and read from the Book of the Law of the Lord their God for a fourth of the day and for another fourth of it they confessed and worshiped the Lord their God.
Nehemiah,9,4,On the stairs of the Levites stood Jeshua Bani Kadmiel Shebaniah Bunni Sherebiah Bani and Chenani and they cried with a loud voice to the Lord their God.
Nehemiah,9,5,Then the Levites--Jeshua Kadmiel Bani Hashabneiah Sherebiah Hodiah Shebaniah and Pethahiah--said Stand up and bless the Lord your God from everlasting to everlasting. Blessed be Your glorious name which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
Nehemiah,9,6,[And Ezra said] You are the Lord You alone; You have made heaven the heaven of heavens with all their host the earth and all that is on it the seas and all that is in them; and You preserve them all and the hosts of heaven worship You.
Nehemiah,9,7,You are the Lord the God Who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees and gave him the name Abraham.
Nehemiah,9,8,You found his heart faithful before You and You made the covenant with him to give his descendants the land of the Canaanite Hittite Amorite Perizzite Jebusite and Girgashite. And You have fulfilled Your promise for You are just and righteous.
Nehemiah,9,9,You saw our fathers' affliction in Egypt and You heard their cry at the Red Sea.
Nehemiah,9,10,You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land for You knew that they dealt insolently against the Israelites. And You got for Yourself a name as it is today.
Nehemiah,9,11,You divided the sea before them so that they went through its midst on dry land; their persecutors You threw into the depths as a stone into mighty waters.
Nehemiah,9,12,Moreover by a pillar of cloud You led them by day and by a pillar of fire by night to light the way they should go.
Nehemiah,9,13,You came down also upon Mount Sinai and spoke with them from Heaven and gave them right ordinances and true laws good statutes and commandments.
Nehemiah,9,14,And You made known to them Your holy Sabbath and gave them commandments statutes and a law through Moses Your servant.
Nehemiah,9,15,You gave them bread from heaven for their hunger and brought water for them out of the rock for their thirst; and You told them to go in and possess the land You had sworn to give them.
Nehemiah,9,16,But they and our fathers acted presumptuously and stiffened their necks and did not heed Your commandments.
Nehemiah,9,17,They refused to obey nor were they mindful of Your wonders and miracles which You did among them; but they stiffened their necks and in their rebellion appointed a captain that they might return to their bondage [in Egypt]. But You are a God ready to pardon gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great steadfast love; and You did not forsake them.
Nehemiah,9,18,Even when they had made for themselves a molten calf and said This is your god who brought you out of Egypt and had committed great and contemptible blasphemies
Nehemiah,9,19,You in Your great mercy forsook them not in the wilderness; the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way nor the pillar of fire by night to light the way they should go.
Nehemiah,9,20,You also gave Your good Spirit to instruct them and withheld not Your manna from them and gave water for their thirst.
Nehemiah,9,21,Forty years You sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell.
Nehemiah,9,22,Also You gave them kingdoms and peoples and allotted to them every corner. So they possessed the land of Sihon king of Heshbon and the land of Og king of Bashan.
Nehemiah,9,23,Their children You also multiplied as the stars of heaven and brought them into the land which You told their fathers they should go in and possess.
Nehemiah,9,24,So the descendants went in and possessed the land; and You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land the Canaanites and gave them into their hands with their kings and the peoples of the land that they might do with them as they would.
Nehemiah,9,25,And they captured fortified cities and a rich land and took possession of houses full of all good things cisterns hewn out vineyards olive orchards and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in Your great goodness.
Nehemiah,9,26,Yet they were disobedient and rebelled against You and cast Your law behind their back and killed Your prophets who accused and warned them to turn to You again; and they committed great and contemptible blasphemies.
Nehemiah,9,27,Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their enemies who distressed them. In the time of their suffering when they cried to You You heard them from heaven and according to Your abundant mercy You gave them deliverers who saved them from their enemies.
Nehemiah,9,28,But after they had rest they did evil again before You; therefore You left them in the hand of their enemies so that they had dominion over them. Yet when they turned and cried to You You heard them from heaven and many times You delivered them according to Your mercies
Nehemiah,9,29,And reproved and warned them that You might bring them again to Your law. Yet they acted presumptuously and did not heed Your commandments but sinned against Your ordinances which by keeping a man shall live. And they turned a stubborn shoulder stiffened their neck and would not listen.
Nehemiah,9,30,Yet You bore with them many years more and reproved and warned them by Your Spirit through Your prophets; still they would not listen. Therefore You gave them into the power of the peoples of the lands.
Nehemiah,9,31,Yet in Your great mercies You did not utterly consume them or forsake them for You are a gracious and merciful God.
Nehemiah,9,32,Now therefore our God the great mighty and terrible God Who keeps covenant and mercy and loving-kindness let not all the trouble and hardship seem little to You--the hardship that has come upon us our kings our princes our priests our prophets our fathers and on all Your people since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.
Nehemiah,9,33,However You are just in all that has come upon us; for You have dealt faithfully but we have done wickedly;
Nehemiah,9,34,Our kings our princes our priests and our fathers have not kept Your law or hearkened to Your commandments and Your warnings and reproofs which You gave them.
Nehemiah,9,35,They did not serve You in their kingdom and in Your great goodness that You gave them and in the large and rich land You set before them nor did they turn from their wicked works.
Nehemiah,9,36,Behold we are slaves this day and as for the land that You gave to our fathers to eat the fruit and the good of it behold we are slaves in it.
Nehemiah,9,37,And its rich yield goes to the kings whom You have set over us because of our sins; they have power also over our bodies and over our livestock at their pleasure. And we are in great distress.
Nehemiah,9,38,Because of all this we make a firm and sure written covenant and our princes Levites and priests set their seal to it.

Nehemiah,12,30,And the priests and the Levites purified themselves the people the gates and the wall.
Nehemiah,12,31,Then I brought the princes of Judah up on the wall and I appointed two great companies of them who gave thanks and went in procession. One went to the right upon the wall toward the Dung Gate.

Nehemiah,12,38,The other company of those who gave thanks went to the left; I followed with half of the people upon the wall above the Tower of the Furnaces to the Broad Wall
Nehemiah,12,39,And above the Gate of Ephraim and by the Old Gate and by the Fish Gate and by the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of Hammeah even to the Sheep Gate; and they stopped at the Gate of the Guard.
Nehemiah,12,40,So the two companies of those who gave thanks stood in the house of God and I and the half of the officials with me;
Nehemiah,12,41,And the priests Eliakim Maaseiah Miniamin Micaiah Elioenai Zechariah and Hananiah with trumpets;
Nehemiah,12,42,And Maaseiah Shemaiah Eleazar Uzzi Jehohanan Malchijah Elam and Ezer. And the singers sang and made themselves heard with Jezrahiah as leader.
Nehemiah,12,43,Also that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women also and the children rejoiced. The joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
Nehemiah,12,44,On that day men were appointed over the chambers for the stores the contributions the firstfruits and the tithes to gather into them the portions required by law for the priests and the Levites according to the fields of the towns for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who served [faithfully].
Nehemiah,12,45,And they performed the due service of their God and of the purification; so did the singers and gatekeepers as David and his son Solomon had commanded.
Nehemiah,12,46,For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
Nehemiah,12,47,And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and [later] of Nehemiah gave the daily portions for the singers and the gatekeepers; and they set apart what was for the Levites and the Levites set apart what was for the sons of Aaron [the priests].
Nehemiah,13,1,ON THAT day they read in the Book of Moses in the audience of the people and in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever come into the assembly of God
Nehemiah,13,2,For they met not the Israelites with food and drink but hired Balaam to curse them; yet our God turned the curse into a blessing.
Nehemiah,13,3,When [the Jews] heard the law they separated from Israel all who were of foreign descent.
Nehemiah,13,4,Now before this Eliashib the priest who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God and was related [by marriage] to Tobiah [our adversary]
Nehemiah,13,5,Prepared for Tobiah a large chamber where previously they had put the cereal offerings the frankincense the vessels and the tithes of grain new wine and oil which were given by commandment to the Levites the singers and gatekeepers and the contributions for the priests.
Nehemiah,13,6,But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes [Persian] king of Babylon I went to the king. Then later I asked leave of him
Nehemiah,13,7,And came to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah in preparing him [an adversary] a chamber in the courts of the house of God!
Nehemiah,13,8,And it grieved me exceedingly and I threw all the house furnishings of Tobiah out of the chamber.
Nehemiah,13,9,Then I commanded and they cleansed the chambers; and I brought back there the vessels of the house of God with the cereal offerings and the frankincense.
Nehemiah,13,10,And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them so that the Levites and the singers who did the work [forced by necessity] had each fled to his field.
Nehemiah,13,11,Then I contended with the officials and said Why is the house of God neglected and forsaken? I gathered the Levites and singers and set them in their stations.
Nehemiah,13,12,Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain the new wine and the oil to the storerooms.
Nehemiah,13,13,I set treasurers over the storerooms: Shelemiah the priest Zadok the scribe and Pedaiah of the Levites; assisting them was Hanan son of Zaccur the son of Mattaniah for they were counted faithful and their task was to distribute to their brethren.
Nehemiah,13,14,O my God [earnestly] remember me concerning this and wipe not out my good deeds and kindnesses done for the house of my God and for His service.
Nehemiah,13,15,In those days I saw in Judah men treading winepresses on the Sabbath bringing in sheaves or heaps of grain with which they loaded donkeys as well as wine grapes figs and all sorts of burdens which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I protested and warned them on the day they sold the produce.
Nehemiah,13,16,There dwelt men of Tyre there also who brought fish and all kinds of wares and sold on the Sabbath to the people of Judah and in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,13,17,Then I reproved the nobles of Judah and said What evil thing is this that you do--profaning the Sabbath day?
Nehemiah,13,18,Did not your fathers do thus and did not our God bring all this evil upon us and upon this city? Yet you bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath.
Nehemiah,13,19,And when it began to get dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath [day began] I commanded that the gates should be shut and not be opened till after the Sabbath. And I set some of my servants at the gates to prevent any burden being brought in on the Sabbath day.
Nehemiah,13,20,So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.
Nehemiah,13,21,But I reproved and warned them saying Why do you lodge by the wall? If you do so again I will lay hands on you. Then they stopped coming on the Sabbath.
Nehemiah,13,22,And I commanded the Levites to cleanse themselves and come and guard the gates to keep the Sabbath day holy. O my God [earnestly] remember me concerning this also and spare me according to the greatness of Your mercy and loving-kindness.
Nehemiah,13,23,In those days also I saw Jews who had married wives from Ashdod Ammon and Moab.
Nehemiah,13,24,And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod and could not speak the Hebrew but in the language of each people.
Nehemiah,13,25,And I contended with them and reviled them and beat some of them and pulled out their hair and made them swear by God saying You shall not give your daughters to their sons nor take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.
Nehemiah,13,26,Did not Solomon king of Israel act treacherously against God and miss the mark on account of such women? Among many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God and God made him king over all Israel; yet strange women even caused him to sin [when he was old he turned treacherously away from the Lord to other gods and God rent his kingdom from him].
Nehemiah,13,27,Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil and act treacherously against our God by marrying strange (heathen) women?
Nehemiah,13,28,One of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I chased him from me.
Nehemiah,13,29,O my God [earnestly] remember them because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priests and Levites.
Nehemiah,13,30,Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign (heathen) and I defined the duties of the priests and Levites everyone in his work;
Nehemiah,13,31,And I provided for the wood offering at appointed times and for the firstfruits. O my God [earnestly] remember me for good and imprint me [on Your heart]!
Esther,1,1,IT WAS in the days of Ahasuerus [Xerxes] the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over 127 provinces.
Esther,1,2,In those days when King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne which was in Shushan or Susa [the capital of the Persian Empire] in the palace or castle
Esther,1,3,In the third year of his reign he made a feast for all his princes and his courtiers. The chief officers of the Persian and Median army and the nobles and governors of the provinces were there before him
Esther,1,4,While he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendor and excellence of his majesty for many days even 180 days.
Esther,1,5,And when these days were completed the king made a feast for all the people present in Shushan the capital both great and small a seven-day feast in the court of the garden of the king's palace.
Esther,1,6,There were hangings of fine white cloth of green and of blue [cotton] fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings or rods and marble pillars. The couches of gold and silver rested on a [mosaic] pavement of porphyry white marble mother-of-pearl and [precious] colored stones.
Esther,1,7,Drinks were served in different kinds of golden goblets and there was royal wine in abundance according to the liberality of the king.
Esther,1,8,And drinking was according to the law; no one was compelled to drink for the king had directed all the officials of his palace to serve only as each guest desired.
Esther,1,9,Also Queen Vashti gave a banquet for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.
Esther,1,10,On the seventh day when the king's heart was merry with wine he commanded Mehuman Biztha Harbona Bigtha Abagtha Zethar and Carkas the seven eunuchs who ministered to King Ahasuerus as attendants
Esther,1,11,To bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown to show the peoples and the princes her beauty for she was fair to behold.
Esther,1,12,But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command conveyed by the eunuchs. Therefore the king was enraged and his anger burned within him.
Esther,1,13,Then the king spoke to the wise men who knew the times--for this was the king's procedure toward all who were familiar with law and judgment--
Esther,1,14,Those next to him being Carshena Shethar Admatha Tarshish Meres Marsena and Memucan the seven princes of Persia and Media who were in the king's presence and held first place in the kingdom.
Esther,1,15,[He said] According to the law what is to be done to Queen Vashti because she has not done the bidding of King Ahasuerus conveyed by the eunuchs?
Esther,1,16,And Memucan answered before the king and the princes Vashti the queen has not only done wrong to the king but also to all the princes and to all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.
Esther,1,17,For this deed of the queen will become known to all women making their husbands contemptible in their eyes since they will say King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him but she did not come.
Esther,1,18,This very day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's behavior will be telling it to all the king's princes. So contempt and wrath in plenty will arise.
Esther,1,19,If it pleases the king let a royal command go forth from him and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and Medes so that it may not be changed that Vashti is to [be divorced and] come no more before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she.
Esther,1,20,So when the king's decree is made and proclaimed throughout all his kingdom extensive as it is all wives will give honor to their husbands high and low.
Esther,1,21,This advice pleased the king and the princes and the king did what Memucan proposed.
Esther,1,22,He sent letters to all the royal provinces to each in its own script and to every people in their own language saying that every man should rule in his own house and speak there in the language of his own people. [If he had foreign wives let them learn his language.]
Esther,2,1,AFTER THESE things when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified he [earnestly] remembered Vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her.
Esther,2,2,Then the king's servants who ministered to him said Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king.
Esther,2,3,And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the beautiful young virgins to the capital in Shushan to the harem under the custody of Hegai the king's eunuch who is in charge of the women; and let their things for purification be given them.
Esther,2,4,And let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. This pleased the king and he did so.
Esther,2,5,There was a certain Jew in the capital in Shushan whose name was Mordecai son of Jair the son of Shimei the son of Kish a Benjamite
Esther,2,6,Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives taken away with Jeconiah king of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried into exile.
Esther,2,7,He had brought up Hadassah that is Esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother. The maiden was beautiful and lovely and when her father and mother died Mordecai took her as his own daughter.
Esther,2,8,So when the king's command and his decree were proclaimed and when many maidens were gathered in Shushan the capital under the custody of Hegai Esther also was taken to the king's house into the custody of Hegai keeper of the women.
Esther,2,9,And the maiden pleased [Hegai] and obtained his favor. And he speedily gave her the things for her purification and her portion of food and the seven chosen maids to be given her from the king's palace; and he removed her and her maids to the best [apartment] in the harem.
Esther,2,10,Esther had not made known her nationality or her kindred for Mordecai had charged her not to do so.
Esther,2,11,And Mordecai [who was an attendant in the king's court] walked every day before the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and what would become of her.
Esther,2,12,Now when the turn of each maiden came to go in to King Ahasuerus after the regulations for the women had been carried out for twelve months--since this was the regular period for their beauty treatments six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet spices and perfumes and the things for the purifying of the women--
Esther,2,13,Then in this way the maiden came to the king: whatever she desired was given her to take with her from the harem into the king's palace.
Esther,2,14,In the evening she went and next day she returned into the second harem in the custody of Shaashgaz the king's eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She came to the king no more unless the king delighted in her and she was called for by name.
Esther,2,15,Now when the turn for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her as his own daughter had come to go in to the king she required nothing but what Hegai the king's attendant the keeper of the women suggested. And Esther won favor in the sight of all who saw her.
Esther,2,16,So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal palace in the tenth month the month of Tebeth in the seventh year of his reign.
Esther,2,17,And the king loved Esther more than all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the maidens so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
Esther,2,18,Then the king gave a great feast for all his princes and his servants Esther's feast; and he gave a holiday [or a lessening of taxes] to the provinces and gave gifts in keeping with the generosity of the king.
Esther,2,19,And when the maidens were gathered together the second time Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.
Esther,2,20,Now Esther had not yet revealed her nationality or her people for she obeyed Mordecai's command to her [ to fear God and execute His commands] just as when she was being brought up by him.
Esther,2,21,In those days while Mordecai sat at the king's gate two of the king's eunuchs Bigthan and Teresh of those who guarded the door were angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.
Esther,2,22,And this was known to Mordecai who told it to Queen Esther and Esther told the king in Mordecai's name.
Esther,2,23,When it was investigated and found to be true both men were hanged on the gallows. And it was recorded in the Book of the Chronicles in the king's presence.
Esther,3,1,AFTER THESE things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.
Esther,3,2,And all the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed down and did reverence to Haman for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or do him reverence.
Esther,3,3,Then the king's servants who were at the king's gate said to Mordecai Why do you transgress the king's command?
Esther,3,4,Now when they spoke to him day after day and he paid no attention to them they told Haman to see whether Mordecai's conduct would stand for he had told them that he was a Jew.
Esther,3,5,And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or do him reverence he was very angry.
Esther,3,6,But he scorned laying hands only on Mordecai. So since they had told him Mordecai's nationality Haman sought to destroy all the Jews the people of Mordecai throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.
Esther,3,7,In the first month the month of Nisan in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus Haman caused Pur that is lots to be cast before him day after day [to find a lucky day for his venture] month after month until the twelfth the month of Adar.
Esther,3,8,Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from every other people neither do they keep the king's laws. Therefore it is not for the king's profit to tolerate them.
Esther,3,9,If it pleases the king let it be decreed that they be destroyed and I will pay 10000 talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king's business that it may be brought into the king's treasuries.
Esther,3,10,And the king took his signet ring from his hand [with which to seal his letters by the king's authority] and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite the Jews' enemy.
Esther,3,11,And the king said to Haman The silver is given to you the people also to do with them as it seems good to you.
Esther,3,12,Then the king's secretaries were called in on the thirteenth day of the first month and all that Haman had commanded was written to the king's chief rulers and to the governors who were over all the provinces and to the princes of each people to every province in its own script and to each people in their own language; it was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and it was sealed with the king's [signet] ring.
Esther,3,13,And letters were sent by special messengers to all the king's provinces--to destroy to slay and to do away with all Jews both young and old little children and women in one day the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month of Adar and to seize their belongings as spoil.
Esther,3,14,A copy of the writing was to be published and given out as a decree in every province to all the peoples to be ready for that day.
Esther,3,15,The special messengers went out in haste by order of the king and the decree was given out in Shushan the capital. And the king and Haman sat down to drink but the city of Shushan was perplexed [at the strange and alarming decree].
Esther,4,1,NOW WHEN Mordecai learned all that was done [he] rent his clothes and put on sackcloth with ashes and went out into the midst of the city and cried with a loud and bitter cry.
Esther,4,2,He came and stood before the king's gate for no one might enter the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
Esther,4,3,And in every province wherever the king's commandment and his decree came there was great mourning among the Jews with fasting weeping and wailing and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
Esther,4,4,When Esther's maids and her attendants came and told it to her the queen was exceedingly grieved and distressed. She sent garments to clothe Mordecai with orders to take his sackcloth from off him but he would not receive them.
Esther,4,5,Then Esther called for Hathach one of the king's attendants whom he had appointed to attend her and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was.
Esther,4,6,So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city which was in front of the king's gate.
Esther,4,7,And Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews to be destroyed.
Esther,4,8,[Mordecai] also gave him a copy of the decree to destroy them that was given out in Shushan that he might show it to Esther explain it to her and charge her to go to the king make supplication to him and plead with him for the lives of her people.
Esther,4,9,And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Esther,4,10,Then Esther spoke to Hathach and gave him a message for Mordecai saying
Esther,4,11,All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that any person be it man or woman who shall go into the inner court to the king without being called shall be put to death; there is but one law for him except [him] to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live. But I have not been called to come to the king for these thirty days.
Esther,4,12,And they told Mordecai what Esther said.
Esther,4,13,Then Mordecai told them to return this answer to Esther Do not flatter yourself that you shall escape in the king's palace any more than all the other Jews.
Esther,4,14,For if you keep silent at this time relief and deliverance shall arise for the Jews from elsewhere but you and your father's house will perish. And who knows but that you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this and for this very occasion?
Esther,4,15,Then Esther told them to give this answer to Mordecai
Esther,4,16,Go gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan and fast for me; and neither eat nor drink for three days night or day. I also and my maids will fast as you do. Then I will go to the king though it is against the law; and if I perish I perish.
Esther,4,17,So Mordecai went away and did all that Esther had commanded him.
Esther,5,1,ON THE third day [of the fast] Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the royal or inner court of the king's palace opposite his [throne room]. The king was sitting on his throne facing the main entrance of the palace.
Esther,5,2,And when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court she obtained favor in his sight and he held out to [her] the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near and touched the tip of the scepter.
Esther,5,3,Then the king said to her What will you have Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom.
Esther,5,4,And Esther said If it seems good to the king let the king and Haman come this day to the dinner that I have prepared for the king.
Esther,5,5,Then the king said Cause Haman to come quickly that what Esther has said may be done.
Esther,5,6,So the king and Haman came to the dinner that Esther had prepared.
Esther,5,7,And during the serving of wine the king said to Esther What is your petition? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
Esther,5,8,Then Esther said My petition and my request is: If I have found favor in the sight of the king and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the dinner that I shall prepare for them; and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.
Esther,5,9,Haman went away that day joyful and elated in heart. But when he saw Mordecai at the king's gate refusing to stand up or show fear before him he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.
Esther,5,10,Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home. There he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife.
Esther,5,11,And Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches the abundance of his [ten] sons all the things in which the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
Esther,5,12,Haman added Yes and today Queen Esther did not let any man come with the king to the dinner she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king.
Esther,5,13,Yet all this benefits me nothing as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.
Esther,5,14,Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him Let a gallows be made fifty cubits [seventy-five feet] high and in the morning speak to the king that Mordecai may be hanged on it; then you go in merrily with the king to the dinner. And the thing pleased Haman and he caused the gallows to be made.
Esther,6,1,ON THAT night the king could not sleep; and he ordered that the book of memorable deeds the chronicles be brought and they were read before the king.
Esther,6,2,And it was found written there how Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh two of the king's attendants who guarded the door who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.
Esther,6,3,And the king said What honor or distinction has been given Mordecai for this? Then the king's servants who ministered to him said Nothing has been done for him.
Esther,6,4,The king said Who is in the court? Now Haman had just come into the outer court of the king's palace to ask the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows he had prepared for him.
Esther,6,5,And the king's servants said to him Behold Haman is standing in the court. And the king said Let him come in.
Esther,6,6,So Haman came in. And the king said to him What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman said to himself To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to me?
Esther,6,7,And Haman said to the king For the man whom the king delights to honor
Esther,6,8,Let royal apparel be brought which the king has worn and the horse which the king has ridden and a royal crown be set on his head.
Esther,6,9,And let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes. Let him array the man whom the king delights to honor and conduct him on horseback through the open square of the city and proclaim before him Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.
Esther,6,10,Then the king said to Haman Make haste and take the apparel and the horse as you have said and do so to Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king's gate. Leave out nothing that you have spoken.
Esther,6,11,Then Haman took the apparel and the horse and conducted Mordecai on horseback through the open square of the city proclaiming before him Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.
Esther,6,12,Then Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hastened to his house mourning and having his head covered.
Esther,6,13,And Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him If Mordecai before whom you have begun to fall is of the offspring of the Jews you cannot prevail against him but shall surely fall before him.
Esther,6,14,While they were yet talking with him the king's attendants came and hastily brought Haman to the dinner that Esther had prepared.
Esther,7,1,SO THE king and Haman came to dine with Esther the queen.
Esther,7,2,And the king said again to Esther on the second day when wine was being served What is your petition Queen Esther? It shall be granted. And what is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
Esther,7,3,Then Queen Esther said If I have found favor in your sight O king and if it pleases the king let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request.
Esther,7,4,For we are sold I and my people to be destroyed slain and wiped out of existence! But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen I would have held my tongue for our affliction is not to be compared with the damage this will do to the king.
Esther,7,5,Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther Who is he and where is he who dares presume in his heart to do that?
Esther,7,6,And Esther said An adversary and an enemy even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and queen.
Esther,7,7,And the king arose from the feast in his wrath and went into the palace garden; and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Queen Esther for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
Esther,7,8,When the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the drinking of wine Haman was falling upon the couch where Esther was. Then said the king Will he even forcibly assault the queen in my presence in my own palace? As the king spoke the words [the servants] covered Haman's face.
Esther,7,9,Then said Harbonah one of the attendants serving the king Behold the gallows fifty cubits high which Haman has made for Mordecai whose warning saved the king stands at the house of Haman. And the king said Hang him on it!
Esther,7,10,So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king's wrath was pacified.
Esther,8,1,ON THAT day King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman the Jews' enemy to Queen Esther. And Mordecai came before the king for Esther had told what he was to her.
Esther,8,2,And the king took off his [signet] ring which he had taken from Haman and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
Esther,8,3,And Esther spoke yet again to the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to avert the evil plot of Haman the Agagite and his scheme that he had devised against the Jews.
Esther,8,4,Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose and stood before the king.
Esther,8,5,And she said If it pleases the king and if I have found favor in his sight and the thing seems right before the king and I am pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces.
Esther,8,6,For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come upon my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
Esther,8,7,Then the King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew Behold I have given Esther the house of Haman and him they have hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the Jews.
Esther,8,8,Write also concerning the Jews as it pleases you in the king's name and seal it with the king's [signet] ring--for writing which is in the king's name and sealed with the king's ring no man can reverse.
Esther,8,9,Then the king's scribes were called in the third month the month of Sivan on the twenty-third day and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews to the chief rulers and the governors and princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia 127 provinces to every province in its own script and to every people in their own language and to the Jews according to their writing and according to their language.
Esther,8,10,He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king's ring and sent letters by messengers on horseback riding on swift steeds mules and young dromedaries used in the king's service bred from the [royal] stud.
Esther,8,11,In it the king granted the Jews who were in every city to gather and defend their lives; to destroy to slay and to wipe out any armed force that might attack them their little ones and women; and to take the enemies' goods for spoil.
Esther,8,12,On one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month of Adar
Esther,8,13,A copy of the writing was to be issued as a decree in every province and as a proclamation to all peoples and the Jews should be ready on that day to avenge themselves upon their enemies.
Esther,8,14,So the couriers who were mounted on swift beasts that were used in the king's service went out being hurried and urged on by the king's command; and the decree was released in Shushan the capital.
Esther,8,15,And Mordecai went forth from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white with a great crown of gold and with a robe of fine linen and purple; and the city of Shushan shouted and rejoiced.
Esther,8,16,The Jews had light [a dawn of new hope] and gladness and joy and honor.
Esther,8,17,And in every province and in every city wherever the king's command and his decree came the Jews had gladness and joy a feast and a holiday. And many from among the peoples of the land [submitted themselves to Jewish rite and] became Jews for the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them.
Esther,9,1,NOW IN the twelfth month the month of Adar on the thirteenth day of Adar when the king's command and his edict were about to be executed on the [very] day that the enemies of the Jews had planned for a massacre of them it was turned to the contrary and the Jews had rule over those who hated them.
Esther,9,2,The Jews gathered together in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on such as sought their hurt; and no man could withstand them for the fear of them had fallen upon all the peoples.
Esther,9,3,And all the princes of the provinces and the chief rulers and the governors and they who attended to the king's business helped the Jews because the fear of Mordecai had fallen upon them.
Esther,9,4,For Mordecai was great in the king's palace; and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces for the man Mordecai became more and more powerful.
Esther,9,5,So the Jews smote all their enemies with the sword slaughtering and destroying them and did as they chose with those who hated them.
Esther,9,6,In Shushan the capital itself the Jews slew and destroyed 500 men.
Esther,9,7,And they killed Parshandatha
Esther,9,8,Dalphon Aspatha Poratha Adalia
Esther,9,9,Aridatha Parmashta Arisai Aridai
Esther,9,10,And Vaizatha the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha the Jews' enemy; but on the spoil they laid not their hands.
Esther,9,11,On that day the number of those who were slain in Shushan the capital was brought before the king.
Esther,9,12,And the king said to Esther the queen The Jews have slain and destroyed 500 men in Shushan the capital and the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be granted to you. Or what is your request further? It shall be done.
Esther,9,13,Then said Esther If it pleases the king let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day's decree and let [the dead bodies of] Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows.
Esther,9,14,And the king commanded it to be done; the decree was given in Shushan and they hanged [the bodies of] Haman's ten sons.
Esther,9,15,And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered together on the fourteenth day also of the month of Adar and slew 300 men in Shushan but on the spoil they laid not their hands.
Esther,9,16,And the other Jews who were in the king's provinces gathered to defend their lives and had relief and rest from their enemies and slew of them that hated them 75000; but on the spoil they laid not their hands.
Esther,9,17,This was done on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar and on the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
Esther,9,18,But the Jews who were in Shushan [Susa] assembled on the thirteenth day and on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
Esther,9,19,Therefore the Jews of the villages who dwell in the unwalled towns make the fourteenth day of the month of Adar a day of gladness and feasting a holiday and a day for sending choice portions to one another.
Esther,9,20,And Mordecai recorded these things and he sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus both near and far
Esther,9,21,To command them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and also the fifteenth yearly
Esther,9,22,As the days on which the Jews got rest from their enemies and as the month which was turned for them from sorrow to gladness and from mourning into a holiday--that they should make them days of feasting and gladness days of sending choice portions to one another and gifts to the poor.
Esther,9,23,So the Jews undertook to do as they had begun and as Mordecai had written to them--
Esther,9,24,Because Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite the enemy of all the Jews had plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had cast Pur that is the lot [to find a lucky day] to crush and consume and destroy them.
Esther,9,25,But when Esther brought the matter before the king he commanded in writing that Haman's wicked scheme which he had devised against the Jews should return upon his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
Esther,9,26,Therefore they called these days Purim after the name Pur [lot]. Therefore because of all that was in this letter and what they had faced in this matter and what had happened to them
Esther,9,27,The Jews ordained and took it upon themselves and their descendants and all who joined them that without fail every year they would keep these two days at the appointed time and as it was written
Esther,9,28,That these days should be remembered (imprinted on their minds) and kept throughout every generation in every family province and city and that these days of Purim should never cease from among the Jews nor the commemoration of them cease among their descendants.
Esther,9,29,Then Queen Esther the daughter of Abihail with Mordecai the Jew gave full power [written authority] confirming this second letter about Purim.
Esther,9,30,And letters were sent to all the Jews to the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus in words of peace and truth
Esther,9,31,To confirm that these days of Purim should be observed at their appointed times as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had commanded [the Jews] and as they had ordained for themselves and for their descendants in the matter of their fasts and their lamenting.
Esther,9,32,And the command of Esther confirmed these observances of Purim and it was written in the book.
Esther,10,1,KING AHASUERUS laid a tribute (tax) on the land and on the coastlands of the sea.
Esther,10,2,And all the acts of his power and of his might and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia?
Esther,10,3,For Mordecai the Jew was next to King Ahasuerus and great among the Jews and was a favorite with the multitude of his brethren for he sought the welfare of his people and spoke peace to his whole race.
Job,1,1,THERE WAS a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright and one who [reverently] feared God and abstained from and shunned evil [because it was wrong].
Job,1,2,And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
Job,1,3,He possessed 7000 sheep 3000 camels 500 yoke of oxen 500 female donkeys and a very great body of servants so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East.
Job,1,4,His sons used to go and feast in the house of each on his day (birthday) in turn and they invited their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
Job,1,5,And when the days of their feasting were over Job sent for them to purify and hallow them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed or disowned God in their hearts. Thus did Job at all [such] times.
Job,1,6,Now there was a day when the sons (the angels) of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan (the adversary and accuser) also came among them.
Job,1,7,And the Lord said to Satan From where did you come? Then Satan answered the Lord From going to and fro on the earth and from walking up and down on it.
Job,1,8,And the Lord said to Satan Have you considered My servant Job that there is none like him on the earth a blameless and upright man one who [reverently] fears God and abstains from and shuns evil [because it is wrong]?
Job,1,9,Then Satan answered the Lord Does Job [reverently] fear God for nothing?
Job,1,10,Have You not put a hedge about him and his house and all that he has on every side? You have conferred prosperity and happiness upon him in the work of his hands and his possessions have increased in the land.
Job,1,11,But put forth Your hand now and touch all that he has and he will curse You to Your face.
Job,1,12,And the Lord said to Satan (the adversary and the accuser) Behold all that he has is in your power only upon the man himself put not forth your hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.
Job,1,13,And there was a day when [Job's] sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house [on his birthday]
Job,1,14,And there came a messenger to Job and said The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them
Job,1,15,And the Sabeans swooped down upon them and took away [the animals]. Indeed they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword and I alone have escaped to tell you.
Job,1,16,While he was yet speaking there came also another and said The fire of God (lightning) has fallen from the heavens and has burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and I alone have escaped to tell you.
Job,1,17,While he was yet speaking there came also another and said The Chaldeans divided into three bands and made a raid upon the camels and have taken them away yes and have slain the servants with the edge of the sword and I alone have escaped to tell you.
Job,1,18,While he was yet speaking there came also another and said Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house
Job,1,19,And behold there came a great [whirlwind] from the desert and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young people and they are dead and I alone have escaped to tell you.
Job,1,20,Then Job arose and rent his robe and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped
Job,1,21,And said Naked (without possessions) came I [into this world] from my mother's womb and naked (without possessions) shall I depart. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; blessed (praised and magnified in worship) be the name of the Lord!
Job,1,22,In all this Job sinned not nor charged God foolishly.
Job,2,1,AGAIN THERE was a day when the sons of God [the angels] came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan (the adversary and the accuser) came also among them to present himself before the Lord.
Job,2,2,And the Lord said to Satan From where do you come? And Satan (the adversary and the accuser) answered the Lord From going to and fro on the earth and from walking up and down on it.
Job,2,3,And the Lord said to Satan Have you considered My servant Job that there is none like him on the earth a blameless and upright man one who [reverently] fears God and abstains from and shuns all evil [because it is wrong]? And still he holds fast his integrity although you moved Me against him to destroy him without cause.
Job,2,4,Then Satan answered the Lord Skin for skin! Yes all that a man has will he give for his life.
Job,2,5,But put forth Your hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse and renounce You to Your face.
Job,2,6,And the Lord said to Satan Behold he is in your hand; only spare his life.
Job,2,7,So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord and smote Job with loathsome and painful sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
Job,2,8,And he took a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself and he sat [down] among the ashes.
Job,2,9,Then his wife said to him Do you still hold fast your blameless uprightness? Renounce God and die!
Job,2,10,But he said to her You speak as one of the impious and foolish women would speak. What? Shall we accept [only] good at the hand of God and shall we not accept [also] misfortune and what is of a bad nature? In [spite of] all this Job did not sin with his lips.
Job,2,11,Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him they came each one from his own place Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite for they had made an appointment together to come to condole with him and to comfort him.
Job,2,12,And when they looked from afar off and saw him [disfigured] beyond recognition they lifted up their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and they cast dust over their heads toward the heavens.
Job,2,13,So they sat down with [Job] on the ground for seven days and seven nights and none spoke a word to him for they saw that his grief and pain were very great.
Job,3,1,AFTER THIS Job opened his mouth and cursed his day (birthday).
Job,3,2,And Job said
Job,3,3,Let the day perish wherein I was born and the night which announced There is a man-child conceived.
Job,3,4,Let that day be darkness! May not God above regard it nor light shine upon it.
Job,3,5,Let gloom and deep darkness claim it for their own; let a cloud dwell upon it; let all that blackens the day terrify it (the day that I was born).
Job,3,6,As for that night let thick darkness seize it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.
Job,3,7,Yes let that night be solitary and barren; let no joyful voice come into it.
Job,3,8,Let those curse it who curse the day who are skilled in rousing up Leviathan.
Job,3,9,Let the stars of the early dawn of that day be dark; let [the morning] look in vain for the light nor let it behold the day's dawning
Job,3,10,Because it shut not the doors of my mother's womb nor hid sorrow and trouble from my eyes.
Job,3,11,Why was I not stillborn? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bore me?
Job,3,12,Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts that I should suck?
Job,3,13,For then would I have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then would I have been at rest [in death]
Job,3,14,With kings and counselors of the earth who built up [now] desolate ruins for themselves
Job,3,15,Or with princes who had gold who filled their houses with silver.
Job,3,16,Or [why] was I not a miscarriage hidden and put away as infants who never saw light?
Job,3,17,There [in death] the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary are at rest.
Job,3,18,There the [captive] prisoners rest together; they hear not the taskmaster's voice.
Job,3,19,The small and the great are there and the servant is free from his master.
Job,3,20,Why is light [of life] given to him who is in misery and life to the bitter in soul
Job,3,21,Who long and wait for death but it comes not and dig for it more than for hidden treasures
Job,3,22,Who rejoice exceedingly and are elated when they find the grave?
Job,3,23,[Why is the light of day given] to a man whose way is hidden and whom God has hedged in?
Job,3,24,For my sighing comes before my food and my groanings are poured out like water.
Job,3,25,For the thing which I greatly fear comes upon me and that of which I am afraid befalls me.
Job,3,26,I was not or am not at ease nor had I or have I rest nor was I or am I quiet yet trouble came and still comes [upon me].
Job,4,1,THEN ELIPHAZ the Temanite answered and said
Job,4,2,If we venture to converse with you will you be offended? Yet who can restrain himself from speaking?
Job,4,3,Behold you have instructed many and you have strengthened the weak hands.
Job,4,4,Your words have held firm him who was falling and you have strengthened the feeble knees.
Job,4,5,But now it is come upon you and you faint and are grieved; it touches you and you are troubled and dismayed.
Job,4,6,Is not your [reverent] fear of God your confidence and the integrity and uprightness of your ways your hope?
Job,4,7,Think [earnestly] I beg of you: who being innocent ever perished? Or where were those upright and in right standing with God cut off?
Job,4,8,As I myself have seen those who plow iniquity and sow trouble and mischief reap the same.
Job,4,9,By the breath of God they perish and by the blast of His anger they are consumed.
Job,4,10,The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion and the teeth of the young lions are broken.
Job,4,11,The old and strong lion perishes for lack of prey and the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.
Job,4,12,Now a thing was secretly brought to me and my ear received a whisper of it.
Job,4,13,In thoughts from the visions of the night when deep sleep falls on men
Job,4,14,Fear came upon me and trembling which made all my bones shake.
Job,4,15,Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up!
Job,4,16,[The spirit] stood still but I could not discern the appearance of it. A form was before my eyes; there was silence and then I heard a voice saying
Job,4,17,Can mortal man be just before God or be more right than He is? Can a man be pure before his Maker or be more cleansed than He is?
Job,4,18,Even in His [heavenly] servants He puts no trust or confidence and His angels He charges with folly and error--
Job,4,19,How much more those who dwell in houses (bodies) of clay whose foundations are in the dust who are crushed like the moth.
Job,4,20,Between morning and evening they are destroyed; without anyone noticing it they perish forever.
Job,4,21,Is not their tent cord plucked up within them [so that the tent falls]? Do they not die and that without [acquiring] wisdom?
Job,5,1,CALL NOW--is there any who will answer you? And to which of the holy [angels] will you turn?
Job,5,2,For vexation and rage kill the foolish man; jealousy and indignation slay the simple.
Job,5,3,I have seen the foolish taking root [and outwardly prospering] but suddenly I saw that his dwelling was cursed [for his doom was certain].
Job,5,4,His children are far from safety; [involved in their father's ruin] they are crushed in the [court of justice in the city's] gate and there is no one to deliver them.
Job,5,5,His harvest the hungry eat and take it even [when it grows] among the thorns; the snare opens for [his] wealth.
Job,5,6,For affliction comes not forth from the dust neither does trouble spring forth out of the ground.
Job,5,7,But man is born to trouble as the sparks and the flames fly upward.
Job,5,8,As for me I would seek God and inquire of and require Him and to God would I commit my cause--
Job,5,9,Who does great things and unsearchable marvelous things without number
Job,5,10,Who gives rain upon the earth and sends waters upon the fields
Job,5,11,So that He sets on high those who are lowly and those who mourn He lifts to safety.
Job,5,12,He frustrates the devices of the crafty so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise or anything of [lasting] worth.
Job,5,13,He catches the [so-called] wise in their own trickiness and the counsel of the schemers is brought to a quick end.
Job,5,14,In the daytime they meet in darkness and at noon they grope as in the night.
Job,5,15,But [God] saves [the fatherless] from the sword of their mouth and the needy from the hand of the mighty.
Job,5,16,So the poor have hope and iniquity shuts her mouth.
Job,5,17,Happy and fortunate is the man whom God reproves; so do not despise or reject the correction of the Almighty [subjecting you to trial and suffering].
Job,5,18,For He wounds but He binds up; He smites but His hands heal.
Job,5,19,He will rescue you in six troubles; in seven nothing that is evil [for you] will touch you.
Job,5,20,In famine He will redeem you from death and in war from the power of the sword.
Job,5,21,You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes.
Job,5,22,At destruction and famine you shall laugh neither shall you be afraid of the living creatures of the earth.
Job,5,23,For you shall be in league with the stones of the field and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.
Job,5,24,And you shall know that your tent shall be in peace and you shall visit your fold and your dwelling and miss nothing [from them].
Job,5,25,You shall know also that your children shall be many and your offspring as the grass of the earth.
Job,5,26,You shall come to your grave in ripe old age and as a shock of grain goes up [to the threshing floor] in its season.
Job,5,27,This is what we have searched out; it is true. Hear and heed it and know for yourself [for your good].
Job,6,1,THEN JOB answered
Job,6,2,Oh that my impatience and vexation might be [thoroughly] weighed and all my calamity be laid up over against them in the balances one against the other [to see if my grief is unmanly]!
Job,6,3,For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash and wild
Job,6,4,[But it is] because the arrows of the Almighty are within me the poison which my spirit drinks up; the terrors of God set themselves in array against me.
Job,6,5,Does the wild ass bray when it has grass? Or does the ox low over its fodder?
Job,6,6,Can that which has no taste to it be eaten without salt? Or is there any flavor in the white of an egg?
Job,6,7,[These afflictions] my soul refuses to touch! Such things are like diseased food to me [sickening and repugnant]!
Job,6,8,Oh that I might have my request and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
Job,6,9,I even wish that it would please God to crush me that He would let loose His hand and cut me off!
Job,6,10,Then would I still have consolation--yes I would leap [for joy] amid unsparing pain [though I shrink from it]--that I have not concealed or denied the words of the Holy One!
Job,6,11,What strength have I left that I should wait and hope? And what is ahead of me that I should be patient?
Job,6,12,Is my strength and endurance that of stones? Or is my flesh made of bronze?
Job,6,13,Is it not that I have no help in myself and that wisdom is quite driven from me?
Job,6,14,To him who is about to faint and despair kindness is due from his friend lest he forsake the fear of the Almighty.
Job,6,15,[You] my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook as the channel of brooks that pass away
Job,6,16,Which are black and turbid by reason of the ice and in which the snows hides itself;
Job,6,17,When they get warm they shrink and disappear; when it is hot they vanish out of their place.
Job,6,18,The caravans which travel by way of them turn aside; they go into the waste places and perish. [Such is my disappointment in you the friends I fully trusted.]
Job,6,19,The caravans of Tema looked [for water] the companies of Sheba waited for them [in vain].
Job,6,20,They were confounded because they had hoped [to find water]; they came there and were bitterly disappointed.
Job,6,21,Now to me you are [like a dried-up brook]; you see my dismay and terror and [believing me to be a victim of God's anger] you are afraid [to sympathize with me].
Job,6,22,Did I ever say Bring me a gift or Pay a bribe on my account from your wealth
Job,6,23,To deliver me from the adversary's hand or Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?
Job,6,24,Teach me and I will hold my peace; and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
Job,6,25,How forcible are words of straightforward speech! But what does your arguing argue and prove or your reproof reprove?
Job,6,26,Do you imagine your words to be an argument but the speeches of one who is desperate to be as wind?
Job,6,27,Yes you would cast lots over the fatherless and bargain away your friend.
Job,6,28,Now be pleased to look upon me that it may be evident to you if I lie [for surely I would not lie to your face].
Job,6,29,Return [from your suspicion] I pray you let there be no injustice; yes return again [to confidence in me] my vindication is in it.
Job,6,30,Is there wrong on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern what is destructive?
Job,7,1,IS THERE not an [appointed] warfare and hard labor to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling?
Job,7,2,As a servant earnestly longs for the shade and the evening shadows and as a hireling who looks for the reward of his work
Job,7,3,So am I allotted months of futile [suffering] and [long] nights of misery are appointed to me.
Job,7,4,When I lie down I say When shall I arise and the night be gone? And I am full of tossing to and fro till the dawning of the day.
Job,7,5,My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken and has become loathsome and it closes up and breaks out afresh.
Job,7,6,My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle and are spent without hope.
Job,7,7,Oh remember that my life is but wind (a puff a breath a sob); my eye shall see good no more.
Job,7,8,The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more; while your eyes are upon me I shall be gone.
Job,7,9,As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away so he who goes down to Sheol (the place of the dead) shall come up no more.
Job,7,10,He shall return no more to his house neither shall his place know him any more.
Job,7,11,Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit I will complain in the bitterness of my soul [O Lord]!
Job,7,12,Am I the sea or the sea monster that You set a watch over me?
Job,7,13,When I say My bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease my complaint
Job,7,14,Then You scare me with dreams and terrify me through visions
Job,7,15,So that I would choose strangling and death rather than these my bones.
Job,7,16,I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone for my days are a breath (futility).
Job,7,17,What is man that You should magnify him and think him important? And that You should set Your mind upon him?
Job,7,18,And that You should visit him every morning and try him every moment?
Job,7,19,How long will Your [plaguing] glance not look away from me nor You let me alone till I swallow my spittle?
Job,7,20,If I have sinned what [harm] have I done You O You Watcher and Keeper of men? Why have You set me as a mark for You so that I am a burden to myself [and You]?
Job,7,21,And why do You not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust; and [even if] You will seek me diligently [it will be too late for] I shall not be.
Job,8,1,THEN ANSWERED Bildad the Shuhite
Job,8,2,How long will you say these things [Job]? And how long shall the words of your mouth be as a mighty wind?
Job,8,3,Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?
Job,8,4,If your children have sinned against Him then He has delivered them into the power of their transgression.
Job,8,5,If you will seek God diligently and make your supplication to the Almighty
Job,8,6,Then if you are pure and upright surely He will bestir Himself for you and make your righteous dwelling prosperous again.
Job,8,7,And though your beginning was small yet your latter end would greatly increase.
Job,8,8,For inquire I pray you of the former age and apply yourself to that which their fathers have searched out
Job,8,9,For we are but of yesterday and know nothing because our days upon earth are a shadow.
Job,8,10,Shall not [the forefathers] teach you and tell you and utter words out of their hearts (the deepest part of their nature)?
Job,8,11,Can the rush or papyrus grow up without marsh? Can the flag or reed grass grow without water?
Job,8,12,While it is yet green in flower and not cut down it withers before any other herb [when without water].
Job,8,13,So are the ways of all who forget God; and the hope of the godless shall perish.
Job,8,14,For his confidence breaks and [the object of] his trust is a spider's web.
Job,8,15,He shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand; he shall hold fast to it but it shall not last.
Job,8,16,He is green before the sun and his shoots go forth over his garden.
Job,8,17,[Godless] his roots are wrapped about the [stone] heap and see their way [promisingly] among the rocks.
Job,8,18,But if [God] snatches him from his property [then having passed into the hands of others] it [his property] will forget and deny him [saying] I have never seen you [before as if ashamed of him--like his former friends].
Job,8,19,See this is the joy of going the way [of the ungodly]! And from the dust others will spring up [to take his place].
Job,8,20,Behold as surely as God will never uphold wrongdoers He will never cast away a blameless man.
Job,8,21,He will yet fill your mouth with laughter [Job] and your lips with joyful shouting.
Job,8,22,Those who hate you will be clothed with shame and the tents of the wicked shall be no more.
Job,9,1,THEN JOB answered and said
Job,9,2,Yes I know it is true. But how can mortal man be right before God?
Job,9,3,If one should want to contend with Him he cannot answer one [of His questions] in a thousand.
Job,9,4,[God] is wise in heart and mighty in strength; who has [ever] hardened himself against Him and prospered or even been safe?
Job,9,5,[God] Who removes the mountains and they know it not when He overturns them in His anger;
Job,9,6,Who shakes the earth out of its place and the pillars of it tremble;
Job,9,7,Who commands the sun and it rises not; Who seals up the stars [from view];
Job,9,8,Who alone stretches out the heavens and treads upon the waves and high places of the sea;
Job,9,9,Who made [the constellations] the Bear Orion and the [loose cluster] Pleiades and the [vast starry] spaces of the south;
Job,9,10,Who does great things past finding out yes marvelous things without number.
Job,9,11,Behold He goes by me and I see Him not; He passes on also but I perceive Him not.
Job,9,12,Behold He snatches away; who can hinder or turn Him back? Who will say to Him What are You doing?
Job,9,13,God will not withdraw His anger; the [proud] helpers of Rahab [arrogant monster of the sea] bow under Him.
Job,9,14,How much less shall I answer Him choosing out my words to reason with Him
Job,9,15,Whom though I were righteous (upright and innocent) yet I could not answer? I must appeal for mercy to my Opponent and Judge [for my right].
Job,9,16,If I called and He answered me yet would I not believe that He listened to my voice.
Job,9,17,For He overwhelms and breaks me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause.
Job,9,18,He will not allow me to catch my breath but fills me with bitterness.
Job,9,19,If I speak of strength behold He is mighty! And if of justice Who says He will summon Me?
Job,9,20,Though I am innocent and in the right my own mouth would condemn me; though I am blameless He would prove me perverse.
Job,9,21,Though I am blameless I regard not myself; I despise my life.
Job,9,22,It is all one; therefore I say God [does not discriminate but] destroys the blameless and the wicked.
Job,9,23,When [His] scourge slays suddenly He mocks at the calamity and trial of the innocent.
Job,9,24,The earth is given into the hands of the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges [so that they are blinded to justice]. If it is not [God] who then is it [responsible for all this inequality]?
Job,9,25,Now my days are swifter than a runner; they flee away they see no good.
Job,9,26,They are passed away like the swift rowboats made of reeds or like the eagle that swoops down on the prey.
Job,9,27,If I say I will forget my complaint I will put off my sad countenance and be of good cheer and brighten up
Job,9,28,I become afraid of all my pains and sorrows [yet to come] for I know You will not pronounce me innocent [by removing them].
Job,9,29,I shall be held guilty and be condemned; why then should I labor in vain [to appear innocent]?
Job,9,30,If I wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye
Job,9,31,Yet You will plunge me into the ditch and my own clothes will abhor me [and refuse to cover so foul a body].
Job,9,32,For [God] is not a [mere] man as I am that I should answer Him that we should come together in court.
Job,9,33,There is no umpire between us who might lay his hand upon us both [would that there were!]
Job,9,34,That He might take His rod away from [threatening] me and that the fear of Him might not terrify me.
Job,9,35,[Then] would I speak and not fear Him but I am not so in myself [to make me afraid were only a fair trial given me].
Job,10,1,I AM weary of my life and loathe it! I will give free expression to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,10,2,I will say to God Do not condemn me [do not make me guilty]! Show me why You contend with me.
Job,10,3,Does it seem good to You that You should oppress that You should despise and reject the work of Your hands and favor the schemes of the wicked?
Job,10,4,Have You eyes of flesh? Do You see as man sees?
Job,10,5,Are Your days as the days of man are Your years as man's [years]
Job,10,6,That You inquire after my iniquity and search for my sin--
Job,10,7,Although You know that I am not wicked or guilty and that there is none who can deliver me out of Your hand?
Job,10,8,Your hands have formed me and made me. Would You turn around and destroy me?
Job,10,9,Remember [earnestly] I beseech You that You have fashioned me as clay [out of the same earth material exquisitely and elaborately]. And will You bring me into dust again?
Job,10,10,Have You not poured me out like milk and curdled me like cheese?
Job,10,11,You have clothed me with skin and flesh and have knit me together with bones and sinews.
Job,10,12,You have granted me life and favor and Your providence has preserved my spirit.
Job,10,13,Yet these [the present evils] have You hid in Your heart [for me since my creation]; I know that this was with You [in Your purpose and thought].
Job,10,14,If I sin then You observe me and You will not acquit me from my iniquity and guilt.
Job,10,15,If I am wicked woe unto me! And if I am righteous yet must I not lift up my head for I am filled with disgrace and the sight of my affliction.
Job,10,16,If I lift myself up You hunt me like a lion and again show Yourself [inflicting] marvelous [trials] upon me.
Job,10,17,You renew Your witnesses against me and increase Your indignation toward me; I am as if attacked by a troop time after time.
Job,10,18,Why then did You bring me forth out of the womb? Would that I had perished and no eye had seen me!
Job,10,19,I should have been as though I had not existed; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
Job,10,20,Are not my days few? Cease then and let me alone that I may take a little comfort and cheer up
Job,10,21,Before I go whence I shall not return even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death
Job,10,22,The land of sunless gloom as intense darkness [the land] of the shadow of death without any order and where the light is as thick darkness.
Job,11,1,THEN ZOPHAR the Naamathite replied
Job,11,2,Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk [and making such great professions] be pronounced free from guilt or blame?
Job,11,3,Should your boastings and babble make men keep silent? And when you mock and scoff shall no man make you ashamed?
Job,11,4,For you have said My doctrine [that God afflicts the righteous knowingly] is pure and I am clean in [God's] eyes.
Job,11,5,But oh that God would speak and open His lips against you
Job,11,6,And that He would show you the secrets of wisdom! For He is manifold in understanding! Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your guilt and iniquity [deserve].
Job,11,7,Can you find out the deep things of God or can you by searching find out the limits of the Almighty [explore His depths ascend to His heights extend to His breadths and comprehend His infinite perfection]?
Job,11,8,His wisdom is as high as the heights of heaven! What can you do? It is deeper than Sheol (the place of the dead)! What can you know?
Job,11,9,Longer in measure [and scope] is it than the earth and broader than the sea.
Job,11,10,If [God] sweeps in and arrests and calls into judgment who can hinder Him? [If He is against a man who shall call Him to account for it?]
Job,11,11,For He recognizes and knows hollow wicked and useless men (men of falsehood); when He sees iniquity will He not consider it?
Job,11,12,But a stupid man will get wisdom [only] when a wild donkey's colt is born a man [as when he thinks himself free because he is lifted up in pride].
Job,11,13,If you set your heart aright and stretch out your hands to [God]
Job,11,14,If you put sin out of your hand and far away from you and let not evil dwell in your tents;
Job,11,15,Then can you lift up your face to Him without stain [of sin and unashamed]; yes you shall be steadfast and secure; you shall not fear.
Job,11,16,For you shall forget your misery; you shall remember it as waters that pass away.
Job,11,17,And [your] life shall be clearer than the noonday and rise above it; though there be darkness it shall be as the morning.
Job,11,18,And you shall be secure and feel confident because there is hope; yes you shall search about you and you shall take your rest in safety.
Job,11,19,You shall lie down and none shall make you afraid; yes many shall sue for your favor.
Job,11,20,But the eyes of the wicked shall look [for relief] in vain and they shall not escape [the justice of God]; and their hope shall be to give up the ghost.
Job,12,1,THEN JOB answered
Job,12,2,No doubt you are the [only wise] people [in the world] and wisdom will die with you!
Job,12,3,But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these [of God's wisdom and might]?
Job,12,4,I am become one who is a laughingstock to his friend; I one whom God answered when he called upon Him--a just upright (blameless) man--laughed to scorn!
Job,12,5,In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune--but it is ready for those whose feet slip.
Job,12,6,The dwellings of robbers prosper; those who provoke God are [apparently] secure; God supplies them abundantly [who have no god but their own hands and power].
Job,12,7,For ask now the animals and they will teach you [that God does not deal with His creatures according to their character]; ask the birds of the air and they will tell you;
Job,12,8,Or speak to the earth [with its other forms of life] and it will teach you; and the fish of the sea will declare [this truth] to you.
Job,12,9,Who [is so blind as] not to recognize in all these [that good and evil are promiscuously scattered throughout nature and human life] that it is God's hand which does it [and God's way]?
Job,12,10,In His hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind.
Job,12,11,Is it not the task of the ear to discriminate between [wise and unwise] words just as the mouth distinguishes [between desirable and undesirable] food?
Job,12,12,With the aged [you say] is wisdom and with length of days comes understanding.
Job,12,13,But [only] with [God] are [perfect] wisdom and might; He [alone] has [true] counsel and understanding.
Job,12,14,Behold He tears down and it cannot be built again; He shuts a man in and none can open.
Job,12,15,He withholds the waters and the land dries up; again He sends forth [rains] and they overwhelm the land or transform it.
Job,12,16,With Him are might and wisdom; the deceived and the deceiver are His [and in His power].
Job,12,17,He leads [great and scheming] counselors away stripped and barefoot and makes the judges fools [in human estimation by overthrowing their plans].
Job,12,18,He looses the fetters [ordered] by kings and has [the] waistcloth [of a slave] bound about their [own] loins.
Job,12,19,He leads away priests as spoil and men firmly seated He overturns.
Job,12,20,He deprives of speech those who are trusted and takes away the discernment and discretion of the aged.
Job,12,21,He pours contempt on princes and loosens the belt of the strong [disabling them bringing low the pride of the learned].
Job,12,22,He uncovers deep things out of darkness and brings into light black gloom and the shadow of death.
Job,12,23,He makes nations great and He destroys them; He enlarges nations [and then straitens and shrinks them again] and leads them [away captive].
Job,12,24,He takes away understanding from the leaders of the people of the land and of the earth and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no path.
Job,12,25,They grope in the dark without light and He makes them to stagger and wander like a drunken man.
Job,13,1,[JOB CONTINUED:] Behold my eye has seen all this my ear has heard and understood it.
Job,13,2,What you know I also know; I am not inferior to you.
Job,13,3,Surely I wish to speak to the Almighty and I desire to argue and reason my case with God [that He may explain the conflict between what I believe of Him and what I see of Him].
Job,13,4,But you are forgers of lies [you defame my character most untruthfully]; you are all physicians of no value and have no remedy to offer.
Job,13,5,Oh that you would altogether hold your peace! Then you would evidence your wisdom and you might pass for wise men.
Job,13,6,Hear now my reasoning and listen to the pleadings of my lips.
Job,13,7,Will you speak unrighteously for God and talk deceitfully for Him?
Job,13,8,Will you show partiality to Him [be unjust to me in order to gain favor with Him]? Will you act as special pleaders for God?
Job,13,9,Would it be profitable for you if He should investigate your tactics [with me]? Or as one deceives and mocks a man do you deceive and mock Him?
Job,13,10,He will surely reprove you if you do secretly show partiality.
Job,13,11,Shall not His majesty make you afraid and should not your awe for Him restrain you?
Job,13,12,Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes [valueless]; your defenses are defenses of clay [and will crumble].
Job,13,13,Hold your peace! Let me alone so I may speak; and let come on me what may.
Job,13,14,Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hands [incurring the danger of God's wrath]?
Job,13,15,[I do it because though He slay me yet will I wait for and trust Him and] behold He will slay me; I have no hope--nevertheless I will maintain and argue my ways before Him and even to His face.
Job,13,16,This will be my salvation that a polluted and godless man shall not come before Him.
Job,13,17,Listen diligently to my speech and let my declaration be in your ears.
Job,13,18,Behold now I have prepared my case; I know that I shall be justified and vindicated.
Job,13,19,Who is he who will argue against and refute me? For then I would hold my peace and expire.
Job,13,20,Only [O Lord] grant two conditions to me and then will I not hide myself from You:
Job,13,21,Withdraw Your hand and take this bodily suffering far from me; and let not my [reverent] dread of You terrify me.
Job,13,22,Then [Lord] call and I will answer or let me speak and You answer me.
Job,13,23,How many are my iniquities and sins [that so much sorrow should come to me]? Make me recognize and know my transgression and my sin.
Job,13,24,Why do You hide Your face [as if offended] and alienate me as if I were Your enemy?
Job,13,25,Will You harass and frighten a [poor helpless] leaf driven to and fro and will You pursue the chaff of the dry stubble?
Job,13,26,For You write bitter things against me [in Your bill of indictment] and make me inherit and be accountable now for the iniquities of my youth.
Job,13,27,You put my feet also in the stocks and observe critically all my paths; You set a circle and limit around the soles of my feet [which I must not overstep].
Job,13,28,And he wastes away as a rotten thing like a garment that is moth-eaten.
Job,14,1,MAN WHO is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.
Job,14,2,He comes forth like a flower and withers; he flees also like a shadow and continues not.
Job,14,3,And [Lord] do You open Your eyes upon such a one and bring me into judgment with You?
Job,14,4,Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one!
Job,14,5,Since a man's days are already determined and the number of his months is wholly in Your control and he cannot pass the bounds of his allotted time--
Job,14,6,[O God] turn from him [and cease to watch him so pitilessly]; let him rest until he has accomplished as does a hireling the appointed time for his day.
Job,14,7,For there is hope for a tree if it is cut down that it will sprout again and that the tender shoots of it will not cease. [But there is no such hope for man.]
Job,14,8,Though its roots grow old in the earth and its stock dies in the ground
Job,14,9,Yet through the scent [and breathing] of water [the stump of the tree] will bud and bring forth boughs like a young plant.
Job,14,10,But [the brave strong] man must die and lie prostrate; yes man breathes his last and where is he?
Job,14,11,As waters evaporate from the lake and the river drains and dries up
Job,14,12,So man lies down and does not rise [to his former state]. Till the heavens are no more men will not awake nor be raised [physically] out of their sleep.
Job,14,13,Oh that You would hide me in Sheol (the unseen state) that You would conceal me until Your wrath is past that You would set a definite time and then remember me earnestly [and imprint me on your heart]!
Job,14,14,If a man dies shall he live again? All the days of my warfare and service I will wait till my change and release shall come.
Job,14,15,[Then] You would call and I would answer You; You would yearn for [me] the work of Your hands.
Job,14,16,But now You number each of my steps and take note of my every sin.
Job,14,17,My transgression is sealed up in a bag and You glue up my iniquity [to preserve it in full for the day of reckoning].
Job,14,18,But as a mountain if it falls crumbles to nothing and as the rock is removed out of its place
Job,14,19,As waters wear away the stones and as floods wash away the soil of the earth so You [O Lord] destroy the hope of man.
Job,14,20,You prevail forever against him and he passes on; You change his appearance [in death] and send him away [from the presence of the living].
Job,14,21,His sons come to honor and he knows it not; they are brought low and he perceives it not.
Job,14,22,But his body [lamenting its decay in the grave] shall grieve over him and his soul shall mourn [over the body of clay which it once enlivened].
Job,15,1,THEN ELIPHAZ the Temanite answered [Job]
Job,15,2,Should a wise man utter such windy knowledge [as we have just heard] and fill himself with the east wind [of withering parching and violent accusations]?
Job,15,3,Should he reason with unprofitable talk? Or with speeches with which he can do no good?
Job,15,4,Indeed you are doing away with [reverential] fear and you are hindering and diminishing meditation and devotion before God.
Job,15,5,For your iniquity teaches your mouth and you choose the tongue of the crafty.
Job,15,6,Your own mouth condemns you and not I; yes your own lips testify against you.
Job,15,7,Are you the first man that was born [the original wise man]? Or were you created before the hills?
Job,15,8,Were you present to hear the secret counsel of God? And do you limit [the possession of] wisdom to yourself?
Job,15,9,What do you know that we know not? What do you understand that is not equally clear to us?
Job,15,10,Among us are both the gray-haired and the aged older than your father by far.
Job,15,11,Are God's consolations [as we have interpreted them to you] too trivial for you? Is there any secret thing (any bosom sin) which you have not given up? [Or] were we too gentle [in our first speech] toward you to be effective?
Job,15,12,Why does your heart carry you away [why allow yourself to be controlled by feeling]? And why do your eyes flash [in anger or contempt]
Job,15,13,That you turn your spirit against God and let [such] words [as you have spoken] go out of your mouth?
Job,15,14,What is man that he could be pure and clean? And he who is born of a woman that he could be right and just?
Job,15,15,Behold [God] puts no trust in His holy ones [the angels]; indeed the heavens are not clean in His sight--
Job,15,16,How much less that which is abominable and corrupt a man who drinks iniquity like water?
Job,15,17,I will show you hear me; and that which I have seen I will relate
Job,15,18,What wise men have not hid but have freely communicated; it was told to them by their fathers
Job,15,19,Unto whom alone the land was given and no stranger intruded or passed among them [corrupting the truth].
Job,15,20,The wicked man suffers with [self-inflicted] torment all his days through all the years that are numbered and laid up for him the oppressor.
Job,15,21,A [dreadful] sound of terrors is in his ears; in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him [the dwellings of robbers are not at peace].
Job,15,22,He believes that he will not return out of darkness and [because of his guilt] he is waited for by the sword [of God's vengeance].
Job,15,23,He wanders abroad for food saying Where is it? He knows that the day of darkness and destruction is already close upon him.
Job,15,24,Distress and anguish terrify him; [he knows] they shall prevail against him like a king ready for battle.
Job,15,25,Because he has stretched out his hand against God and bids defiance and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty
Job,15,26,Running stubbornly against Him with a thickly ornamented shield;
Job,15,27,Because he has covered his face with his fat adding layers of fat on his loins [giving himself up to animal pleasures]
Job,15,28,And has lived in desolate [God-forsaken] cities and in houses which no man should inhabit which were destined to become heaps [of ruins];
Job,15,29,He shall not be rich neither shall his wealth last neither shall his produce bend to the earth nor his possessions be extended on the earth.
Job,15,30,He shall not depart out of darkness [and escape from calamity; the wrath of God] shall consume him as flame consumes a dry tree and by the blast of His mouth he shall be swept away.
Job,15,31,Let him not deceive himself and trust in vanity (emptiness falseness and futility) for these shall be his recompense [for such living].
Job,15,32,It shall be accomplished and paid in full while he still lives and his branch shall not be green [but shall wither away].
Job,15,33,He shall fail to bring his grapes to maturity [leaving them to wither unnourished] on the vine and shall cast off blossoms [and fail to bring forth fruit] like the olive tree.
Job,15,34,For the company of the godless shall be barren and fire shall consume the tents of bribery (wrong and injustice).
Job,15,35,They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity and their inmost soul hatches deceit.
Job,16,1,THEN JOB answered
Job,16,2,I have heard many such things; wearisome and miserable comforters are you all!
Job,16,3,Will your futile words of wind have no end? Or what makes you so bold to answer [me like this]?
Job,16,4,I also could speak as you do if you were in my stead; I could join words together against you and shake my head at you.
Job,16,5,[But] I would strengthen and encourage you with [the words of] my mouth and the consolation of my lips would soothe your suffering.
Job,16,6,If I speak [to you miserable comforters] my sorrow is not soothed or lessened; and if I refrain [from speaking] in what way am I eased? [I hardly know whether to answer you or be silent.]
Job,16,7,But now [God] has taken away my strength. You [O Lord] have made desolate all my family and associates.
Job,16,8,You have laid firm hold on me and have shriveled me up which is a witness against me; and my leanness [and wretched state of body] are further evidence [against me]; [they] testify to my face.
Job,16,9,[ My adversary Satan] has torn [me] in his wrath and hated and persecuted me; he has gnashed upon me with his teeth; my adversary sharpens his eyes against me.
Job,16,10,[The forces of evil] have gaped at me with their mouths; they have struck me upon the cheek insolently; they massed themselves together and conspired unanimously against me.
Job,16,11,God has delivered me to the ungodly (to the evil one) and cast me [headlong] into the hands of the wicked (Satan's host).
Job,16,12,I was living at ease but [Satan] crushed me and broke me apart; yes he seized me by the neck and dashed me in pieces; then he set me up for his target.
Job,16,13,[Satan's] arrows whiz around me. He slashes open my vitals and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground.
Job,16,14,[Satan] stabs me making breach after breach and attacking again and again; he runs at me like a giant and irresistible warrior.
Job,16,15,I have sewed sackcloth over my skin [as a sign of mourning] and have defiled my horn (my insignia of strength) in the dust.
Job,16,16,My face is red and swollen with weeping and on my eyelids is the shadow of death [my eyes are dimmed]
Job,16,17,Although there is no guilt or violence in my hands and my prayer is pure.
Job,16,18,O earth cover not my blood and let my cry have no resting-place [where it will cease being heard].
Job,16,19,Even now behold my Witness is in heaven and He who vouches for me is on high.
Job,16,20,My friends scorn me but my eye pours out tears to God.
Job,16,21,Oh that there might be one who would plead for a man with God and that he would maintain his right with Him as a son of man pleads with or for his neighbor!
Job,16,22,For when a few years are come I shall go the way from which I shall not return.
Job,17,1,MY SPIRIT is broken my days are spent (snuffed out); the grave is ready for me.
Job,17,2,Surely there are mockers and mockery around me and my eye dwells on their obstinacy insults and resistance.
Job,17,3,Give me a pledge with Yourself [acknowledge my innocence before my death]; who is there that will give security for me?
Job,17,4,But their hearts [Lord] You have closed to understanding; therefore You will not let them triumph [by giving them a verdict against me].
Job,17,5,He who denounces his friends [in order to make them] a prey and get a share the eyes of his children shall fail [to find food].
Job,17,6,But He has made me a byword among the people and they spit before my face.
Job,17,7,My eye has grown dim because of grief and all my members are [wasted away] like a shadow.
Job,17,8,Upright men shall be astonished and appalled at this and the innocent shall stir himself up against the godless and polluted.
Job,17,9,Yet shall the righteous (those upright and in right standing with God) hold to their ways and he who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger.
Job,17,10,But as for you come on again all of you though I find not a wise man among you.
Job,17,11,My days are past my purposes and plans are frustrated; even the thoughts (desires and possessions) of my heart [are broken off].
Job,17,12,These [thoughts] extend from the night into the day [so that] the light is short because of darkness.
Job,17,13,But if I look to Sheol (the unseen state) as my abode if I spread my couch in the darkness
Job,17,14,If I say to the grave and corruption You are my father and to the worm [that feeds on decay] You are my mother and my sister [because I will soon be closest to you]
Job,17,15,Where then is my hope? And if I have hope who will see [its fulfillment]?
Job,17,16,[My hope] shall go down to the bars of Sheol (the unseen state) when once there is rest in the dust.
Job,18,1,THEN BILDAD the Shuhite answered
Job,18,2,How long will you lay snares for words and have to hunt for your argument? Do some clear thinking and then we will reply.
Job,18,3,Why are we counted as beasts [as if we had no sense]? Why are we unclean in your sight?
Job,18,4,You who tear yourself in your anger shall the earth be forsaken for you or the rock be removed out of its place?
Job,18,5,Yes the light of the wicked shall be put out and the flame of his fire shall not shine.
Job,18,6,The light shall be dark in his dwelling and his lamp beside him shall be put out.
Job,18,7,The steps of his strength shall be shortened and his own counsel and the plans in which he trusted shall bring about his downfall.
Job,18,8,For the wicked is cast into a net by his own feet and he walks upon a lattice-covered pit.
Job,18,9,A trap will catch him by the heel and a snare will lay hold on him.
Job,18,10,A noose is hidden for him on the ground and a trap for him in the way.
Job,18,11,Terrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall chase him at his heels.
Job,18,12,The strength [of the wicked] shall be hunger-bitten and calamity is ready at his side [if he halts].
Job,18,13,By disease his strength and his skin shall be devoured; the firstborn of death [the worst of diseases] shall consume his limbs.
Job,18,14,He shall be rooted out of his dwelling place in which he trusted and he shall be brought to the king of terrors [death].
Job,18,15,There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his [family]; sulphur shall be scattered over his dwelling [to purify it after his going].
Job,18,16,The roots [of the wicked] shall be dried up beneath and above shall his branch be cut off and wither.
Job,18,17,His remembrance shall perish from the earth and he shall have no name in the street.
Job,18,18,He shall be thrust from light into darkness and driven out of the world.
Job,18,19,He shall neither have son nor grandson among his people nor any remaining where he sojourned.
Job,18,20,They [of the west] that come after [the wicked man] shall be astonished and appalled at his day as they [of the east] that went before were seized with horror.
Job,18,21,Surely such are the dwellings of the ungodly and such is the place of him who knows not (recognizes not and honors not) God.
Job,19,1,THEN JOB answered:
Job,19,2,How long will you vex and torment me and break me in pieces with words?
Job,19,3,These ten times you have reproached me; you are not ashamed that you make yourselves strange [harden yourselves against me and deal severely with me].
Job,19,4,And if it were true that I have erred my error would remain with me [I would be conscious of it].
Job,19,5,If indeed you magnify yourselves against me and plead against me my reproach and humiliation
Job,19,6,Know that God has overthrown and put me in the wrong and has closed His net about me.
Job,19,7,Behold I cry out Violence! but I am not heard; I cry aloud for help but there is no justice.
Job,19,8,He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass and He has set darkness upon my paths.
Job,19,9,He has stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head.
Job,19,10,He has broken me down on every side and I am gone; my hope has He pulled up like a tree.
Job,19,11,He has also kindled His wrath against me and He counts me as one of His adversaries.
Job,19,12,His troops come together and cast up their way and siege works against me and encamp round about my tent.
Job,19,13,He has put my brethren far from me and my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.
Job,19,14,My kinsfolk have failed me and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
Job,19,15,Those who live temporarily in my house and my maids count me as a stranger; I am an alien in their sight.
Job,19,16,I call to my servant but he gives me no answer though I beseech him with words.
Job,19,17,I am repulsive to my wife and loathsome to the children of my own mother.
Job,19,18,Even young children despise me; when I get up they speak against me.
Job,19,19,All the men of my council and my familiar friends abhor me; those whom I loved are turned against me.
Job,19,20,My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh and I have escaped with the skin or gums of my teeth.
Job,19,21,Have pity on me! Have pity on me O you my friends for the hand of God has touched me!
Job,19,22,Why do you as if you were God pursue and persecute me? [Acting like wild beasts] why are you not satisfied with my flesh?
Job,19,23,Oh that the words I now speak were written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book [carved on a tablet of stone]!
Job,19,24,That with an iron pen and [molten] lead they were graven in the rock forever!
Job,19,25,For I know that my Redeemer and Vindicator lives and at last He [the Last One] will stand upon the earth.
Job,19,26,And after my skin even this body has been destroyed then from my flesh or without it I shall see God
Job,19,27,Whom I even I shall see for myself and on my side! And my eyes shall behold Him and not as a stranger! My heart pines away and is consumed within me.
Job,19,28,If you say How we will pursue him! [and continue to persecute me with the claim] that the root [cause] of all these [afflictions] is found in me
Job,19,29,Then beware and be afraid of the sword [of divine vengeance] for wrathful are the punishments of that sword that you may know there is a judgment.
Job,20,1,THEN ZOPHAR the Naamathite answered
Job,20,2,Therefore do my thoughts give me an answer and I make haste [to offer it] for this reason.
Job,20,3,I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame but out of my understanding my spirit answers me.
Job,20,4,Do you not know from of old since the time that man was placed on the earth
Job,20,5,That the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the godless and defiled is but for a moment?
Job,20,6,Though his [proud] height mounts up to the heavens and his head reaches to the clouds
Job,20,7,Yet he will perish forever like his own dung; those who have seen him will say Where is he?
Job,20,8,He will fly away like a dream and will not be found; yes he will be chased away as a vision of the night.
Job,20,9,The eye which saw him will see him no more neither will his [accustomed] place any more behold him.
Job,20,10,The poor will oppress his children and his hands will give back his [ill-gotten] wealth.
Job,20,11,His bones are full of youthful energy but it will lie down with him in the dust.
Job,20,12,Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth though he hides it under his tongue
Job,20,13,Though he is loath to let it go but keeps it still within his mouth
Job,20,14,Yet his food turns [to poison] in his stomach; it is the venom of asps within him.
Job,20,15,He has swallowed down [his ill-gotten] riches and he shall vomit them up again; God will cast them out of his belly.
Job,20,16,He shall suck the poison of asps [which ill-gotten wealth contains]; the viper's tongue shall slay him.
Job,20,17,He shall not look upon the rivers the flowing streams of honey and butter [to enjoy his wealth].
Job,20,18,That which he labored for shall he give back and shall not swallow it down [to enjoy it]; according to his wealth shall the restitution be and he shall not rejoice in it.
Job,20,19,For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; he has violently taken away a house which he did not build.
Job,20,20,Because his desire and greed knew no quietness within him he will not save anything of that in which he delights.
Job,20,21,There was nothing left that he did not devour; therefore his prosperity will not endure.
Job,20,22,In the fullness of his sufficiency [in the time of his great abundance] he shall be poor and in straits; every hand of everyone who is in misery shall come upon him [he is but a wretch on every side].
Job,20,23,When he is about to fill his belly [as in the wilderness when God sent the quails] God will cast the fierceness of His wrath upon him and will rain it upon him while he is eating.
Job,20,24,He will flee from the iron weapon but the bow of bronze shall strike him through.
Job,20,25,[The arrow] is drawn forth and it comes out after passing through his body; yes the glittering point comes out of his gall. Terrors march in upon him;
Job,20,26,Every misfortune is laid up for his treasures. A fire not blown by man shall devour him; it shall consume what is left in his tent [and it shall go ill with him who remains there].
Job,20,27,The heavens shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise up against him.
Job,20,28,The produce and increase of his house will go into exile [with the victors] dragged away in the day of [God's] wrath.
Job,20,29,This is the wicked man's portion from God and the heritage appointed to him by God.
Job,21,1,THEN JOB answered
Job,21,2,Hear diligently my speech and let this [your attention] be your consolation [given me].
Job,21,3,Allow me and I also will speak; and after I have spoken mock on.
Job,21,4,As for me is my complaint to man or of him? And why should I not be impatient and my spirit be troubled?
Job,21,5,Look at me and be astonished (appalled); and lay your hand upon your mouth.
Job,21,6,Even when I remember I am troubled and afraid; horror and trembling take hold of my flesh.
Job,21,7,Why do the wicked live become old and become mighty in power?
Job,21,8,Their children are established with them in their sight and their offspring before their eyes.
Job,21,9,Their houses are safe and in peace without fear; neither is the rod of God upon them.
Job,21,10,Their bull breeds and fails not; their cows calve and do not miscarry.
Job,21,11,They send forth their little ones like a flock and their children skip about.
Job,21,12,They themselves lift up their voices and sing to the tambourine and the lyre and rejoice to the sound of the pipe.
Job,21,13,They spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol (the unseen state) in a moment and peacefully.
Job,21,14,Yet they say to God Depart from us for we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.
Job,21,15,Who is the Almighty that we should serve Him? And what profit do we have if we pray to Him?
Job,21,16,But notice [you say] the prosperity of the wicked is not in their power; the mystery [of God's dealings] with the ungodly is far from my comprehension.
Job,21,17,How often [then] is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity comes upon them? That God distributes pains and sorrows to them in His anger?
Job,21,18,That they are like stubble before the wind and like chaff that the storm steals and carries away?
Job,21,19,You say God lays up [the punishment of the wicked man's] iniquity for his children. Let Him recompense it to the man himself that he may know and feel it.
Job,21,20,Let his own eyes see his destruction and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
Job,21,21,For what pleasure or interest has a man in his house and family after he is dead when the number of his months is cut off?
Job,21,22,Shall any teach God knowledge seeing that He judges those who are on high?
Job,21,23,One dies in his full strength being wholly at ease and quiet;
Job,21,24,His pails are full of milk [his veins are filled with nourishment] and the marrow of his bones is fresh and moist
Job,21,25,Whereas another man dies in bitterness of soul and never tastes of pleasure or good fortune.
Job,21,26,They lie down alike in the dust and the worm spreads a covering over them.
Job,21,27,Behold I know your thoughts and plans and the devices with which you would wrong me.
Job,21,28,For you say Where is the house of the rich and liberal prince [meaning me]? And where is the tent in which the wicked [Job] dwelt?
Job,21,29,Have you not asked those who travel this way and do you not accept their testimony and evidences--
Job,21,30,That the evil man is [now] spared in the day of calamity and destruction and they are led forth and away on the day of [God's] wrath?
Job,21,31,But who declares [a man's] way [and rebukes] him to his face? And who pays him back for what he has done?
Job,21,32,When he is borne to the grave watch is kept over his tomb.
Job,21,33,The clods of the valley are sweet to him and every man shall follow him to a grave as innumerable people [have gone] before him.
Job,21,34,How then can you comfort me with empty and futile words since in your replies there lurks falsehood?
Job,22,1,THEN ELIPHAZ the Temanite answered [Job]
Job,22,2,Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he that is wise is profitable to himself.
Job,22,3,Is it any pleasure or advantage to the Almighty that you are righteous (upright and in right standing with Him)? Or is it gain to Him that you make your ways perfect?
Job,22,4,Is it for your [reverential] fear of Him that He [thus] reproves you that He enters with you into judgment?
Job,22,5,Is not your wickedness great? There is no end to your iniquities.
Job,22,6,For you have taken pledges of your brother for nothing and stripped the naked of their clothing.
Job,22,7,You have not given water to the weary to drink and you have withheld bread from the hungry.
Job,22,8,But [you Job] the man with power possessed the land and the favored and accepted man dwelt in it.
Job,22,9,You have sent widows away empty-handed and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
Job,22,10,Therefore snares are round about you and sudden fear troubles and overwhelms you;
Job,22,11,Your light is darkened so that you cannot see and a flood of water covers you.
Job,22,12,Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars how high they are!
Job,22,13,Therefore you say How and what does God know [about me]? Can He judge through the thick darkness?
Job,22,14,Thick clouds are a covering to Him so that He does not see and He walks on the vault of the heavens.
Job,22,15,Will you pay attention and keep to the old way that wicked men trod [in Noah's time]
Job,22,16,Men who were snatched away before their time whose foundations were poured out like a stream [during the flood]?
Job,22,17,They said to God Depart from us and What can the Almighty do for or to us?
Job,22,18,Yet He filled their houses with good [things]. But the counsel of the ungodly is far from me.
Job,22,19,The righteous see it and are glad; and the innocent laugh them to scorn [saying]
Job,22,20,Surely those who rose up against us are cut off and that which remained to them the fire has consumed.
Job,22,21,Acquaint now yourself with Him [agree with God and show yourself to be conformed to His will] and be at peace; by that [you shall prosper and great] good shall come to you.
Job,22,22,Receive I pray you the law and instruction from His mouth and lay up His words in your heart.
Job,22,23,If you return to the Almighty [and submit and humble yourself before Him] you will be built up; if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents
Job,22,24,If you lay gold in the dust and the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brook [considering them of little worth]
Job,22,25,And make the Almighty your gold and [the Lord] your precious silver treasure
Job,22,26,Then you will have delight in the Almighty and you will lift up your face to God.
Job,22,27,You will make your prayer to Him and He will hear you and you will pay your vows.
Job,22,28,You shall also decide and decree a thing and it shall be established for you; and the light [of God's favor] shall shine upon your ways.
Job,22,29,When they make [you] low you will say [There is] a lifting up; and the humble person He lifts up and saves.
Job,22,30,He will even deliver the one [for whom you intercede] who is not innocent; yes he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.
Job,23,1,THEN JOB answered
Job,23,2,Even today is my complaint rebellious and bitter; my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
Job,23,3,Oh that I knew where I might find Him that I might come even to His seat!
Job,23,4,I would lay my cause before Him and fill my mouth with arguments.
Job,23,5,I would learn what He would answer me and understand what He would say to me.
Job,23,6,Would He plead against me with His great power? No He would give heed to me.
Job,23,7,There the righteous [one who is upright and in right standing with God] could reason with Him; so I should be acquitted by my Judge forever.
Job,23,8,Behold I go forward [and to the east] but He is not there; I go backward [and to the west] but I cannot perceive Him;
Job,23,9,On the left hand [and to the north] where He works [I seek Him] but I cannot behold Him; He turns Himself to the right hand [and to the south] but I cannot see Him.
Job,23,10,But He knows the way that I take [He has concern for it appreciates and pays attention to it]. When He has tried me I shall come forth as refined gold [pure and luminous].
Job,23,11,My foot has held fast to His steps; His ways have I kept and not turned aside.
Job,23,12,I have not gone back from the commandment of His lips; I have esteemed and treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.
Job,23,13,But He is unchangeable and who can turn Him? And what He wants to do that He does.
Job,23,14,For He performs [that which He has] planned for me and of many such matters He is mindful.
Job,23,15,Therefore am I troubled and terrified at His presence; when I consider I am in dread and afraid of Him.
Job,23,16,For God has made my heart faint timid and broken and the Almighty has terrified me
Job,23,17,Because I was not cut off before the darkness [of these woes befell me] neither has He covered the thick darkness from my face.
Job,24,1,WHY [seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty] does He not set seasons for judgment? Why do those who know Him see not His days [for punishment of the wicked]?
Job,24,2,Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks and pasture them [appropriating land and flocks openly].
Job,24,3,They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
Job,24,4,They crowd the poor and needy off the road; the poor and meek of the earth all hide themselves.
Job,24,5,Behold as wild asses in the desert [the poor] go forth to their work seeking diligently for prey and food; the wilderness yields them bread for their children [in roots and herbage].
Job,24,6,They reap each one his fodder in a field [that is not his own] and they glean the vintage of the wicked man.
Job,24,7,They lie all night naked without clothing and have no covering in the cold.
Job,24,8,They are wet with the showers of the mountains and cling to the rock for want of shelter.
Job,24,9,[The violent men whose wickedness seems unnoticed] pluck the fatherless infants from the breast [to sell or make them slaves] and take [the clothing on] the poor for a pledge
Job,24,10,So that the needy go about naked for lack of clothing and though hungry they must carry [but not eat from] the sheaves.
Job,24,11,Among the olive rows [of the wicked the poor] make oil; they tread [the fresh juice of the grape from] the presses but suffer thirst.
Job,24,12,From out of the populous city men groan and the very life of the wounded cries for help; yet God [seemingly] regards not the wrong done them.
Job,24,13,These wrongdoers are of those who rebel against the light; they know not its ways nor stay in its paths.
Job,24,14,The murderer rises with the light; he kills the poor and the needy and in the night he becomes as a thief.
Job,24,15,The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight saying No eye shall see me and he puts a disguise upon his face.
Job,24,16,In the dark they dig through [the penetrable walls of] houses; by day they shut themselves up; they do not know the sunlight.
Job,24,17,For midnight is morning to all of them; for they are familiar with the terrors of deep darkness.
Job,24,18,[You say] Swiftly such men pass away on the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth; [no treader] turns into their vineyards.
Job,24,19,Drought and heat consume the snow waters; so does Sheol (the place of the dead) those who have sinned.
Job,24,20,The womb shall forget him the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered and unrighteousness shall be broken like a tree [which cannot be healed].
Job,24,21,[The evil man] preys upon the barren childless woman and does no good to the widow.
Job,24,22,Yet [God] prolongs the life of the [wicked] mighty by His power; they rise up when they had despaired of life.
Job,24,23,God gives them security and they rest on it; and His eyes are upon their ways.
Job,24,24,They are exalted for a little while and then are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all others are and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.
Job,24,25,And if this is not so who will prove me a liar and make my speech worthless?
Job,25,1,THEN BILDAD the Shuhite answered
Job,25,2,Dominion and fear are with [God]; He makes peace in His high places.
Job,25,3,Is there any number to His armies? And upon whom does not His light arise?
Job,25,4,How then can man be justified and righteous before God? Or how can he who is born of a woman be pure and clean?
Job,25,5,Behold even the moon has no brightness [compared to God's glory] and the stars are not pure in His sight--
Job,25,6,How much less man who is a maggot! And a son of man who is a worm!
Job,26,1,BUT JOB answered
Job,26,2,How you have helped him who is without power! How you have sustained the arm that is without strength!
Job,26,3,How you have counseled him who has no wisdom! And how plentifully you have declared to him sound knowledge!
Job,26,4,With whose assistance have you uttered these words? And whose spirit [inspired what] came forth from you?
Job,26,5,The shades of the dead tremble underneath the waters and their inhabitants.
Job,26,6,Sheol (the place of the dead) is naked before God and Abaddon (the place of destruction) has no covering [from His eyes].
Job,26,7,He it is Who spreads out the northern skies over emptiness and hangs the earth upon or over nothing.
Job,26,8,He holds the waters bound in His clouds [which otherwise would spill on earth all at once] and the cloud is not rent under them.
Job,26,9,He covers the face of His throne and spreads over it His cloud.
Job,26,10,He has placed an enclosing limit [the horizon] upon the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.
Job,26,11,The pillars of the heavens tremble and are astonished at His rebuke.
Job,26,12,He stills or stirs up the sea by His power and by His understanding He smites proud Rahab.
Job,26,13,By His breath the heavens are garnished; His hand pierced the [swiftly] fleeing serpent.
Job,26,14,Yet these are but [a small part of His doings] the outskirts of His ways or the mere fringes of His force the faintest whisper of His voice! Who dares contemplate or who can understand the thunders of His full magnificent power?
Job,27,1,JOB AGAIN took up his discourse and said
Job,27,2,As God lives Who has taken away my right and denied me justice and the Almighty Who has vexed and embittered my life
Job,27,3,As long as my life is still whole within me and the breath of God is [yet] in my nostrils
Job,27,4,My lips shall not speak untruth nor shall my tongue utter deceit.
Job,27,5,God forbid that I should justify you--saying you are right [in your accusations against me]; till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
Job,27,6,My uprightness and my right standing with God I hold fast and will not let them go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days and it shall not reproach me as long as I live.
Job,27,7,Let my enemy be as the wicked and let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.
Job,27,8,For what is the hope of the godless and polluted even though he has gained [in this world] when God cuts him off and takes away his life?
Job,27,9,Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him?
Job,27,10,Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?
Job,27,11,I will teach you regarding the hand and handiwork of God; that which is with the Almighty [God's actual treatment of the wicked man] will I not conceal.
Job,27,12,Behold all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain [cherishing foolish notions]?
Job,27,13,This [which I am about to tell] is the portion of a wicked man with God and the heritage which oppressors shall receive from the Almighty:
Job,27,14,If his children are multiplied it is for the sword; and his offspring will not have sufficient bread.
Job,27,15,Those who survive him [the pestilence] will bury and [their] widows will make no lamentation.
Job,27,16,Though he heaps up silver like dust and piles up clothing like clay
Job,27,17,He may prepare it but the just will wear it and the innocent will divide the silver.
Job,27,18,He builds his house like a moth or a spider like a booth which a watchman makes [to last for a season].
Job,27,19,[The wicked] will lie down rich but does it not again; he opens his eyes and [his wealth] is gone.
Job,27,20,Terrors overtake him like a [suddenly loosened] flood; a windstorm steals him away in the night.
Job,27,21,The east wind lifts him up and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.
Job,27,22,For [God and the storm] hurl at him without pity and unsparingly [their thunderbolts of wrath]; he flees in haste before His power.
Job,27,23,[God causes] men to clap their hands at him [in malignant joy] and hiss him out of his place.
Job,28,1,SURELY THERE is a mine for silver and a place for gold where they refine it.
Job,28,2,Iron is taken out of the earth and copper is smelted from the stone ore.
Job,28,3,Man sets an end to darkness and he searches out the farthest bounds for the ore buried in gloom and deep darkness.
Job,28,4,Men break open shafts away from where people sojourn in places forgotten by [human] foot; and [descend into them] hanging afar from men they swing or flit to and fro.
Job,28,5,As for the earth out of it comes bread but underneath [its surface down deep in the mine] there is blasting turning it up as by fire.
Job,28,6,Its stones are the bed of sapphires; it holds dust of gold [which he wins].
Job,28,7,That path no bird of prey knows and the falcon's eye has not seen it.
Job,28,8,The proud beasts [and their young] have not trodden it nor has the fierce lion passed over it.
Job,28,9,Man puts forth his hand upon the flinty rock; he overturns the mountains by the roots.
Job,28,10,He cuts out channels and passages among the rocks; and his eye sees every precious thing.
Job,28,11,[Man] binds the streams so that they do not trickle [into the mine] and the thing that is hidden he brings forth to light.
Job,28,12,But where shall Wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,13,Man knows not the price of it; neither is it found in the land of the living.
Job,28,14,The deep says [Wisdom] is not in me; and the sea says It is not with me.
Job,28,15,It cannot be gotten for gold neither shall silver be weighed for the price of it.
Job,28,16,It cannot be valued in [terms of] the gold of Ophir in the precious onyx or beryl or the sapphire.
Job,28,17,Gold and glass cannot equal [Wisdom] nor can it be exchanged for jewels or vessels of fine gold.
Job,28,18,No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; for the possession of Wisdom is even above rubies or pearls.
Job,28,19,The topaz of Ethiopia cannot compare with it nor can it be valued in pure gold.
Job,28,20,From where then does Wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,21,It is hidden from the eyes of all living and knowledge of it is withheld from the birds of the heavens.
Job,28,22,Abaddon (the place of destruction) and Death say We have [only] heard the report of it with our ears.
Job,28,23,God understands the way [to Wisdom] and He knows the place of it [Wisdom is with God alone].
Job,28,24,For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.
Job,28,25,When He gave to the wind weight or pressure and allotted the waters by measure
Job,28,26,When He made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder
Job,28,27,Then He saw [Wisdom] and declared it; He established it yes and searched it out [for His own use and He alone possesses it].
Job,28,28,But to man He said Behold the reverential and worshipful fear of the Lord--that is Wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
Job,29,1,AND JOB again took up his discussion and said
Job,29,2,Oh that I were as in the months of old as in the days when God watched over me
Job,29,3,When His lamp shone above and upon my head and by His light I walked through darkness;
Job,29,4,As I was in the [prime] ripeness of my days when the friendship and counsel of God were over my tent
Job,29,5,When the Almighty was yet with me and my children were about me
Job,29,6,When my steps [through rich pasturage] were washed with butter and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!
Job,29,7,When I went out to the gate of the city when I prepared my seat in the street [the broad place for the council at the city's gate]
Job,29,8,The young men saw me and hid themselves; the aged rose up and stood;
Job,29,9,The princes refrained from talking and laid their hands on their mouths;
Job,29,10,The voices of the nobles were hushed and their tongues cleaved to the roof of their mouths.
Job,29,11,For when the ear heard it called me happy and blessed me; and when the eye saw it testified for me [approvingly]
Job,29,12,Because I delivered the poor who cried the fatherless and him who had none to help him.
Job,29,13,The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
Job,29,14,I put on righteousness and it clothed me or clothed itself with me; my justice was like a robe and a turban or a diadem or a crown!
Job,29,15,I was eyes to the blind and feet was I to the lame.
Job,29,16,I was a father to the poor and needy; the cause of him I did not know I searched out.
Job,29,17,And I broke the jaws or the big teeth of the unrighteous and plucked the prey out of his teeth.
Job,29,18,Then I said I shall die in or beside my nest and I shall multiply my days as the sand.
Job,29,19,My root is spread out and open to the waters and the dew lies all night upon my branch.
Job,29,20,My glory and honor are fresh in me [being constantly renewed] and my bow gains [ever] new strength in my hand.
Job,29,21,Men listened to me and waited and kept silence for my counsel.
Job,29,22,After I spoke they did not speak again and my speech dropped upon them [like a refreshing shower].
Job,29,23,And they waited for me as for the rain and they opened their mouths wide as for the spring rain.
Job,29,24,I smiled on them when they had no confidence and their depression did not cast down the light of my countenance.
Job,29,25,I chose their way [for them] and sat as [their] chief and dwelt like a king among his soldiers like one who comforts mourners.
Job,30,1,BUT NOW they who are younger than I have me in derision whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.
Job,30,2,Yes how could the strength of their hands profit me? They were men whose ripe age and vigor had perished.
Job,30,3,They are gaunt with want and famine; they gnaw the dry and barren ground or flee into the wilderness into the gloom of wasteness and desolation.
Job,30,4,They pluck saltwort or mallows among the bushes and roots of the broom for their food or to warm them.
Job,30,5,They are driven from among men who shout after them as after a thief.
Job,30,6,They must dwell in the clefts of frightful valleys (gullies made by torrents) and in holes of the earth and of the rocks.
Job,30,7,Among the bushes they bray and howl [like wild animals]; beneath the prickly scrub they fling themselves and huddle together.
Job,30,8,Sons of the worthless and nameless they have been scourged and crushed out of the land.
Job,30,9,And now I have become their song; yes I am a byword to them.
Job,30,10,They abhor me they stand aloof from me and do not refrain from spitting in my face or at the sight of me.
Job,30,11,For God has loosed my bowstring and afflicted and humbled me; they have cast off the bridle [of restraint] before me.
Job,30,12,On my right hand rises the rabble brood; they jostle me and push away my feet and they cast up against me their ways of destruction [like an advancing army].
Job,30,13,They break up and clutter my path [embarrassing my plans]; they urge on my calamity even though they have no helper [and are themselves helpless].
Job,30,14,As through a wide breach they come in; amid the crash [of falling walls] they roll themselves upon me.
Job,30,15,Terrors are turned upon me; my honor and reputation they chase away like the wind and my welfare has passed away as a cloud.
Job,30,16,And now my life is poured out within me; the days of affliction have gripped me.
Job,30,17,My bones are pierced [with aching] in the night season and the pains that gnaw me take no rest.
Job,30,18,By the great force [of my disease] my garment is disguised and disfigured; it binds me about like the collar of my coat.
Job,30,19,[God] has cast me into the mire and I have become like dust and ashes.
Job,30,20,I cry to You [Lord] and You do not answer me; I stand up but You [only] gaze [indifferently] at me.
Job,30,21,You have become harsh and cruel to me; with the might of Your hand You [keep me alive only to] persecute me.
Job,30,22,You lift me up on the wind; You cause me to ride upon it and You toss me about in the tempest.
Job,30,23,For I know that You will bring me to death and to the house [of meeting] appointed for all the living.
Job,30,24,However does not one falling in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand? Or in his calamity will he not therefore cry for help?
Job,30,25,Did not I weep for him who was in trouble? Was not my heart grieved for the poor and needy?
Job,30,26,But when I looked for good then evil came to me; and when I waited for light there came darkness.
Job,30,27,My heart is troubled and does not rest; days of affliction come to meet me.
Job,30,28,I go about blackened but not by the sun; I stand up in the congregation and cry for help.
Job,30,29,I am a brother to jackals [which howl] and a companion to ostriches [which scream dismally].
Job,30,30,My skin falls from me in blackened flakes and my bones are burned with heat.
Job,30,31,Therefore my lyre is turned to mourning and my pipe into the voice of those who weep.
Job,31,1,I DICTATED a covenant (an agreement) to my eyes; how then could I look [lustfully] upon a girl?
Job,31,2,For what portion should I have from God above [if I were lewd] and what heritage from the Almighty on high?
Job,31,3,Does not calamity [justly] befall the unrighteous and disaster the workers of iniquity?
Job,31,4,Does not [God] see my ways and count all my steps?
Job,31,5,If I have walked with falsehood or vanity or if my foot has hastened to deceit--
Job,31,6,Oh let me be weighed in a just balance and let Him weigh me that God may know my integrity!
Job,31,7,If my step has turned out of [God's] way and my heart has gone the way my eyes [covetously] invited and if any spot has stained my hands with guilt
Job,31,8,Then let me sow and let another eat; yes let the produce of my field or my offspring be rooted out.
Job,31,9,If my heart has been deceived and I made a fool by a woman or if I have [covetously] laid wait at my neighbor's door [until his departure]
Job,31,10,Then let my wife grind [meal like a bondslave] for another and let others bow down upon her.
Job,31,11,For [adultery] is a heinous and chief crime an iniquity [to demand action by] the judges and punishment.
Job,31,12,For [uncontrolled passion] is a fire which consumes to Abaddon (to destruction ruin and the place of final torment); [that fire once lighted would rage until all is consumed] and would burn to the root all my [life's] increase.
Job,31,13,If I have despised and rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant when they contended or brought a complaint against me
Job,31,14,What then shall I do when God rises up [to judge]? When He visits [to inquire of me] what shall I answer Him?
Job,31,15,Did not He Who made me in the womb make [my servant]? And did not One fashion us both in the womb?
Job,31,16,If I have withheld from the poor and needy what they desired or have caused the eyes of the widow to look in vain [for relief]
Job,31,17,Or have eaten my morsel alone and have not shared it with the fatherless--
Job,31,18,No but from my youth [the fatherless] grew up with me as a father and I have been [the widow's] guide from my mother's womb--
Job,31,19,If I have seen anyone perish for want of clothing or any poor person without covering
Job,31,20,If his loins have not blessed me [for clothing them] and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep
Job,31,21,If I have lifted my hand against the fatherless when I saw [that the judges would be favorable and be] my help at the [council] gate
Job,31,22,Then let my shoulder fall away from my shoulder blade and my arm be broken from its socket.
Job,31,23,For calamity from God was a terror to me and because of His majesty I could not endure [to face Him] and could do nothing.
Job,31,24,If I have made gold my trust and hope or have said to fine gold You are my confidence
Job,31,25,If I rejoiced because my wealth was great and because my [powerful] hand [alone] had gotten much
Job,31,26,If I beheld [as an object of worship] the sunlight when it shone or the moon walking in its brightness
Job,31,27,And my heart has been secretly enticed by them or my mouth has kissed my hand [in homage to them]
Job,31,28,This also would have been [a heinous and principal] iniquity to demand the judges' action and punishment for I would have denied and been false to the God Who is above.
Job,31,29,If I rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me or lifted myself up [in malicious triumph] when evil overtook him--
Job,31,30,No I have let my mouth sin neither by cursing my enemy nor by praying that he might die--
Job,31,31,[Just ask] if the men of my tent will not say Who can find one in need who has not been satisfied with food he gave them?--
Job,31,32,The temporary resident has not lodged in the street but I have opened my door to the wayfaring man--
Job,31,33,If like Adam or like [other] men I have concealed my transgressions by hiding my iniquity in my bosom
Job,31,34,Because I feared the great multitude and the contempt of families terrified me so that I kept silence and did not go out of the door--
Job,31,35,Oh for a hearing! Oh for an answer from the Almighty! Let my adversary write out His indictment [and put His vague accusations in tangible form] in a book!
Job,31,36,Surely I would [proudly] bear it on my shoulder and wind the scroll about my head as a diadem.
Job,31,37,I would count out to Him the number of my steps [with every detail of my life] approaching His presence as a prince--
Job,31,38,For if my land has cried out against me and its furrows have complained together with tears [that I have no right to them]
Job,31,39,If I have eaten its fruits without paying for them or have caused its [rightful] owners to breathe their last
Job,31,40,Let thistles grow instead of wheat and cockleburs instead of barley. The [controversial] words of Job [with his friends] are ended.
Job,32,1,SO THESE three men ceased to answer Job because he was [rigidly] righteous (upright and in right standing with God) in his own eyes. [But there was a fifth man there also.]
Job,32,2,Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite of the family of Ram became indignant. His indignation was kindled against Job because he justified himself rather than God [even made himself out to be better than God].
Job,32,3,Also against [Job's] three friends was [Elihu's] anger kindled because they had found no answer [were unable to show his real error] and yet they had declared him to be in the wrong [and responsible for his own afflictions].
Job,32,4,Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were older than he.
Job,32,5,But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men he became angry.
Job,32,6,Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite said I am young and you are aged; for that reason I was timid and restrained and dared not declare my opinion to you.
Job,32,7,I said Age should speak and a multitude of years should teach wisdom [so let it be heard].
Job,32,8,But there is [a vital force] a spirit [of intelligence] in man and the breath of the Almighty gives men understanding.
Job,32,9,It is not the great [necessarily] who are wise nor [always] the aged who understand justice.
Job,32,10,So I say Listen to me; I also will give you my opinion [about Job's situation] and my knowledge.
Job,32,11,You see I waited for your words I listened to your wise reasons while you searched out what to say.
Job,32,12,Yes I paid attention to what you said and behold not one of you convinced Job or made [satisfactory] replies to his words [you could not refute him].
Job,32,13,Beware lest you say We have found wisdom; God thrusts [Job] down [justly] not man [God alone is dealing with him].
Job,32,14,Now [Job] has not directed his words against me [therefore I have no cause for irritation] neither will I answer him with speeches like yours. [I speak for truth not for revenge.]
Job,32,15,[Job's friends] are amazed and embarrassed they answer no more; they have not a thing to say [reports Elihu].
Job,32,16,And shall I wait because they say nothing but stand still and answer no more?
Job,32,17,I also will answer my [God-assigned] part; I also will declare my opinion and my knowledge.
Job,32,18,For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me.
Job,32,19,My breast is as wine that has no vent; like new wineskins it is ready to burst.
Job,32,20,I must speak that I may get relief and be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer.
Job,32,21,I will not [I warn you] be influenced by respect for any man's person and show partiality neither will I flatter any man.
Job,32,22,For I know not how to flatter [wasting my time in mere formalities for then] my Maker would soon take me away.
Job,33,1,BE THAT as it may Job I beg of you to hear what I have to say and give heed to all my words.
Job,33,2,Behold here I am with open mouth; here is my tongue talking.
Job,33,3,My words shall express the uprightness of my heart and my lips shall speak what they know with utter sincerity.
Job,33,4,[It is] the Spirit of God that made me [which has stirred me up] and the breath of the Almighty that gives me life [which inspires me].
Job,33,5,Answer me now if you can; set your words in order before me; take your stand.
Job,33,6,Behold I am toward God and before Him even as you are; I also am formed out of the clay [though I speak with abnormal wisdom because of a divine illumination].
Job,33,7,See my terror [for I am only a fellow mortal not God]; I shall not make you afraid neither shall my pressure be heavy upon you.
Job,33,8,Surely you have spoken in my hearing and I have heard the voice of your words saying
Job,33,9,I am clean without transgression; I am innocent neither is there iniquity in me.
Job,33,10,But behold God finds occasions against me and causes of alienation and indifference; He counts me as His enemy.
Job,33,11,He puts my feet in the stocks; He [untrustingly] watches all my paths [you say].
Job,33,12,I reply to you Behold in this you are not just; God is superior to man.
Job,33,13,Why do you contend against Him? For He does not give account of any of His actions. [Sufficient for us it should be to know that it is He Who does them.]
Job,33,14,For God [does reveal His will; He] speaks not only once but more than once even though men do not regard it [including you Job].
Job,33,15,[One may hear God's voice] in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falls on men while slumbering upon the bed
Job,33,16,Then He opens the ears of men and seals their instruction [terrifying them with warnings]
Job,33,17,That He may withdraw man from his purpose and cut off pride from him [disgusting him with his own disappointing self-sufficiency].
Job,33,18,He holds him back from the pit [of destruction] and his life from perishing by the sword [of God's destructive judgments].
Job,33,19,[God's voice may be heard by man when] he is chastened with pain upon his bed and with continual strife in his bones or while all his bones are firmly set
Job,33,20,So that his desire makes him loathe food and even dainty dishes [nauseate him].
Job,33,21,His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen and his bones that were not seen stick out.
Job,33,22,Yes his soul draws near to corruption and his life to the inflicters of death (the destroyers).
Job,33,23,[God's voice may be heard] if there is for the hearer a messenger or an angel an interpreter one among a thousand to show to man what is right for him [how to be upright and in right standing with God]
Job,33,24,Then [God] is gracious to him and says Deliver him from going down into the pit [of destruction]; I have found a ransom (a price of redemption an atonement)!
Job,33,25,[Then the man's] flesh shall be restored; it becomes fresher and more tender than a child's; he returns to the days of his youth.
Job,33,26,He prays to God and He is favorable to him so that he sees His face with joy; for [God] restores to him his righteousness (his uprightness and right standing with God--with its joys).
Job,33,27,He looks upon other men or sings out to them I have sinned and perverted that which was right and it did not profit me or He did not requite me [according to my iniquity]!
Job,33,28,[God] has redeemed my life from going down to the pit [of destruction] and my life shall see the light!
Job,33,29,[Elihu comments] Behold God does all these things twice yes three times with a man
Job,33,30,To bring back his life from the pit [of destruction] that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.
Job,33,31,Give heed O Job listen to me; hold your peace and I will speak.
Job,33,32,If you have anything to say answer me; speak for I desire to justify you.
Job,33,33,If [you do] not [have anything to say] listen to me; hold your peace and I will teach you wisdom.
Job,34,1,ELIHU ANSWERED (continued his discourse) and said
Job,34,2,Hear my words you wise men and give ear to me you who have [so much] knowledge.
Job,34,3,For the ear tries words as the palate tastes food.
Job,34,4,Let us choose for ourselves that which is right; let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job,34,5,For Job has said I am [innocent and uncompromisingly] righteous but God has taken away my right;
Job,34,6,Would I lie against my right? Yet notwithstanding my right I am counted a liar. My wound is incurable though I am without transgression.
Job,34,7,What man is like Job who drinks up scoffing and scorning like water
Job,34,8,Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity and walks with wicked men?
Job,34,9,For he has said It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God and consent to Him.
Job,34,10,Therefore hear me you men of understanding. Far be it from God that He should do wickedness and from the Almighty that He should commit iniquity.
Job,34,11,For according to the deeds of a man God will [exactly] proportion his pay and He will cause every man to find [recompense] according to his ways.
Job,34,12,Truly God will not do wickedly neither will the Almighty pervert justice.
Job,34,13,Who put [God] in charge over the earth? Or who laid on Him the whole world?
Job,34,14,If [God] should set His heart upon him [man] and withdraw His [life-giving] spirit and His breath [from man] to Himself
Job,34,15,All flesh would perish together and man would turn again to dust.
Job,34,16,If now you have understanding hear this; listen to my words.
Job,34,17,Is it possible that an enemy of right should govern? And will you condemn Him Who is just and mighty?
Job,34,18,[God] Who says to a king You are worthless and vile or to princes and nobles You are ungodly and evil?
Job,34,19,[God] is not partial to princes nor does He regard the rich more than the poor for they all are the work of His hands.
Job,34,20,In a moment they die; even at midnight the people are shaken and pass away and the mighty are taken away by no [human] hand.
Job,34,21,For [God's] eyes are upon the ways of a man and He sees all his steps.
Job,34,22,There is no darkness nor thick gloom where the evildoers may hide themselves.
Job,34,23,[God] sets before man no appointed time that he should appear before [Him] in judgment.
Job,34,24,He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry [before a jury] and in ways past finding out and sets others in their stead.
Job,34,25,Therefore He takes knowledge of their works and He overturns them in the night so that they are crushed and destroyed.
Job,34,26,God strikes them down as wicked men in the open sight of beholders
Job,34,27,Because they turned aside from Him and would not consider or show regard for any of His ways
Job,34,28,So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him and He heard the cry of the afflicted.
Job,34,29,When He gives quietness (peace and security from oppression) who then can condemn? When He hides His face [withdrawing His favor and help] who then can behold Him [and make Him gracious] whether it be a nation or a man by himself?--
Job,34,30,That the godless man may not reign that there be no one to ensnare the people.
Job,34,31,For has anyone said to God I have borne my chastisement; I will not offend any more;
Job,34,32,Teach me what I do not see [in regard to how I have sinned]; if I have done iniquity I will do it no more?
Job,34,33,Should [God's] recompense [for your sins] be as you will it when you refuse to accept it? For you must do the choosing and not I; therefore say what is your truthful conclusion.
Job,34,34,Men of understanding will tell me indeed every wise man who hears me [will agree]
Job,34,35,That Job speaks without knowledge and his words are without wisdom and insight.
Job,34,36,[Would that Job's afflictions be continued and] he be tried to the end because of his answering like wicked men!
Job,34,37,For he adds rebellion [in his unsubmissive defiant attitude toward God] to his unacknowledged sin; he claps his hands [in open mockery and contempt of God] among us and he multiplies his words of accusation against God.
Job,35,1,ELIHU SPOKE further [to Job] and said
Job,35,2,Do you think this is your right or are you saying My righteousness is more than God's
Job,35,3,That you ask What advantage have you? How am I profited more than if I had sinned?
Job,35,4,I will answer you and your companions with you.
Job,35,5,Look to the heavens and see; and behold the skies which are higher than you.
Job,35,6,If you have sinned how does that affect God? And if your transgressions are multiplied what have you done to Him?
Job,35,7,If you are righteous what do you [by that] give God? Or what does He receive from your hand?
Job,35,8,Your wickedness touches and affects a man such as you are and your righteousness is for yourself one of the human race [but it cannot touch God Who is above such influence].
Job,35,9,Because of the multitudes of oppressions the people cry out; they cry for help because of the violence of the mighty.
Job,35,10,But no one says Where is God my Maker Who gives songs of rejoicing in the night
Job,35,11,Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?
Job,35,12,[The people] cry out because of the pride of evil men but He does not answer.
Job,35,13,Surely God will refuse to answer [the cry which is] vanity (vain and empty--instead of abiding trust); neither will the Almighty regard it--
Job,35,14,How much less when [missing His righteous judgment on earth] you say that you do not see Him that your cause is before Him and you are waiting for Him!
Job,35,15,But now because God has not [speedily] punished in His anger and seems to be unaware of the wrong and oppression [of which a person is guilty]
Job,35,16,Job uselessly opens his mouth and multiplies words without knowledge [drawing the worthless conclusion that the righteous have no more advantage than the wicked].
Job,36,1,ELIHU PROCEEDED and said
Job,36,2,Bear with me and wait a little longer and I will show you for I have something still to say on God's behalf.
Job,36,3,I will bring my knowledge from afar and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
Job,36,4,For truly my words shall not be false; He Who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
Job,36,5,Behold! God is mighty and yet despises no one nor regards anything as trivial; He is mighty in power of understanding and heart.
Job,36,6,He does not prolong the life of the wicked but gives the needy and afflicted their right.
Job,36,7,He withdraws not His eyes from the righteous (the upright in right standing with God); but He sets them forever with kings upon the throne and they are exalted.
Job,36,8,And if they are bound in fetters [of adversity] and held by cords of affliction
Job,36,9,Then He shows to them [the true character of] their deeds and their transgressions that they have acted arrogantly [with presumption and self-sufficiency].
Job,36,10,He also opens their ears to instruction and discipline and commands that they return from iniquity.
Job,36,11,If they obey and serve Him they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasantness and joy.
Job,36,12,But if they obey not they shall perish by the sword [of God's destructive judgments] and they shall die in ignorance of true knowledge.
Job,36,13,But the godless and profane in heart heap up anger [at the divine discipline]; they do not cry to Him when He binds them [with cords of affliction].
Job,36,14,They die in youth and their life perishes among the unclean (those who are sodomites).
Job,36,15,He delivers the afflicted in their affliction and opens their ears [to His voice] in adversity.
Job,36,16,Indeed God would have allured you out of the mouth of distress into a broad place where there is no situation of perplexity or privation; and that which would be set on your table would be full of fatness.
Job,36,17,But if you [Job] are filled with the judgment of the wicked judgment and justice will keep hold on you.
Job,36,18,For let not wrath entice you into scorning chastisements; and let not the greatness of the ransom [the suffering if rightly endured] turn you aside.
Job,36,19,Will your cry be sufficient to keep you from distress or will all the force of your strength do it?
Job,36,20,Desire not the night when peoples are cut off from their places;
Job,36,21,Take heed turn not to iniquity for this [the iniquity of complaining against God] you have chosen rather than [submission in] affliction.
Job,36,22,Behold God exalts and does loftily in His power; who is a ruler or a teacher like Him?
Job,36,23,Who has appointed God His way? Or who can say You have done unrighteousness?
Job,36,24,Remember that [by submission] you magnify God's work of which men have sung.
Job,36,25,All men have looked upon God's work; man may behold it afar off.
Job,36,26,Behold God is great and we know Him not! The number of His years is unsearchable.
Job,36,27,For He draws up the drops of water which distil as rain from His vapor
Job,36,28,Which the skies pour down and drop abundantly upon [the multitudes of ] mankind.
Job,36,29,Not only that but can anyone understand the spreadings of the clouds or the thunderings of His pavilion?
Job,36,30,Behold He spreads His lightning against the dark clouds and covers the roots of the sea.
Job,36,31,For by [His clouds] God executes judgment upon the peoples; He gives food in abundance.
Job,36,32,He covers His hands with the lightning and commands it to strike the mark.
Job,36,33,His thunderings speak [awesomely] concerning Him; the cattle are told of His coming storm.
Job,37,1,INDEED [at His thunderings] my heart also trembles and leaps out of its place.
Job,37,2,Hear oh hear the roar of His voice and the sound of rumbling that goes out of His mouth!
Job,37,3,Under the whole heaven He lets it loose and His lightning to the ends of the earth.
Job,37,4,After it His voice roars; He thunders with the voice of His majesty and He restrains not [His lightnings against His adversaries] when His voice is heard.
Job,37,5,God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things which we cannot comprehend.
Job,37,6,For He says to the snow Fall on the earth; likewise He speaks to the showers and to the downpour of His mighty rains.
Job,37,7,God seals up (stops brings to a standstill by severe weather) the hand of every man [and now under His seal their hands are forced to inactivity] that all men whom He has made may know His doings (His sovereign power and their subjection to it).
Job,37,8,Then the beasts go into dens and remain in their lairs.
Job,37,9,Out of its chamber comes the whirlwind and cold from the scattering winds.
Job,37,10,By the breath of God ice is given and the breadth of the waters is frozen over.
Job,37,11,He loads the thick cloud with moisture; He scatters the cloud of His lightning.
Job,37,12,And it is turned round about by His guidance that they may do whatever He commands them upon the face of the habitable earth.
Job,37,13,Whether it be for correction or for His earth [generally] or for His mercy and loving-kindness He causes it to come.
Job,37,14,Hear this O Job; stand still and consider the wondrous works of God.
Job,37,15,Do you know how God lays His command upon them and causes the lightning of His [storm] cloud to shine?
Job,37,16,Do you know how the clouds are balanced [and poised in the heavens] the wonderful works of Him Who is perfect in knowledge?
Job,37,17,[Or] why your garments are hot when He quiets the earth [in sultry summer] with the [oppressive] south wind?
Job,37,18,Can you along with Him spread out the sky [which is] strong as a molten mirror?
Job,37,19,Tell us [Job] with what words of man we may address such a Being; we cannot state our case because we are in the dark [in the presence of the unsearchable God].
Job,37,20,So shall it be told Him that I wish to speak? If a man speaks shall he be swallowed up?
Job,37,21,And now men cannot look upon the light when it is bright in the skies when the wind has passed and cleared them.
Job,37,22,Golden brightness and splendor come out of the north; [if men can scarcely look upon it how much less upon the] terrible splendor and majesty God has upon Himself!
Job,37,23,Touching the Almighty we cannot find Him out; He is excellent in power; and to justice and plenteous righteousness He does no violence [He will disregard no right].
Job,37,24,Men therefore [reverently] fear Him; He regards and respects not any who are wise in heart [in their own understanding and conceit].
Job,38,1,THEN THE Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said
Job,38,2,Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?
Job,38,3,Gird up now your loins like a man and I will demand of you and you declare to Me.
Job,38,4,Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Declare to Me if you have and know understanding.
Job,38,5,Who determined the measures of the earth if you know? Or who stretched the measuring line upon it?
Job,38,6,Upon what were the foundations of it fastened or who laid its cornerstone
Job,38,7,When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
Job,38,8,Or who shut up the sea with doors when it broke forth and issued out of the womb?--
Job,38,9,When I made the clouds the garment of it and thick darkness a swaddling band for it
Job,38,10,And marked for it My appointed boundary and set bars and doors
Job,38,11,And said Thus far shall you come and no farther; and here shall your proud waves be stayed?
Job,38,12,Have you commanded the morning since your days began and caused the dawn to know its place
Job,38,13,So that [light] may get hold of the corners of the earth and shake the wickedness [of night] out of it?
Job,38,14,It is changed like clay into which a seal is pressed; and things stand out like a many-colored garment.
Job,38,15,From the wicked their light is withheld and their uplifted arm is broken.
Job,38,16,Have you explored the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?
Job,38,17,Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the doors of deep darkness?
Job,38,18,Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth? Tell Me if you know it all.
Job,38,19,Where is the way where light dwells? And as for darkness where is its abode
Job,38,20,That you may conduct it to its home and may know the paths to its house?
Job,38,21,You must know since you were born then! Or because you are so extremely old!
Job,38,22,Have you entered the treasuries of the snow or have you seen the treasuries of the hail
Job,38,23,Which I have reserved for the time of trouble for the day of battle and war?
Job,38,24,By what way is the light distributed or the east wind spread over the earth?
Job,38,25,Who has prepared a channel for the torrents of rain or a path for the thunderbolt
Job,38,26,To cause it to rain on the uninhabited land [and] on the desert where no man lives
Job,38,27,To satisfy the waste and desolate ground and to cause the tender grass to spring forth?
Job,38,28,Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew?
Job,38,29,Out of whose womb came the ice? And the hoary frost of heaven who has given it birth?
Job,38,30,The waters are congealed like stone and the face of the deep is frozen.
Job,38,31,Can you bind the chains of [the cluster of stars called] Pleiades or loose the cords of [the constellation] Orion?
Job,38,32,Can you lead forth the signs of the zodiac in their season? Or can you guide [the stars of] the Bear with her young?
Job,38,33,Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you establish their rule upon the earth?
Job,38,34,Can you lift up your voice to the clouds so that an abundance of waters may cover you?
Job,38,35,Can you send lightnings that they may go and say to you Here we are?
Job,38,36,Who has put wisdom in the inward parts [or in the dark clouds]? Or who has given understanding to the mind [or to the meteor]?
Job,38,37,Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the [water] bottles of the heavens
Job,38,38,When [heat has caused] the dust to run into a mass and the clods to cleave fast together?
Job,38,39,Can you [Job] hunt the prey for the lion? Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions
Job,38,40,When they couch in their dens or lie in wait in their hiding place?
Job,38,41,Who provides for the raven its prey when its young ones cry to God and wander about for lack of food?
Job,39,1,DO YOU know the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth [their young]? [Or] do you observe when the hinds are giving birth? [Do you attend to all this Job?]
Job,39,2,Can you number the months that they carry their offspring? Or do you know the time when they are delivered
Job,39,3,When they bow themselves bring forth their young ones [and] cast out their pains?
Job,39,4,Their young ones become strong they grow up in the open field; they go forth and return not to them.
Job,39,5,Who has sent out the wild donkey giving him his freedom? Or who has loosed the bands of the swift donkey [by which his tame brother is bound--he the shy the swift-footed and the untamable]
Job,39,6,Whose home I have made the wilderness and the salt land his dwelling place?
Job,39,7,He scorns the tumult of the city and hears not the shoutings of the taskmaster.
Job,39,8,The range of the mountains is his pasture and he searches after every green thing.
Job,39,9,Will the wild ox be willing to serve you or remain beside your manger?
Job,39,10,Can you bind the wild ox with a harness to the plow in the furrow? Or will he harrow the furrows for you?
Job,39,11,Will you trust him because his strength is great or to him will you leave your labor?
Job,39,12,Will you depend upon him to bring home your seed and gather the grain of your threshing floor? [Who Job was the author of this strange variance in the disposition of animals so alike in appearance? Was it you?]
Job,39,13,The wings of the ostrich wave proudly [but] are they the pinions and plumage of love?
Job,39,14,The ostrich leaves her eggs on the ground and warms them in the dust
Job,39,15,Forgetting that a foot may crush them or that the wild beast may trample them.
Job,39,16,She is hardened against her young ones as though they were not hers; her labor is in vain because she has no sense of danger [for her unborn brood]
Job,39,17,For God has deprived her of wisdom neither has He imparted to her understanding.
Job,39,18,Yet when she lifts herself up in flight [so swift is she that] she can laugh to scorn the horse and his rider.
Job,39,19,Have you given the horse his might? Have you clothed his neck with quivering and a shaking mane?
Job,39,20,Was it you [Job] who made him to leap like a locust? The majesty of his [snorting] nostrils is terrible.
Job,39,21,He paws in the valley and exults in his strength; he goes out to meet the weapons [of armed men].
Job,39,22,He mocks at fear and is not dismayed or terrified; neither does he turn back [in battle] from the sword.
Job,39,23,The quiver rattles upon him as do the glittering spear and the lance [of his rider].
Job,39,24,[He seems in running to] devour the ground with fierceness and rage; neither can he stand still at the sound of the [war] trumpet.
Job,39,25,As often as the trumpet sounds he says Ha ha! And he smells the battle from afar the thunder of the captains and the shouting.
Job,39,26,Is it by your wisdom [Job] that the hawk soars and stretches her wings toward the south [as winter approaches]?
Job,39,27,Does the eagle mount up at your command and make his nest on [a] high [inaccessible place]?
Job,39,28,On the cliff he dwells and remains securely upon the point of the rock and the stronghold.
Job,39,29,From there he spies out the prey; and his eyes see it afar off.
Job,39,30,His young ones suck up blood and where the slain are there is he.
Job,40,1,MOREOVER THE Lord said to Job
Job,40,2,Shall he who would find fault with the Almighty contend with Him? He who disputes with God let him answer it.
Job,40,3,Then Job replied to the Lord:
Job,40,4,Behold I am of small account and vile! What shall I answer You? I lay my hand upon my mouth.
Job,40,5,I have spoken once but I will not reply again--indeed twice [have I answered] but I will proceed no further.
Job,40,6,Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind saying
Job,40,7,Gird up your loins now like a man; I will demand of you and you answer Me.
Job,40,8,Will you also annul (set aside and render void) My judgment? Will you condemn Me [your God] that you may [appear] righteous and justified?
Job,40,9,Have you an arm like God? Or can you thunder with a voice like His?
Job,40,10,[Since you question the manner of the Almighty's rule] deck yourself now with the excellency and dignity [of the Supreme Ruler and yourself undertake the government of the world if you are so wise] and array yourself with honor and majesty.
Job,40,11,Pour forth the overflowings of your anger and look on everyone who is proud and abase him;
Job,40,12,Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low and tread down the wicked where they stand [if you are so able Job].
Job,40,13,[Bury and] hide them all in the dust together; [and] shut them up [in the prison house of death].
Job,40,14,[If you can do all this Job proving yourself of divine might] then will I [God] praise you also [and acknowledge that] your own right hand can save you.
Job,40,15,Behold now the behemoth (the hippopotamus) which I created as I did you; he eats grass like an ox.
Job,40,16,See now his strength is in his loins and his power is in the sinews of his belly.
Job,40,17,He moves his tail like a cedar tree; the tendons of his thighs are twisted together [like a rope].
Job,40,18,His bones are like tubes of bronze; his limbs [or ribs] are like bars of iron.
Job,40,19,[The hippopotamus] is the first [in magnitude and power] of the works of God [in animal life]; [only] He Who made him provides him with his [swordlike tusks or only God Who made him can bring near His sword to master him].
Job,40,20,Surely the mountains bring him food where all the wild animals play.
Job,40,21,He lies under the lotus trees in the covert of the reeds in the marsh.
Job,40,22,The lotus trees cover him with their shade; the willows of the brook compass him about.
Job,40,23,Behold if a river is violent and overflows he does not tremble; he is confident though the Jordan [River] swells and rushes against his mouth.
Job,40,24,Can any take him when he is on the watch or pierce through his nose with a snare?
Job,41,1,CAN YOU draw out the leviathan (the crocodile) with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?
Job,41,2,Can you put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook or a spike?
Job,41,3,Will he make many supplications to you [begging to be spared]? Will he speak soft words to you [to coax you to treat him kindly]?
Job,41,4,Will he make a covenant with you to take him for your servant forever?
Job,41,5,Will you play with [the crocodile] as with a bird? Or will you put him on a leash for your maidens?
Job,41,6,Will traders bargain over him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?
Job,41,7,Can you fill his skin with harpoons? Or his head with fishing spears?
Job,41,8,Lay your hand upon him! Remember your battle with him; you will not do [such an ill-advised thing] again!
Job,41,9,Behold the hope of [his assailant] is disappointed; one is cast down even at the sight of him!
Job,41,10,No one is so fierce [and foolhardy] that he dares to stir up [the crocodile]; who then is he who can stand before Me [the beast's Creator or dares to contend with Me]?
Job,41,11,Who has first given to Me that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heavens is Mine. [Therefore who can have a claim against God God Who made the unmastered crocodile?]
Job,41,12,I will not keep silence concerning his limbs nor his mighty strength nor his goodly frame.
Job,41,13,Who can strip off [the crocodile's] outer garment? [Who can penetrate his double coat of mail?] Who shall come within his jaws?
Job,41,14,Who can open the doors of his [lipless] mouth? His [extended jaws and bare] teeth are terrible round about.
Job,41,15,His scales are [the crocodile's] pride [for his back is made of rows of shields] shut up together [as with] a tight seal;
Job,41,16,One is so near to another that no air can come between them.
Job,41,17,They are joined one to another; they stick together so that they cannot be separated.
Job,41,18,His sneezings flash forth light and his eyes are like the [reddish] eyelids of the dawn.
Job,41,19,Out of his mouth go burning torches [and] sparks of fire leap out.
Job,41,20,Out of his nostrils goes forth smoke as out of a seething pot over a fire of rushes.
Job,41,21,His breath kindles coals and a flame goes forth from his mouth.
Job,41,22,In [the crocodile's] neck abides strength and terror dances before him.
Job,41,23,The folds of his flesh cleave together; they are firm upon him and they cannot shake [when he moves].
Job,41,24,His heart is as firm as a stone indeed as solid as a nether millstone.
Job,41,25,When [the crocodile] raises himself up the mighty are afraid; because of terror and the crashing they are beside themselves.
Job,41,26,Even if one strikes at him with the sword it cannot get any hold nor does the spear the dart or the javelin.
Job,41,27,He counts iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood.
Job,41,28,The arrow cannot make [the crocodile] flee; slingstones are treated by him as stubble.
Job,41,29,Clubs [also] are counted as stubble; he laughs at the rushing and the rattling of the javelin.
Job,41,30,His underparts are like sharp pieces of broken pottery; he spreads [grooves like] a threshing sledge upon the mire.
Job,41,31,He makes the deep boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a [foaming] pot of ointment.
Job,41,32,[His swift darting] makes a shining track behind him; one would think the deep to be hoary [with foam].
Job,41,33,Upon earth there is not [the crocodile's] equal a creature made without fear and he behaves fearlessly.
Job,41,34,He looks all mighty [beasts of prey] in the face [without terror]; he is monarch over all the sons of pride. [And now Job who are you who dares not arouse the unmastered crocodile yet who dares resist Me the beast's Creator to My face? Everything under the heavens is Mine; therefore who can have a claim against God?]
Job,42,1,THEN JOB said to the Lord
Job,42,2,I know that You can do all things and that no thought or purpose of Yours can be restrained or thwarted.
Job,42,3,[You said to me] Who is this that darkens and obscures counsel [by words] without knowledge? Therefore [I now see] I have [rashly] uttered what I did not understand things too wonderful for me which I did not know.
Job,42,4,[I had virtually said to You what You have said to me:] Hear I beseech You and I will speak; I will demand of You and You declare to me.
Job,42,5,I had heard of You [only] by the hearing of the ear but now my [spiritual] eye sees You.
Job,42,6,Therefore I loathe [my words] and abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes.
Job,42,7,After the Lord had spoken the previous words to Job the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends for you have not spoken of Me the thing that is right as My servant Job has.
Job,42,8,Now therefore take seven bullocks and seven rams and go to My servant Job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job shall pray for you for I will accept [his prayer] that I deal not with you after your folly in that you have not spoken of Me the thing that is right as My servant Job has.
Job,42,9,So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the Lord commanded them; and the Lord accepted [Job's prayer].
Job,42,10,And the Lord turned the captivity of Job and restored his fortunes when he prayed for his friends; also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.
Job,42,11,Then there came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before and they ate bread with him in his house; and they sympathized with him and comforted him over all the [distressing] calamities that the Lord had brought upon him. Every man also gave him a piece of money and every man an earring of gold.
Job,42,12,And the Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; for he had 14000 sheep 6000 camels 1000 yoke of oxen and 1000 female donkeys.
Job,42,13,He had also seven sons and three daughters.
Job,42,14,And he called the name of the first Jemimah and the name of the second Keziah and the name of the third Keren-happuch.
Job,42,15,And in all the land there were no women so fair as the daughters of Job and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers.
Job,42,16,After this Job lived 140 years and saw his sons and his sons' sons even to four generations.
Job,42,17,So Job died an old man and full of days.
Psalm,1,1,BLESSED (HAPPY fortunate prosperous and enviable) is the man who walks and lives not in the counsel of the ungodly [following their advice their plans and purposes] nor stands [submissive and inactive] in the path where sinners walk nor sits down [to relax and rest] where the scornful [and the mockers] gather.

Psalm,2,4,He Who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord has them in derision [and in supreme contempt He mocks them].

Proverbs,1,1,THE PROVERBS (truths obscurely expressed maxims and parables) of Solomon son of David king of Israel:
Proverbs,1,2,That people may know skillful and godly Wisdom and instruction discern and comprehend the words of understanding and insight
Proverbs,1,3,Receive instruction in wise dealing and the discipline of wise thoughtfulness righteousness justice and integrity
Proverbs,1,4,That prudence may be given to the simple and knowledge discretion and discernment to the youth--
Proverbs,1,5,The wise also will hear and increase in learning and the person of understanding will acquire skill and attain to sound counsel [so that he may be able to steer his course rightly]--
Proverbs,1,6,That people may understand a proverb and a figure of speech or an enigma with its interpretation and the words of the wise and their dark sayings or riddles.
Proverbs,1,7,The reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord is the beginning and the principal and choice part of knowledge [its starting point and its essence]; but fools despise skillful and godly Wisdom instruction and discipline.
Proverbs,1,8,My son hear the instruction of your father; reject not nor forsake the teaching of your mother.
Proverbs,1,9,For they are a [victor's] chaplet (garland) of grace upon your head and chains and pendants [of gold worn by kings] for your neck.
Proverbs,1,10,My son if sinners entice you do not consent.
Proverbs,1,11,If they say Come with us; let us lie in wait [to shed] blood let us ambush the innocent without cause [and show that his piety is in vain];
Proverbs,1,12,Let us swallow them up alive as does Sheol (the place of the dead) and whole as those who go down into the pit [of the dead];
Proverbs,1,13,We shall find and take all kinds of precious goods [when our victims are put out of the way] we shall fill our houses with plunder;
Proverbs,1,14,Throw in your lot with us [they insist] and be a sworn brother and comrade; let us all have one purse in common--
Proverbs,1,15,My son do not walk in the way with them; restrain your foot from their path;
Proverbs,1,16,For their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed blood.
Proverbs,1,17,For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird!
Proverbs,1,18,But [when these men set a trap for others] they are lying in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives.
Proverbs,1,19,So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain; such [greed for plunder] takes away the lives of its possessors.
Proverbs,1,20,Wisdom cries aloud in the street she raises her voice in the markets;
Proverbs,1,21,She cries at the head of the noisy intersections [in the chief gathering places]; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:
Proverbs,1,22,How long O simple ones [open to evil] will you love being simple? And the scoffers delight in scoffing and [self-confident] fools hate knowledge?
Proverbs,1,23,If you will turn (repent) and give heed to my reproof behold I [ Wisdom] will pour out my spirit upon you I will make my words known to you.
Proverbs,1,24,Because I have called and you have refused [to answer] have stretched out my hand and no man has heeded it
Proverbs,1,25,And you treated as nothing all my counsel and would accept none of my reproof
Proverbs,1,26,I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when the thing comes that shall cause you terror and panic--
Proverbs,1,27,When your panic comes as a storm and desolation and your calamity comes on as a whirlwind when distress and anguish come upon you.
Proverbs,1,28,Then will they call upon me [Wisdom] but I will not answer; they will seek me early and diligently but they will not find me.
Proverbs,1,29,Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord
Proverbs,1,30,Would accept none of my counsel and despised all my reproof
Proverbs,1,31,Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be satiated with their own devices.
Proverbs,1,32,For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them and the careless ease of [self-confident] fools shall destroy them.
Proverbs,1,33,But whoso hearkens to me [Wisdom] shall dwell securely and in confident trust and shall be quiet without fear or dread of evil.
Proverbs,2,1,MY SON if you will receive my words and treasure up my commandments within you
Proverbs,2,2,Making your ear attentive to skillful and godly Wisdom and inclining and directing your heart and mind to understanding [applying all your powers to the quest for it];
Proverbs,2,3,Yes if you cry out for insight and raise your voice for understanding
Proverbs,2,4,If you seek [Wisdom] as for silver and search for skillful and godly Wisdom as for hidden treasures
Proverbs,2,5,Then you will understand the reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of [our omniscient] God.
Proverbs,2,6,For the Lord gives skillful and godly Wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.
