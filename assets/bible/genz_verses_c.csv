You said there will always be someone from his lineage ruling over Israel, but, like, only if his descendants are actually, like, following your laws, just how you've walked before us. We really don't want anyone to be, like, cut off or anything."
2 Chronicles,6,17,"Yo, God of Israel, it's time to make your promises come true! You said those words to your servant David, so let it happen."
2 Chronicles,6,18,"Wait, so like, is God really gonna come chill with us humans on this planet? Dude, even the whole universe can't contain Him, so like, this house I built is way too small for Him, no cap!"

2 Chronicles,6,21,"Listen up to the prayers of your servant and the people of Israel, as they direct them towards this spot. Listen to them from your crib up in the clouds, and when you hear their voices, forgive them."
2 Chronicles,6,22,"If someone messes up with their neighbor and they have to swear an oath, and that whole oath stuff happens in front of the altar in this house;"
2 Chronicles,6,23,"So, like, pay attention up there in Heaven, and take some action, and like, make fair judgments on your peeps. Give the wicked what they deserve, like, make them face the consequences of their actions. And, yeah, make things right for the righteous, like, reward them according to their goodness."
2 Chronicles,6,24,"And if your squad Israel gets wrecked by the enemy, because they messed up against you; but then they come back, admit they were wrong, and start praying and begging you in this spot;"
2 Chronicles,6,25,"So, listen up, man! I'm hoping you'll hear me out from up above and forgive all the wrongs that your peeps, the Israelites, have done. And I'm asking you, if it's not too much trouble, to bring them back to the land that you promised to them and their ancestors. Thanks, bro!"
2 Chronicles,6,26,"When the sky is closed off and there's no rain because they messed up; but if they pray in this spot, own up to their mistakes, and stop doing wrong when you punish them;"
2 Chronicles,6,27,"Yo, listen up! God, if you're up there, please forgive us, your servants, and the peeps of Israel when you've shown us the right path to follow. Also, can you bless our land with some much-needed rain? After all, it's the place you gave to your people as an inheritance. Thanks, fam!"
2 Chronicles,6,28,"If, like, there's, like, a major shortage of stuff in the land, or if there's, like, a crazy widespread disease going on, or if there's, like, serious devastating natural disasters happening, with, like, locusts everywhere and caterpillers wrecking everything. And also, if their enemies surround them and attack their cities and stuff. Basically, if any kind of bad stuff is going down, whether it's a super intense illness or any other kind of trouble, you know, in their cities or wherever in their land, then, like, it's a really tough situation."
2 Chronicles,6,29,"So like, whenever someone prays or asks for something, like anyone from the cool peeps of Israel, when they're feeling super down and pouring their hearts out, raising their hands in this house, or you know, toward this place:"
2 Chronicles,6,30,"So, like, listen up from your heavenly pad and like, forgive and give everyone what they deserve based on their actions, 'cause you totally know what's up with their hearts (cus, let's be real, only you know what's inside us humans' hearts, ya know?)"
2 Chronicles,6,31,"So that they'll have mad respect for you and follow your path their whole lives while living in the land you gave to our ancestors. {all the days which...: in other words, like forever} {in the land: like, on the whole planet}"
2 Chronicles,6,32,"And yo, about the stranger, who ain't even from your crew in Israel, but came from a serious distance because of your dope name and your incredible power; if they roll up and start praying in this spot, no doubt;"
2 Chronicles,6,33,"So, like, listen up from your heavenly crib and do whatever this random dude asks of you. This way, everyone on earth will know your name and respect you, just like your homies in Israel. And they'll also know that this rad house I built is dedicated to you. #blessed"
2 Chronicles,6,34,"If your squad rolls out to battle their enemies in the direction you send them, and they hit you up with some prayers towards this lit city you picked, and the dope house I built in your name;"
2 Chronicles,6,35,"Then listen, like, from Heaven to their prayer and their plea, and totally support their cause. #justice"
2 Chronicles,6,36,"If they mess up and make a mistake (because let's be real, we all do), and you get mad at them and let their enemies take them prisoner to a faraway or nearby place; when I say take them prisoner, I mean they really take them prisoner."
2 Chronicles,6,37,"But if they actually stop and think about it in the place where they're taken as prisoners, and they decide to turn around and send up a prayer to you in that place, saying, 'We messed up, we've done wrong, and we've been really bad in our actions';"
2 Chronicles,6,38,"If they fully come back to you, like, with all their heart and soul, even in that faraway place where they're being held captive, and they pray towards the land you promised their ancestors, and towards the city you picked, and towards the temple I built for you, God..."
2 Chronicles,6,39,"So, like, God, listen up from your heavenly crib to their prayer and supplications. Make sure to have their backs, and forgive your people who messed up and sinned against you. #justiceforall"
2 Chronicles,6,40,"Yo God, listen up! Open your eyes and tune in to the prayer happening right here. Take a moment, give a listen, ya know?"
2 Chronicles,6,41,"Yo, God, it's time to chill out and find your spot to kick back. Bring yourself and your powerful vibes with the ark of strength. And make sure your crew of priests stays lit with salvation, and let your loyal peeps celebrate all the goodness."
2 Chronicles,6,42,"Yo, God, don't ignore your chosen one: think about all the good stuff you did for David, your servant."
2 Chronicles,7,1,"So, like, when Solomon finished praying, this insane thing happened: fire came down from heaven and totally burned up the burnt offering and sacrifices. And to top it all off, the glory of the LORD filled the entire house!"
2 Chronicles,7,2,"Yo, the priests couldn't even step inside the crib of the LORD, man. His glory straight up filled up the whole place, you feel me?"
2 Chronicles,7,3,"And like, when all the Israelite squad peeped the lit fire drop and the glorious presence of the LORD on the crib, they straight up bowed down on the ground like total legends. They started worshiping and giving mad props to the LORD, saying how dope He is 'cause His mercy is forever, yo."
2 Chronicles,7,4,So the king and everyone dipped into some lit offerings for the LORD.
2 Chronicles,7,5,"So King Solomon went all out and offered a massive sacrifice, with 22k oxen and a whopping 120k sheep! It was a major event, and both the king and all the people joined in dedicating the house of God."
2 Chronicles,7,6,"So, the priests were doing their priestly duties, and the Levites were there too, rocking out with musical instruments that King David had made specifically to worship the LORD and show off His never-ending mercy. Whenever David praised God and the Levites played their music, the priests would blast their trumpets, and all the people of Israel would stand tall."
2 Chronicles,7,7,"Solomon made the center of the courtyard in front of the Lord's house sacred. He offered burnt sacrifices and the choice parts of the peace offerings there, since the bronze altar Solomon had made wasn't big enough to handle all the burnt sacrifices, grain offerings, and fat."
2 Chronicles,7,8,"So like, Solomon threw this lit party that lasted seven whole days, and all of Israel turned up - like, seriously, there were hella people! From as far as Hamath to the river of Egypt, the whole squad was there."
2 Chronicles,7,9,"And on the eighth day, they had a massive gathering: because they celebrated the dedication of the altar for a whole week, and continued the party for seven days. {a solemn...: meaning, they put a lot of effort into it}"
2 Chronicles,7,10,"And on the 23rd day of the 7th month, dude was like, 'Alright, y'all can head back to your tents!' Everyone was stoked and super hyped because the LORD had shown mad love to David, Solomon, and all the peeps of Israel."
2 Chronicles,7,11,"So, like, Solomon totally finished building the house for the LORD and the king's crib, you know? And he totally made all the cool stuff that he wanted to in both the house of the LORD and his own crib. He was, like, super successful and totally nailed it, you know?"
2 Chronicles,7,12,"So, like, the LORD showed up to Solomon while he was chilling in his bed, and was like, 'Yo, I heard your prayer and I'm picking this spot for my crib where we can sacrifice and stuff.'"
2 Chronicles,7,13,"If I, like, close off the sky so it doesn't rain or tell all the locusts to chow down on the land, or make diseases go crazy among my peeps;"
2 Chronicles,7,14,"If my squad, who reps my name, can get real and down-to-earth, hit me up with their prayers, genuinely seek my vibe, and leave behind their messed-up ways; that's when I'll tune in from the heavenly realm, forgive their wrongdoings, and bring healing to their territory. {who reps...: Hebrew - representing my name}"
2 Chronicles,7,15,"Okay, listen up fam! I'm about to be all attentive to the prayers y'all be making in this spot. My eyes and ears are wide open, ready to hear what you gotta say. #Blessed"
2 Chronicles,7,16,"Yo, I've straight-up chosen and blessed this crib, so that my name can be there forever. And like, my eyes and my heart will be there for real, like, always."
2 Chronicles,7,17,"And for you, if you're down to live your life like David your dad did, following all my rules and laws, and being cool with my commands and decisions;"
2 Chronicles,7,18,"I'll totally establish your kingdom's throne, just like I promised your dad David. There's always gonna be a ruler in Israel, no doubt about it. Trust me, it's gonna be epic!"
2 Chronicles,7,19,"But, like, if you straight up ditch my rules and the things I told you to do, which I made super clear, and you decide to start worshiping other gods instead, then, yeah..."
2 Chronicles,7,20,"I'm gonna totally uproot them from the land I gave 'em, and this crib that I made sacred for myself, I'm gonna kick it outta my sight. It's gonna become a mad famous saying and a sick nickname everywhere."
2 Chronicles,7,21,"And this lit house is gonna blow everyone's mind when they see it pass by, like, seriously, they'll be like, whoa, why did the LORD do this crazy thing to this place and this house?"
2 Chronicles,7,22,"And like, the reason this is all happening is because they totally ditched the LORD God who freed them from Egypt, and instead started following all these other gods and idolizing them. They were super into it, like serving them and everything. So, basically, that's why they're going through all this evil stuff."
2 Chronicles,8,1,"After 20 freaking years, Solomon finished building the crib for the LORD and his own sick pad,"
2 Chronicles,8,2,"So, like, Huram had fixed up these cities for Solomon, right? And Solomon, being the boss that he is, actually went ahead and built them up even more. He even hooked up the kids of Israel with some sweet places to call home there."
2 Chronicles,8,3,"So, like, Solomon totally rolled up to Hamathzobah and totally dominated it. Epic win!"
2 Chronicles,8,4,"And he totally flexed by constructing Tadmor out in the middle of nowhere, along with all those sick storage cities he built in Hamath."
2 Chronicles,8,5,"He also created Bethhoron the higher and Bethhoron the lower, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars."
2 Chronicles,8,6,"And Baalath and all the super cool cities that King Solomon had, along with the sweet chariot cities and the rad horsemen cities, and every single thing that Solomon wanted to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and all his land. (This includes everything that Solomon really, really wanted to build.)"
2 Chronicles,8,7,"So, basically, there were still some Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites left, but they weren't part of Israel, ya know?"
2 Chronicles,8,8,"So basically, Solomon made the children of Israel's leftovers pay up till now. Ya know, those kids who were still hanging around in the land after their parents were gone? Yeah, they had to cough up some tribute for Solomon. Talk about a never-ending debt!"
2 Chronicles,8,9,"Yo, Solomon straight up didn't recruit no servants from the children of Israel for his projects. Nah, he just had guys who were all about that warrior life, leading his squads and riding in his sick chariots and horsemobiles."
2 Chronicles,8,10,"So, like, these were the top dudes in King Solomon's crew, there were, like, 250 of them, and they were totally in charge of the people, you know?"
2 Chronicles,8,11,"So Solomon took Pharaoh's daughter from the city of David to his own crib that he built for her. He didn't want his wifey living in King David's pad 'cause that place is straight up sacred, where the LORD's ark is kept. 🔥"
2 Chronicles,8,12,"So Solomon busted out some sick burnt offerings to the LORD on the LORD's altar, the one he built by the front porch."
2 Chronicles,8,13,"Like, every single day and stuff, they had to give offerings and follow Moses' commandment and stuff. And on the sabbaths, new moons, and big fancy feasts, they had to do it three times a year. Like, during the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of weeks, and the feast of tabernacles."
2 Chronicles,8,14,"So, he chose priests and Levites, following his father David's instructions, to perform their duties. Their responsibilities included praising and assisting the priests, as required every day. The gatekeepers were also assigned to their respective gates, following the command of David, a man of God."
2 Chronicles,8,15,And they totally listened to the king's command about everything and didn't question the priests and Levites or the precious stuff.
2 Chronicles,8,16,"So, like, everything that Solomon was doin' went on until the day when the house of the LORD was built, and they kept at it until it was all done. And, yo, the house of the LORD was, like, totally perfect then!"
2 Chronicles,8,17,"So Solomon headed over to Eziongeber and Eloth, which is by the sea in the land of Edom. (FYI, Eloth is also known as Elath.)"
2 Chronicles,8,18,Huram sent ships and skilled sailors to help Solomon's servants. They all sailed to Ophir together and brought back a whopping four hundred and fifty talents of gold for King Solomon.
2 Chronicles,9,1,"So, like, when the queen of Sheba heard about how awesome Solomon was, she totally rolled up to Jerusalem with a massive squad and, like, a bunch of camels carrying spices, gold, and precious stones. And once she reached Solomon, she had this deep convo about everything on her mind. It was legit."
2 Chronicles,9,2,"So, Solomon answered all her questions, and there was literally nothing that Solomon didn't tell her. No secrets here."
2 Chronicles,9,3,"So, the queen of Sheba checked out Solomon's vibes and saw how wise he was, along with the lit house he built."
2 Chronicles,9,4,"And like, the food he served, and the way his crew sat, and how his homies looked after him, and what they wore; also, his squad of cupbearers and their drip; and the entrance he used to go into the house of the LORD; it was just too much for her to handle, she was overwhelmed."
2 Chronicles,9,5,"Yo, I gotta tell you, King, I heard some straight facts about your stuff and how smart you are, all the way in my own hood. Word on the street is legit!"
2 Chronicles,9,6,"But I didn't believe what they were saying until I actually saw it with my own eyes. And let me tell you, the rumors don't even do justice to half of how amazing your wisdom is. You totally surpassed your reputation, dude."
2 Chronicles,9,7,"Blessed are your squad, and blessed are those who stay loyal by your side, always hyped up by your wisdom."
2 Chronicles,9,8,"Praise the LORD your God, who is totally stoked to have chosen you as king and put you on the throne. Your God is all about showing love to Israel and making sure they are set up for success. That’s why you’re their king, to make fair decisions and bring about justice."
2 Chronicles,9,9,"And the queen hooked up the king big-time with a hundred and twenty talents of gold, tons of spicy stuff, and mad precious stones. No one else came close to the queen of Sheba's spice game for sure."
2 Chronicles,9,10,"So, like, Huram's crew and Solomon's crew, they brought back mad gold from Ophir, plus some lit algum trees and precious stones. Oh, BTW, algum trees are also known as almug trees, just FYI."
2 Chronicles,9,11,"And the king used algum trees to build platforms at the house of the LORD and the king's palace. He also had harps and psalteries for the singers, which were super cool and had never been seen before in the land of Judah. (terraces: or, stairs: Heb. highways)"
2 Chronicles,9,12,"And like, King Solomon totally hooked up the queen of Sheba with whatever she wanted, no cap. He gave her everything she asked for, except for the stuff she already brought for the king, ya know? So then she bounced and went back to her own land with her crew."
2 Chronicles,9,13,"In just one year, Solomon gathered a huge amount of bling, totaling six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold. Can you even imagine? That's some serious flex, no cap."
2 Chronicles,9,14,"Besides the stuff traders and merchants brought, even the coolest kings of Arabia and the big shots in the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. BTW, those governors were basically like captains."

2 Chronicles,9,17,"The king flexed and built this sick throne made outta ivory, totally dripping with pure gold."
2 Chronicles,9,18,"So, like, the throne had these like six steps, you know? And there was a super fancy gold footstool attached to the throne. And on each side, there were these cool support things, like hands or whatever, and two fierce lions standing by them. Rawr!"
2 Chronicles,9,19,"And yo, there were these twelve fierce lions chillin' on one side and the other side, like, they were straight up posted on these six legit steps. No other kingdom could match up to this level of awesomeness, fam."
2 Chronicles,9,20,"Dude, check it out! King Solomon had all these sick gold drinking cups, and even the furniture in his palace made from pure gold. Like, no silver at all, man. It wasn't even worth mentioning back in the day of Solomon, you know?"
2 Chronicles,9,21,"So, like, the king's ships went to Tarshish with Huram's crew, ya know? And every three years like clockwork, the ships of Tarshish would cruise back with all sorts of swag: gold, silver, ivory, elephants' teeth, monkeys, and even peacocks! Pretty epic loot, if you ask me."
2 Chronicles,9,22,And King Solomon flexed on all the other kings in the world with his huge wealth and mad smarts.

2 Chronicles,9,26,"Yo, this dude was the boss over all the kings, like from the river all the way to Philistine territory and Egypt's border. By river, we mean the Euphrates, just so you know."
2 Chronicles,9,27,"The king flexed in Jerusalem with stacks of silver, and he flexed even harder with cedar trees, making them just as plentiful as sycomore trees in the low plains. It was a major flex, no cap. #Blessed"
2 Chronicles,9,28,"So, they basically got Solomon some sick horses straight outta Egypt and from all over the place."
2 Chronicles,9,29,"So, like, all the other stuff that Solomon did, you know, from start to finish, it's all written down in this book by this dude named Nathan, who was a prophet. And there's also some prophecies from this guy Ahijah the Shilonite, and like, visions from this seer called Iddo, all about Jeroboam, Nebat's son, you know? It's all in there, man. Hashtag book of Hebrew words, if that's your thing."
2 Chronicles,9,30,"So, like, Solomon took over in Jerusalem and ruled the whole of Israel for a solid forty years, fam."
2 Chronicles,9,31,"And Solomon passed away, and he was laid to rest in the city of David, his father. Then Rehoboam, his son, took over as ruler."
2 Chronicles,10,1,So Rehoboam went to Shechem because all of Israel had gathered there to make him king.
2 Chronicles,10,2,"So, like, when Jeroboam, Nebat's son, who was hiding out in Egypt 'cause he was running away from King Solomon, found out about it, he came back from Egypt and stuff."
2 Chronicles,10,3,"So they hit him up and were like, 'Yo, Jeroboam and all of us Israel peeps are here to chat with Rehoboam,'"
2 Chronicles,10,4,"Your dad really made us suffer with all these rules and responsibilities. So, can you like, make things a bit easier for us by lightening the load and taking off some of the pressure put on us? If you do, we promise to be down to serve you, bro."
2 Chronicles,10,5,"And he was like, yo, come back to me in three days. And the people were like, bet, peace out."
2 Chronicles,10,6,"So King Rehoboam went and talked to the OGs who had been there since his dad Solomon was alive, and he asked them, 'What advice do you have for me to respond to these people?'"
2 Chronicles,10,7,"And they were like, 'Dude, if you show kindness to these peeps, and make them happy, and speak like, awesome words to them, they'll totally be loyal to you forever.'"

2 Chronicles,10,9,"He asked them, 'Any ideas on how to respond to these people who told me to lighten the load that my father imposed on us?'"
2 Chronicles,10,10,"And the squad that grew up with him spoke to him like, listen up bro, here's how you need to reply to those people who be complaining about your dad making things tough for us. Just tell 'em that my skills are gonna be way more powerful than my old man's, like my pinky finger is stronger than his whole body."
2 Chronicles,10,11,"Yo, listen up! My pops may have laid a heavy burden on you, but I'm about to make it even heavier. He disciplined you with whips, but I'm gonna come at you with scorpions. Yeah, you heard that right. Pops really went all out with the workload, ya know."
2 Chronicles,10,12,"So Jeroboam and all the homies rolled up to Rehoboam on day three, just like the king told them, saying, 'Slide back again to me on day three.'"
2 Chronicles,10,13,"The king totally snapped at them; King Rehoboam straight up ignored the advice of the OGs,"
2 Chronicles,10,14,"And the young guys were like, listen up, my dudes. Your old man totally made your workload a total drag, but I'm gonna make it even worse. He disciplined you with whips, but I'm gonna go next level and bring out the scorpions!"
2 Chronicles,10,15,"The king didn't listen to the people, 'cause God made it happen so that the LORD could make His words come true like Ahijah the Shilonite said to Jeroboam, Nebat's son."
2 Chronicles,10,16,"And when all of Israel realized that the king wasn't listening to them, the people spoke up and said to the king, 'What do we even gain from being connected to David? We don't have any claim on Jesse's son. Everyone, go back to your own business, Israel! And David, you better focus on your own affairs.' So all of Israel returned to their own lives."
2 Chronicles,10,17,"So like, the Israelite peeps who were living in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam was the boss ruling over them."
2 Chronicles,10,18,"King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of collecting taxes, but the people of Israel pelted him with rocks until he died. Panicked, King Rehoboam quickly hopped onto his chariot to escape to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,10,19,And Israel straight up went against the house of David like they're not even vibing with them anymore till this day.
2 Chronicles,11,1,"So, like, Rehoboam pulled up to Jerusalem and got a crew of 180k badass homies from the clans of Judah and Benjamin. They were straight-up warriors, ready to wage war against Israel and reclaim the kingdom for Rehoboam, you know?"
2 Chronicles,11,2,"Yo, God spoke to Shemaiah, this dude who's tight with Him and stuff, and here's what He said,"
2 Chronicles,11,3,"Yo, hit up Rehoboam, son of Solomon, king of Judah, and anyone in Judah and Benjamin. Here's what you gotta say:"
2 Chronicles,11,4,"Yo, listen up! The LORD says, 'Yo, chill! Don't go up and start fighting your bros. Just head back home, ya know? I'm the one behind all this. And guess what? They actually listened to the LORD and decided to bounce instead of going against Jeroboam."
2 Chronicles,11,5,So Rehoboam stayed in Jerusalem and constructed cities in Judah to enhance their security.
2 Chronicles,11,6,"He, like, totally constructed these sick places called Bethlehem, Etam, and Tekoa."
2 Chronicles,11,7,"And like yo, there's Bethzur, Shoco, and Adullam in da mix."
2 Chronicles,11,8,"And like, Gath, Mareshah, and Ziph,"
2 Chronicles,11,9,"And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,"
2 Chronicles,11,10,"And, like, there were also Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which were super fortified cities in the land of Judah and Benjamin."
2 Chronicles,11,11,"And he like, upgraded the strongholds and appointed captains to run them, stocked up on food, oil, and wine, you know, to keep his crew well supplied."
2 Chronicles,11,12,"And like, in every city, he was all about the shields and spears, making them super strong and representing Judah and Benjamin, you know?"
2 Chronicles,11,13,And all the priests and Levites from all over Israel came to him. They showed up from every corner of the land.
2 Chronicles,11,14,"So, like, the Levites decided to bounce from their hood and their stuff, and headed to Judah and Jerusalem. 'Cause Jeroboam and his sons basically cancelled them from doing their priest duties for the Lord, you know?"
2 Chronicles,11,15,"And he appointed some dudes to be priests for the wicked places, you know, like for those evil spirits and those calf idols he had made."
2 Chronicles,11,16,"And then, like, people from all the tribes of Israel who were totally committed to seeking the LORD God of Israel went to Jerusalem to give sacrifices to the LORD God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,11,17,"So they like totally boosted the kingdom of Judah and made Rehoboam, Solomon's kid, super powerful for a whole three years. Like, those three years were all about following in the footsteps of David and Solomon, you know?"
2 Chronicles,11,18,"And Rehoboam was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna marry Mahalath, daughter of Jerimoth, who's a homie from David's fam, and also Abihail, daughter of Eliab, son of Jesse, is gonna be part of the squad too."
2 Chronicles,11,19,"These are the kids he had: Jeush, Shamariah, and Zaham."
2 Chronicles,11,20,"Then he started dating Maachah, who was Absalom's daughter. They had kids named Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. BTW, Maachah was also known as Michaiah, Uriel's daughter."
2 Chronicles,11,21,"And Rehoboam was really into Maachah, Absalom's daughter. She was his favorite out of all his wives and concubines (because, you know, he had a bunch of them!). Rehoboam ended up having a total of eighteen wives, sixty concubines, twenty-eight sons, and sixty daughters! Can you imagine?"
2 Chronicles,11,22,"And Rehoboam promoted Abijah, Maachah's son, as the top leader among his siblings, with intentions of making him king."
2 Chronicles,11,23,"And he was really smart, and sent all his children to different places in the countries of Judah and Benjamin, to every cool city. And he made sure they had plenty of food. Also, he wanted to have lots of wives. {lots of wives: in Hebrew, a whole bunch of wives}"
2 Chronicles,12,1,"So, like, once Rehoboam was all settled in as king and everything, he started doing his own thing and totally went against what God wanted. And not just him, but all of Israel followed suit too."
2 Chronicles,12,2,"So, like, in the fifth year of King Rehoboam's reign, this dude Shishak, who was the king of Egypt, totally rolled up to Jerusalem, because the people there, like, totally messed up and went against the Lord."
2 Chronicles,12,3,"He had, like, 1200 chariots and 60,000 horse-riders, plus a huge crowd of people from Egypt. Can you believe it? There were Lubims, Sukkiims, and Ethiopians too!"
2 Chronicles,12,4,"And he totally conquered the super fortified cities that belonged to Judah, and then arrived at Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,12,5,"So this prophet named Shemaiah rolled up to Rehoboam and the squad of big shots from Judah, who were all chilling in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and he straight up told them, 'Listen up, the LORD has some words for you: You went and ditched me, so now I'm just gonna let Shishak give you a taste of his power.'"
2 Chronicles,12,6,"So basically, the big shots of Israel and the king were like, 'Okay, we messed up, God is totally in the right.'"
2 Chronicles,12,7,"And like, when God saw that they were like, being all humble and stuff, He was like, 'Yo, Shemaiah, listen up! They totally humbled themselves, so I'm not gonna wreck them completely. Instead, I'll let them have, like, some sort of relief from trouble. And like, my anger won't be unleashed on Jerusalem by Shishak, at least not immediately.'"
2 Chronicles,12,8,But they will be his servants so that they learn about serving me and serving the kingdoms of other nations.
2 Chronicles,12,9,"So, like, this dude Shishak, the king of Egypt, totally rolled up to Jerusalem, and straight up jacked all the sick treasures from the house of the LORD and the king's crib. He took everything, man! And, yo, he even swiped those epic gold shields that Solomon had made."
2 Chronicles,12,10,"But instead, King Rehoboam had these really cool brass shields made and gave them to his top guard to protect the entrance of his crib."
2 Chronicles,12,11,"So, when the king stepped inside the crib of the Almighty, the security squad swooped in, grabbed them, and then escorted them right back to the secure zone."
2 Chronicles,12,12,"And when he showed humility, God's anger towards him subsided, preventing complete destruction. And in Judah, things were going pretty smoothly. (and despite that, or surprisingly, good things happened in Judah)"
2 Chronicles,12,13,"King Rehoboam leveled up in Jerusalem and took charge. He was 41 years old when he started ruling and reigned for 17 years in Jerusalem, the city that the LORD picked as his favorite out of all the tribes of Israel. It was like a gamer tagging his name on a spot. And his mom, Naamah, was a total Ammonitess."
2 Chronicles,12,14,"And he messed up, because he didn't even bother to get his heart right and seek the LORD. {prepared: or, fixed}"
2 Chronicles,12,15,"So like, everything that Rehoboam did from the beginning to the end, it's all like written down in the book of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer, you know, documenting all the family trees and stuff. And oh man, Rehoboam and Jeroboam, they were constantly at war with each other. It's all recorded, ya know!"
2 Chronicles,12,16,And Rehoboam passed away and was laid to rest in the city of David. And his son Abijah took over as ruler. {Abijah: also known as Abijam}
2 Chronicles,13,1,"So, like, in the 18th year of King Jeroboam's rule, Abijah started being in charge of Judah."
2 Chronicles,13,2,"So this dude ruled the city for like three years, and his Mom, Michaiah, was from this place called Gibeah. And there was like this big feud going on between Abijah and Jeroboam."
2 Chronicles,13,3,"Abijah gathered up his crew of fearless warriors, a solid force of 400K handpicked soldiers. On the other side, Jeroboam wasn't messing around either, coming at him with a massive squad of 800K elite badasses. Abijah meant business, no doubt."
2 Chronicles,13,4,"So Abijah goes up to mount Zemaraim, this like, totally awesome place in mount Ephraim, and he's like, 'Listen up, Jeroboam and all you peeps of Israel! Hear what I gotta say!'"
2 Chronicles,13,5,"Don't you already know that the LORD God of Israel totally handed over the kingdom of Israel to David forever? Like, it's a serious deal and it even includes his kids, thanks to a super important agreement."
2 Chronicles,13,6,"But this dude Jeroboam, who used to work for Solomon, David's son, decided to go against his boss and rebelled."
2 Chronicles,13,7,"And a bunch of useless dudes, the children of Belial, got together and ganged up on Rehoboam, Solomon's son, when Rehoboam was still young and couldn't handle them."
2 Chronicles,13,8,"And now you actually believe that you can go against the Lord's kingdom, handled by the sons of David? Seriously? You may have a ton of people with you and those shiny golden calves that Jeroboam whipped up for you to worship, but come on now."
2 Chronicles,13,9,"Yo, did y'all just straight up reject the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites and instead made yourselves priests like those other nations? So now anyone who wants to be a priest, just gotta bring a young bull and seven rams and boom, they're a priest for some fake gods."
2 Chronicles,13,10,"But like, for real, the LORD is totally our God, and we haven't ditched Him at all. And the priests, who serve the LORD, they're like the sons of Aaron and the Levites handle all their tasks like total pros:"
2 Chronicles,13,11,"Every morning and evening, they offer burnt sacrifices and sweet incense to the LORD. They also neatly arrange the shewbread on the pure table, and light the golden candlestick with its lamps every evening. We remain faithful in carrying out the duties assigned by the LORD our God, but sadly, you have abandoned Him."
2 Chronicles,13,12,"Yo, check this out: God's got our back as our leader, and his priests are straight-up blasting trumpets to warn you. Listen up, fam, don't even think about going against the LORD, God of your ancestors. 'Cause I promise you, it won't end well for you."
2 Chronicles,13,13,"But then Jeroboam set up a sneaky trap from the back: so while Judah was facing them, the trap was lurking behind them."
2 Chronicles,13,14,"And, like, Judah turned around and saw, like, the battle happening in front of them and behind them too. So they, like, cried out to the LORD, and the priests, like, blasted their trumpets."
2 Chronicles,13,15,"So, like, the dudes from Judah were like, shouting and stuff, and, like, OMG, God totally wrecked Jeroboam and all of Israel, just straight up owned them in front of Abijah and his crew from Judah. #Gameover"
2 Chronicles,13,16,"So, like, the Israelites ran away from Judah, but God totally let them get beat."
2 Chronicles,13,17,"And Abijah and his squad totally wrecked them: like, they wiped out five hundred thousand elite soldiers from Israel."
2 Chronicles,13,18,"So the Israelites got owned back then, but the people from Judah came out on top because they had faith in the LORD God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,13,19,"So Abijah went after Jeroboam and conquered some cities from him, like Bethel and its surrounding towns, Jeshanah and its surrounding towns, and Ephrain along with its surrounding towns."
2 Chronicles,13,20,Jeroboam couldn't make a comeback during Abijah's time because the big man upstairs put him down for good.
2 Chronicles,13,21,"Abijah became super successful and had a total of fourteen wives, and they had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters together."
2 Chronicles,13,22,"The other stuff Abijah did, and how he rolled, and what he said, is all recorded in the book written by the prophet Iddo."
2 Chronicles,14,1,"And then Abijah passed away, being laid to rest in the city of David. Asa, his son, took his place as ruler. For the next decade, things were chill and peaceful in the land."
2 Chronicles,14,2,And Asa was totally on point and did what was lit and righteous in the eyes of the LORD his God:
2 Chronicles,14,3,"Because he totally got rid of those altars dedicated to random deities and destroyed all those fancy places they were worshiped at. He straight up demolished their statues and chopped down those groves. (BTW, 'images' means statues, in case you were wondering.)"
2 Chronicles,14,4,"And like, he told Judah to totally seek the LORD God of their ancestors, and, you know, actually follow the rules and stuff."
2 Chronicles,14,5,"Then he removed all the fancy worship spots and false gods from all the cities in Judah, and everything became calm in the kingdom. {images: or idols}"
2 Chronicles,14,6,"And he like, totally built these awesome fortified cities in Judah, ya know? 'Cause the land was all chill and peaceful, no wars and stuff, 'cause it was a vibe from the LORD. Spreadin' that rest, you feel me?"
2 Chronicles,14,7,"So he was like, yo Judah, let's flex on these cities by building walls, towers, gates, and bars. Like, we gotta secure our land while it's still open, because we've been seeking the LORD our God and He's blessed us with mad peace and protection. And guess what? They actually built everything and straight up thrived."
2 Chronicles,14,8,"So Asa had this army, right? Like, there were three hundred thousand warriors from Judah, and they were equipped with shields and spears. And then Benjamin brought in two hundred eighty thousand soldiers with shields and bows. Let me tell you, these dudes were fierce and courageous. Total badasses!"
2 Chronicles,14,9,"So this dude named Zerah, who was from Ethiopia, like no joke, rolls up with, get this, a massive army of a million peeps and three hundred chariots, and they straight up pull up to Mareshah."
2 Chronicles,14,10,"So Asa confronted him, and they planned the showdown in the epic battlefield at Zephathah Valley by Mareshah."
2 Chronicles,14,11,"So Asa was like, yo God, we really need your help. It doesn't matter if we're few or weak, you can totally come through for us. We're counting on you, our God, to defeat this huge crowd. Don't let any mere mortal beat you."
2 Chronicles,14,12,"Yo, God totally wrecked the Ethiopians when they came up against Asa and Judah, and those Ethiopians straight up ran away in fear."
2 Chronicles,14,13,"So Asa and his squad chased after those boys all the way to Gerar. They totally wrecked the Ethiopians, like they couldn't even bounce back. It was a complete annihilation in front of the LORD and his crew, and they scored some major loot."
2 Chronicles,14,14,"And they totally wrecked all the cities near Gerar, because they were straight-up terrified of the Lord. They raided all the cities and scored mad loot, 'cause there was a ton of awesome stuff for the taking."
2 Chronicles,14,15,"They totally wrecked the tents where the animals were chillin', and straight up hauled away a bunch of sheep and camels, like way too many. Then they came back to Jerusalem, no biggie."
2 Chronicles,15,1,"And God's vibe hit Azariah, Oded's kid:"
2 Chronicles,15,2,"So, he goes to hang with Asa and drops some truth bombs like, 'Listen up, Asa, and all you peeps from Judah and Benjamin! Here's the deal- if you stick with the LORD, He's got your back. And if you actually go looking for Him, you'll totally find Him. But, if you bail on Him, don't be surprised if He bounces on you.' #loyalty"
2 Chronicles,15,3,"For, like, a really long time, Israel has been totally lost without the real God, and they haven't had a single cool priest to teach them, or any rules to follow."
2 Chronicles,15,4,"But, like, when they were going through tough times and stuff, they turned to the LORD God of Israel and reached out to Him, and yo, He totally showed up for them."
2 Chronicles,15,5,"And back in the day, nobody could catch a break whether they were coming or going. It was pure chaos and stress for everyone living in those places."
2 Chronicles,15,6,"And one nation was getting wrecked by another nation, and cities were getting trashed by other cities, 'cause God was totally messing them up with all sorts of troubles. {wrecked: Hebrew for beaten into pieces}"
2 Chronicles,15,7,"So, like, be strong and don't let your hands turn all weak, okay? 'Cause, guess what? You're totally gonna get rewarded for all your hard work, for real!"
2 Chronicles,15,8,"So Asa, after hearing what Oded the prophet said, felt empowered and got rid of all the disgusting idols from the entire land of Judah and Benjamin, as well as from the cities he had conquered from Mount Ephraim. He also restored the altar of the LORD that stood in front of the LORD's entrance."
2 Chronicles,15,9,"And he got together all the homies from Judah and Benjamin, and even some outsiders from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, because they knew he was the real deal and the Lord his God had his back."
2 Chronicles,15,10,"So they all came together in Jerusalem in the third month, during Asa's fifteenth year as king."
2 Chronicles,15,11,"And they flexed on the LORD with some mad offerings, bringing in a whopping 700 oxen and 7,000 sheep from their sick loot. It was lit, straight up."
2 Chronicles,15,12,"And they made a pact to fully vibe with the LORD God of their ancestors, giving it their all - heart and soul!"
2 Chronicles,15,13,"Anyone who refuses to seek the LORD God of Israel will face capital punishment, regardless of age, gender, or social status."
2 Chronicles,15,14,"And they were like, totally swearin' to the LORD, like super loud, with shoutin' and blastin' trumpets, and jammin' on cornets."
2 Chronicles,15,15,"And all of Judah was stoked about the promise, 'cause they were fully committed and super eager to find Him. And guess what? They found Him, and the LORD totally hooked them up with some chill vibes all around."
2 Chronicles,15,16,"And, like, Asa the king straight up dethroned Maachah, who was Asa's grandma, all because she went and made this freaky idol in the woods. So Asa went ahead and destroyed that idol, crushing it with his foot and burning it down by the brook Kidron. No room for idols and horror shows in his kingdom, man."
2 Chronicles,15,17,"But the Instagram-worthy destinations were not abolished in Israel, even though Asa stayed true to his values throughout his life."
2 Chronicles,15,18,"And he flexed in the house of God with the stuff his pops gave him, and the stuff he flexed with, like mad silver, gold, and dope af items."
2 Chronicles,15,19,And there wasn't any more fighting until Asa had been king for thirty-five years.
2 Chronicles,16,1,"Like, this one time in, like, the 36th year of Asa's rule, Baasha, the king of Israel, totally attacked Judah and built up this city called Ramah, with, like, the purpose of blocking anyone from like, entering or leaving Judah where Asa was the king, you know?"
2 Chronicles,16,2,"So Asa flexed his riches from the stash of the Lord's house and the king's crib, and hit up Benhadad, the boss of Syria, chilling in Damascus, like, yo, I got something to say."
2 Chronicles,16,3,"Just so you know, there's an agreement between us, just like there was between our dads. Check it out, I've hooked you up with some cash and bling. Now, go ahead and ditch that alliance with Baasha, the king of Israel, so he'll leave me alone."
2 Chronicles,16,4,"So Benhadad listened to king Asa and sent his army captains to attack the cities of Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abelmaim, and all the storied cities of Naphtali."
2 Chronicles,16,5,"And it happened, when Baasha heard about it, that he stopped building Ramah and quit his project."
2 Chronicles,16,6,So King Asa gathered all the people of Judah and they took the stones from Ramah and the wood that Baasha was using to build. Then they used those materials to construct Geba and Mizpah.
2 Chronicles,16,7,"So Hanani the visionary went up to Asa, the king of Judah, and was like, 'Bro, you totally messed up. You depended on the king of Syria instead of trusting in the LORD your God, and now the Syrian army slipped away from your grip.'"
2 Chronicles,16,8,"Yo, weren't the Ethiopians and the Lubims, like, a massive crew rolling deep with mad chariots and horsemen? But yo, since you put your trust in the LORD, he straight up handed them over to you. {a huge: like, in abundance, you know}"
2 Chronicles,16,9,"The LORD be keeping a watchful eye all over the earth, flexing His divine strength for those who stay loyal to Him. But you messed up big time, so get ready for some serious conflict from here on out. (And no, it's not just about flexing His strength, it's about being there for you and stuff.)"
2 Chronicles,16,10,"So Asa got really mad at the seer and threw him into a prison cell. He was so furious with him because of what he said. And on top of that, Asa also mistreated some of the people during that time."
2 Chronicles,16,11,"Yo, check it out. The whole story of Asa, from start to finish, is all documented in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
2 Chronicles,16,12,"And when Asa had been ruling for 39 years, he got a serious foot disease. It was really bad, but instead of turning to the LORD, he went to the doctors for help."
2 Chronicles,16,13,"And Asa passed away, joining his ancestors, in the forty-first year of his rule."
2 Chronicles,16,14,"They put him to rest in his fancy tombs that he built for himself in the city of David, and placed him on a comfy bed filled with lovely scents and various types of aromatic spices crafted by the clever apothecaries. Then they held a grand bonfire in his honor. (had made: In Hebrew, it means had dug)"
2 Chronicles,17,1,And then Jehoshaphat took over as king and made sure to stand strong against Israel.
2 Chronicles,17,2,"And he, like, stationed a bunch of troops in, like, all the fortified cities of Judah. He, you know, put soldiers in like, the land of Judah, and also in the cities of Ephraim, that his dad Asa had, you know, captured."
2 Chronicles,17,3,"And God was with Jehoshaphat because he followed in the footsteps of his dad, David, and didn't get caught up with worshipping false gods."
2 Chronicles,17,4,"Instead, they looked to the {LORD} God of their father, and followed his commandments, not the ways of Israel."
2 Chronicles,17,5,"So, like, God totally made Jehoshaphat the king and all the people of Judah showered him with gifts and stuff. He was, like, loaded with riches and had, like, mad respect from everyone. #blessed"
2 Chronicles,17,6,"And he was totally on the Lord's vibe, like all in. Plus, he got rid of all those sketchy high places and groves in Judah."
2 Chronicles,17,7,"And in the third year of his reign, he hit up his squad - Benhail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethaneel, and Michaiah - to spread the knowledge in the cities of Judah."
2 Chronicles,17,8,"And he also sent some Levites to assist them. Their names were Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah. Among the Levites, there were Elishama and Jehoram, who were priests."
2 Chronicles,17,9,"So, like, they were teaching in Judah and they had the book of the law of the LORD, right? And they were all, like, going around to all the cities in Judah, spreading the teachings and, like, educating the people."
2 Chronicles,17,10,"And all the other kingdoms surrounding Judah were mad shook by the LORD, so they didn't even think about starting any war with Jehoshaphat. They were straight up scared, y'all. No cap. 🔥"
2 Chronicles,17,11,"Yo, just so you know, some of the Philistines showed up with some sick gifts for Jehoshaphat. They brought him a bunch of tribute silver. And check it, the Arabians came through with a massive haul of flocks - we're talking seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and another seven thousand and seven hundred he goats. That's straight up impressive."
2 Chronicles,17,12,"Jehoshaphat was very successful and he flexed hard; he built some sick castles and epic cities in Judah. {castles: or, palaces}"
2 Chronicles,17,13,"And he was hella busy in the cities of Judah: and the homies who were warriors, straight up badass dudes, were posted up in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,17,14,"So, these are the stats of the squad based on their family background: In the crew of Judah, we got Adnah leading the way with three hundred thousand fierce warriors by his side. They're absolutely formidable."
2 Chronicles,17,15,"And right beside him was Jehohanan, the leader, and he had a solid crew of two hundred and eighty thousand with him. They had his back, no doubt."

2 Chronicles,17,17,"And Benjamin had Eliada, who was pretty badass, leading an army of 200k armed dudes with bows and shields."
2 Chronicles,17,18,"And right beside him was Jehozabad, with a massive army of 180,000 fully geared up for battle."
2 Chronicles,17,19,"These dudes served the king, along with the ones the king stationed in the fortified cities all over Judah."
2 Chronicles,18,1,"So, like, Jehoshaphat was totally loaded and respected by everyone, and he totally teamed up with Ahab."
2 Chronicles,18,2,"So, after some time, he went down to Ahab in Samaria. And Ahab hooked him up with tons of sheep and oxen, not just for him but also for all the homies he brought along. Ahab convinced him to roll with him to Ramothgilead. Yeet!"
2 Chronicles,18,3,"So, like, Ahab, the king of Israel, asked Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, if he wanted to join him in this battle, you know, in Ramothgilead. And Jehoshaphat was all like, 'I got your back, man! Me and my people are with you. Let's do this!'"
2 Chronicles,18,4,"Yo, Jehoshaphat told the king of Israel, 'Yo, can you hit up the LORD today and see what He's gotta say?'"
2 Chronicles,18,5,"So the king of Israel rounded up about 400 prophets and asked them, 'Should we roll up to Ramothgilead for a brawl or should I chill out? And they were all like, 'Go for it! God's got your back, man.'"
2 Chronicles,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat was like, 'Yo, isn't there another prophet of the LORD around here we could ask for guidance? I mean, more options, ya know?'"
2 Chronicles,18,7,"The king of Israel was like, 'There's this one guy we can ask the LORD through, but ugh, I can't stand him! He always brings bad news, never anything good. Yeah, it's Micaiah, son of Imla.' But Jehoshaphat was like, 'Don't say that, King.'"
2 Chronicles,18,8,"So, the king of Israel was like, 'Yo, find that officer dude and hurry up and bring me Micaiah, son of Imla.'"
2 Chronicles,18,9,"So, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were chilling on their thrones, decked out in their fancy outfits, posted up in this open area by the entrance of the gate in Samaria. And all the prophets were dropping some mad prophecies in front of them."
2 Chronicles,18,10,"So, Zedekiah, Chenaanah's kid, went ahead and crafted some sick iron horns. And he was like, 'Yo, the LORD says you gonna rock these horns and straight up wreck Syria until they are totally wiped out. Like, you gonna consume them, bro!'"
2 Chronicles,18,11,"And all the prophets were like, 'Yo, go to Ramothgilead and you'll totally crush it, dude. The LORD's got your back and he's gonna hand it over to the king.'"
2 Chronicles,18,12,"So, the guy who was sent to fetch Micaiah approached him and said, 'Listen up, bro, all the prophets are saying really positive stuff to the king. It would be great if you could join in and say the same things. Spread some positivity, you know?'"
2 Chronicles,18,13,"And Micaiah was like, yo, I swear by the LORD's name, whatever info my God gives me, that's exactly what I'm gonna say, no lie."
2 Chronicles,18,14,"So, like, when he arrived in front of the king, the king was like, 'Hey Micaiah, should we go to Ramothgilead and fight the battle, or should I chill out?' And Micaiah was like, 'Dude, go for it! You'll crush 'em and they'll totally surrender to you.'"
2 Chronicles,18,15,"And the king was like, dude, I've asked you so many times to just be honest with me in the Lord's name. Can you please not keep anything from me?"
2 Chronicles,18,16,"Yo, so he was like, I totally saw all of Israel spread out on the mountains, like clueless sheep without a shepherd. And then the LORD was like, 'These peeps don't have a boss, so let 'em all go back home in peace, yo.'"
2 Chronicles,18,17,"Yo, the king of Israel was like, 'Didn't I tell you that he's not gonna bring me good news, only bad? Like, seriously?'}"
2 Chronicles,18,18,"So, like, listen up guys, God was all like, 'Yo, pay attention and hear what the LORD's gotta say.' And then I saw God chilling on His throne, and the whole crew of angels were standing on His right and left side, you know what I'm saying?"
2 Chronicles,18,19,"So, like, the LORD was like, 'Yo, who's gonna trick Ahab, the king of Israel, into going up to Ramothgilead and end up eating dirt?' And one dude was like, 'I got an idea, hear me out,' and another dude was like, 'Hold up, I got a different plan, check it out.'"
2 Chronicles,18,20,"Suddenly, a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, 'I got this, I'll totally mess with him.' And the LORD replied, 'Okay, how do you plan on doing that?'"
2 Chronicles,18,21,"And he was like, I'm gonna dip and be a total fake spirit, giving bogus prophecies to all his peeps. Then, the LORD was like, you should totally lure him in and you're gonna succeed, so just go ahead and do it."
2 Chronicles,18,22,"Yo, just listen up. God straight up put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets, and He's not holding back on His judgment against you."
2 Chronicles,18,23,"So Zedekiah, Chenaanah's kid, walks up and slaps Micaiah on the face. He's all like, 'Hey, how did the Spirit of the LORD end up talking to you instead of me? Like, what's the deal?'"
2 Chronicles,18,24,"Yo, listen up! Micaiah straight up told him, 'Check it, bro, when you go all low-key into that secret hiding spot, you gonna see what's about to go down on that day. Don't even trip, it's gonna be some next level stuff happening there.'"
2 Chronicles,18,25,"And the king of Israel was like, 'Hey, grab Micaiah and take him back to Amon, the ruler of the city, and to Joash, the king's son!'"
2 Chronicles,18,26,"And the king's like, 'Yo, throw this dude in jail, give him some sad, bland bread and water, and keep him there until I come back unharmed.'"
2 Chronicles,18,27,"And Micaiah was like, if you come back in one piece, then the LORD totally spoke through me. And he was like, listen up, everyone."
2 Chronicles,18,28,"So, like, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat – the king of Judah, you know – they decided to head up to this place called Ramothgilead."
2 Chronicles,18,29,"The king of Israel was like, 'Yo, Jehoshaphat, I'm gonna change up my look and go to battle incognito, but you stay in your fancy robes.' So the king of Israel completely transformed his appearance and they both headed to the battle."
2 Chronicles,18,30,"So the king of Syria told his chariot captains not to fight with anyone except the king of Israel, whether they were weak or strong."
2 Chronicles,18,31,"And, like, when the dudes in the chariots peeped Jehoshaphat, they were like, 'Yo, it's the king of Israel, fam!' So they started circling him, ready to throw down. But Jehoshaphat straight up shouted out, and the LORD came through and had his back, man! God made those haters bounce and peace out from him."
2 Chronicles,18,32,"So basically, when the chariot leaders figured out it wasn't the king of Israel they were chasing, they decided to turn around and give up on pursuing him."
2 Chronicles,18,33,So this dude randomly shot an arrow and hit the king of Israel right in his weak spot. The king told his chariot driver to turn around and get him out of there because he got messed up.
2 Chronicles,18,34,"The fight was getting intense that day, but the king of Israel held his ground in his cool chariot against the Syrians until the evening. And when the sun was about to set, he sadly passed away."

2 Chronicles,21,8,"During his time, the Edomites straight up decided they were done being ruled by Judah and went ahead and crowned their own king. Flexin' on their independence, ya know? (By the way, dominion in Hebrew means having control or power, just so you're in the loop.)"
2 Chronicles,21,9,"So Jehoram and his squad, riding in their dope chariots, rolled out and pulled an all-nighter. They straight up wrecked the Edomites who were hella surrounding them, including those chariot leaders."

2 Chronicles,21,13,"But you, like, totally followed the same messed up path as the kings of Israel. You made Judah and the people of Jerusalem go off the rails, engaging in some seriously questionable behavior, just like the scandalous stuff that went down in the Ahab household. And not only that, you went ahead and straight up killed your own brothers who were actually better than you. Like, seriously?"
2 Chronicles,21,14,"Yo, check it out! The Lord is gonna hit you and your whole crew with a massive plague. It's gonna affect your people, your kids, your wives, and all your stuff. #EpicSmite"

2 Chronicles,21,16,"And God totally sparked some major drama for Jehoram by getting the Philistines and the Arabians, who were chilling near the Ethiopians, all riled up against him:"
2 Chronicles,21,17,"So these guys rolled up to Judah, broke in, and straight up took everything they found in the king's crib - like, all his valuables, his sons, and even his wives.

2 Chronicles,21,18,"And then, like, God totally hit him with this like, super serious illness in his digestive system that, like, couldn't be cured or anything."

And to make matters worse, he ended up kicking the bucket from some serious illnesses. And get this, his peeps didn't even give him a proper funeral pyre like his ancestors had. Super disrespectful, right?"
2 Chronicles,21,20,"He was 32 years old when he started ruling, and he ruled in Jerusalem for 8 years, but sadly, no one really cared about him. They did bury him in the city of David, but not with the other kings in the fancy tombs. {without...: meaning nobody really wanted him there}"
2 Chronicles,22,1,"So, the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, the youngest son of Jehoram king of Judah, their new king because the Arabians who came to attack their camp had killed all the older sons. And thus, Ahaziah began his reign as the ruler."
2 Chronicles,22,2,Ahaziah was 42 years old when he became king. He ruled over Jerusalem for one year. His mom's name was Athaliah and she was Omri's daughter.
2 Chronicles,22,3,"He was influenced by Ahab's crew, because his mom was his partner in crime."
2 Chronicles,22,4,"So basically, he was a total disaster in God's eyes, just like the Ahab crew. They were his advisors and led him to his downfall after his dad kicked the bucket."
2 Chronicles,22,5,"He totally did what they suggested and joined Jehoram, the son of Ahab, who was the king of Israel, in waging war against Hazael, the king of Syria at Ramothgilead. And guess what? The Syrians totally defeated Joram."
2 Chronicles,22,6,"So, this guy went back to Jezreel to get healed from the injuries he got in a fight with Hazael, the king of Syria. And Azariah, the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah, went down to Jezreel to visit Jehoram, son of Ahab, because he wasn't feeling well. (Just a little FYI, Azariah is also known as Ahaziah or Jehoahaz, in case you were wondering.)"
2 Chronicles,22,7,"So Ahaziah met his downfall because of God's plan. He joined forces with Joram to confront Jehu, the chosen one anointed by the LORD to dismantle the Ahab dynasty."
2 Chronicles,22,8,"So, like, Jehu was totally carrying out some serious judgment on the house of Ahab. And, while he was doing that, he came across these VIPs from Judah and the cousins of Ahaziah who had been serving him, and he straight up took them out."
2 Chronicles,22,9,"And they tried to find Ahaziah, and finally caught him hiding in Samaria. They brought him to Jehu, who killed him and buried him. They said, 'He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who truly worshipped the LORD with all his heart.' After his death, the house of Ahaziah lost its power and couldn't retain the kingdom."
2 Chronicles,22,10,"But like, when Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was like, totally dead, she like, rose up and, destroyed all the royal fam of the house of Judah."
2 Chronicles,22,11,"But Jehoshabeath, who was the king's daughter, saved Joash, Ahaziah's son, by sneaking him out from the others who were killed, and hid him and his nurse in a secret room. You see, Jehoshabeath was the daughter of King Jehoram and the wife of Jehoiada the priest, and she was also Ahaziah's sister. She made sure Athaliah couldn't find Joash and harm him."
2 Chronicles,22,12,"And he totally went undercover with them in the house of God for like six years straight, while Athaliah was, like, totally ruling the whole land."
2 Chronicles,23,1,"So, in the seventh year, Jehoiada decided to level up and gathered the squad: Azariah, son of Jeroham, Ishmael, son of Jehohanan, Azariah (again), son of Obed, Maaseiah, son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat, son of Zichri, and they became bros forever."
2 Chronicles,23,2,"So they traveled throughout Judah, gathering up all the Levites from every city in Judah, as well as the respected elders of Israel, and together they arrived in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,23,3,"And like, the whole group of peeps in the church made a deal with the king in the house of God. And he was like, yo, check it, the king's son gonna rule, just like the LORD said about David's descendants."
2 Chronicles,23,4,"Here's what you gotta do: On the Sabbath, a third of you cool peeps, including priests and Levites, should take turns being doorkeepers. Yeah, like guarding the doors, you know? The Hebrew word for 'doors' actually means 'thresholds', by the way."
2 Chronicles,23,5,"And like, one-third will hang at the king's crib, one-third will chill at the foundation gate, and everyone else will be vibin' in the courts of the Lord's crib."
2 Chronicles,23,6,Only the priests and Levites who serve in the house of the LORD are allowed to enter; they are the chosen ones. The rest of the people must remain vigilant and honor the watch of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,23,7,"The Levites gonna surround the king, each of them armed and ready. Anyone else who enters the house gonna get killed, just FYI. But y'all gotta stick with the king when he comes in and leaves, you feel me?"
2 Chronicles,23,8,"So, like, the Levites and everyone in Judah totally followed all the instructions from Jehoiada the priest. They made sure to bring in the people who were supposed to work on the Sabbath and let those who were supposed to take a break do their thing. 'Cause Jehoiada the priest didn't mess around and didn't cancel any shifts."
2 Chronicles,23,9,"Also, Jehoiada the priest gave the army leaders some sick weapons like spears, bucklers, and shields that belonged to king David and were kept in God's crib 😎"
2 Chronicles,23,10,"And he gathered all the peeps, each person flexing with their weapon in hand, from one end of the temple to the other, all around the altar and crib, right by the king. {side: like shoulder, you know} {temple: like house, but fancy}"
2 Chronicles,23,11,"So they brought out the king's son and placed the crown on him, and handed him the official documents, declaring him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and exclaimed, 'Long live the king!'"
2 Chronicles,23,12,"So like, when Athaliah heard all the commotion and hype from the people cheering for the king, she rolled up to the crowd at the crib of the LORD:"
2 Chronicles,23,13,"And she looked, and, OMG, the king was standing at his fancy entrance with the important people and the trumpets next to him. And all the peeps in the land were super stoked and started playing the trumpets, and there were singers rocking out with their musical instruments, giving praises. Then Athaliah freaked out and tore her clothes, yelling, 'Conspiracy, Conspiracy!'"
2 Chronicles,23,14,"So, like, Jehoiada, the priest, got all the hundreds captains that were in charge of the army together and was like, 'Yo, dudes! Take her out of here and if anyone tries to chase after her, kill 'em with swords, man! The priest said not to take her out in the house of the LORD, tho."
2 Chronicles,23,15,"So they grabbed her; and when she arrived at the entrance of the horse gate by the king's house, they killed her right there."
2 Chronicles,23,16,"And Jehoiada, like, made this super legit agreement between him, all the peeps, and the king, yo. They were all gonna be the LORD'S squad, no doubt."
2 Chronicles,23,17,"So, like, everyone just stormed into Baal's crib and straight-up wrecked it. They smashed his altars and destroyed his statues, and they even took out Mattan, the priest of Baal, right there in front of those altars."
2 Chronicles,23,18,"Jehoiada also assigned the responsibility of running the house of the LORD to the priests, who were from the tribe of Levi. This was something David had planned out when he set up the house of the LORD. Their main job was to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, just as it was written in the law of Moses. And they did it with so much joy and singing, exactly how David had instructed."
2 Chronicles,23,19,"And he put the cool bouncers at the entrances of the house of the LORD, making sure no one dirty could come in."
2 Chronicles,23,20,"Then he gathered the top squad leaders, the VIPs, and the influencer bosses, along with all the cool people in the land. They took the king out from the holy crib and escorted him through the fancy entrance to his banging pad. Finally, they hooked the king up on the throne, ruling the kingdom like a boss."
2 Chronicles,23,21,And everyone was stoked about it: the city was finally chill after they straight up defeated Athaliah with a sword.
2 Chronicles,24,1,"Joash was only 7 years old when he started ruling the kingdom, and he ruled the city of Jerusalem for a solid 40 years. By the way, his mom's name was Zibiah and she came from Beersheba."
2 Chronicles,24,2,"And Joash was totally on point, like he knew what's up with the LORD, throughout Jehoiada the priest's entire gig."
2 Chronicles,24,3,"So Jehoiada decided to have two wives, and he ended up having sons and daughters with them."

2 Chronicles,24,5,"So, he called all the priests and Levites and told them, 'Head out to the towns in Judah and get money from all the Israelites to fix up the house of your God every year, and make sure you do it quickly.' But the Levites didn't do it quickly."
2 Chronicles,24,6,"The king hit up Jehoiada, the big boss, and asked him why he hasn't told the Levites to bring in the cash from Judah and Jerusalem like Moses and the crew of Israel commanded. It's for the Tabernacle, yo!"
2 Chronicles,24,7,"So, like, those Athaliah's kids, you know, that totally wicked woman, they totally wrecked God's crib and gave away all the sacred stuff in the LORD's house to those Baalim dudes."
2 Chronicles,24,8,So the king told them to make a chest and put it outside the gate of the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,24,9,"So they sent out a message to everyone in Judah and Jerusalem, telling them to bring the offering that Moses, God's loyal servant, commanded the people of Israel to give while they were in the wilderness. The message was loud and clear!"
2 Chronicles,24,10,"And like, everyone, including the cool leaders and all the peeps, were totally stoked and brought in their contributions, throwing them into the chest until they were done, ya feel me?"
2 Chronicles,24,11,"So, like, when they brought the chest to the king's office and saw that there was a lot of money, the scribe of the king and the officer of the high priest came and emptied the chest. Then they took it and put it back in its place. They did this every day and gathered a ton of money."
2 Chronicles,24,12,"So, the king and Jehoiada hooked up the people who were grinding at the house of the LORD with some cash, and they hired skilled workers like masons and carpenters to fix up the crib. They even found peeps who could handle iron and brass to repair the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,24,13,"So the workers got to work and did a great job, making sure everything in the house of God was on point and strong. They really showed out and made it perfect, no doubt. God's place is lit now, thanks to their skills and dedication!"
2 Chronicles,24,14,"And after they were done, they brought the remaining money to the king and Jehoiada, who used it to make cool stuff for the house of the LORD, like sacred utensils and equipment for offerings, and even fancy spoons made of gold and silver. They kept offering burnt sacrifices in the house of the LORD non-stop throughout Jehoiada's time. (or, pestils)"
2 Chronicles,24,15,"But Jehoiada got super old, like, lived a really long time and then he passed away. He was legit a hundred and thirty years old when he died."
2 Chronicles,24,16,"And they laid him to rest in the city of David where the kings rest, cuz he was a real one in Israel and showed love to God and his fam."

2 Chronicles,24,18,"So, they actually ditched the LORD God of their ancestors and started worshipping trees and statues like it was cool. And surprise, surprise, Judah and Jerusalem got seriously messed up because of their messed up actions."
2 Chronicles,24,19,"But he like totally sent prophets to them, you know, to bring them back to the LORD. And these prophets were like speaking truth and all, but they were totally ignored."
2 Chronicles,24,20,"And then Zechariah, Jehoiada's son who was a priest, felt the Spirit of God settle upon him as he stood among the people. He spoke to them, saying, 'Listen up, everyone! God has a message for you. You've been breaking the LORD's commandments, and that's why you're not doing so well. It's because you've turned your back on the LORD, and as a result, He's turned His back on you too.'"
2 Chronicles,24,21,"And, like, they totally teamed up against him, and, like, threw a bunch of rocks at him because the king said so, right in the court of the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,24,22,"So, like, King Joash totally forgot about all the good things that his father Jehoiada did for him and actually ended up killing his own son. And right before he died, he was like, 'Yo, God, you better take notice of this and make things right.'"
2 Chronicles,24,23,"So, like, after a whole year, the army of Syria totally attacked this dude. They rolled up to Judah and Jerusalem and straight-up wrecked all the big shots of the land, taking all their stuff and sending it to the king of Damascus. You know, Damascus, that place."
2 Chronicles,24,24,"Yo, the Syrians rolled up with a few homies, but then the big man upstairs handed them a massive L. The reason? These dudes straight up ditched the OG LORD God of their ancestors. As a result, they straight up served some justice to Joash."
2 Chronicles,24,25,"After they abandoned him, because he was seriously ill, his own servants plotted against him to avenge the sons of Jehoiada the priest. They killed him while he was in bed, and he died. They buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs reserved for the kings."
2 Chronicles,24,26,"And these are the people who plotted against him: Zabad, the son of Shimeath, who was an Ammonite, and Jehozabad, the son of Shimrith, who was a Moabite. (Zabad could also be called Jozacher, and Shimrith could also be called Shomer.)"
2 Chronicles,24,27,"So, like, there's this whole thing about this guy's sons and how they were, like, really burdened with a bunch of responsibilities and stuff. And they totally wrote all about it in this book called the book of the kings. Then this guy named Amaziah took over as king after his dad. He was like, into fixing and rebuilding the house of God. It's all in there, you know?"
2 Chronicles,25,1,"Amaziah was like 25 when he became king, and he ruled for about 29 years in Jerusalem. By the way, his mom's name was Jehoaddan and she was from Jerusalem too."
2 Chronicles,25,2,"He was like, totally doing the right thing in God's eyes, but he had, like, not a completely pure heart, you know?"
2 Chronicles,25,3,"So, after he became king and everything was official, he decided to take out the people who had offed his dad. True story, fam. #KingdomVibes"
2 Chronicles,25,4,"But he didn't kill their children, he followed what it says in the law, written in the book of Moses. The LORD commanded, saying, Parents shouldn't be punished for their children, and children shouldn't be punished for their parents. Everyone should take responsibility for their own mistakes and face the consequences."
2 Chronicles,25,5,"So Amaziah brought all the people of Judah together and appointed leaders over thousands and hundreds, following their family lines in the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. He counted all those who were at least twenty years old and discovered that there were three hundred thousand skilled warriors who were ready for battle, skilled in handling spears and shields."
2 Chronicles,25,6,He also hired a hundred thousand absolute legends from Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
2 Chronicles,25,7,"Yo, listen up! This holy dude rolled up to the king and straight up said, Kingg, don't take the Israelite army with you, cuz the LORD's not rocking with them, especially the Ephraim crew.'"
2 Chronicles,25,8,"But if you're gonna go, then do it. Get yourself ready for battle, 'cause God's gonna make you fall in front of the enemy. He's got the power to help or bring you down."
2 Chronicles,25,9,"And Amaziah was like, dude, what are we gonna do about the hundred talents I gave to the army of Israel? And the man of God was like, bro, the LORD can totally hook you up with way more than that. {army: Hebrew word for band}"
2 Chronicles,25,10,"So Amaziah split with the troops from Ephraim who had come to him, telling them to bounce back and head home. This made them super pissed off at Judah, and they stormed back home with a burning rage. #TemperIssues"
2 Chronicles,25,11,"So Amaziah, like, totally powered up and assembled his crew, then they headed out to this place called the valley of salt and totally whooped the children of Seir, like, ten thousand of them got dealt with. Gnarly!"
2 Chronicles,25,12,"So, the kids from Judah took about ten thousand others as prisoners and brought them to the top of the rock. And dang, they straight up yeeted them off the top, and they all got totally wrecked and shattered."
2 Chronicles,25,13,"But the soldiers that Amaziah didn't want to fight with him turned around and attacked several cities in Judah, from Samaria all the way to Bethhoron. They defeated three thousand people and took a lot of loot."
2 Chronicles,25,14,"So, like, once Amaziah was done fighting the Edomites and all, he straight-up started worshiping their gods! He was all about the gods of the children of Seir, setting them up as his own. He even got down on his knees and burned some incense for them, man!"
2 Chronicles,25,15,"So, like, the LORD got super mad at Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him and was like, 'Dude, seriously? Why are you worshiping these useless gods that couldn't even save their own people from you?'"
2 Chronicles,25,16,"And like, as they were, like, talking, the king was like, yo, dude, are you, like, part of the king's squad? Chill, man, why would you wanna get wrecked? So the prophet, like, held back and was like, I know for sure that God is planning to wreck you, 'cause you've, like, totally messed up and didn't listen to my advice. Like, for real, man."
2 Chronicles,25,17,"So Amaziah, the king of Judah, decided to chat with Joash, the son of Jehoahaz and grandson of Jehu, the king of Israel. He was like, 'Hey, Joash! Let's meet up and have a face-to-face convo!'"
2 Chronicles,25,18,"So, like, Joash, the king of Israel, hit up Amaziah, the king of Judah, and was like, 'Yo, that little weed in Lebanon slid into the DMs of those tall trees in Lebanon and was like, 'Hey, let's do a little royal merger by marrying your daughter to my son.' But then, outta nowhere, a savage beast from the field showed up and straight-up wrecked the weed.'"
2 Chronicles,25,19,"So you're like, 'Oh look, I totally crushed the Edomites!' and you're feeling all proud and stuff. But seriously, just stay at home. Why would you want to mess with something that's only gonna hurt you and end up making you, and even Judah, fall?"
2 Chronicles,25,20,"But Amaziah was, like, totally stubborn and didn't wanna listen; 'cause it was hella planned by God to let their enemies kick their butts, all 'cause they were obsessed with those Edom gods."
2 Chronicles,25,21,"So Joash, the king of Israel, went up and came face-to-face with Amaziah, the king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which is part of Judah."
2 Chronicles,25,22,"And Judah got wrecked by Israel, and they all ran away to their tents."
2 Chronicles,25,23,"So, Joash, the king of Israel, captured Amaziah, the king of Judah, who happens to be Joash's son and the grandson of Jehoahaz, in Bethshemesh. Then he brought Amaziah to Jerusalem and tore down a part of the city wall, from the Ephraim Gate to the corner gate, which measured about four hundred cubits. (Just to clarify, the corner gate refers to the gate that faces that direction, you know?)"
2 Chronicles,25,24,"So like, he grabbed all the gold, silver, and stuff from the house of God that belonged to Obededom. He even took the treasures from the king's house, the hostages and all. Then he went back to Samaria, you know?"
2 Chronicles,25,25,"So, after Jehoash, the son of Joash, who was the ruler of Judah, passed away, Amaziah carried on as the king for a good fifteen years. Just FYI!"
2 Chronicles,25,26,"Yo, if you wanna know more about what Amaziah did, check out the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. It's got all the deets, from start to finish."
2 Chronicles,25,27,"So, like, after Amaziah decided to ditch following the LORD, a bunch of people in Jerusalem got all sneaky and made a conspiracy against him. So, he freaked out and escaped to Lachish, but those tricky dudes sent people after him and ended up killing him there."
2 Chronicles,25,28,So they took him on horses and laid him to rest with his ancestors in the city of Judah. (FYI: That's the same city where David used to live!)
2 Chronicles,26,1,"So like, all the peeps in Judah were like, 'Yo, Uzziah, you're sixteen now, time to be king in place of your dad Amaziah.' (P.S. Uzziah was also called Azariah, just FYI.)"
2 Chronicles,26,2,He built Eloth and gave it back to Judah after the king passed away.
2 Chronicles,26,3,"Uzziah became king when he was just sixteen, and he ruled over Jerusalem for a cool fifty-two years. His mom, Jecoliah, was also from Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,26,4,"And he totally did what was right in God's eyes, just like his dad Amaziah."
2 Chronicles,26,5,"And he was all about finding God during the time of Zechariah, who totally got what it meant to see the big picture: and as long as he kept up with seeking the LORD, God totally hooked him up with success."
2 Chronicles,26,6,"So he went out and fought against the Philistines, smashing the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. Then he built cities near Ashdod and among the Philistines. (Or you could say, in the land of Ashdod)"
2 Chronicles,26,7,"And God totally had his back when it came to dealing with the Philistines, and even those Arabians who were chilling in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims too. #TeamGod"
2 Chronicles,26,8,"The Ammonites straight up flexed on Uzziah with some sick presents. Like, his rep was so lit that people all the way from Egypt were talking about him, ‘cause he got mad strong. No cap."
2 Chronicles,26,9,"Uzziah went ahead and flexed in Jerusalem by building these sick towers at the corner gate, the valley gate, and at the turning point of the wall, making them super strong. Like, he really repaired and upgraded them, you know?"
2 Chronicles,26,10,"Yo, this dude went all out. He straight up built towers and dug a ton of wells in the desert, because he had mad livestock. Like, he had animals everywhere - in the lowlands, in the plains, even up in the mountains and Carmel. You know why? 'Cause this guy was all about that farming life. He totally loved taking care of the land."
2 Chronicles,26,11,"And Uzziah had a bunch of warriors who went out to war in organized groups, each with their own count written down by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler. They were under the command of Hananiah, one of the king's top captains."
2 Chronicles,26,12,"Bro, there were a total of 2.6K epic dads who were absolute units and super brave."
2 Chronicles,26,13,"And they had, like, a huge army, bro! There were like, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred warriors, totally ready to bring the heat in battle and back up the king against the enemy. It was, like, the ultimate power move, you know? #squadgoals"
2 Chronicles,26,14,"So Uzziah made sure that everyone in his army had cool stuff like shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows, and slings to shoot stones with. Yeah, those sling things. Pretty epic, right?"
2 Chronicles,26,15,"And in Jerusalem, they built machines created by skilled inventors, placed on the towers and fortifications, to shoot arrows and large stones. And their fame spread widely because they were greatly assisted until they became powerful."
2 Chronicles,26,16,"But when he got powerful, he let it get to his head and ended up messing himself up big time. He went against the LORD his God and went into the temple to burn incense on the fancy incense altar."
2 Chronicles,26,17,"Then Azariah, the priest, went in with him, accompanied by eighty devoted priests of the LORD, who were absolute legends:"
2 Chronicles,26,18,"Yo, Uzziah, you can't be burning incense to the LORD, that's the job of the priests who are directly descended from Aaron and authorized to do it. Leave the sanctuary now, you've crossed the line. This won't earn you any brownie points with the LORD God."
2 Chronicles,26,19,"So Uzziah gets really angry and starts waving around a censer to burn some incense. But as he's losing his cool with the priests, boom, he suddenly gets a nasty case of leprosy right on his forehead, right there in front of those priests in the House of the LORD, near the fancy incense altar."
2 Chronicles,26,20,"Then Azariah, the head priest, and all the other priests saw that he had leprosy on his forehead, so they kicked him out of there. He quickly left on his own too, because God had punished him."
2 Chronicles,26,21,"Uzziah, the king, had leprosy until the day he died, and he lived in a separate house because he was banned from the Lord's house. Meanwhile, his son Jotham took charge of the royal household and governed the people of the land."
2 Chronicles,26,22,"So, like, all the other stuff Uzziah did, beginning to end, was written down by Isaiah the prophet, who's like the son of Amoz."
2 Chronicles,26,23,"Uzziah passed away and was laid to rest alongside his ancestors in the royal burial grounds, because he was diagnosed with leprosy. So, his son Jotham took over as the new ruler."
2 Chronicles,27,1,"Jotham was like 25 when he started ruling, and he ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. His mom's name was Jerushah, and his grandpa was Zadok."
2 Chronicles,27,2,"He did the right stuff, just like his dad Uzziah, and stayed away from the LORD's temple. But the people were still being shady."
2 Chronicles,27,3,"He flexed on that house of the LORD by building a super dope gate, and he went all out by building a ton of stuff on the wall of Ophel. (Ophel: also known as the tower, FYI)"
2 Chronicles,27,4,"And he, like, totally constructed some sick cities up in the mountains of Judah, you know? And, like, in the forests, he built these awesome castles and towers. It was all super impressive, dude."
2 Chronicles,27,5,"He totally clashed with the king of the Ammonites and totally schooled them. And the Ammonites were so shook that they handed over a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand measures of barley in that same year. And they kept paying up every year, for three solid years. (By the way, this is straight from the original Hebrew!)"
2 Chronicles,27,6,"Jotham totally blew up on the scene, you know? He was so legit because he had his life totally on point and in line with the LORD his God. Like, he had his priorities straight and was all about that solid foundation, you feel me? #established"
2 Chronicles,27,7,"So basically, all the other stuff that Jotham did - you know, his battles, his whole vibe - it's all written down in this book about the kings of Israel and Judah."
2 Chronicles,27,8,"He was 25 years old when he started ruling, and ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,27,9,"And Jotham passed away, and they laid him to rest in the city of David. Then Ahaz, his son, took over as the new ruler."
2 Chronicles,28,1,"Ahaz was 20 when he became king and ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. But he didn't follow the Lord's ways, unlike his dad David."
2 Chronicles,28,2,He was totally influenced by the lifestyle of the Israelite kings and even went as far as creating emoji-like statues for Baalim.
2 Chronicles,28,3,"Also, he was into that incense vibe, like, in the valley of the son of Hinnom. And get this, he actually sacrificed his own children, like, literally burned them alive! He was copying the messed up stuff the non-believers used to do before God booted them out of Israel"
2 Chronicles,28,4,"He also did sacrifices and burnt incense in all the lit spots, like on top of the hills and under every chill tree."
2 Chronicles,28,5,"So, like, God let the king of Syria capture him because he did bad stuff. The king of Syria and his people totally beat him up and took a bunch of them as prisoners to Damascus. But then, God also let the king of Israel defeat him real bad. Damascus is the place they're talking about, by the way."
2 Chronicles,28,6,"Yo, Pekah, Remaliah's son, straight up took down a badass group of 120k dudes in Judah in just one day, 'cause they ditched the Lord God their ancestors worshipped. These dudes were no joke, all brave AF! #rekt #loyalty"
2 Chronicles,28,7,"So, this guy Zichri, who was like really strong and from Ephraim, totally took down Maaseiah, the son of the king, and Azrikam, the governor of the house, and Elkanah, who was like second in command to the king. (By the way, 'next...: Heb. the second to the king' means he was basically the king's right-hand person!)"
2 Chronicles,28,8,"So like, the Israelites totally captured around 200k of their own peeps – including women, sons, and daughters. Plus, they snagged a bunch of loot and brought it back to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,28,9,"Yo, there was a total prophet of the LORD, named Oded, right there. So, he comes out in front of the whole crew rollin' up to Samaria and straight up tells them like, listen up! The LORD God of your fam was seriously mad at Judah, so He let y'all take 'em out, and you went all crazy and killed 'em like there was no tomorrow."
2 Chronicles,28,10,And now you guys are thinking about enslaving the children of Judah and Jerusalem as your servants? Like seriously? Don't y'all realize that you've already got enough sins against the LORD your God stacked up?
2 Chronicles,28,11,"Listen up fam, it's time to free those prisoners you've been holding from your own clique. The Almighty's anger is totally fierce and directed at you, so peep the message and make it right."
2 Chronicles,28,12,"So, like, these leaders from the peeps of Ephraim, we got Azariah (Johanan's kid), Berechiah (Meshillemoth's kid), Jehizkiah (Shallum's kid), and Amasa (Hadlai's kid). They took a stand against the peeps who came back from the battle. It was intense!"
2 Chronicles,28,13,"And he was like, 'No way, dudes! Don't even think about bringing those captives here. We've already messed up pretty bad with the Lord, and now you want to make it even worse? Our sins are already off the charts, and there's some serious anger brewing against Israel, man."
2 Chronicles,28,14,"So, like, the soldiers dropped off the prisoners and all the cool stuff they took in front of the important people and everyone else."
2 Chronicles,28,15,"Then the guys who were specifically named stepped up, and grabbed the prisoners, and decked out all the ones who were stark naked with some fresh clothes, and styled them up, and hooked them up with kicks, and made sure they got something to eat and drink, and even put some nice oil on them, and carried all the weak ones on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, which is that city with palm trees, to be with their squad. After that, they headed back to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,28,16,"So, basically, King Ahaz was like, 'Yo, Assyrian kings, I need your backup right now.'"
2 Chronicles,28,17,"So, like, once again those Edomites came and totally attacked Judah, and took a bunch of people as prisoners. {captives: BTW, in Hebrew it means they were taken away, just so you know}"
2 Chronicles,28,18,"Yo, the Philistines straight up took over the cities in the low country and south of Judah. They grabbed Bethshemesh, Ajalon, Gederoth, Shocho and all its surrounding villages, plus Timnah and its villages, and even Gimzo along with its villages. They settled in and made it their own, no cap."
2 Chronicles,28,19,"The LORD totally brought Judah down because of Ahaz, the king of Israel. Ahaz made Judah look foolish and straight-up rebelled against the LORD."
2 Chronicles,28,20,"Then this Assyrian king, Tilgathpilneser, came and really messed with him, but didn't actually help him out."
2 Chronicles,28,21,"So Ahaz straight-up swiped some stuff from the house of the LORD, and even snatched some goodies from the house of the king and the princes, and handed it all over to the king of Assyria. But guess what? It didn't help him at all."
2 Chronicles,28,22,"And when things got tough, he kept disobeying the LORD even more: we're talking about King Ahaz, fam."
2 Chronicles,28,23,"So, this guy was making offerings to the gods of Damascus, thinking they would protect him. He believed that since the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, they would also help him if he worships them. But this ended up being the downfall for him and all of Israel. (Just so you know, 'Damascus' means 'Darmesek' in Hebrew)"
2 Chronicles,28,24,"So Ahaz basically took all the holy stuff from God's house, trashed it into pieces, locked up the doors of the Lord's house, and then went around setting up altars everywhere you could find in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,28,25,"He set up places in every city of Judah to burn incense to other gods, which made the LORD God of his ancestors very angry."
2 Chronicles,28,26,"So, like, everything else this dude did and how he rolled, you can peep it all in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel, y'know?"
2 Chronicles,28,27,"So Ahaz died and was buried in Jerusalem, but he wasn't laid to rest in the tombs of the kings of Israel. After that, his son Hezekiah became the new ruler."
2 Chronicles,29,1,"Hezekiah took the throne at the ripe age of 25 and ruled the city of Jerusalem for a cool 29 years. His mom's name was Abijah, daughter of Zechariah."
2 Chronicles,29,2,"And he was, like, totally righteous in the eyes of the LORD, you know? He followed in the footsteps of his dad, David, and did everything just like him."
2 Chronicles,29,3,"In his first year as king, during the first month, he went ahead and opened up the doors to the house of the LORD and fixed them up."
2 Chronicles,29,4,So he rounded up all the priests and Levites and gathered them on the east street.
2 Chronicles,29,5,"Yo, listen up, Levites! It's time to get your act together, purify yourselves, and cleanse the house of the LORD God of your ancestors. Remove all the nasty stuff from this sacred space."
2 Chronicles,29,6,"Yo, our ancestors messed up big time. They straight up did evil stuff that the LORD our God was not cool with. They ditched Him and turned away from where He lives. They basically dissed Him and turned their backs on Him."
2 Chronicles,29,7,"Yo, they totally closed off the entrance, turned off the lights, and straight up neglected to light incense or make any burnt offerings in the sacred area for the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,29,8,"So, God was really mad at Judah and Jerusalem. He dealt them a whole lot of problems, like, serious trouble and even shocked them to the point of being totally amazed. People even made fun of them, like, can you believe it? You can actually see all this happening with your own eyes, no joke. {trouble: in Hebrew means commotion, just FYI}"
2 Chronicles,29,9,"Yo, listen up, our ancestors got wrecked in battle, and now our kids, partners, and the whole squad are stuck in captivity because of it."
2 Chronicles,29,10,"So, like, I really wanna make a deal with the LORD God of Israel, you know? I hope that by doing this, His super intense anger will just cool off and not affect us anymore."
2 Chronicles,29,11,"Yo dudes, don't slack off: 'cause the LORD chose you to be in his presence, to serve him, and do the whole incense thing. {don't be deceived} {offer sacrifice}"
2 Chronicles,29,12,"So, there were these Levites who stepped up: Mahath, who's Amasai's kid, and Joel, who's Azariah's kid. They were from the Kohathites. Then there were Kish, Abdi's offspring, and Azariah, Jehalelel's offspring, from the Merari family. And also, Joah, Zimmah's son, and Eden, Joah's son, who were from the Gershonites."
2 Chronicles,29,13,"And Elizaphan's sons were Shimri and Jeiel, and Asaph's sons were Zechariah and Mattaniah."
2 Chronicles,29,14,"So, these were Heman's kids - Jehiel and Shimei. And from Jeduthun's crew, we got Shemaiah and Uzziel."
2 Chronicles,29,15,"And they gathered all their squad, prepared themselves, and rolled up to the house of the LORD, just like the king had ordered and following the words of the LORD, to purify the holy place. {or, to do some divine business}"
2 Chronicles,29,16,So the priests went inside the super holy part of the LORD's house to clean it up and discovered a bunch of dirty stuff in the temple. They then dragged all that unclean stuff out to the courtyard of the LORD's house. The Levites took it from there and disposed of it in the Kidron Creek.
2 Chronicles,29,17,"So, like, they started getting all holy on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day, they like, finally made it to the entrance of the LORD's place. And, you know, it took them a whole eight days to make the LORD's house all holy and stuff. So, yeah, on the sixteenth day of the first month, they were totally done with the whole sanctifying thing."
2 Chronicles,29,18,"So they went to Hezekiah, the king, and were like, 'Yo, we totally cleaned the entire house of the LORD, including the altar for burnt offerings, all its stuff, and even the table for the showbread and its things.'"
2 Chronicles,29,19,"Yo, we've totally gathered up all those sick items that King Ahaz threw away during his rebellious phase, and we've totally blessed them and set them up right in front of the LORD's altar, you know?"
2 Chronicles,29,20,"So King Hezekiah woke up early, got all the city leaders together, and went to the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,21,"So they came with seven bullocks, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats, as a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. Then he told the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, to offer them on the LORD's altar."
2 Chronicles,29,22,"So they straight up slaughtered the bullocks, and the priests got the blood and legit sprinkled it on the altar. And yo, when they took down the rams, they also sprinkled the blood on the altar. They didn't hold back, man. They went ahead and killed the lambs too, and sprinkled the blood on the altar."
2 Chronicles,29,23,"Then they brought out the male goats for the sin offering right in front of the king and the whole crew, and they placed their hands on them."
2 Chronicles,29,24,"So, the priests went ahead and took care of that, you know? They made things right by sacrificing those animals and sprinkling their blood on the altar. This was like a way to fix things up and make peace with God for all the people of Israel. 'Cause the king, he said it was important to have these burnt offerings and sin offerings for everyone in Israel."
2 Chronicles,29,25,"So like, he put the Levites in the house of the LORD and they were all playing cymbals, psalteries, and harps, just as David, Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet commanded, because that's what the LORD's prophets said he should do. Like, it was totally the LORD's command through his prophets, you know?"
2 Chronicles,29,26,"The Levites were totally rockin' out with David's instruments, and the priests were killin' it on the trumpets."
2 Chronicles,29,27,"So Hezekiah was like, 'Yo, let's offer this burnt offering on the altar.' And when they started doing that, they started playing this awesome song for the Lord with trumpets and instruments that were chosen by David, the king of Israel. It all happened at the same time, you know?"
2 Chronicles,29,28,"And the whole crew totally vibed, with the singers straight up slaying and the trumpeters bringing the hype. This epic jam sesh went on until they were totally done with the burnt offering. (Note: In Hebrew, 'singers' means they were dropping some sick beats.)"
2 Chronicles,29,29,"And after they finished giving their offering, the king and everyone there with him humbled themselves and showed reverence."
2 Chronicles,29,30,"BTW, King Hezekiah and the VIPs told the Levites to flex their singing skills and worship the LORD using David and Asaph's lit lyrics. They sang with mad joy, bowing their heads and gettin' their worship on. 🔥"
2 Chronicles,29,31,"So Hezekiah was like, 'Yo, you guys have totally dedicated yourselves to the LORD. Come closer and bring sacrifices and thankful offerings to the house of the LORD.' And the whole crew brought in sacrifices and thankful offerings, and those who were feelin' it in their hearts brought burnt offerings willingly."
2 Chronicles,29,32,"And the total number of burnt offerings the gang brought was sixty-nine bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs. All of these were offered as a sacrifice to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,33,"Yo, the holy stuff was like 600 cows and 3000 sheep, insane right?!"
2 Chronicles,29,34,"But like, there weren't enough priests to, like, skin all the burnt offerings, you know? So, their fellow Levites totally stepped in and helped them out until the job was done. And it was only after the other priests had purified themselves that the Levites showed how dedicated they were to purifying themselves too. Because, like, the Levites were all about having pure hearts and stuff, even more than the priests."
2 Chronicles,29,35,"Plus, there were heaps of burnt offerings with all that fatty goodness from the peace offerings and drinks to go with every burnt offering. The whole shebang was perfectly organized, just how the house of the LORD liked it."
2 Chronicles,29,36,"And Hezekiah was hyped, and all the people were stoked, because God straight up set up the people: 'cause the whole thing happened outta nowhere."
2 Chronicles,30,1,"So Hezekiah hit up all the peeps in Israel and Judah, and even slid into the DMs of Ephraim and Manasseh, telling them to roll through to the crib of the LORD in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover with the one and only God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,30,2,"So the king, his crew, and everyone in Jerusalem got together and decided to celebrate Passover in the second month."
2 Chronicles,30,3,"So, like, they couldn't do it back then since the priests didn't fully prepare themselves, and the people didn't come together in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,30,4,"And the king and all the fam were totally vibing with it. {vibing...: like, yeah, the king was totally down with that}"
2 Chronicles,30,5,"So they made a rule and spread the word all over Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, telling everyone to come and celebrate the Passover to honor the LORD God of Israel in Jerusalem. It had been a super long time since they had done it the way it was written."
2 Chronicles,30,6,"So like, these posts were totally sent out with letters from the king and his crew all over Israel and Judah, ya know? And like, the king was all like, 'Hey, you children of Israel! It's time to come back to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. If you do, He'll totally look out for the rest of you who survived the kings of Assyria, so you won't be messed with anymore.'"
2 Chronicles,30,7,"Don't be like your parents and siblings who messed up and angered the LORD God of their ancestors. As a result, God let them suffer and you can see the consequences."
2 Chronicles,30,8,"Don't be stubborn like your ancestors, but instead surrender yourselves to the LORD and step into his sacred place, which he has blessed forever. Serve the LORD your God, so that his anger won't come crashing down on you."
2 Chronicles,30,9,"If y'all come back to the LORD, your squad and your fam will get mad love from the ones who are holding them captive. They'll make their way back to this place, 'cause the LORD your God is all about showing grace and mercy, and won't ignore y'all when y'all come back to him."
2 Chronicles,30,10,"So like, the messages went around from city to city, like, going through Ephraim and Manasseh, all the way to Zebulun, but everyone just, you know, laughed at them and made fun of them."
2 Chronicles,30,11,"But, like, there were some cool people from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun who were like, 'Hey, let's take a step back and show some humility.' So they made their way to Jerusalem, you know?"
2 Chronicles,30,12,"In Judah, God totally united everyone and made them all follow the king and the princes, all because of what the LORD said."

2 Chronicles,30,16,"And they did their thing, just like Moses the man of God said: the priests sprayed the blood, which they got from the Levites. (their thing: Hebrew their vibin)"
2 Chronicles,30,17,"There were a bunch of people in the crew who hadn't been purified yet, so the Levites were responsible for slaughtering the passovers for anyone who wasn't clean, to make them holy for the LORD."
2 Chronicles,30,18,"So, like, there were a ton of people - I'm talking Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun - who didn't bother to clean themselves up before having the passover feast. They totally did it differently than what was written. But Hezekiah, he was all about them prayers, man. He asked the good LORD to forgive them all, you know?"
2 Chronicles,30,19,"If someone's heart is set on finding God, the LORD God of their ancestors, even if they haven't gone through all the religious rituals and stuff."

2 Chronicles,30,27,"The priests, aka the Levites, stood up and blessed the people. Their voices were totally heard, and their prayer reached up to God's super sacred crib, aka his holy dwelling place, all the way to heaven. It was like, straight up divine."
2 Chronicles,31,1,"And once they had completed everything, all the people of Israel who were there went out to the towns of Judah and smashed the statues, cut down the trees, and demolished all the fancy places of worship and altars throughout Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh. They didn't stop until everything was completely wiped out. After that, all the Israelites went back to their own towns and reclaimed their own land."
2 Chronicles,31,2,"And Hezekiah made a plan for the priests and the Levites, each assigned to their own duties. The priests and Levites were in charge of the burnt offerings and peace offerings, as well as serving, giving thanks, and praising in the sacred areas of the LORD's dwelling."

2 Chronicles,31,4,"He told the folks living in Jerusalem to share some of their resources with the priests and Levites, so they could stay motivated in following God's commands."

2 Chronicles,31,6,"So, like, the Israelite and Judah peeps who were living in the cities of Judah, they totally brought in their tithes of oxen and sheep, you know? And they also brought in tithes of holy stuff that was dedicated to the LORD their God, and they piled it all up into big heaps. Yeah, like, heaps of heaps, you feel me?"

2 Chronicles,31,8,"When Hezekiah and the squad rolled up and saw the stacks, they gave mad props to the LORD and his homies, the people of Israel."

2 Chronicles,31,10,"And like, Azariah, the main priest from the house of Zadok, totally responded and was like, 'Dude, ever since the peeps started bringing the offerings to the house of the LORD, we've been fully fed and had enough leftovers too, ya know? 'Cause the LORD has totally blessed us, and we've got this massive surplus left.'"
2 Chronicles,31,11,"So Hezekiah was like, 'Yo, we gotta get some rooms ready up in this house of the LORD.' And they went ahead and got those rooms all set up, you know, like storehouses and stuff."
2 Chronicles,31,12,"And they brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the dedicated stuff, like, all 100% faithfully. Cononiah, the epic Levite, was totally in charge of that, and his homie Shimei was his right-hand bro."
2 Chronicles,31,13,"Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were in charge, working under Cononiah and his brother Shimei. They were following the orders of King Hezekiah and Azariah, the leader of God's house."
2 Chronicles,31,14,"Kore, the son of Imnah the Levite, had the important job of being the gatekeeper on the east side. He was in charge of handling all the offerings that people willingly gave to God and distributing them, including the special sacred items."
2 Chronicles,31,15,"And beside them were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, working in the cities of the priests, in their designated positions, to distribute to their fellow brothers and sisters in organized groups, regardless of rank: whether they were important or not so important."
2 Chronicles,31,16,"And they kept track of all the guys who were at least three years old and older, and they were responsible for everything that happened in the house of the LORD. They each had their daily tasks and responsibilities based on their assigned roles."
2 Chronicles,31,17,"So basically, this is a list of all the priests and Levites, tracing back their family lines. The Levites included those who were at least twenty years old and above, and they were responsible for different tasks in their assigned rotations."

2 Chronicles,31,20,"And Hezekiah, like totally, did all these awesome things in the land of Judah. He was all about doing what was upright, righteous, and keeping it real, before his God, the LORD."
2 Chronicles,31,21,"And in every task he did for the house of God, following the law and commandments, seeking his God, he gave it his all and thrived."
2 Chronicles,32,1,"So, like, after all that happened and everything was set up, Sennacherib, this Assyrian king, like totally rolled up in Judah and set up camp near the fortified cities. And get this, he actually thought he could conquer them and make 'em his own, you know? But he was like, 'Nah, I'll just break 'em up.'"
2 Chronicles,32,2,"So, when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had arrived and was planning to attack Jerusalem, he was not messing around and ready to go to war."
2 Chronicles,32,3,"He discussed with his squad and his crew to block the flow of the fountains outside the city, and they totally had his back."
2 Chronicles,32,4,"So, like, a big crowd got together and they totally blocked off all the fountains and the brook that flowed through the middle of the land. They were like, 'Why should those kings from Assyria come and have access to all this water?'"
2 Chronicles,32,5,"Then he flexed his muscles, and fixed all the broken walls like a pro, adding extra towers and an outer wall. He even repaired Millo in the city of David and crafted a ton of darts and shields. #Skillz #GettinItDone"
2 Chronicles,32,6,"And he appointed war leaders to oversee the people, bringing them together at the city gate, where he addressed them with kindness and encouragement, saying, 'Yo, listen up! I'm here to speak straight to your hearts.'"

2 Chronicles,32,8,"He may have his human strength, but we've got the LORD our God on our side, ready to help us and fight our battles. And the people trusted and relied on the words of Hezekiah, the cool king of Judah. 🙌"
2 Chronicles,32,9,"So, like, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, sent his crew to Jerusalem, while he himself was busy attacking Lachish with all his power. They rolled up to Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and all the peeps in Judah hanging out in Jerusalem, and were like, 'Yo, we got dominion over here!"
2 Chronicles,32,10,"Yo, listen up! Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, was like, 'What's up with you guys in Jerusalem, chillin' in the middle of a siege? Like, where's your trust coming from?'"
2 Chronicles,32,11,"Isn't Hezekiah trying to convince you to not surrender to starving and dehydrating? He's saying, 'Don't worry, God's got our back and will save us from the Assyrian king!'"
2 Chronicles,32,12,"Didn't Hezekiah, like, remove all his fancy worship spots and altars and tell everyone in Judah and Jerusalem that they had to worship at just one altar and burn incense there?"
2 Chronicles,32,13,"Yo, don't you know what me and my ancestors did to all the peeps in other countries? Were the gods of those nations even able to save their lands from me?"
2 Chronicles,32,14,"Like, seriously, out of all those gods the other nations worshipped, my ancestors totally wiped them out. So, tell me, is there any chance that your God can save you from me? Doubt it, tbh."
2 Chronicles,32,15,"So, like, don't get duped by Hezekiah or let him convince you otherwise. Don't even think about believing him. 'Cause seriously, no god from any country or kingdom had the power to save their people from me and my ancestors. So, how on earth do you think your God will be able to save you from me?"
2 Chronicles,32,16,And his squad talked mad trash about the LORD God and his homie Hezekiah.
2 Chronicles,32,17,"He sent some mad hate letters, dissing the LORD God of Israel, talking trash about him, saying, 'Yo, like all the gods of those other countries couldn't save their people from me, so the God of Hezekiah won't save his people either, fam.'"
2 Chronicles,32,18,"So, like, they shouted real loud in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, you know, to scare them and like, make them uneasy, so they could, you know, capture the city."
2 Chronicles,32,19,"And they were like so disrespecting the God of Jerusalem, talking trash about Him, and treating Him like just any other man-made god."
2 Chronicles,32,20,"So Hezekiah, the king, and Isaiah, the prophet who's Amoz's son, were like, super desperate and sent their prayers and cries up to heaven."
2 Chronicles,32,21,"Then God sent an angel who defeated all the strong and brave warriors, as well as the leaders and commanders in the king of Assyria's army. So the king returned home feeling humiliated. And when he entered the temple of his god, his own family members attacked and killed him there with a sword."
2 Chronicles,32,22,"So, like, the LORD totally came through for Hezekiah and the peeps in Jerusalem, like, for real, and saved them from that Sennacherib dude, the king of Assyria, and, like, all the other bad guys, and, you know, like, guided them and protected them from all directions."
2 Chronicles,32,23,"And, like, a bunch of people brought gifts to the LORD in Jerusalem, and also gave presents to Hezekiah, the king of Judah. It was a big deal, and he totally gained a ton of respect from all the nations after that. They were like, 'Woah, this dude is legit!'"
2 Chronicles,32,24,"Back in the day, Hezekiah was on his deathbed, feeling really sick, and he reached out to the LORD in prayer. And guess what? The LORD had a chat with him and even threw in a little miracle to prove His power. It was amazing!"
2 Chronicles,32,25,But Hezekiah didn't show gratitude for what was given to him because he got too full of himself: that's why he and Judah and Jerusalem faced some serious consequences.
2 Chronicles,32,26,"But like, Hezekiah totally checked his ego and was all humble, both him and the peeps in Jerusalem, so God wasn't even mad at them during Hezekiah's time. #NoWrath"

2 Chronicles,32,31,"But when the ambassadors from the big shots of Babylon hit him up to get the lowdown on the crazy stuff happening in his land, God dipped out and left him hanging. He wanted to test him and see what was really going on in his heart. #trustissues"
2 Chronicles,32,32,"So, like, all the other cool stuff that Hezekiah did and how awesome he was, you can find it in the vision written by Isaiah the prophet, son of Amoz. It's also in this super legit book about the kings of Judah and Israel. You know, it's all about his mad kindness and stuff. #Impressive"
2 Chronicles,32,33,"And Hezekiah passed away, and they laid him to rest in the fanciest tomb among the descendants of David. All of Judah and the people of Jerusalem paid their respects to him when he died. Then his son Manasseh took over as the new ruler."
2 Chronicles,33,1,"Manasseh was just 12 years old when he started being in charge, and he ruled over Jerusalem for a total of 55 years:"
2 Chronicles,33,2,"But they did stuff that was super messed up according to God, you know, like the gross things other people were doing that God already kicked out before the Israelites."
2 Chronicles,33,3,"Like, he totally rebuilt those fancy religious spots that Hezekiah, his dad, had demolished. And not only that, he went ahead and set up altars for Baalim, made some groves, and straight-up worshipped all the celestials. He was like, serving them and all."
2 Chronicles,33,4,"He also set up some sick altars in the house of the LORD, just like the LORD had said, 'My name is gonna be in Jerusalem forever, no cap'."
2 Chronicles,33,5,"And yo, he straight up constructed altars for all the cool celestial beings in both the courts, like, inside the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,33,6,"And he made his children go through some intense stuff in this creepy valley called the son of Hinnom: he did all these weird rituals, like trying to predict the future, casting spells, dabbling in witchcraft and summoning spirits like he's in some kind of magic show. And let me tell you, all this messed up stuff he did really ticked off the LORD, made Him super angry."
2 Chronicles,33,7,"So, he like put this statue thingy, which he made on his own, in God's crib. That crib was legit special, 'cause God told David and Solomon that He'd be all up in that house, in Jerusalem, and that it's gonna be the spot where His name will always be. No cap, fam."
2 Chronicles,33,8,"I ain't gonna kick Israel out of the land I gave to your ancestors anymore. They better pay attention and do everything I told them through Moses, like following the whole law and all the rules."
2 Chronicles,33,9,"Manasseh totally led the people of Judah and Jerusalem astray, making them do even worse things than the non-believers that God had already wiped out when the Israelites first came in."
2 Chronicles,33,10,"So, like, the LORD had something to say to Manasseh and his crew, but they were like, not even listening, you know?"

2 Chronicles,33,12,"When things got tough, he reached out to the LORD his God, and showed mad respect and humility before the God of his ancestors."
2 Chronicles,33,13,"So he reached out to Him in prayer, and God listened and answered his plea, bringing him back to Jerusalem and restoring him to his rightful place as king. It was at that moment that Manasseh realized that the LORD, He was truly God."
2 Chronicles,33,14,"So, like, later on he constructed this big wall outside the city of David, y'know, on the western side of Gihon in the valley. It stretched all the way to the entrance at the fish gate and surrounded Ophel. He made it super tall and made sure to assign war leaders to all the fortified cities in Judah. (Ophel can also be called the tower, just FYI)"
2 Chronicles,33,15,"Then he got rid of all those funky gods and that ugly statue from the Lord's crib, along with all the altars he built on the holy mountain and in Jerusalem, and yeeted 'em right outta the city."
2 Chronicles,33,16,"So, like, he totally fixed up the LORD's altar and made some chill peace offerings and thanksgiving offerings. And he was all like, 'Yo, Judah, let's serve the LORD God of Israel together, okay?'"
2 Chronicles,33,17,"But the people kept sacrificing in the high places, like, only to the LORD their God."
2 Chronicles,33,18,"So, like, there's more stuff about Manasseh that went down. He had this epic prayer sesh with his God, and the seers were totally dropping wisdom on him in the name of the LORD God of Israel. You gotta check out the deets in the book of the kings of Israel, it's all there!"
2 Chronicles,33,19,"Yo, this dude's prayer game was strong and God totally heard him out. But we gotta talk about his past sins, those high places, groves, and graven images he was messing with before he got humbled. All the deets about that are straight up recorded by the seers, you feel me?"
2 Chronicles,33,20,"And then Manasseh passed away, and they laid him to rest in his own crib. After that, his son Amon took over as the boss."
2 Chronicles,33,21,"Amon was just 22 when he took charge, holding it down for a solid two years in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,33,22,"But, like, he totally did something super not cool in the eyes of the LORD, just like his dad Manasseh. Amon was all about sacrificing to those fancy carved images that his dad made and worshiping them and stuff."
2 Chronicles,33,23,"And he didn't show humility before the LORD like his father Manasseh did; instead, Amon kept doing more and more wrong things. {kept doing more and more wrong things: Heb. multiplied his wrongdoings}"
2 Chronicles,33,24,"And his homies plotted against him, and straight up took him out in his crib."
2 Chronicles,33,25,"But yo, the peeps of the land straight up took out all those who plotted against king Amon, and the homies of the land legit made Josiah, his son, the new king in his place."

2 Chronicles,34,3,"In the eighth year of his reign, when he was still pretty young, he started searching for the God of his dad David. Then, in the twelfth year, he started getting rid of all the worship sites, forests, fancy statues, and metal statues in Judah and Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,34,4,"And they totally destroyed the altars dedicated to false gods that were in front of them. They smashed the statues that were placed up high, knocked down the grove of trees, shattered the carved and melted statues into tiny pieces, and scattered the remains on top of the graves of those who worshiped them. (The statues may have represented the sun.) (The graves were the visible part of the graves.)"
2 Chronicles,34,5,"And he totally roasted those priests' bones on their altars, like fire emoji level burned. He straight up purified Judah and Jerusalem, no cap."
2 Chronicles,34,6,"And he did the same in all the chill cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, and even Naphtali, with their tools in hand. (Tools meaning like, hammers or mauls or whatever)"
2 Chronicles,34,7,"So, like, this dude totally destroyed all the altars and the groves, smashed those graven images into tiny pieces, and totally got rid of all those idols in the whole land of Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem. Schmood, right?!"
2 Chronicles,34,8,"So, like, in the 18th year of his reign, after cleaning up the whole land and the house, he hit up Shaphan (Azaliah's kid), Maaseiah (the city governor), and Joah sonn of Joahaz, the record keeper) to fix up the house of the LORD his God."
2 Chronicles,34,9,"So, when they went to Hilkiah, the top priest, they gave him the cash that had been brought into God's house. The Levites, who were responsible for guarding the doors, had collected it from the hands of Manasseh, Ephraim, and all the other people of Israel, as well as those from Judah and Benjamin. Then, they all returned back to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,34,10,"And they gave it to the workers in charge of the house of the LORD, and they handed it to the workers who were fixing and improving the house of the LORD:"
2 Chronicles,34,11,"They even gave it to the skilled workers and builders, so they could purchase carved stone and wood for construction, and repair the homes that were destroyed by the kings of Judah. (To fix the floors or add rafters, you know!)"
2 Chronicles,34,12,"And the dudes did the work like real champs: Jahath and Obadiah were the bosses, they were from the Levite crew, descendants of Merari. Zechariah and Meshullam, from the Kohathites fam, were in charge of making sure things ran smoothly. And there were other skilled Levites who knew how to jam on musical instruments."
2 Chronicles,34,13,"They were also in charge of managing the logistics and overseeing all the tasks performed in various services. Among the Levites, there were scribes, officers, and porters."
2 Chronicles,34,14,"So, like, when they were checking out the cash that was brought into God's crib, Hilkiah the priest stumbled upon this book of laws from God that Moses gave us. Just passing it on, you know?"
2 Chronicles,34,15,"So Hilkiah was like, hey Shaphan, dude, guess what? I just found the book of the law up in the house of the LORD! And then Hilkiah passed the book over to Shaphan."
2 Chronicles,34,16,"So Shaphan took the book to the king and told him what it said. He said, 'All the things we were supposed to do, we did them.'"
2 Chronicles,34,17,So they rounded up all the cash they found in the LORD's crib and handed it over to the bosses and the workers. {gathered together: a total flex}
2 Chronicles,34,18,"So, like, Shaphan, the scribe, goes up to the king and is like, 'Yo, Hilkiah the priest gave me this sick book, dude.' And then, Shaphan starts reading it in front of the king, you know?"
2 Chronicles,34,19,"So, like, the king was all, listening to the law and stuff, and he got so worked up that he tore his clothes, man."
2 Chronicles,34,20,"So the king was like, yo Hilkiah, Ahikam sonn of Shaphan), Abdon sonn of Micah), Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah (a servant of the king), listen up. And by the way, Abdon could also be called Achbor, just FYI."
2 Chronicles,34,21,"Hey, go hit up the LORD for me and for the peeps who are still in Israel and Judah. We need some answers about the stuff written in that book we found. The LORD is super mad at us 'cause our ancestors didn't follow His word and do all the things it says in this book."
2 Chronicles,34,22,"Hilkiah and the crew that the king handpicked went to talk to Huldah the prophetess. She was married to Shallum, Tikvath's son, who was the son of Hasrah. By the way, Hasrah was in charge of the fashionable clothes. Huldah was living in Jerusalem, chilling in the college. So they had a little chat with her to get some insight. (BTW, Hasrah was also known as Harhas, and the wardrobe was all about those trendy garments. And when we say college, we mean like a school or maybe the second part of somewhere.)"
2 Chronicles,34,23,"And she replied to them, like, listen up y'all, this is straight from the big man upstairs, the LORD God of Israel. So go tell the dude who sent you to me,"
2 Chronicles,34,24,"Yo, listen up! The LORD's got something important to say. Check it: He's about to unleash some serious trouble on this place and everyone who lives here. Like, all the bad stuff that's written down in that book the king of Judah read? Yeah, it's all going down."
2 Chronicles,34,25,"Because they straight up ditched me and started worshipping other gods, thinking it would tick me off with all the stuff they made. So now I'm totally fed up and my anger is gonna go full blast on this spot, and it's gonna be intense, no chance of putting it out."
2 Chronicles,34,26,"Hey, when you talk to the king of Judah who sent you to ask the LORD, here's what you gotta say: 'This is what the LORD God of Israel has to say about the stuff you heard.'"
2 Chronicles,34,27,"Your heart was mad soft, and you totally humbled yourself before God when you heard what He had to say about this place and the people living here. You straight up came to me, tore your clothes, and cried your eyes out. I gotta admit, I heard you loud and clear, says the LORD."
2 Chronicles,34,28,"Yo, listen up! I'm gonna take you to your ancestors, and you'll peacefully rest in your final crib. You won't even have to witness all the bad stuff that's gonna go down here and affect those who stick around. Word got back to the king, just like I told ya!"
2 Chronicles,34,29,So the king hits up all the OGs in Judah and Jerusalem to come over.
2 Chronicles,34,30,"So the king, along with all the dudes from Judah, the peeps from Jerusalem, the priests, the Levites, and basically everyone, whether they're VIP or just a regular person, went into the house of the LORD. And there, he straight up read out loud all the words from the book of the covenant that they found in the house of the LORD. Like, from the boss man to the smallest homie, they all got to hear it."
2 Chronicles,34,31,"The king was like, 'Yo, I'm standin' right here, and I'm makin' a pact with the LORD. I'm gonna straight up follow the LORD, keepin' all His rules, and doin' what He says with my whole heart and soul. I'm gonna do everything that's written in this book, word for word."
2 Chronicles,34,32,"And he made everyone in Jerusalem and Benjamin get in on it. And the peeps in Jerusalem totally kept their word, just like their ancestors did, you know?!"
2 Chronicles,34,33,"Josiah straight up eliminated all the disgusting stuff going on in all the countries where the Israelites were chilling. He made everyone in Israel serve the LORD their God, no doubt about it. And let me tell you, throughout his whole life, they never strayed away from following the LORD, the God of their ancestors. Like, they were totally committed!"
2 Chronicles,35,1,"Anyway, Josiah decided to throw a lit passover party for the LORD in Jerusalem. They straight up slaughtered the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. It was a total vibe!"
2 Chronicles,35,2,"And he assigned the priests their tasks, and gave them mad motivation to serve the house of the LORD,"
2 Chronicles,35,3,"So the Levites were instructed, the ones who were set apart for the LORD, to place the sacred ark in the house that King Solomon, son of David of Israel, had built. This way, they wouldn't have to carry the heavy load on their shoulders. Their task now was to serve the LORD their God and the people of Israel."
2 Chronicles,35,4,"Get ready, fam, by your ancestral homes, just like your dads did in the good old days, following the instructions written by King David of Israel and his son, King Solomon."
2 Chronicles,35,5,"And like, make sure you're all hanging out in the sacred spot, you know, based on your fam's ancestry and all, just like the Levites do. It's all about sticking with your fam and your peeps, ya feel me?"
2 Chronicles,35,6,"Yo, it's time to slay the passover offering, get yourselves ready, and help out your peeps so they can follow the word of the LORD through Moses."
2 Chronicles,35,7,"Yo, Josiah hooked the people up with some lit passover offerings. He gave them mad lambs and goats from his own stash, like a total of 30k, and 3k beefy bulls. It was all from the king's riches, you know?"
2 Chronicles,35,8,"And the leaders generously gave to the people, the priests, and the Levites: Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, who were in charge of the house of God, gave two thousand six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen as offerings for the passover. They gave willingly, offering them with a sincere heart."
2 Chronicles,35,9,"Conaniah, Shemaiah, Nethaneel, Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, who were the leaders of the Levites, gave five thousand cute little farm animals and five hundred big cows as offerings for the Passover feast. (They gave these offerings with sincere hearts.)"
2 Chronicles,35,10,"So like, everything was all set up for the service, and the priests were like in their spots, and the Levites were in their groups, just doing what the king told them to do."
2 Chronicles,35,11,"Then they slaughtered the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites skinned them."
2 Chronicles,35,12,"They took away the burnt offerings to distribute them among the different families, just like it says in the book of Moses. And they did the same thing with the oxen."
2 Chronicles,35,13,"And they totally roasted the passover in fire like it was the ultimate cook-off challenge: but the other holy offerings were cooked up in pots, caldrons, and pans, and quickly shared out among all the people. (divided...: It was split up super fast)"
2 Chronicles,35,14,"And then they got themselves organized, both the regular people and the priests. You see, the priests, who were the sons of Aaron, were super busy offering burnt sacrifices and dealing with the fatty parts of the animals until it was nighttime. So, the Levites took charge and prepared everything not just for themselves, but also for the priests, who were the sons of Aaron."
2 Chronicles,35,15,"And the singers, the cool dudes who have mad vocal skills, like Asaph's sons, were doing their thing, just as David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the king's seer, had commanded. Meanwhile, the gatekeepers were holding it down at each gate, committed to their job; they couldn't dip out because their fellow Levite homies were looking out for them. (Station: Hebrew for 'where they were posted')"
2 Chronicles,35,16,"So, like, everything that needed to be done for the LORD was totally set up in one day. They were getting ready to celebrate the passover and make burnt offerings on the LORD's altar, just like king Josiah ordered. Solid, right?"
2 Chronicles,35,17,"So, like, the Israelites who were there, they celebrated the passover and this thing called the feast of unleavened bread for, like, a whole week. Found = present, just Hebrew lingo, ya know."
2 Chronicles,35,18,"And let me tell you, there had never been a Passover celebration like the one that went down in Israel since the time of Samuel the prophet. Seriously, no king of Israel had ever thrown a Passover like Josiah did, with all the priests, Levites, and everyone from Judah and Israel who showed up, along with the people of Jerusalem. It was lit, fam! (BTW, 'present' means 'found' in Hebrew, just so you know.)"
2 Chronicles,35,19,"So like, in the year when Josiah was ruling for the eighteenth time, they celebrated this big feast called Passover and stuff."
2 Chronicles,35,20,"So, like, once Josiah finished fixing up the temple, this dude Necho, the king of Egypt, he rolls up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates River. And guess what? Josiah ain't afraid, man! He goes out to face him head-on like a boss."
2 Chronicles,35,21,"But he like, sent messengers to him and was like, 'What's my beef with you, yo, the king of Judah? Like, I ain't even attacking you today, but the house that I'm at war with. God told me to hurry up and get this done, so don't mess with Him, 'cause He's on my side and will wreck you. So just back off and don't start no fights with the guy who's got God backing him.'"
2 Chronicles,35,22,"But Josiah wasn't going to back down, even though he tried to hide his identity and wanted to fight against him. He ignored what Necho said, claiming it was from God, and went to battle in the valley of Megiddo."
2 Chronicles,35,23,"So these archers took aim at King Josiah, and he shouted to his peeps: 'Get me outta here, yo! I'm totally hurtin'!' (Translation note: 'hurtin' here means 'sore wounded' in Hebrew)"
2 Chronicles,35,24,So they moved him from his fancy ride to another fancy ride he had. They took him to Jerusalem and that's where he kicked the bucket and got buried in the same place as his ancestors. Everyone in Judah and Jerusalem was totally devastated about Josiah's death.
2 Chronicles,35,25,"Jeremiah was so, so sad about Josiah. Like, seriously, he was devastated. And all the singers, especially the guys and the girls with great voices, they talked about Josiah in their sad songs. This went on for like, forever, and became a tradition in Israel. And guess what? It's all written down in those sad songs, or as we call them, the lamentations."
2 Chronicles,35,26,"So, like, there were other things that Josiah did, and man, he was such a good dude, just like it says in the Lord's law, ya know? It talks about all the acts of kindness he showed, it's pretty rad!"
2 Chronicles,35,27,"Check it out, all the awesome things he did, from start to finish, are totally documented in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah."
2 Chronicles,36,1,"So, like, the locals decided to make Jehoahaz, Josiah's son, the new king of Jerusalem instead of his dad."
2 Chronicles,36,2,"Jehoahaz was just 23 years old when he started being the boss, and he ruled over Jerusalem for, like, three months."
2 Chronicles,36,3,"So, the king of Egypt was like, 'Nah, you're outta here!' and made him leave Jerusalem. Oh, and he also made them pay a crazy amount of money: 100 talents of silver and a talent of gold. Like, majorly condemned the whole land. Can you even imagine?"
2 Chronicles,36,4,"So, the king of Egypt decided to make Eliakim, who was his brother, the king of Judah and Jerusalem. Oh, and he even changed his name to Jehoiakim! Meanwhile, Necho, a total boss, took Jehoahaz, his own brother, and brought him all the way to Egypt. Talk about some serious family drama!"
2 Chronicles,36,5,"So Jehoiakim was, like, 25 years old when he became king and ruled over Jerusalem for 11 years. But, dang, he did a lot of bad stuff that really didn't sit well with the Big Guy upstairs, aka the LORD his God."
2 Chronicles,36,6,"So, like, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, totally showed up and put this guy in chains to take him back to Babylon. (Chains, like, as in handcuffs and stuff.)"
2 Chronicles,36,7,Nebuchadnezzar straight up took some holy stuff from the LORD's crib and put it in his own temple in Babylon.
2 Chronicles,36,8,"Yo, there's more juicy stuff about Jehoiakim, all the messed up stuff he did, and the tea about him can be found in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. After him, his son Jehoiachin took over. PS: Jehoiachin is also known as Jeconiah or Coniah."
2 Chronicles,36,9,"Jehoiachin was only eight when he became king, and he ruled Jerusalem for three months and ten days. But, like, he totally messed up and did some seriously bad stuff that the LORD was not cool with."
2 Chronicles,36,10,"And once the year was up, King Nebuchadnezzar sent for him and brought him to Babylon, along with all the fancy stuff from the house of the LORD. Then he made Zedekiah, his bro, the king of Judah and Jerusalem. Zedekiah's real name was Mattaniah and he was like Nebuchadnezzar's uncle or something."
2 Chronicles,36,11,Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king and ruled over Jerusalem for 11 years.
2 Chronicles,36,12,"And he straight up did some messed up stuff that totally disappointed the LORD his God. Like, he didn't even have the decency to show respect to Jeremiah the prophet when he was speaking God's words."
2 Chronicles,36,13,"And he totally went against King Nebuchadnezzar, who made him swear by God: but he was like, 'Nah, not gonna do it,' and stayed stubborn, refusing to turn back to the LORD God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,36,14,"And like, the high priests and everyone, they totally messed up and did a ton of messed up stuff just like all those non-believers, and they totally disrespected the Lord's holy house in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,36,15,"And the OG God of their fams straight up hit them up with his messengers, like always being on top of it and sending out the messages; 'cause he straight up felt for his peeps and his crib, you feel me?"
2 Chronicles,36,16,"But like, they totally made fun of God's messengers and like, didn't take His words seriously, and straight up disrespected His prophets. And then, boom, the LORD got super mad and was like, 'Enough is enough!' and there was, like, no way to fix things anymore."
2 Chronicles,36,17,"And so, because they messed up big time, God let the king of the Chaldees come and wreck havoc in their holy place. He straight up killed all their young guys with his sword, showing zero mercy to anyone - whether they were dudes or girls, old folks or even the elderly. He basically handed all of them over to the king's control."
2 Chronicles,36,18,"And, like, all the cool stuff from the house of God, from big things to small things, and all the super valuable stuff from the house of the LORD, plus the super fancy stuff from the king and his crew - he took all that and brought it to Babylon."
2 Chronicles,36,19,"And they straight up set the house of God on fire, and completely wrecked the wall of Jerusalem. They burned down all the palaces there, and trashed all the fancy stuff inside."
2 Chronicles,36,20,"And those who survived the sword were taken to Babylon and became servants to him and his sons until the kingdom of Persia took over. (Surprising, right? They were the leftovers from the whole sword thing.)"
2 Chronicles,36,21,"To make sure what the LORD said through Jeremiah came true, until the land had a good break: while it stayed all empty and barren, it took a chill pill and rested, just like, for a whole seventy years."
2 Chronicles,36,22,"So, like, in the beginning of Cyrus's reign as king of Persia, the LORD totally fulfilled what He told Jeremiah. The LORD totally influenced Cyrus, giving him this rad idea to make a huge announcement all over his kingdom, and even write it down, saying,"
2 Chronicles,36,23,"Yo, listen up! This is what Cyrus, the boss of Persia, has to say: The Almighty God of heaven has graced me with all the kingdoms of the earth. He gave me a special mission to build a house for Him in Jerusalem, y'know, in Judah. So, anyone from His chosen peeps out there? May the Lord, his God, be with that person and let 'em go up!"
Ezra,1,1,"So, like, in the beginning of Cyrus' reign as king of Persia, this epic prophecy from the LORD spoken by Jeremiah was totally about to go down. The LORD, like, totally inspired Cyrus and got him hyped up to make this huge announcement all over his kingdom. And then, he didn't just say it, he even wrote it down, like, for everyone to see and stuff. It was wild!"
Ezra,1,2,"Yo, listen up! Cyrus, the king of Persia, got a message from the LORD God up there in heaven. He straight up blessed him with all the kingdoms on earth and gave him this important mission to build a house for Him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Juicy stuff!"
Ezra,1,3,"Yo, anyone from his squad wanna join? If so, may his God be with him and let him head to Jerusalem, yo! It's in Judah, BTW. We gotta build the house of the LORD God of Israel, like, he's legit, you know? And his HQ is in Jerusalem, FYI."
Ezra,1,4,"And if anyone stays in a certain location for a while, the guys around him should totally help him out with cash, bling, cool stuff, and even some animals too, along with a voluntary donation for God's crib in Jerusalem. #LiftHimUp"
Ezra,1,5,"So, the leaders of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and the Levites, and all those who were motivated by God's Spirit, came together to start building the house of the LORD in Jerusalem."
Ezra,1,6,"And all the people who were around them showed their support by giving them silver, gold, valuable items, and even livestock. They gladly offered all these things to help them."
Ezra,1,7,"So like, this dude Cyrus, the king, like took all the stuff from the house of the LORD that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and put it in his own gods' house, you know."
Ezra,1,8,"Cyrus, the king of Persia, brought them all out with the help of Mithredath the treasurer and counted them in front of Sheshbazzar, the ruler of Judah."
Ezra,1,9,"So, like, there were like 30 flashy gold chargers, a freaking 1000 shiny silver chargers, and like 29 super sharp knives, ya know?"
Ezra,1,10,"Like, there were 30 golden bowls, ya know? And, like, 410 silver bowls of a different kind? Plus, like, a thousand other fancy things!"
Ezra,1,11,"Sheshbazzar straight up brought like, 5400 gold and silver things all the way from Babylon to Jerusalem when the people were getting transported out of there."
Ezra,2,1,"So, these are the kids from the province who made it out of captivity, who were taken away by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and brought back to Jerusalem and Judah, each one to their own city."
Ezra,2,2,"These are the people who came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah (also known as Azariah), Reelaiah (also called Raamiah), Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar (or Mispereth), Bigvai, Rehum (or Nehum). The count of the men from the people of Israel."
Ezra,2,3,"The squad of Parosh, straight flexin' with 2.7k peeps."
Ezra,2,4,"The kids of Shephatiah? They were like, 372 in total."

Ezra,2,56,"The squad of Jaalah, the fam of Darkon, the crew of Giddel,"
Ezra,2,57,"The fam of Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth from Zebaim, and Ami aka Amon's squad."
Ezra,2,58,There were a total of 392 Nethinims and children of Solomon's servants.
Ezra,2,59,"So these were the people who came from Telmelah, Telharsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer. But they couldn't prove their family background and whether they were true Israelites. Addan was also known as Addon, and 'seed' refers to their lineage."
Ezra,2,60,"Delaiah had some kids, Tobiah had some kids, Nekoda also had some kids, a grand total of six hundred and fifty-two offspring!"
Ezra,2,61,"And the offspring of the priests included Habaiah, Koz, and Barzillai, who married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and took on their family name."
Ezra,2,62,"These guys were looking for their name on the family tree, but couldn't find it anywhere. So, they got kicked out of the priesthood like a total disgrace."
Ezra,2,63,So the big boss told them not to chow down on the super sacred stuff until a priest stepped up with their special guide.
Ezra,2,64,"There were like, 42,300 peeps in the whole crew, if we're being specific."
Ezra,2,65,"In addition to their squad of helpers, which numbered to a whopping 7,337, they had a legit crew of 200 singers consisting of both dudes and chicks."
Ezra,2,66,"They had, like, 736 horses and 245 mules, ngl."
Ezra,2,67,"They had, like, 435 camels and, like, 6,720 donkeys."
Ezra,2,68,"And then a few of the elders, when they arrived at the house of the LORD in Jerusalem, generously donated towards building the house of God and setting it up in its rightful spot:"
Ezra,2,69,"They flexed their skills and contributed to the treasure of the project with a whopping 61k grams of gold, 5k pounds of silver, and 100 lit priests' outfits."
Ezra,2,70,"So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities."
Ezra,3,1,"So, like, when it was the seventh month and all the Israelites were chillin' in their cities, they all came together as a united squad and headed to Jerusalem, you know?"
Ezra,3,2,"So Jeshua, son of Jozadak, along with his fellow priests, and Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and his crew, got up and built the altar for the God of Israel. They wanted to offer burnt sacrifices there, just like it says in the law of Moses, that cool dude who was close to God. (By the way, Jeshua is also known as Joshua, and Zerubbabel is sometimes called Zorobabel, and Shealtiel goes by Salathiel in Greek.)"
Ezra,3,3,"So they placed the altar on its foundations; they were afraid of the people from those countries. And they made burnt offerings to the LORD on it, both in the morning and in the evening."
Ezra,3,4,"They celebrated the festival of tabernacles, just like it was written, and offered the daily burnt offerings according to the usual custom, as was required every day; following the routine for each specific day."
Ezra,3,5,"And then they did the regular burnt offering, like, every time there was a new moon or a special festival that the LORD said to do. And also, anyone who was super down, they could totally trustingly give an offering out of their own free will to the LORD."
Ezra,3,6,"On the very first day of the seventh month, they started making burnt offerings to the LORD. But they hadn't even laid the foundation for the LORD's temple yet."
Ezra,3,7,"They gave some cash to the builders and the craftsmen, as well as food, drinks, and oil, to those from Zidon and Tyre. All this was to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, just as we got permission from Cyrus, the king of Persia. {carpenters: or, workmen}"
Ezra,3,8,"So, like, it was the second year after they all showed up at the house of God in Jerusalem. It was the second month when Zerubbabel, Shealtiel's son, Jeshua, Jozadak's son, and the rest of their crew - the priests, the Levites, and all those who came back from captivity to Jerusalem - got together. They decided to assign the Levites, who were at least twenty years old, to start working on the house of the LORD."
Ezra,3,9,"So, Jeshua and his fam, including Kadmiel and his fam, the fam of Judah, joined up to lead the workers at God's crib. Plus, the Henadad fam and their squads, the Levites. (P.S. Judah is also called Hodaviah. They all came together as one gang.)"
Ezra,3,10,"So, like, when the builders started putting down the base for the temple of the LORD, they had the priests rocking their lit outfits with trumpets, and the Levites (the sons of Asaph) jamming on their cymbals to show some major love for the LORD, following the rules set by King David of Israel."
Ezra,3,11,"They all sang and vibed together, praising and showing gratitude to the LORD, 'cause He's awesome and His love for Israel lasts forever. And yo, all the people shouted and made a major hype when they praised the LORD, 'cause they just laid down the foundation for His house."
Ezra,3,12,"But a bunch of priests, Levites, and OG dads who had seen the old house being built, witnessed the foundation of this new house and started crying like crazy. Meanwhile, others were straight up shouting with pure happiness!"
Ezra,3,13,"So basically, the people were so hype that you couldn't even tell if they were screaming with happiness or crying. They were straight up shouting like crazy and the sound traveled far and wide."
Ezra,4,1,"So, like, when the haters of Judah and Benjamin found out that the kids who were taken away built the temple for the LORD God of Israel, you know?"
Ezra,4,2,"So they went to Zerubbabel and the head of the parents' group and said to them, 'Hey, let's join forces and help you build! We're also into your God, just like you are, and we've been making sacrifices to Him since the days of Esarhaddon, the king of Assur, who brought us here.'"
Ezra,4,3,"But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other top leaders of Israel were like, 'Yo, you guys can't help us build a house for our God. We got this! We're gonna build it ourselves for the LORD God of Israel, just like King Cyrus of Persia ordered us to.'"
Ezra,4,4,"So basically, the locals started causing trouble for the people of Judah and messed with their building plans."
Ezra,4,5,"So they got advisors to go against them and mess up their plans throughout the entire time Cyrus, the king of Persia, ruled, until Darius, another king of Persia, took over."
Ezra,4,6,"And when Ahasuerus started being in charge, some people sent him a complaint about the peeps living in Judah and Jerusalem. (FYI, Ahasuerus is another word for Ahashverosh)"
Ezra,4,7,"So back in the days of Artaxerxes, there were some guys named Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and their crew. They decided to write a letter to Artaxerxes, the king of Persia. Now, this letter was written in the Syrian language, and then translated into the Syrian language again. Just some interesting tidbits: Bishlam's name means 'in peace' and the word 'companions' could also mean 'societies' in Hebrew."
Ezra,4,8,"So like, Rehum and Shimshai, they were the ones who wrote this letter, right? And they were all against Jerusalem, and they sent it to King Artaxerxes. It went something like this, you know:"
Ezra,4,9,"So Rehum, the chancellor, and Shimshai, the scribe, along with their crew, the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites (Chaldean homies too), all came together and wrote a letter."
Ezra,4,10,"Then there were these other nations that were brought by the cool and awesome Asnappar to live in the cities of Samaria and other places on this side of the river, all happening at a specific time. (Chaldee, Cheeneth)"
Ezra,4,11,"So here's the deal, this is the exact copy of the letter they sent to Artaxerxes, the king. It's from your boys on this side of the river, at a specific time."
Ezra,4,12,"Yo, just so you know, King, those Jews who migrated from your place to ours have arrived in Jerusalem. They're busy constructing that rebellious and not-so-great city, and they've managed to finish building its walls and connecting the foundations."
Ezra,4,13,"Yo, king, listen up. If they rebuild this city and put up the walls, they ain't gonna pay no tolls, taxes, or fees. That means it will hurt the king's money flow. Just saying."
Ezra,4,14,"So, because we're getting support from the palace and it would be totally uncool for us to witness any disrespect towards the king, we decided to send a message to let the king know. You know, we've got that palace vibe in us."
Ezra,4,15,"Like, check the archives of your ancestors, you'll totally find in the ancient records that this city is, like, super rebellious and causes trouble for kings and provinces. They've been stirring up trouble since forever, which is, like, why the city got wrecked. Just saying."
Ezra,4,16,"Yo, just so you know, if they rebuild this city and put up its walls, you won't have any part of it on this side of the river."
Ezra,4,17,"The king hit up Rehum, the big shot, and Shimshai, the writer, and their crew in Samaria, and everyone else across the river with a chill message: Peace, and let's link up soon. 🕊️"
Ezra,4,18,"I just finished reading the letter you sent us, no frills."
Ezra,4,19,"So, like, I ordered an investigation, and they found out that this city has, like, a history of rebelling against kings and causing all sorts of chaos and disruption. It's, like, known for being a total troublemaker, you know?"
Ezra,4,20,"Yo, there were some seriously powerful kings in charge of Jerusalem, and they had control over all the regions across the river. These kings were getting paid mad cash in the form of tolls, tribute, and taxes."
Ezra,4,21,"Yo, tell them to stop right now and not continue building this city until I give them another command. Like, make it a decree and stuff."
Ezra,4,22,"Yo, make sure you don't slack off on this, alright? We don't want things to get messed up and cause trouble for the kings, you feel me?"
Ezra,4,23,"So, like, when Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their crew read the letter from king Artaxerxes, they freaked out and rushed to Jerusalem to stop the Jews forcefully, using their power and all. The whole arm and power thing, you know!"
Ezra,4,24,"The construction of God's crib in Jerusalem stopped. It didn't continue until the second year of Darius, the Persian ruler."
Ezra,5,1,"So, like, the prophets Haggai and Zechariah were all up in the Jews' faces, you know, the ones chilling in Judah and Jerusalem. They were preaching in the name of the God of Israel, giving them some spiritual wisdom and stuff."
Ezra,5,2,"Zerubbabel, Shealtiel's kiddo, and Jeshua, Jozadak's offspring, stepped up and kicked off the construction of God's crib, right here in Jerusalem. And they had the prophets of God by their side, lending a hand."
Ezra,5,3,"So, like, Tatnai, the governor of this area, and Shetharboznai, and their crew showed up, and they were all like, 'Who told you guys to build this crib and put up this wall?'"
Ezra,5,4,"So we were like, yo, who are the dudes responsible for putting up this sick building? Like, what's their squad name? Word is they're Chaldeans, master builders and all that."
Ezra,5,5,"But God was watching over the elders of the Jews, making sure that nobody could stop them until the whole thing went to Darius. And that's when they sent a letter to explain what was going on."
Ezra,5,6,"So there's this letter that Tatnai, the governor dude, and Shetharboznai, and their crew, the Apharsachites, who were all on this side of the river, sent to King Darius:"
Ezra,5,7,"They hit him up with a letter that went like: 'Yo, Darius the king, peace out, my dude.'"
Ezra,5,8,"Yo, just a heads up for the king, we totally made our way to the province of Judea, to the crib of the almighty God. And let me tell you, that place is legit! They got massive stones for the walls and they're even adding some sick timber. The construction is moving mad fast and they're killing it. No doubt, everything's going super well for them."
Ezra,5,9,"So we went to those old heads and straight up asked them, like, who told you to build this crib and put up these walls?"
Ezra,5,10,"We were like, 'Yo, what's your names tho? Just so we can make sure and write down the names of the homies who were leading them."
Ezra,5,11,"And they responded, saying, We're like, totally the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we're working on this super awesome house that was built ages ago by this major king of Israel. It's all legit, fam!"
Ezra,5,12,"Yo, listen up. So, our ancestors seriously ticked off the big man upstairs and He got super pissed. He ended up letting this dude named Nebuchadnezzar, the ruler of Babylon, lay the smackdown on them. And not only did he wreck their crib, but he also straight up kidnapped our people and took them to Babylon."
Ezra,5,13,"So, like, in the first year when Cyrus was ruling Babylon, he was all like, 'Yo, let's build God's crib, fam.'"
Ezra,5,14,"So, like, Nebuchadnezzar straight up took all the fancy gold and silver stuff from God's house in Jerusalem and brought it to Babylon. But then Cyrus, the king, snatched those goodies from the Babylon temple and handed them over to this dude named Sheshbazzar, who he made governor. Pretty impressive, huh?"
Ezra,5,15,"Yo, He's like, 'Yo, grab these things, go and bring them to the temple in Jerusalem, and get the house of God built up in that spot, ya feel?"
Ezra,5,16,"So like, Sheshbazzar showed up and started building the house of God in Jerusalem. And yo, it's been under construction since then, like till now and still not totally done."
Ezra,5,17,"So, like, if the king is cool with it, we should totally check out his treasure stash in Babylon. We need to find out if it's true that King Cyrus made a decree to build God's house in Jerusalem. And then the king can hit us up with his thoughts on this."
Ezra,6,1,"So, King Darius dropped a new rule and they went on a search in the ancient Babylonian library, where all the cool stuff was kept. {rolls: Chaldee, books} {laid up: Chaldee, made to descend}"
Ezra,6,2,"So, like, they found this scroll in Achmetha, you know, that fancy palace in the province of the Medes. And guess what? It had a record written on it, like, really old-school style. Achmetha, by the way, is also known as Ecbatana, or it was in a coffer or something."
Ezra,6,3,"In the lit year of Cyrus the king (yes, that Cyrus), he straight up made a sick proclamation about rebuilding God's crib in Jerusalem. Let's get this house party started - the spot where they used to make sacrifices - and make sure the foundations are legit solid. We're talking sixty cubits high and wide, no cap."
Ezra,6,4,"We need three sick rows of big flexin' stones, and one row of fresh timber. And yo, make sure the king's crib covers the expenses, you feel me?"
Ezra,6,5,"Oh, and don't forget to give back those cool gold and silver stuff from God's crib that Nebuchadnezzar swiped and brought over to Babylon. Take 'em back to the temple in Jerusalem and put each item back where it belongs, back in God's house. Got it?"
Ezra,6,6,"So, like, Tatnai and Shetharboznai, you and your crew of Apharsachites, who are like, on the other side of the river, peeps, you better back off real quick. Don't even think about coming near that place, 'cause it's off-limits, ya feel me? And I'm not just talking about on a physical level, but also on a spiritual level, bro. So, yeah, keep your distance, my dudes. Oh, and by the way, I'm speaking this message in the language of Chaldee, just so you know what's up with their culture and stuff, ya know?"
Ezra,6,7,"Yo, chill with messing with this crib of God. Let the boss of the Jews and the OGs of the Jews do their thing and build this holy pad for God in peace."
Ezra,6,8,"Yo, listen up! I've got an important announcement regarding the OG Jews and their project of building God's crib. Check it: I decree that these homies should be provided with cash money from the king's stash, specifically from the taxes collected across the river. No delays allowed, we need to support their hustle and make sure nothing gets in their way. Like, no obstacles, man. This decree is legit, signed by yours truly."
Ezra,6,9,"And they should provide whatever is necessary - like, young bullocks, rams, and lambs - for the sweet offerings to the God of the heavens. Also, don't forget to give them wheat, salt, wine, and oil, just as the priests in Jerusalem have instructed. It's gotta be given to them daily, no exceptions!"
Ezra,6,10,"So they can make some lit offerings to the Heavenly God, and also pray for the king's life and his fam. {of sweet...: Chaldee, of rest}"
Ezra,6,11,"I've made a rule, okay? If anyone even thinks about changing this word, their house will be torn down and they'll be hung on the timber. And to top it off, their house will become a disgusting mess."
Ezra,6,12,"And the God who has picked this place as His home will destroy any kings or people who try to mess with or ruin this awesome house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, am making it official - get it done ASAP!"
Ezra,6,13,"So, like, Tatnai, the governor dude, and Shetharboznai, and their crew, they followed what King Darius had ordered and got things done fast!"
Ezra,6,14,"So, the wise OGs of the Jews came together, and with the lit words of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, they went all in and built. They hustled hard and completed the project, just like the God of Israel and Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, the kings of Persia commanded them. It was a big deal, like a solid decree."
Ezra,6,15,"And this crib got done like, bam, on the third day of the month Adar, smack in the middle of Darius the king's sixth year on the throne."
Ezra,6,16,"So, like, the Israelites, the priests, the Levites, and the other peeps who were brought here as captives, they totally celebrated the dedication of God's house with heaps of joy, ya know?"
Ezra,6,17,"And they went all out with the housewarming party at this lit crib of God. They brought a hundred beefy bullocks, two hundred fierce rams, and four hundred fluffy lambs. Plus, to make things right for the whole squad of Israel, they threw in twelve badass he-goats, one for each tribe. Talk about turning up!"
Ezra,6,18,"So they organized the priests into their groups, and the Levites into their squads, to do the work of God in Jerusalem, just as it was written in the book of Moses."
Ezra,6,19,And the kids who were taken away celebrated Passover on the 14th day of the first month.
Ezra,6,20,"The priests and Levites were totally clean after the purification process. They came together and slaughtered the passover animal for all the children held captive, their fellow priests, and themselves."
Ezra,6,21,"The Israelite squad, who bounced back from captivity, and all those who had chosen to distance themselves from the nasty habits of the foreign peeps in the land, all gathered to feast in honor of the one and only LORD God of Israel."
Ezra,6,22,"And they had this lit celebration called 'Unleavened Bread Week' where they partied for a whole week. It was so fire because God had blessed them with happiness and even made the king of Assyria support them and help them with their work in building the house of God, who's the real deal for Israel."
Ezra,7,1,"So, like, this all happened during the time when Artaxerxes was, like, the boss king of Persia. And Ezra, he was the son of Seraiah, who was the son of Azariah, who was the son of Hilkiah. Pretty cool, right?"
Ezra,7,2,"Shallum's kid, Zadok's kid, Ahitub's kid,"
Ezra,7,3,"So like, Amariah's kid, Azariah's kid, and Meraioth's kid,"
Ezra,7,4,"Zerahiah's kid, Uzzi's grandson, Bukki's great-grandson,"
Ezra,7,5,"Abishua's kid, Phinehas' grandkid, Eleazar's great-grandkid, Aaron's OG high priest:"
Ezra,7,6,"So, this dude named Ezra left Babylon and he was super skilled at writing down and understanding all the laws that Moses gave us. The LORD God of Israel was the one who gave those laws, by the way. And get this, the king totally approved of Ezra and gave him everything he asked for! That's because the LORD his God had his back big time!"
Ezra,7,7,"So, like, this group of peeps from Israel, along with the priests, Levites, singers, porters, and Nethinims, they all headed to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes."
Ezra,7,8,"And he rolled up in Jerusalem on the fifth month, around the seventh year of the king."
Ezra,7,9,"So on the first day of the first month, he started his journey from Babylon and arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month. This was all because his God was watching over him and making things happen. (The first day of the first month marked the beginning of his journey, just so you know.)"
Ezra,7,10,"Ezra was totally ready to search for God's law, live it out, and educate peeps in Israel about the rules and decisions."
Ezra,7,11,"So, like, here's the letter King Artaxerxes sent to Ezra, the priest and super smart scribe who wrote down all the important stuff God said and the rules He gave to Israel."
Ezra,7,12,"Yo, Artaxerxes, the ultimate ruler, hollerin' at Ezra the priest, a dope writer who knows all about the laws of the God up above, hope you're chillin' in complete peace. And this is goin' down at the perfect timing."
Ezra,7,13,"Yo, listen up! I'm putting it out there that any Israelites, priests, or Levites in my kingdom who are feeling it in their hearts to head over to Jerusalem can roll with you, no questions asked."
Ezra,7,14,"Since you've been assigned by the king and his council of seven to investigate Judah and Jerusalem, according to the laws of your God that you have in your possession; as per the king's requirement."
Ezra,7,15,"And to transport the sick bling, made of silver and gold, that the king and his squad generously donated to the big man upstairs, the God of Israel, who's kicking it in Jerusalem,"
Ezra,7,16,"And yo, grab all the sick silver and gold you can find in the whole province of Babylon, plus the generous offerings from the people and the priests who are down to contribute, all willingly, for the crib of their God in Jerusalem:"
Ezra,7,17,"So you can flex real quick with all this cash and cop some dope bullocks, rams, and lambs, along with their fire food and drinks. Then you can go ahead and sacrifice them on the altar at your God's crib in Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,18,"So, like, whatever you and your squad think is cool to do with the rest of the cash money, just make sure it aligns with what your higher power wants, ya know?"
Ezra,7,19,"Don't forget to bring all those cool stuff that are meant for serving in God's crib, and hand 'em over to the big man upstairs in Jerusalem!"
Ezra,7,20,"And whatever else you need to provide for the house of your God, feel free to use the king's treasure house for that."
Ezra,7,21,"Yo, it's ya boy Artaxerxes the king, and I'm here to drop a mad decree for all the treasurers out there, y'know? Basically, my main man Ezra, the priest and scribe of the divine law from the big man upstairs, he's got some requests for y'all. And let me tell ya, whatever he needs, y'all better make it happen ASAP, no questions asked!"
Ezra,7,22,"I'll hook you up with a sick amount of cash, like a hundred stacks of silver. And not just that, I got you covered with a hundred loads of wheat, a hundred barrels of wine, a hundred barrels of oil, and unlimited salt, no cap. (measures: Chaldee, cors)"
Ezra,7,23,"Yo, whatever the God of heaven commands, make sure you do it with mad dedication for the house of the God of heaven. Like, we don't want any wrath coming down on the king and his sons, you feel?"
Ezra,7,24,"Yo, listen up! We gotta let you know that when it comes to the priests, Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, and all those who serve in God's house, it's totally illegal to make them pay any taxes, fees, or customs, okay?"
Ezra,7,25,"Yo, Ezra, use your God-given wisdom to appoint leaders and judges who can uphold the laws of God. Their job is to judge all the people who live on the other side of the river, specifically those who already know God's laws. And, don't forget to teach those who don't know 'em yet."
Ezra,7,26,"So, anyone who refuses to follow the laws of your God and the laws of the king better face the consequences real quick. They could end up facing death, getting banished, losing all their stuff, or even getting thrown in jail. (Just so you know, 'to banishment' in Chaldee means getting completely uprooted.)"
Ezra,7,27,"Praise the LORD God of our dads, who has inspired the king to make the house of the LORD in Jerusalem even cooler!"
Ezra,7,28,"And God showed me kindness in front of the king, his advisors, and all the powerful people in the kingdom. I felt empowered because I knew that the Lord my God was with me, and I gathered important leaders from Israel to go with me."
Ezra,8,1,These are the top fam leaders and here's the family tree of the squad that rolled with me from Babylon when Artaxerxes was king.
Ezra,8,2,"Phinehas had a son named Gershom, Ithamar had a son named Daniel, and David had a son named Hattush."
Ezra,8,3,"Among the dudes from Shechaniah's crew, from the Pharosh squad, there was this dude named Zechariah. He was listed as one of the OGs in the family tree, with a total count of 150 of his homies."
Ezra,8,4,"Among the guys from Pahathmoab were Elihoenai, son of Zerahiah, and he rolled in with a squad of 200 homies."
Ezra,8,5,"Among Shechaniah's crew, there was Jahaziel's homie leading a squad of 300 bros."
Ezra,8,6,"Among Adin's kids, there was Ebed, Jonathan's son. He rolled deep with a team of fifty other dudes."
Ezra,8,7,"And among the dudes from Elam were Jeshaiah, the son of Athaliah, and he had like 70 homies with him."
Ezra,8,8,"And among the sons of Shephatiah was Zebadiah, who was bro of Michael, and they rolled deep with eighty dudes."
Ezra,8,9,"Among Joab's crew were Obadiah, Jehiel's son, rolling with a squad of 218 dudes."
Ezra,8,10,"And among the dudes from team Shelomith were Josiphiah, a legendary bro, who rolled with a squad of a hundred and sixty other dudes."
Ezra,8,11,"And among the dudes of Bebai, there was Zechariah, Bebai's own son. Plus, he had 28 homies rollin' with him."
Ezra,8,12,"And from the squad of Azgad, there was Johanan, a total bro, who brought along 110 dudes. (BTW, he was the youngest in the squad!)"
Ezra,8,13,"And the last boys of Adonikam, their names are Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and they bring along sixty dudes with them. 🙌"
Ezra,8,14,"Among the dudes from the Bigvai crew were Uthai, Zabbud, and a squad of seventy homies. (Or maybe Zabbud's name was actually Zaccur, according to some peeps.)"
Ezra,8,15,"So, like, I gathered everyone near this cool river, you know, the one that flows towards Ahava? Anyway, we set up our tents and stayed there for like three days. As I looked around, I noticed that none of the dudes from the Levi tribe were there. It was kinda weird, you know? 😅"
Ezra,8,16,"So I hit up Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam - all the top dogs. I also reached out to Joiarib and Elnathan, who are pretty wise, you know."
Ezra,8,17,"So, like, I gave them some instructions, you know? I was all like, 'Go find this Iddo guy in Casiphia, he's in charge and stuff.' And I told them what to say to him and his Nethinim buddies, also in Casiphia. I was like, 'We need some peeps to help out in our temple, so bring us some ministers, ya know?'"
Ezra,8,18,"And thanks to God, they introduced us to a really wise dude from the Mahli crew, who was from the Levi fam, which is part of the Israel fam. Sherebiah and his squad, including his sons and bros, were also there, making it a total of eighteen people."
Ezra,8,19,"And Hashabiah, and his bro Jeshaiah from Merari's fam, along with their fam and kids, were a total of twenty;"
Ezra,8,20,"In addition to that, there were 220 Nethinims who were selected by David and the leaders to assist the Levites. Each and every one of them was specifically named and recognized for their role."
Ezra,8,21,"So I was like, let's have a fasting sesh by the Ahava river, so we could humble ourselves before God and ask Him for guidance in finding the right path for us, our squad and everything we own."
Ezra,8,22,"I didn't want to ask the king for backup of soldiers and horsemen to fight off the enemy. We had told the king that God's got our backs if we seek Him, but He'll come down hard on anyone who abandons Him."
Ezra,8,23,"So, like, we were totally fasting and earnestly praying to our awesome God for this, and yo, He totally answered our prayers!"
Ezra,8,24,"So, I picked twelve top priests - Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their buddies - and I set them apart for a special mission."
Ezra,8,25,"Then they checked out the cash, bling, and stuff that the peeps, including the king, his crew, and all of Israel, brought as an offering to God's crib."
Ezra,8,26,"I gave them about 650 talents of silver and 100 talents of silver vessels, and also 100 talents of gold."
Ezra,8,27,"I got twenty gold basons, each worth a thousand drams, and two super cool vessels made of fancy copper that's as precious as gold. (BTW, the copper is like shiny brass, and it's totally desirable!)"
Ezra,8,28,"And I was like, yo, you guys are totally set apart for the Lord, y'know? Like, you're sacred, just like the cool utensils, and even the shiny silver and gold are like, gifts that you willingly give to the Lord, the God of your ancestors, bro."
Ezra,8,29,"Yo, stay woke and guard those things until you take them to the big shots like the high priests, Levites, and top dogs of Israel, in Jerusalem, at the sick crib of the Lord's crib."
Ezra,8,30,"So, like, the priests and the Levites, they took all the silver, gold, and cool stuff, and they brought it all to Jerusalem, to the house of our awesome God!"
Ezra,8,31,"So, like, we left the Ahava River on the twelfth of the first month to head to Jerusalem. And, bro, the power of our God was totally with us, and He saved us from our enemies and anyone trying to ambush us on the way."
Ezra,8,32,"So, we rolled up in Jerusalem and stayed there for, like, three days."
Ezra,8,33,"So, like, on day four, they were weighing all the silver, gold, and fancy stuff in God's house. Meremoth, son of Uriah the priest, was in charge of it, with Eleazar, son of Phinehas, and Jozabad, son of Jeshua, and Noadiah, son of Binnui, who were all Levites and helping out."
Ezra,8,34,"It was all counted and weighed, and every weight was recorded back then."
Ezra,8,35,"The kids of the ones who were once taken away and came back from being stuck, they made some lit sacrifices to the God of Israel. It was a total flex - twelve big bullocks, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve he goats just for forgiveness vibes. All of that was offered up in flames to the LORD."
Ezra,8,36,So they sent the king's orders to the king's squad leaders and the bosses on this side of the river. And they helped out the people and the house of God.
Ezra,9,1,"So, once everything was done, the big shots came to me and said, 'Yo, the Israelites, the priests, and the Levites haven't been keeping their distance from the people of these foreign lands. They out here doing all the messed up stuff those Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites do.'"
Ezra,9,2,"They've started dating and marrying people from other lands, even though they were supposed to keep their community pure. The leaders and influential ones were the ones leading this whole mess."
Ezra,9,3,"Bro, when I heard this news, I straight up tore my clothes, yanked out my hair, and sat there in complete shock."
Ezra,9,4,"So, like, everyone who was totally in awe of what the God of Israel said, showed up to see me. It was all because of those who messed up big time and got taken away. I was just sitting there, mind blown, until it was time for the evening sacrifice."
Ezra,9,5,"After the evening prayer, I got up from being downhearted. I tore my clothes and fell to my knees, stretching out my hands to the LORD my God."
Ezra,9,6,"And I'm like, OMG, I'm totally embarrassed and turning red right now to even look at you, God. Seriously, our wrongdoing has reached maximum levels, like it's way above our heads, and our guiltiness is like, sky-high. It's gotten out of control, you know?"
Ezra,9,7,"Ever since our ancestors, we've been messing up big time, and we're still doing it today. Because of all the wrongs we've done, our leaders and religious folks have been handed over to the kings of other countries. They've been facing violence, captivity, plunder, and humiliation, just like what's happening right now."
Ezra,9,8,"So, like, God has totally blessed us with some grace, you know? He's given us a chance to survive and left a small group as a way out. Plus, He's setting up a solid foundation for us in His holy spot, just like a nail or pin, ya know? That way, our God can brighten our spirits and bring us some much-needed hope while we're going through tough times. Oh, and that 'moment' thing means just a really short time, by the way!"
Ezra,9,9,"So, we were like totally slaves, but our God didn't ditch us when we were stuck in that crappy situation. Instead, He showed us mad love and favor in front of those Persian big shots. He gave us a sweet comeback by helping us rebuild our temple, fix all the messed-up parts, and even gave us some solid protection in Judah and Jerusalem. It was lit, fam!"
Ezra,9,10,"Yo, God, what do we even say right now? Like, we totally ditched your commandments and stuff."
Ezra,9,11,"So, like, God told His prophets to say that the land you're about to take over is, like, really dirty and messed up because the people living there have all these disgusting and sinful things going on. It's like they've spread their impurity and wickedness all over the place."
Ezra,9,12,"So, like, don't let your girls date their boys, and don't let their girls date your boys, and don't try to be all friendly with them or get in on their money forever. That way you can be legit strong, enjoy the blessings of this land, and pass it down as an inheritance to your kids - for real, forever."
Ezra,9,13,"And after all the stuff that we totally brought upon ourselves because of our messed up deeds, and our major mistakes, like seriously, God you punished us way less than we actually deserved and gave us this super awesome way out; like for real, you held back even when we totally did wrong."
Ezra,9,14,"Yo, should we seriously overstep your rules again and start mixing it up with these wicked folks? Like, wouldn't you totally lose your cool with us until we're wiped out completely, so there's no one left behind?"
Ezra,9,15,"Yo, like, God of Israel, you're totally righteous. 'Cause, you know, we've managed to survive up 'til now, here in your presence even though we've messed up big time. And, like, we can't even stand before you 'cause of all our mistakes."
Ezra,10,1,"So, like, when Ezra finished praying and, you know, poured out his heart and stuff, crying and literally throwing himself down in front of the house of God, a huge crowd of men, women, and even kids gathered around him from Israel. Everyone was bawling their eyes out, it was intense. #EmotionalVibes"
Ezra,10,2,"So Shechaniah, Jehiel's son, one of the Elamites, spoke up and said to Ezra, dude, we messed up big time. We've been marrying these foreign chicks from the land, totally not cool. But yo, there's still hope for us in Israel if we handle this right."
Ezra,10,3,"So let's make a deal with God to break up with all the wives and their kids, just like my boss said and those who are super careful about following God's commandments. And let's do it all legally and by the book."
Ezra,10,4,"Yo, listen up; this situation is on your plate. We got your back too, so don't stress. Stay confident and handle it."
Ezra,10,5,"So Ezra stood up and gathered the head priests, the Levites, and all of Israel together, making them promise to follow this command. And they totally swore to it!"
Ezra,10,6,"So Ezra left the house of God and went to Johanan's room, the son of Eliashib. And when he got there, he didn't eat any food or drink water because he was sad about the wrong actions of those who were taken away."
Ezra,10,7,So they went around Judah and Jerusalem telling all the kids who were in exile to come join the party in Jerusalem.
Ezra,10,8,"And anyone who didn't show up within three days, as the cool peeps in charge advised, would have to give up all their stuff, and get kicked out of the crew. Oh, and their stuff would be considered like, super duper sacred."
Ezra,10,9,"So, like, all the dudes from Judah and Benjamin straight up came together in Jerusalem within three days. It was, like, the ninth month, on the twentieth day and everyone was chilling in the street outside God's crib, totally shook by what was happening and also because it was raining like crazy. Seriously, it was pouring!"
Ezra,10,10,"So, like, Ezra the priest totally called them out. He was all like, 'Guys, you know you messed up big time, right? You went and married these foreign ladies, which like, totally added fuel to the fire of Israel's wrongdoing.' But, you know, just to clarify, 'have taken' can also mean 'caused to dwell' or 'brought back' in Hebrew."
Ezra,10,11,"So like, it's time to come clean and admit your wrongs to the Lord God of your ancestors. You gotta do what pleases Him and distance yourselves from the people in the land and those spouses who aren't part of your tribe."
Ezra,10,12,"And like, everyone in the group was like, 'Yeah, totally!' and said in a super loud voice, 'We're all down for that, just as you said! We're totally gonna rock it!'"
Ezra,10,13,"But yo, there's a mad crowd here and it's raining like crazy. We can't just chill outside all day, this ain't no quick task. There's a bunch of us who messed up big time in this situation."
Ezra,10,14,"Yo, it's time for all the leaders of the crew to step up. And all y'all who went and married some foreigners in our cities, it's time to come together at specific times. Bring the OGs from every city and even the judges. We gotta do this until our God's anger about this situation calms down. #priorities"
Ezra,10,15,"Just Jonathan, Asahel's son, and Jahaziah, Tikvah's son, were the ones who took care of this task. Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite were there to provide support. They all stood together in unity and worked together to get things done."
Ezra,10,16,"So the kids who were in captivity, like, totally obeyed. And Ezra the priest, along with some important dudes from the fam, you know, tracing their ancestry and all, they all got together and sat down on the first day of the tenth month to, like, investigate the situation."
Ezra,10,17,And they were done dealing with all the dudes who had hooked up with non-Holy boo thangs by the start of the first month.
Ezra,10,18,"So, like, there were some priests' sons who, um, had, like, married these foreign women, you know? Specifically, it was like, Jeshua's son, Jozadak's son, and his dudes: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah."
Ezra,10,19,"And they made a promise to break up with their wives, and feeling guilty, they offered a ram from their squad as a way to make up for their mistake."
Ezra,10,20,"And from the boys of Immer, there were Hanani and Zebadiah."
Ezra,10,21,"The sons of Harim were Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah."
Ezra,10,22,"And these were the dudes from the Pashur fam: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah."
Ezra,10,23,"And there were also some cool Levites in the gang: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (he's also known as Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer."
Ezra,10,24,"Amongst the singers, we had Eliashib, the talented one, and as for the porters, we had Shallum, Telem, and Uri, holding it down."
Ezra,10,25,"And also in Israel there were these cool dudes from the tribe of Parosh: Ramiah, Jeziah, Malchiah, Miamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah."
Ezra,10,26,"Here are the names of Elam's sons: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Eliah."
Ezra,10,27,"Here are the cool dudes from the Zattu squad: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza."
Ezra,10,28,"And Bebai had some kids too, like Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai."
Ezra,10,29,"So, like, some of Bani's sons were Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Ramoth."
Ezra,10,30,"And the squad of Pahathmoab had the homies Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, Binnui, and Manasseh."
Ezra,10,31,"And the sons of Harim were like Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,"
Ezra,10,32,"Yo, it's Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah in the house!"
Ezra,10,33,"These are the names of Hashum's sons: Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei."
Ezra,10,34,"In Bani's squad we had Maadai, Amram, and Uel,"
Ezra,10,35,"Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,"
Ezra,10,36,"Okay, so we've got Vaniah, Meremoth, and Eliashib,"
Ezra,10,37,"Yo, Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau,"
Ezra,10,38,"And Bani, and Binnui, and Shimei,"
Ezra,10,39,"And like, Shelemiah, Nathan, and Adaiah,"
Ezra,10,40,"Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, or maybe Mabnadebai (as some copies say)"
Ezra,10,41,"Azareel, Shelemiah, and Shemariah,"
Ezra,10,42,"Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph, fam."
Ezra,10,43,"Among Nebo's sons, we got Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, Joel, and Benaiah."
Ezra,10,44,"So, like, all these dudes went ahead and married these, like, foreign women. And, you know, some of them even had kids with these wives, man."
Nehemiah,1,1,"So like, Nehemiah, who's Hachaliah's kid, was, like, hanging out in Shushan the palace during the month of Chisleu in his twentieth year or whatever."
Nehemiah,1,2,"So this dude Hanani, who's like my bro, showed up with some homies from Judah. And I was all like, yo Hanani, tell me what's up with those Jews who made it out and are still kickin' after being in captivity. Oh, and what's the deal with Jerusalem?"
Nehemiah,1,3,"So basically, these guys came up to me and were like, 'Dude, there's only a few people left from our capture in this place, and they're all going through some serious tough times. The city of Jerusalem is a total wreck, the walls are demolished, and the gates got burned down to ashes.'"
Nehemiah,1,4,"So, like, when I heard this stuff, I just couldn't handle it and had to sit down and let it all out. I was all tears and grieving for a few days, and I even went on a fast and prayed hard to the God up in heaven."
Nehemiah,1,5,"And like, I'm like, totally begging you, God of heaven, the epic and awe-inspiring God, who always keeps His promises and shows mercy to those who love Him and follow His commandments:"
Nehemiah,1,6,"Yo, God, listen up! Open up those eyes and ears of yours so you can hear my prayer. I've been praying for the children of Israel, your loyal peeps, day and night. And now, I wanna confess the sins of the children of Israel, including me and my fam. Yeah, we messed up too."
Nehemiah,1,7,"We've like, totally messed up big time against you, and we didn't follow any of the rules and stuff that you, like, told your servant Moses to follow."
Nehemiah,1,8,"Yo, listen up. Don't forget what you told Moses, man. You were like, 'If you mess up, I'm gonna scatter you all over the place, among different nations.'"
Nehemiah,1,9,"But if you're down to come back to me, follow my rules, and actually do them; even if some of you get kicked out to the farthest corners of the universe, I'll still bring you back and settle you in the spot where I want my name to be."
Nehemiah,1,10,"These are your squad and your peeps, that you've totally come through for with your awesome power and insane strength."
Nehemiah,1,11,"Hey God, listen up! I humbly ask that you give your full attention to the prayer of your servant and all those who want to honor your name. Please bless me today and show me favor in front of this person. Just so you know, I used to be the king's cupbearer."
Nehemiah,2,1,"So, like, in the month Nisan, when Artaxerxes the king was in his twentieth year, he had a glass of wine in front of him. And I was there, and I grabbed the wine and gave it to the king. It's important to note that I wasn't feeling down or anything in his presence before this moment."
Nehemiah,2,2,"So the king asked me, like, 'Why do you look so down? You're not even sick or anything.' But it's just that my heart is filled with sorrow, you know? And man, I got super scared when that happened."
Nehemiah,2,3,"So I told the king, like, may the king live forever, you know? But why shouldn't I be bummed out when the city where my ancestors are buried is all ruined and the gates are burnt to a crisp?"
Nehemiah,2,4,"Then the king was like, 'Yo, what's your wish?' And I was all like, 'Imma pray to the man upstairs, God.'"
Nehemiah,2,5,"So I was like, yo king, if it's cool with you and if I've scored some brownie points with you, could you, like, send me to Judah? You know, to my ancestors' graveyard, so I can fix it up."
Nehemiah,2,6,"The king, with his wife by his side, asked me, 'How long will your trip take, and when will you come back?' The king was happy to send me, and I gave him a specific timeframe."
Nehemiah,2,7,"Also, I told the king like, hey if it's cool with you, can you give me some letters to the governors on the other side of the river so they can hook me up with a ride to Judah?"
Nehemiah,2,8,"So, I sent a message to Asaph, the one in charge of the king's forest, asking for some wood to build beams for the palace gates, the city wall, and the house I will be living in. And guess what? The king totally approved it, all because my God had my back!"
Nehemiah,2,9,"So, I jetted over to the governors on the other side of the river and hooked them up with the king's letters. The king, being the boss that he is, had sent some top-notch army captains and horsemen to roll with me."
Nehemiah,2,10,"When Sanballat, the dude from Horon, and Tobiah, the servant guy from Ammon, heard about it, they were hella bummed out that someone actually showed up to look after the well-being of the Israelite peeps."
Nehemiah,2,11,"So, like, I went to Jerusalem and, you know, hung out there for three days."
Nehemiah,2,12,"So, like, in the middle of the night, me and a few of my squad decided to bounce. I didn't spill the tea to anyone about what my God had laid on my heart to do in Jerusalem. And, just FYI, I only had my ride-or-die beast by my side, no other animals or anything."
Nehemiah,2,13,"So, I snuck out at night, through the cool gate of the valley, near where the dragon well is, to check out the walls of Jerusalem. Man, they were totally wrecked, and the gates were burnt to a crisp."
Nehemiah,2,14,"So, I headed over to the gate of the fountain and the king's pool, but, like, there was totally no room for the animal I was riding on to get through."
Nehemiah,2,15,"So, I decided to take a late-night stroll by the brook, checking out the wall. Eventually, I turned around and made my way through the valley gate to head back."
Nehemiah,2,16,"And the leaders had no idea where I went or what I did. I hadn't even told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the rulers, or anyone else involved in the project yet."
Nehemiah,2,17,"So I said to them, you can clearly see the bad situation we're in - Jerusalem is destroyed and its gates are burned down. Let's all come together and rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, so that we won't be looked down upon anymore."
Nehemiah,2,18,"So, I was like, yo, listen up! God was totally blessing me, you know? Like, He had my back, and I was feeling hella good about it. I also shared the dope words the king dropped on me. And guess what? My peeps were like, let's do this! We gotta rise up and build, no doubt. So, they rallied together, pumped up and ready to do some epic work."
Nehemiah,2,19,"But when Sanballat, the Horonite, and Tobiah, the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem, the Arabian, heard about it, they totally roasted us, ridiculed us, and were like, 'What's up with this thing you're doing? Are you trying to rebel against the king?'"
Nehemiah,2,20,"So I replied to them, saying: The Almighty in the sky has got our back, so we, His devoted followers, will step up and construct. But you guys ain't got no claim, authority, or remembrance in Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,3,1,"So Eliashib, the high priest, teamed up with his fellow priests to construct the sheep gate. They made it holy and installed its doors, all the way to the tower of Meah and the tower of Hananeel."
Nehemiah,3,2,"And then the guys from Jericho started building next to him. And right beside them, Zaccur the son of Imri started building too. #teamwork"
Nehemiah,3,3,"Yo, the fish gate was totally built by the squad known as the sons of Hassenaah. They straight up flexed their carpentry skills, setting up the sick beams, doors, locks, and bars for that entrance."
Nehemiah,3,4,"Then Meremoth, the son of Urijah and grandson of Koz, stepped up to do some repairs. Right after him, it was Meshullam, the son of Berechiah and great-grandson of Meshezabeel. And not far behind, there was Zadok, son of Baana, joining in on the repairs."
Nehemiah,3,5,"And then the Tekoites got to fixing up their section, but their fancy peeps didn't bother lifting a finger for the work of the Lord."
Nehemiah,3,6,"Also, Jehoiada, son of Paseah, and Meshullam, son of Besodeiah, were the ones who fixed the old gate. They put in new beams, installed some fresh doors, and made sure the locks and bars were secure."
Nehemiah,3,7,"Then Melatiah, a Gibeonite, and Jadon, a Meronothite, who were from Gibeon and Mizpah, worked on repairing the wall up to the seat of the governor on this side of the river."
Nehemiah,3,8,"Uzziel, the son of Harhaiah, a skilled goldsmith, stepped up and fixed things up. Hananiah, the son of one of the apothecaries, also jumped in and they strengthened Jerusalem all the way to the big wall."
Nehemiah,3,9,"And then Rephaiah, the son of Hur, who was in charge of half of Jerusalem, helped with the repairs."
Nehemiah,3,10,"And then Jedaiah, Harumaph's son, fixed up his house right by it. And next to him, Hattush, Hashabniah's son, also did some repairs."
Nehemiah,3,11,"Malchijah, Harim's son, and Hashub, Pahathmoab's son, fixed up the rest of the area, including the tower with the furnaces. (Other piece means the second part.)"
Nehemiah,3,12,"Then Shallum, the son of Halohesh, and his daughters—who were total boss babes—took charge and fixed up the other half of Jerusalem like it was NBD."
Nehemiah,3,13,"Hanun and the Zanoah peeps fixed up the valley gate. They built it, set up the doors, locks, and bars. They even threw in a cool one-thousand cubits of wall all the way to the dung gate."
Nehemiah,3,14,"But Malchiah, the son of Rechab and ruler in Bethhaccerem, was in charge of fixing the dung gate. He totally rebuilt it, putting in new doors, locks, and bars. Such dedication, dude!"
Nehemiah,3,15,"Shallun, the son of Colhozeh, who was in charge of a part of Mizpah, fixed and upgraded the gate of the fountain. He built it up, put a protective cover on it, and installed the doors, locks, and bars. He also worked on the wall of the pool of Siloah, near the king's garden, all the way to the stairs leading down from the city of David."
Nehemiah,3,16,"Then Nehemiah, Azbuk's son, who was in charge of half of Bethzur, fixed up the area across from David's tombs, the cool pool, and the badass house."
Nehemiah,3,17,"Next up, the Levite crew got to work. We had Rehum, Bani's son, leading the charge. Right beside him, we had Hashabiah, bossing it as the ruler of Keilah's half. They both put in the work and fixed things up."
Nehemiah,3,18,"Then Bavai, Henadad's son and the leader of half of Keilah, helped repair alongside his fellow brethren."
Nehemiah,3,19,"Then Ezer, the son of Jeshua, who was in charge of Mizpah, worked on the section of the wall near the entrance to the weapons storage."
Nehemiah,3,20,"And then Baruch, son of Zabbai, put in some serious work on the other section, from where the wall bends to the doorway of Eliashib the high priest's house. (Zabbai, also known as Zaccai)"
Nehemiah,3,21,"Then Meremoth, the son of Urijah and grandson of Koz, stepped up and fixed up another part, starting from the entrance of Eliashib's house all the way to the other end."
Nehemiah,3,22,"And then the priests, along with the dudes from the flatlands, went on to fix things."
Nehemiah,3,23,"Benjamin and Hashub fixed up their crib, and Azariah, son of Maaseiah and grandson of Ananiah, did some serious renovations at his pad."
Nehemiah,3,24,"Then Binnui, Henadad's son, took on the task of fixing up another section of the wall, all the way from Azariah's crib to the epic corner."
Nehemiah,3,25,"Palal, Uzai's son, was in charge of the spot where the wall turns and the cool tower sticking out from the king's fancy crib, right next to the courtyard where they keep the prisoners. Following him was Pedaiah, Parosh's offspring."
Nehemiah,3,26,"And the Nethinims lived in Ophel, right by the water gate on the east side, near the cool tower. They came from Ophel to restore it."
Nehemiah,3,27,"The Tekoites had their turn and fixed up a different part, right where the huge tower is, all the way to the Ophel wall."
Nehemiah,3,28,"The priests flexed their repairing skills above the horse gate, each one handling their own crib."
Nehemiah,3,29,"Next up, Zadok, Immer's kid, fixed up his crib. Then there was Shemaiah, Shechaniah's offspring, holding it down at the east gate."
Nehemiah,3,30,"Yo, Hananiah, son of Shelemiah, and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, came through to fix up another part. And then Meshullam, son of Berechiah, fixed up his own space."
Nehemiah,3,31,"Then Malchiah, the son of a skilled goldsmith, fixed up the area of the Nethinims and merchants, right across from the Miphkad gate, all the way up to the corner. {corner chamber: or, room at the turning}"
Nehemiah,3,32,"Yo, the goldsmiths and merchants were busy fixin' things up from one side to the other, all the way from the corner to the sheep gate. They were on a mission to make those repairs, ya feel me? It was straight hustle and determination!"
Nehemiah,4,1,"So, like, when Sanballat found out we were like, totally building the wall, he got so mad and super salty, and started hella clowning on the Jews."
Nehemiah,4,2,"So he like totally spoke in front of his peeps and the squad of Samaria, and was all like, yo, what's up with these weak Jews? Do they think they can build up their defenses? Are they gonna throw down some sacrifices? Do they think they can finish this in a day? Are they gonna bring these burnt rocks back to life from the trash piles? (Fortify...: Basically, leave them alone to do their own thing)"
Nehemiah,4,3,"So this guy Tobiah, he was hanging around and was like, 'Even if some fox goes up, it'll totally wreck their wall, man.'"
Nehemiah,4,4,"Listen up, God; because we're getting hated on: make them pay for their insults and let them be caught in their own trap, and make them suffer as captives in a foreign land."
Nehemiah,4,5,"Don't ignore their mistakes, don't let their wrongdoings fade away. They totally ticked you off in front of the builders, yo."
Nehemiah,4,6,"So we flexed on that wall, and the whole thing was connected halfway through, 'cause the squad was all about that grind."
Nehemiah,4,7,"But, like, when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, Ammonites, and Ashdodites found out that the walls of Jerusalem were, like, all fixed up and the damaged parts were getting repaired, they got super angry, you know?"
Nehemiah,4,8,"So they all joined forces to come and battle against Jerusalem, intending to disrupt their plans."
Nehemiah,4,9,"But yo, we straight up prayed to our God and stayed on guard against them 24/7, all because of those peeps."
Nehemiah,4,10,"Yo, Judah straight up said, the peeps who carry all the heavy stuff are losin' their strength, and there's mad trash everywhere. It's like, we can't even build this wall, you feel me?"
Nehemiah,4,11,"And our haters were like, 'They won't even see it coming until we swoop in and totally take them out, putting an end to their progress.'"
Nehemiah,4,12,"So, like, it happened that when the Jews who lived nearby came, they were like, 'Dude, like, come back to us ten times from wherever you go, 'cause we need ya.'"
Nehemiah,4,13,"So I stationed people with their swords, spears, and bows both on the lower parts behind the wall and on the higher areas, organizing them according to their families."
Nehemiah,4,14,"So, I saw what was going down and I stood up and said to the squad, the bosses, and everyone else, don't stress about those haters. Don't forget that the Lord is awesome and fierce. Stand up for your fam, your bros, your sisters, your baes, and your crib."
Nehemiah,4,15,"So, like, when our haters found out that we got the deets, and God totally ruined their plans, we all went back to our tasks on the wall, you know, like it's all good."
Nehemiah,4,16,"So from that point on, half of my servants were busy doing the work, while the other half held onto their spears, shields, bows, and armor. The leaders were positioned behind everyone in the house of Judah."
Nehemiah,4,17,"The ones building the wall and carrying heavy loads, along with those who were loading, each worked with one hand on the task, and held a weapon in the other hand."
Nehemiah,4,18,"The builders were ready to work with their swords strapped to their waists and got down to business. There was even someone standing next to me, ready to sound the trumpet. (on his loins: That's what the Hebrew says!)"
Nehemiah,4,19,"So, like, I was talking to all the fancy people, the rulers, and everybody else, and I was all, 'Yo, this project we got going on is hella huge, and we're spread out on this wall, like, we're miles apart, dude.'"
Nehemiah,4,20,"So, like, whenever you hear the trumpet sound, you better come join us, yo! Our God's got our backs, He's gonna fight for us, no doubt!"
Nehemiah,4,21,"So we were grinding in the grind: and, like, half of them held the spears from hella early in the morning till the stars showed up, you know."
Nehemiah,4,22,"So I told the people, yo, let everyone and their crew stay in Jerusalem. That way, during the night, they can watch over us and hustle during the day."
Nehemiah,4,23,"So, like, not me, my crew, or anyone in my squad, nobody changed out of our outfits, except when we needed to wash them. We made sure to keep our weapons with us when we went to get water though."
Nehemiah,5,1,"And the whole squad, along with their significant others, straight up called out their own crew, the Jews."
Nehemiah,5,2,"Some people were like, 'Yo, we got a big fam with mad kids. So, we need to gather some food to keep us fed and alive.'"
Nehemiah,5,3,"There were some people who were like, yo, we had to put our lands, vineyards, and houses on the line to get some corn, 'cause there was a major shortage and we needed to eat."
Nehemiah,5,4,"There were some people who were like, 'Yo, we had to take out mad cash to pay the king's tribute and it's straight up affecting our lands and vineyards.'"
Nehemiah,5,5,"But like, our bodies are basically the same as our brothers', and our kids are just like their kids, you know? And like, it's messed up 'cause we're forcing our own sons and daughters to be servants. Some of our daughters are already in that situation, and like, we can't even do anything about it, 'cause other guys own our lands and vineyards, seriously."
Nehemiah,5,6,I was pretty ticked off when I heard them whining and saying that.
Nehemiah,5,7,"So, I thought about it and I called out the fancy people and the leaders, saying, 'You're charging interest to your own family members! That's not cool.' And I gathered a huge group of people against them."
Nehemiah,5,8,"So, like, I was all like, 'Yo, we totally stepped up and saved our Jewish fam from getting sold to those non-believers. And now, you wanna sell them too? Are you serious? Like, are we gonna let them get sold to us? Ugh!' And they, like, didn't say anything 'cause they knew they had nothing to come back with, you know?"
Nehemiah,5,9,"I was like, dude, it's not cool what you're doing. Shouldn't you be all about respecting our God and not caring about what our enemies say?"
Nehemiah,5,10,"Yo, me and my crew, including my homies and my employees, could easily ask them for cash and grub. But, yo, let's stop this shady business of charging high interest rates, ya feel me?"
Nehemiah,5,11,"Hey, can you, like, give back their lands, vineyards, oliveyards, and houses ASAP? Oh, and don't forget to return one percent of the money, corn, wine, and oil that you took from them, cool?"
Nehemiah,5,12,"And they were like, 'Yeah, we'll totally give it back, no strings attached. We'll do exactly what you said.' So I was like, 'Alright, you better swear to it.' Then I got the priests involved and made them promise that they'd keep their word."
Nehemiah,5,13,"Then I shook my lap and said, may God remove every person from their house and work who does not fulfill this promise. Let them be removed and left with nothing. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people kept their word."
Nehemiah,5,14,"So, like, ever since I was made their leader in Judah, starting from the twentieth year all the way up to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, which is, like, twelve whole years, me and my crew haven't even had a taste of the fancy governor's food."
Nehemiah,5,15,"But the old governors before me were a burden on the people, taking food and drinks as well as money; even their servants ruled over the people. But I didn't do that because I respected God too much."
Nehemiah,5,16,"Yeah, I was totally committed to this wall project, didn't even think about buying any property, and all my buddies were there helping me out."
Nehemiah,5,17,"And yo, at my table, there were like a hundred and fifty Jewish homies and bosses, plus some cool peeps from other nations around us."
Nehemiah,5,18,"So, like, every day I got this sick feast - one whole ox, six prime sheep, and even some poultry. And you won't believe it, but every ten days I had a whole variety of top-notch wine. But, even with all this abundance, I didn't even need the governor's fancy bread. The people were going through some heavy, oppressive stuff."
Nehemiah,5,19,"Hey, God, do me a solid and remember all the good things I've done for these peeps."
Nehemiah,6,1,"So like, Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arabian, and our other enemies heard that I had built the wall and there were no holes in it anymore. (But just so you know, I hadn't put doors on the gates yet at that time;)"
Nehemiah,6,2,"Sanballat and Geshem hit me up like, 'Yo, let's link up in one of the villages in the Ono area.' But they were totally plotting against me."
Nehemiah,6,3,"So I messaged them like, 'Yo, I'm busy doing something really important right now, so I can't chill with y'all. Can't let this work stop just to hang out with you, you feel me?'"
Nehemiah,6,4,"But they kept hitting me up like four times with the same old story, and I responded to them in the same way."
Nehemiah,6,5,"So then Sanballat, like, sent his servant to me for the fifth time, you know? And get this, he had an open letter in his hand, straight up!"
Nehemiah,6,6,"So, like, word got out among the non-believers, this guy Gashmu is saying that you and the Jews are planning on rebelling. He's claiming that you're building this wall to become their king, you know what I mean? Gashmu is just another name for Geshem, by the way."
Nehemiah,6,7,"And you've chosen prophets to spread the word about you in Jerusalem, saying, 'There's a cool king in Judah.' And now the king will hear about this message. So, let's get together and figure out what to do next."
Nehemiah,6,8,"So I hit him up and told him, like, dude, what you're saying is straight up false. You're just making it all up from your own imagination."
Nehemiah,6,9,"Like, yo, they were all trying to freak us out, saying that our hands would get weak and we wouldn't be able to finish the work. But seriously, {Oh God}, help me out and make my hands strong."
Nehemiah,6,10,"Later on, I went to Shemaiah's crib, he's the son of Delaiah, who's the son of Mehetabeel. Dude was basically on lockdown, you know? And get this, he was all like, 'Let's link up in God's crib, right in the temple, and lock all the doors tight. 'Cause, bro, they're out to get you, man. Yeah, they're planning to take you out, right in the middle of the night, fam.'"
Nehemiah,6,11,"I was like, wait, why should I, a guy as awesome as me, run away? Who in their right mind, with the same awesomeness level as me, would go into the temple just to save themselves? Nope, not gonna happen."
Nehemiah,6,12,"So, like, I totally realized that God didn't actually send him, but he was just spreading this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat paid him off. SMH."
Nehemiah,6,13,"So they paid him to scare me, make me mess up, and do something wrong. They wanted to spread bad rumors about me and shame me."
Nehemiah,6,14,"Yo God, could you like remember Tobiah and Sanballat for what they've been pulling off, along with Noadiah, that prophetess, and the other prophets who tried to scare me?"

Nehemiah,8,1,"So like, all the people came together as one big squad in front of the water gate. And they were like, 'Hey Ezra, you gotta bring us that book of the law of Moses that the LORD told Israel to follow.'"
Nehemiah,8,2,"So, Ezra, the priest, shared the law with everyone, guys and girls, anyone who could actually understand what he was saying. This happened on the first day of the seventh month. (And by 'understand,' we mean they actually paid attention and got what he was talking about, you know?)"
Nehemiah,8,3,"And he started reading in front of the lively street by the water gate from morning 'til midday, in front of the guys, girls, and those who could comprehend. Everyone was completely focused on the book of the law and really listening."
Nehemiah,8,4,"So Ezra the scribe stood on this wooden stage that they made specifically for this occasion. And standing next to him on his right were Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Urijah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, while on his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchiah, Hashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam. (By the way, the 'pulpit' they're talking about here is like a fancy tower made out of wood!)"
Nehemiah,8,5,"So Ezra was like, 'Watch this, y'all!' and he busted out the book in front of everyone. And I mean, he was the main man up there, so everybody looked up to him. As soon as he cracked that book open, everyone straight up stood up in respect. (BTW, 'sight' in Hebrew means eyess', just so you know.)"
Nehemiah,8,6,"Ezra gave mad props to the LORD, the awesome God. And all the people were like, 'Yeah, totally! Yeah, totally!' while throwing their hands up. They humbly bowed their heads and gave mad respect to the LORD, getting their faces on the ground."
Nehemiah,8,7,"And Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, helped the people understand the law, and the people were like totally listening to them, man."
Nehemiah,8,8,"So, like, they were all reading from this book, y'know, the law of God, and they were super clear about it. And they didn't stop there! They also explained what everything meant, so that everyone could actually understand what they were reading."
Nehemiah,8,9,"So Nehemiah, who's like the boss, and Ezra the priest who's really good at writing stuff, and the Levites who teach everyone, told everyone, 'Yo, today is super sacred to the LORD your God. Don't be all sad or cry. But everyone totally started bawling when they heard what the law said.'"
Nehemiah,8,10,"And he was like, yo, go and do your thing, enjoy the good stuff, and share with those who ain't got nothing, 'cause today is all holy and lit for our Lord. Don't be bummed out, 'cause the joy of the LORD will give you strength."
Nehemiah,8,11,"The Levites were like, 'Yo, y'all need to chill. Today's all sacred and stuff, so don't be buggin' or get all sad."
Nehemiah,8,12,"And all the people were like, Timee to grub, sip, and share the goodies!' They were all hyped because they finally got what was being said to them."
Nehemiah,8,13,"So, on the next day, all the important dads, priests, and Levites assembled before Ezra the scribe. They wanted to get a good grasp of what the law said and maybe even learn how to explain it to others."
Nehemiah,8,14,"So, like, they discovered this written law that the LORD had given through Moses, which said that the people of Israel were supposed to live in these booth things during the seventh month festival. (by: Hebrew, by the hand of)"
Nehemiah,8,15,"So, they were told to go and spread the word in all their cities, including Jerusalem, saying, 'Head over to the mountain and gather some olive branches, pine branches, myrtle branches, palm branches, and thick tree branches. We're gonna use them to build cool shelters, just like it says in the book.'"
Nehemiah,8,16,"So, the people went out and brought the stuff, and set up their own chill spots. They made booths on the roof of their houses, in their yards, and even in the courtyards of God's house. They set up booths in the water gate street and the gate of Ephraim street."
Nehemiah,8,17,"And all the crew of Israelites who were freed from captivity built some sick pop-up tents and chilled under those tents. This was a total first, because the last time they did something like this was way back in the day when Jeshua, son of Nun, was around. And let me tell you, everyone was absolutely stoked about it. It was a major vibe."
Nehemiah,8,18,"Every day, from the beginning to the end, he was totally into reading the book of God's law. They partied hard for a whole week, and on the eighth day, they had a super serious gathering, just like you do."
Nehemiah,9,1,"So, like, on the 24th day of this month, all the Israelite peeps got together looking all solemn with fasting, wearing sackcloths and dirt on their bods."
Nehemiah,9,2,"So the people of Israel, like, totally distanced themselves from all these random outsiders, and they like stood up and owned their mistakes and the messed up things their ancestors did. So real, right? Like, 'we see you strangers, but we're all about staying true to our roots and owning our stuff, you know?'"
Nehemiah,9,3,"So, they got up and started reading the book of the LORD their God for, like, a quarter of the day. And then, for another quarter of the day, they came clean and showed their respect by worshiping the LORD their God."
Nehemiah,9,4,"Then the Levites, Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, Chenani, stood up on the platform and shouted loudly to the LORD their God."
Nehemiah,9,5,"So, like, the Levites – you know, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah – were all like, 'Yo, stand up and give mad props to the LORD your God for eternity, man! His name is so awesome, it's, like, totally above all blessings and praises, you feel me?"
Nehemiah,9,6,"Like, OMG, you, like, totally, LORD, are, like, the only one; you created, like, the whole universe and everything in it, like, the sky, the stars, the earth, like, everything! And, like, you keep everything in order, and, like, even the angels in heaven worship you, dude!"
Nehemiah,9,7,"You, like, totally the LORD God, who, like, chose Abram and, like, brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the new name Abraham;"
Nehemiah,9,8,"And you saw that his heart was loyal to you and made an agreement with him to give the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites to him and his descendants. And you have kept your promise because you are righteous."
Nehemiah,9,9,"And you totally saw how our ancestors were so stressed out back in Egypt, and you literally listened to their cries when they were standing by the Red Sea."
Nehemiah,9,10,"And you know, you totally flexed on Pharaoh and his whole squad. You hit them with mad signs and miracles, proving that they shouldn't mess with you. That's how you got your rep, and it's still lit to this day."
Nehemiah,9,11,"And you, like, totally split the sea in front of them, so they could walk right through on dry land. And, like, those who were chasing them got totally thrown into the deep sea, like a stone thrown into super intense waves."
Nehemiah,9,12,"You basically guided them during the day with a cool cloud column, and at night with a lit-up fire column, to show them the way they needed to go."
Nehemiah,9,13,"So, like, God totally descended onto Mount Sinai and started talking to the peeps from the heavens. And, He gave them these super righteous judgments, legit laws, awesome statutes, and straight-up commandments. Like, no lies or fakes, just pure truth, you know? #HebrewLawsOfTruth"
Nehemiah,9,14,"And you showed them your epic holy sabbath, and were like, 'Yo, listen up! Here are the rules, directions, and laws I'm laying down, delivered by Moses, your homeboy and dedicated servant:"
Nehemiah,9,15,"And you totally hooked them up with heavenly bread when they were starving, and you pulled out some sick water from a rock when they were thirsty. You even made them a promise that they would totally score the land you swore to give them, which was like a big deal and everything. You really came through, no doubt!"
Nehemiah,9,16,"But yo, they and our parents were all mega proud and stubborn as heck, and they straight up ignored your commands."
Nehemiah,9,17,"And they straight up ignored your amazing miracles and decided not to listen, they were so stubborn and rebellious they even chose a leader to take them back to their old ways. But you, God, always ready to forgive, full of grace and mercy, patient and kind, you never turned your back on them. You're the real MVP, God of second chances."
Nehemiah,9,18,"So, like, they totally made this cool statue out of melted metal, and were like, 'Dude, this is your God who brought you out of Egypt!' And honestly, they did some pretty crazy stuff that got everyone pretty ticked off."
Nehemiah,9,19,"But you, with all your love and kindness, didn't abandon them in the wilderness. The cloud that guided them during the day and the fire that showed them the way at night never left their side."
Nehemiah,9,20,"You also hooked them up with your dope spirit to teach them, and you didn't hold back on feeding them with your manna, and you made sure they stayed hydrated by giving them water when they were thirsty."
Nehemiah,9,21,"Yeah, for like forty years, you totally kept them going in the middle of nowhere, and they didn't lack anything. Their clothes stayed fresh, and they didn't even get swollen feet."
Nehemiah,9,22,"And you, like, totally hooked them up with kingdoms and nations, and like, split them up into different territories. So they, like, took over the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan."
Nehemiah,9,23,"You made their squad grow like the number of stars in the sky, and you totally hooked them up by bringing them to the promised land, just like you promised their parents. They were about to take over that place and totally own it."
Nehemiah,9,24,"So, like, the kiddos went in and took over the land, and you totally brought the people living there, the Canaanites, under their control. You even handed over the Canaanites, their kings, and the other peeps living there, letting the kiddos do whatever they wanted with them. It was all according to their own plan, ya know?"
Nehemiah,9,25,"Yo, they straight up conquered some lit cities and an awesome land, snagged mad houses filled with all sorts of goodies, had wells and cisterns for days, and owned vineyards, oliveyards, and hella fruit trees. They grubbed, got hella full, and straight up reveled in all the dope blessings!"
Nehemiah,9,26,"But, like, they were totally rebellious and didn't obey you, and they straight-up ignored your laws and killed your prophets who were trying to bring them back to you, which was like a major disrespect."
Nehemiah,9,27,"So, you let their enemies mess with them, and when they were in trouble and called out to you, you listened from heaven. Because you're super kind, you sent them heroes who saved them from their enemies."
Nehemiah,9,28,"But like, even after they had some downtime and stuff, they went back to doing evil in front of you, so you were like, 'Alright, fine,' and let their enemies have power over them and stuff. But then, when they came to their senses and called out to you, you totally heard them from up in heaven and saved them like so many times because you're super merciful and all. Like, they just couldn't help themselves and went back to being all evil again, you know, like it says in the Hebrew version!"
Nehemiah,9,29,"And you gave them warnings, trying to bring them back to following your law, but they were too proud and didn't listen to your commandments. They went against your judgments, which are meant to guide them in living a good life. They shrugged off the responsibility, stubbornly ignored you, and refused to listen."
Nehemiah,9,30,"But you put up with them for a long time and warned them through your prophets, by your spirit. But they didn't listen at all, so you let other nations take over them."
Nehemiah,9,31,"But, like, seriously, because of how merciful and compassionate you are, you didn't totally wipe them out or ditch them; 'cause you're, like, the most caring and kind God ever."
Nehemiah,9,32,"Yo, God, you're awesome, powerful, and kinda scary in a cool way. You always keep your promises and show mercy. So, don't ignore all the tough stuff we're going through, like, seriously, it's been rough on our leaders, priests, prophets, ancestors, and everyone else since way back. #AssyriaToNow"
Nehemiah,9,33,"But yo, you straight up righteous in all the stuff that's been happening to us; 'cause like, you've been doing what's right, but we've been straight up wicked:"
Nehemiah,9,34,"Our leaders, influencers, religious figures, and even our predecessors failed to follow your laws or pay attention to your instructions and the evidence of your teachings that exposed their wrongdoings."
Nehemiah,9,35,"Because they didn't really show you any love during their rule, despite all the awesome blessings you gave them. They didn't even appreciate the amazing land you put in front of them. Plus, they never bothered to change their evil ways."
Nehemiah,9,36,"Yo, check it out, we're like totally servants today, you know? For the land that you gave to our ancestors so they could enjoy the tasty fruit and all the good stuff it has to offer, we're still serving it, man!"
Nehemiah,9,37,"And it actually makes the leaders you put in charge of us even more powerful, all because of the bad choices we've made. They can basically do whatever they want with our lives and our stuff, and we're totally messed up because of it."
Nehemiah,9,38,"So, like, we're all totally convinced about this whole thing, so we're gonna make, like, a legit agreement and put it in writing. And our leaders, along with the Levites and priests, are gonna give it their official stamp of approval, you know? #SealedAndDelivered"
Nehemiah,10,1,"So, like, the peeps who sealed the deal were Nehemiah, the boss-man who was the son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah, ya know? Just FYI, the sealings were legit and everything. Nehemiah was basically the governor, if ya catch my drift."

Nehemiah,10,28,"And the rest of the crew, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the helpers, and all those who had chosen to follow the law of God, along with their partners, kids, and fam, all of them were knowledgeable and understanding."
Nehemiah,10,29,"They stuck together with their squad, the VIPs, and made a serious commitment to follow God's rules, which were passed down by Moses, God's right-hand man. They agreed to totally rock all of the LORD, our awesome leader's, commandments, decisions, and laws; {by: Heb. by the hand of}"
Nehemiah,10,30,"And like, we shouldn't be giving our daughters to those people from other places, and, like, not taking their daughters as wives for our sons either, ya know?"
Nehemiah,10,31,"And if the peeps around us bring their stuff to sell on the Sabbath, we shouldn't buy it from them on that day, or on any holy day for that matter. Also, let's take a break on the seventh year and forgive everyone's debts. No more asking for money, ya hear?"
Nehemiah,10,32,"So, we decided to set rules for ourselves, like, every year we would contribute a third of a shekel to support the work of our God's house."
Nehemiah,10,33,"For the awesome bread, and the non-stop snacks, and the never-ending barbecue, for the chill weekends, the lit parties, the sacred stuff, and for fixing up our mistakes and making things right for Israel, and for all the work that goes down in God's crib."
Nehemiah,10,34,"So we drew lots among the priests, the Levites, and the peeps to decide who would bring the wood offering to the crib of our God. Ya know, just like our ancestors used to do every year at specific times. We gotta burn it up on the LORD our God's altar, you feel? It's all written in the law and stuff!"
Nehemiah,10,35,"And like, every year we gotta take the first crops and all the fruits from our trees to the Lord's crib, ya know?"
Nehemiah,10,36,"We gotta give up the firstborns of our kids and our animals, just like it says in the law. And don't forget about the firstborns of our herds and flocks too. We're supposed to bring 'em to the house of our God, to the priests who do their thing in the house of our God."
Nehemiah,10,37,"So, like, we gotta make sure to give the priests the best of our bread, offerings, fruits, wine, and oil. They chill at the priests' house in our crib, you know? And we should also give a tenth of our crops to the Levites, so they can get their share in all the cities we farm in."
Nehemiah,10,38,"So like, the priest who's Aaron's son gotta be chillin' with the Levites when they collect tithes. And then the Levites gotta bring, like, a portion of those tithes to the house of our God, you know, to the cool chambers where we keep all the treasure."
Nehemiah,10,39,"So, like, the kids from Israel and the Levites gotta bring their offerings of corn, new wine, and oil to the chambers where all the fancy stuff for worship is kept. And it's not just the priests, but also the people helping out at the door and the singers too. We're all in this together and we won't forget about our place of worship, man!"
Nehemiah,11,1,"So, like, the big shots of the people were chillin' in Jerusalem: and the rest of the peeps were like, let's draw straws to see who gets to live in Jerusalem, the super sacred city, you know? And like, one out of every ten got to live there, while the other nine parts got to live in different cities."
Nehemiah,11,2,And the people gave mad props to all the dudes who gladly stepped up and chose to kick it in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,11,3,"So, here's the deal: these are the main peeps who lived in Jerusalem. But in the cities of Judah, everyone just kicked it in their own crib. We're talking about Israel, the priests, the Levites, the Nethinims, and the squad who came from Solomon's servants."
Nehemiah,11,4,"So in Jerusalem, there were some peeps from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. From Judah, there was Athaiah, the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalaleel, from the tribe of Perez (also known as Pharez)."
Nehemiah,11,5,"So, like, there was this dude Maaseiah, right? He was the son of Baruch who was the son of Colhozeh, who was the son of Hazaiah, who was the son of Adaiah, who was the son of Joiarib, who was the son of Zechariah, who was the son of Shiloni."
Nehemiah,11,6,"In Jerusalem, there were 468 epic dudes from the Perez fam holding it down."
Nehemiah,11,7,"And these are the guys from Benjamin: Sallu, who's the son of Meshullam, who's the son of Joed, who's the son of Pedaiah, who's the son of Kolaiah, who's the son of Maaseiah, who's the son of Ithiel, who's the son of Jesaiah."
Nehemiah,11,8,"Then came Gabbai and Sallai, totaling nine hundred twenty-eight."
Nehemiah,11,9,"So like, Joel, Zichri's kid, was in charge around there, you know? And Judah, Senuah's son, was like the second in command in the city."
Nehemiah,11,10,"The squad of priests be like: Jedaiah, Joiarib's son, and Jachin, holding it down."
Nehemiah,11,11,"Seraiah, speaking of Hilkiah, who was the son of Meshullam, who was the son of Zadok, who was the son of Meraioth, who was the son of Ahitub, totally rocked as the boss of God's crib."
Nehemiah,11,12,"And there were, like, 822 of their fellow peeps who were doing the work in the house, you know? And among them was Adaiah, the son of Jeroham, who was the son of Pelaliah, who was the son of Amzi, who was the son of Zechariah, who was the son of Pashur, who was the son of Malchiah."
Nehemiah,11,13,"And his squad, main fam, 242 in total: and Amashai, the son of Azareel, who's the offspring of Ahasai, the descendant of Meshillemoth, the descendant of Immer,"
Nehemiah,11,14,"And their squad, hella strong warriors, 128 of them, with Zabdiel as their boss, who's the son of one of the OGs. (the son of one of the great men)"
Nehemiah,11,15,"And there were even more Levites, like Shemaiah, the dope son of Hashub, who came from a long line of legends - Azrikam, Hashabiah, and Bunni, straight up!"
Nehemiah,11,16,"Shabbethai and Jozabad, the leaders of the Levites, were in charge of handling all the stuff that went down at God's crib. They were responsible for keeping things smooth on the outside. #Blessed"
Nehemiah,11,17,"Mattaniah, son of Micha, grandson of Zabdi, great-grandson of Asaph, was the boss of leading the thanksgiving prayer. Bakbukiah came in second, and he was part of the crew. Abda, son of Shammua, grandson of Galal, and great-grandson of Jeduthun, was also part of the team."
Nehemiah,11,18,"In the holy city, there were a total of 284 Levites."
Nehemiah,11,19,"And there were a total of 172 cool dudes who were the gatekeepers - Akkub, Talmon, and their crew. They were responsible for holding it down at the gates."
Nehemiah,11,20,"So, like, the rest of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, they all lived in different cities of Judah, each in their own land."
Nehemiah,11,21,"But the peeps called Nethinims lived in Ophel, and Ziha and Gispa were the leaders of the Nethinims. Ophel was like a boss tower, you know?"
Nehemiah,11,22,"Uzzi, the descendant of Bani, Hashabiah, Mattaniah, and Micha, was in charge of the Levites in Jerusalem. As for the singers, they were from the Asaph clan and responsible for the affairs of the house of God."
Nehemiah,11,23,"So, like, the king made this rule that the singers should get their fair share every single day. It was, like, a sure thing."
Nehemiah,11,24,"Yo, Pethahiah, the son of Meshezabeel, from the crew of Zerah, you know, Judah's son, was like the king's right-hand man for handling all the stuff that involved the people. (Zerah, also known as Zarah)"
Nehemiah,11,25,"And there were some from the tribe of Judah who lived in Kirjatharba and the surrounding villages, as well as in Dibon and its villages, and in Jekabzeel and its villages."
Nehemiah,11,26,"And at Jeshua, and at Moladah, and at Bethphelet,"
Nehemiah,11,27,"And at Hazarshual, and at Beersheba, and in all the chill spots nearby,"
Nehemiah,11,28,"And in Ziklag, Mekonah, and the surrounding villages,"
Nehemiah,11,29,"And at Enrimmon, and at Zareah, and at Jarmuth,"
Nehemiah,11,30,"They lived in Zanoah, Adullam, and their little towns, in Lachish and its surrounding fields, in Azekah and its villages. They lived from Beersheba all the way to the Hinnom Valley."
Nehemiah,11,31,"The kids from Benjamin in Geba lived in Michmash, Aija, Bethel, and their villages, from there to"
Nehemiah,11,32,"And in Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,"
Nehemiah,11,33,"Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, bruh,"
Nehemiah,11,34,"Bruh, we got Hadid, Zeboim, and Neballat on the list,"
Nehemiah,11,35,"Lod and Ono, the vibes of skilled peeps."
Nehemiah,11,36,"Like, there were these cool Levite squads in both Judah and Benjamin, you know?"
Nehemiah,12,1,"So, here's the lowdown on the priests and Levites who rode along with Zerubbabel, Shealtiel's son, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, you know the crew."
Nehemiah,12,2,"Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, and Malluch (he's also known as Melicu)"
Nehemiah,12,3,"Yo, Shechaniah, aka Shebaniah, Rehum, aka Harim, and Meremoth, aka Meraioth,"
Nehemiah,12,4,"Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah, aka Ginnethon"
Nehemiah,12,5,"Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, {Miamin, also known as Miniamin}, {Maadiah, also known as Moadiah}"
Nehemiah,12,6,"Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah, bruh!"
Nehemiah,12,7,"Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. They were the top priests and their crew back in the days of Jeshua. Sallu, also known as Sallai."
Nehemiah,12,8,"The Levites also included Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who was in charge of leading the grateful songs with his fellow Levites."
Nehemiah,12,9,"And yo, Bakbukiah and Unni, their homies, were holding it down across from them in the watches."
Nehemiah,12,10,"And Jeshua had a kid named Joiakim, who then had a kid named Eliashib, and Eliashib had a kid named Joiada,"
Nehemiah,12,11,"Joiada was the dad of Jonathan, and Jonathan was the dad of Jaddua."
Nehemiah,12,12,"During Joiakim's era, the priests in charge were as follows: Seraiah's top priest was Meraiah, and Jeremiah's top priest was Hananiah."
Nehemiah,12,13,"Of Ezra, it's Meshullam's fam; of Amariah, it's Jehohanan's squad;"
Nehemiah,12,14,"Melicu was in the squad, Jonathan was holding it down; Shebaniah had Joseph by his side, they were quite the team;"
Nehemiah,12,15,Harim had Adna; Meraioth had Helkai;
Nehemiah,12,16,"From Iddo, there's Zechariah; and from Ginnethon, we've got Meshullam;"
Nehemiah,12,17,"Abijah's crew: Zichri. Miniamin's squad: Moadiah. And don't forget about Piltai, too!"
Nehemiah,12,18,"Representing Bilgah, we got Shammua; and repping Shemaiah is Jehonathan;"
Nehemiah,12,19,"And for Joiarib, Mattenai was chosen; for Jedaiah, it was Uzzi;"
Nehemiah,12,20,"From Sallai, we got Slay; from Kallai, we got Killa; from Amok, we got Aces. But Eber, he kept it OG."
Nehemiah,12,21,Hilkiah's squad: Hashabiah. Jedaiah's crew: Nethaneel.
Nehemiah,12,22,"During Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua's time, the Levites were like the big bosses of their families. The priests were also included, all the way till Darius the Persian ruled."
Nehemiah,12,23,"The Levi squad, led by the OG dads, had their names dropped in the chronicles, all the way up until Johanan, Eliashib's kid, took charge."
Nehemiah,12,24,"And the top Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua, son of Kadmiel. They worked alongside their fellow Levites to sing praises and show gratitude, following the instructions from David, a man chosen by God. Each group had their own responsibilities and were stationed in specific areas."
Nehemiah,12,25,"Matt, Bak, Obi, Mesh, Tally, Akk, they were on door duty, guarding the gateways."
Nehemiah,12,26,"These people lived during the time of Joiakim, son of Jeshua, who was the son of Jozadak. Nehemiah was the governor, and Ezra was the priest and scribe."
Nehemiah,12,27,"And when they were celebrating the dedication of the wall in Jerusalem, they searched for the Levites from all over to bring them to Jerusalem. They wanted to make the dedication a joyful event with gratitude, singing, and groovy tunes, using cymbals, cool string instruments, and awesome harps."
Nehemiah,12,28,"Then all the cool singers got together, from the chill countryside near Jerusalem and the rad villages of Netophathi;"
Nehemiah,12,29,"And even from the sick party in Gilgal, and straight outta the chill fields of Geba and Azmaveth: 'cause the dope singers came through and built their lit villages all around Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,12,30,"So, like, the priests and the Levites totally cleansed themselves, and they also cleansed the people, the gates, and the wall. Super clean vibes all around!"
Nehemiah,12,31,So I gathered up the top influencers of Judah and assigned two major squads of them who were all about expressing gratitude. One group walked on the right side of the wall towards the dung gate.
Nehemiah,12,32,"And then Hoshaiah came next, slaying it with his style, accompanied by half of the coolest leaders in Judah,"
Nehemiah,12,33,"And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,"
Nehemiah,12,34,"Yo, we got Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah in the house,"
Nehemiah,12,35,"And there were some cool priests' sons rocking trumpets, like Zechariah, the son of Jonathan, who was the son of Shemaiah, who was the son of Mattaniah, who was the son of Michaiah, who was the son of Zaccur, who was the son of Asaph:"
Nehemiah,12,36,"And his squad, Shemzy, Azzy, Mily, Gilly, Mai, Neth, and Judah, Hanani, with the sick beats of David the OG, and Ezra the wordsmith leading the way."
Nehemiah,12,37,"Then, they headed towards the fountain gate, which was opposite them. They climbed up the stairs of the city of David by the wall, all the way up to the water gate on the east side, passing by the house of David."
Nehemiah,12,38,"Then the rest of the peeps who were grateful joined in and went opposite them, with me following behind. Half of the squad stayed on the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces all the way to the broad wall."
Nehemiah,12,39,"And from up by the Ephraim gate, and up by the old gate, and up by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, all the way to the sheep gate — they just stopped at the prison gate."
Nehemiah,12,40,"So there were these two squads of people giving thanks in the house of God, and I was there too, along with half of the leaders that were with me."
Nehemiah,12,41,"And the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, were rocking the trumpets!"
Nehemiah,12,42,"And there were also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer on the roster. These singers totally belted it out, with their main hype person Jezrahiah leading the charge. (Note: When we say belted it out, we're saying they made their voices heard, no doubt!)"
Nehemiah,12,43,"On that day, they threw down some epic sacrifices and partied hard. God totally blessed them with maximum joy, and the wives and kids were all stoked too. It was like the whole city of Jerusalem was lit with joy and everyone could hear the hype from miles away."
Nehemiah,12,44,"And back in the day, they had some people in charge of the treasure chambers, the offerings, the firstfruits, and the tithes. They collected a portion of the law for the priests and Levites from the fields of the cities. Judah was pretty stoked for the priests and Levites who were waiting on them. (By the way, 'waited' means they were standing around, just FYI.)"
Nehemiah,12,45,"And, like, the singers and the porters totally held it down for their God, and they were all about that purification, following the commandments of David and Solomon, his son."
Nehemiah,12,46,"Back in the day when David and Asaph were running things, there were these super talented singers who led the way in jamming out and giving major props and thanks to God."
Nehemiah,12,47,"And during the time of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all of Israel made sure to give their fair share to the singers and the gatekeepers every single day. They set aside sacred offerings for the Levites, and the Levites in turn offered them to the descendants of Aaron."
Nehemiah,13,1,"So, on that day they were reading from the book of Moses in front of all the people. And they discovered something pretty major written there: it said that the Ammonites and the Moabites were forbidden from entering the assembly of God forever."
Nehemiah,13,2,"Yo, they didn't even give the Israelites any food or water, instead they paid Balaam to curse them. But guess what? Our God totally flipped the script and turned that curse into a legit blessing."
Nehemiah,13,3,"So, like, when they got the memo about the law, they were like peacee out' and totally split from the mixed crowd in Israel."
Nehemiah,13,4,"So, like, this priest dude named Eliashib was in charge of the room in God's house, and get this, he was totally BFFs with Tobiah! Can you believe it? Like, he had a super important position and everything, overseeing everything and all that."
Nehemiah,13,5,"So, he made this super cool room with all the essentials for the Levites, singers, and porters to chillax. In there, they kept the meat offerings, frankincense, vessels, and also gave the tithe of corn, new wine, and oil. Oh, and don't forget about the offerings from the priests, as commanded. It was like the ultimate hangout spot!"
Nehemiah,13,6,"But during this whole time, I wasn't in Jerusalem. It was in the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes of Babylon that I finally went to see the king. After waiting for a while, I managed to get permission from the king. I had to really plead for it!"
Nehemiah,13,7,"So I went to Jerusalem, and found out about the messed up thing Eliashib did by making a room for Tobiah in the sacred space of God's house."
Nehemiah,13,8,"And I was extremely upset, so I kicked Tobiah's belongings out of the room."
Nehemiah,13,9,"So, I told them what to do, and they like totally cleaned out the rooms and stuff. And then, I brought back all the cool stuff from God's crib, like the food and the nice-smelling stuff."
Nehemiah,13,10,"So, I noticed that the Levites didn't get their fair share, because both the Levites and the singers who were doing their thing, had gone off to their own farms."
Nehemiah,13,11,"So, I confronted the big shots and was like, 'Yo, why is the house of God straight-up abandoned?' And I got everyone together and made sure they were all in their proper spot. {place: Hebrew for standing}"
Nehemiah,13,12,"So all of Judah brought their tenth of the crops, the new wine, and the oil to the storage places."
Nehemiah,13,13,"So I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah from the Levites as the money managers. And Hanan, the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah, was right there beside them, because they were known to be trustworthy and responsible. It was their job to distribute resources to their fellow brethren."
Nehemiah,13,14,"Yo God, please don't forget about me when it comes to this. And please don't erase the dope things I've done for the crib of my God, and all the cool stuff I've been handling there. {kindnesses: cool stuff I've done} {observations: or, tasks}"
Nehemiah,13,15,"So, like, back in the day, I saw people in Judah just doing their thing, you know, treading wine presses and bringing in sheaves and loading up donkeys. And get this, they were also bringing in wine, grapes, figs, and all sorts of stuff into Jerusalem on the sabbath day. It was like a whole production. But, dude, I wasn't about it. I straight up called them out on that day when they were selling all that food."
Nehemiah,13,16,"There were these cool dudes from Tyre who were living there, hustling with their fishing skills and selling all kinds of stuff to the peeps of Judah and Jerusalem, even on the day of rest, yo!"
Nehemiah,13,17,"So I like, confronted the popular kids of Judah and was like, 'Yo, what's up with this messed up thing you're doing, straight up disrespecting the Sabbath day?!"
Nehemiah,13,18,"Yo, didn't your ancestors do the same thing? Didn't our God bring all this bad stuff on us and the city? And now you're making Israel even more upset by disrespecting the Sabbath. Seriously?"
Nehemiah,13,19,"And like, this thing happened, right? So, when the sun was setting on the last day of the week, I was like, 'Yo, let's close those gates!' And I made sure nobody opened them until after the day of rest. Then, I assigned some of my peeps to guard the gates and make sure nobody brought in any heavy loads on the day of rest."
Nehemiah,13,20,So the traders and sellers of all kinds of merchandise stayed outside Jerusalem for a night or two.
Nehemiah,13,21,"So I basically called them out, like, 'What are you doing camping near the wall?' If you pull that move again, I'm gonna have to get physical. After that, they never showed up on the Sabbath anymore. (BTW, 'about' here means 'before'.)"
Nehemiah,13,22,"So, I told the Levites to clean up and stand guard at the gates, to make the Sabbath day holy. God, please remember me too and be merciful to me, just like you always are."
Nehemiah,13,23,"So back in the day, I noticed that some Jewish peeps were getting hitched with ladies from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. They were like, fully committed to making a home with them, you know?"
Nehemiah,13,24,"And their kids, like, started talking in this weird Ashdod language and couldn't even speak the same language as the Jews anymore. It was like they adopted the way everyone around them was talkin' instead. It was all mixed up with different languages from different people!"
Nehemiah,13,25,"So I had a serious talk with them, and let out some strong words, and gave a few people a little punch, and pulled their hair, and made them promise to God, saying, 'You better not let your daughters marry their sons, or let your sons marry their daughters, not even for yourself.'"
Nehemiah,13,26,"Yo, did you hear about King Solomon of Israel? Like, he made some mistakes and all, but out of all the kings from all the nations, none were as cool as him. God totally loved him and made him the king of all Israel. But, man, even he got caught up with these foreign women and messed up."
Nehemiah,13,27,"So, like, you're suggesting we actually listen to you and, like, commit this majorly messed up deed by marrying people from different backgrounds, which would totally disrespect our God? No way!"
Nehemiah,13,28,"One of Joiada's sons, who was the son of Eliashib the high priest, happened to be married to Sanballat the Horonite. So, I had no choice but to send him away from me."
Nehemiah,13,29,"Yo, God, don't forget about those peeps who messed up the whole priesthood situation and broke the covenant with the Levites."
Nehemiah,13,30,"So, like, I made sure to get rid of all the outsiders and set up the responsibilities for the priests and Levites based on what they were supposed to do."
Nehemiah,13,31,"And don't forget to bring some firewood and some dope offerings. Also, make sure to give thanks for the first fruits. Yo, God, keep me in mind and bless me, fam."
Esther,1,1,"So, like, back in the day of Ahasuerus, you know, this Ahasuerus dude who was like totally ruling over, like, a massive chunk of land from India all the way to Ethiopia, spanning, like, 127 provinces and stuff."
Esther,1,2,"Back in the day, when King Ahasuerus was all settled on his epic throne ruling his kingdom, which by the way, was located in the super fancy Shushan palace,"
Esther,1,3,"In the third year of his rule, he threw a massive party for all his squad- his peeps from Persia, Media, the VIPs, and the big shots from the provinces- they were all there, turning up together."
Esther,1,4,"When he flexed his mad stacks and the clout of his superior power for, like, a whole 180 days."
Esther,1,5,"And once the time was up, the king threw a massive party for everyone who happened to be in Shushan the palace, including both the important folks and the regular peeps. It lasted seven whole days, in the fancy garden court of the king's palace; {present: Hebrew - found}"
Esther,1,6,"There were cool white, green, and blue drapes, held up by fancy cords made of fine linen and purple, hooked onto shiny silver rings and marble pillars. The beds were all decked out in gold and silver, placed on a floor made of vibrant red, blue, white, and black marble. (You could also call those blue drapes violet, if you want). (Or the floor could be made of porphyre, marble, alabaster, and blue-colored stone)"
Esther,1,7,"And they served them in super fancy gold cups, each cup being unique, and gave them a whole lot of top-notch wine, fit for a king. (like, seriously fancy wine, you know?) It was totally on point with the king's preferences."
Esther,1,8,"And they all followed the rules and drank as they pleased, because the king made it clear to his household that no one should be forced to drink against their will."
Esther,1,9,So Queen Vashti threw this sick party for all the girls at King Ahasuerus' royal crib.
Esther,1,10,"On the chill seventh day, when the king's heart was lit with some fine wine, he straight up told his homies Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas – these seven cool dudes who served Ahasuerus the king, ya feel me? (Side note: those chamberlains were actually eunuchs, just FYI)."
Esther,1,11,"They wanted to bring Queen Vashti to the king, wearing her royal crown, so that the people and the important folks could see how stunning she was. She had a really nice face."
Esther,1,12,"But Queen Vashti straight up denied the king's request from his homies, and the king got mad outraged, his anger was off the charts."
Esther,1,13,"So the king was like, 'Yo, to all the wise peeps who know what's up with the times (because that's how the king rolled with anyone who was knowledgeable about laws and stuff:"
Esther,1,14,"And then there were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the top dogs of Persia and Media. These guys were VIPs who got to chill with the king and had the highest positions in the kingdom. 😎"
Esther,1,15,"So, like, what should we do about Queen Vashti, you know, according to the law and all? 'Cause she totally didn't do what King Ahasuerus commanded through his chamberlains."
Esther,1,16,"Yo, Memucan straight up spoke up in front of the king and the squad, saying that Queen Vashti didn't just disrespect the king but also dissed all the homies, even the peeps from every province under King Ahasuerus."
Esther,1,17,"Like, news about the queen's actions will totally spread everywhere and it'll make all the ladies lose respect for their husbands. It's gonna be like, 'Yo, did you hear? King Ahasuerus asked Queen Vashti to come hang with him, but she straight up said, 'Nah, I'm good.'"
Esther,1,18,"And the girls from Persia and Media are gonna be like, 'OMG, did you hear what the queen did?!' And because of that, there's gonna be so much drama and anger everywhere."
Esther,1,19,"Yo, if the king is cool with it, he should drop a sick command and make sure it gets written down in the official Persian and Mede rulebook. It's gotta be crystal clear that Vashti doesn't step foot in front of King Ahasuerus ever again. And on top of that, the king should give her royal position to someone who's even better. No backing out, no exceptions."
Esther,1,20,"And like, when the king makes a decree and spreads it throughout his whole empire (which, by the way, is like, huge), all the wifey babes gotta show respect to their hubbies, no matter if they're big shots or just regular dudes."
Esther,1,21,"The king and the VIPs thought this idea was awesome, so the king went ahead and did what Memucan suggested."
Esther,1,22,"Like, he sent messages to all the provinces of the king, in each province just the way they talk, and to every group in their own language. The message was all about each person being in charge of their own household and spreading it in the language that everyone understands."
Esther,2,1,"So, like, once everything settled down and King Ahasuerus wasn't super mad anymore, he suddenly remembered this girl named Vashti and all the drama she caused and the consequences she faced."
Esther,2,2,"So, like, the king's dudes who take care of him were all like, 'Yo, we should find some super attractive young girls for the king, you know?"
Esther,2,3,"And the king should choose people in every part of his kingdom to bring all the attractive, young virgin girls to Shushan the palace. They will be taken to the women's quarters under the care of Hege, the king's chamberlain and overseer of the women. They should be given the necessary items for purification."
Esther,2,4,"So, like, the king chose a new queen instead of Vashti. And the king was totally cool with it, so he went ahead and made it happen."
Esther,2,5,"So, in this dope palace in Shushan, there was this Jewish dude named Mordecai. His family tree goes like this: his pops is Jair, his grandpa is Shimei, and his great grandpa is Kish - they're all from the tribe of Benjamin."
Esther,2,6,"Those fam who got taken from Jerusalem as prisoners when Jeconiah, the king of Judah, got captured and taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. {Jeconiah: also known as Jehoiachin}"
Esther,2,7,"And he raised up Hadassah, aka Esther, his uncle's daughter. She didn't have parents and she was an absolute queen - gorgeous and stunning! When her parents passed away, Mordecai adopted her as his own daughter. She was seriously beautiful, both inside and out."
Esther,2,8,"And then, like, when the king's order was heard by everyone and a bunch of girls were brought to this place called Shushan palace under the watch of Hegai, Esther was also taken to the king's crib, under Hegai's watch who was in charge of all the ladies."
Esther,2,9,"And the guy thought the girl was cool, so he was nice to her and quickly gave her all the stuff she needed to get purified. He even picked out seven awesome girls from the king's house to be her friends. He made sure she and her friends had the best spot in the house where the women stayed."
Esther,2,10,Esther kept her people and her relatives a secret because Mordecai told her not to reveal it.
Esther,2,11,So Mordecai would check in every day at the women's house to see how Esther was doing and find out what would happen to her.
Esther,2,12,"So, like, when it was each girl's turn to like, go see king Ahasuerus and all, they had to chill for a whole year beforehand. And during this time, they had to follow this whole beauty routine, you know? For six months, they used myrrh oil and for another six months, they used these sweet-smelling stuff and also other things to make sure they were all purified and clean."
Esther,2,13,"So like, all the girls came to the king, and he gave them whatever they wanted. They could take anything with them from the women's place to the king's crib."
Esther,2,14,"So, like, in the evening she went, and the next day she went back to the second house where all the other ladies were chilling, and this dude named Shaashgaz, who was like the king's right-hand man, was in charge of all the side chicks. From then on, she wasn't allowed to see the king unless he was totally into her, and only if he specifically asked for her by name."
Esther,2,15,"So, it was Esther's turn to hang with the king. She didn't need anything except what Hegai, the guy in charge of the girls, gave her. And guess what? Esther caught everyone's attention and became a total fav!"
Esther,2,16,"So like, Esther got taken to king Ahasuerus' swanky palace crib in the month of Tebeth, which is like December, in the seventh year of his reign."
Esther,2,17,The king was totally obsessed with Esther. She was way cooler than all the other girls and he thought she was the absolute bomb. He was so into her that he even crowned her queen instead of Vashti.
Esther,2,18,"So, like, the king threw this massive party for all his VIPs and staff, just to celebrate Esther and all. He even let the people in the provinces take a break, and he hooked them up with some gifts, you know, based on how rich the king was."
Esther,2,19,"So, like, when all the cool virgins got together again, Mordecai was just chilling at the king's gate, you know."
Esther,2,20,"Esther hadn't revealed her fam or her peeps yet as Mordecai told her to, cuz Esther was loyal to Mordecai, just like when they were tight homies."
Esther,2,21,"So like, back in the day, Mordecai was chilling at the king's gate, right? There were these two chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, who were in charge of guarding the door. But they got mad for some reason, and decided to plan an attack on King Ahasuerus. (By the way, Bigthan is also known as Bigthana, and 'the door' means 'the threshold' in Hebrew.)"
Esther,2,22,"So Mordecai found out about it and told Queen Esther. Then Esther went and let the king know what had happened, using Mordecai's name."
Esther,2,23,"So, like, when they investigated the situation, they totally found out what went down. So, yeah, both of them got hung on a tree, and it was all recorded in the king's history book."
Esther,3,1,"So, like, this king Ahasuerus totally promoted this dude named Haman, right? Like, he gave him a major upgrade and made him higher than all the other important peeps hanging out with him."
Esther,3,2,"And all the dudes working for the king at the entrance were like, 'Yo, Haman, we respect you and all because the king told us to.' But Mordecai wasn't about that, he didn't bow down or show him any respect."
Esther,3,3,"So like, the king's peeps who were chillin' at the king's hangout spot were like, 'Yo Mordecai, why you breakin' the king's rules, dude?'"
Esther,3,4,"So, like, every day they would keep talking to him, but he totally ignored them. They decided to spill the tea to Haman, just to see if Mordecai's plans would hold up. Because Mordecai was keeping it real, letting everyone know he was Jewish."
Esther,3,5,"And when Haman peeped that Mordecai didn't hit the bow or show him respect, Haman got super triggered."
Esther,3,6,"And Haman was totally triggered because Mordecai was getting all the attention, so he decided to go full-on cancel culture and planned to exterminate all the Jews in the kingdom of Ahasuerus, including Mordecai's crew."
Esther,3,7,"In the first month, called Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they rolled Pur, which means the lot, every day and every month, until the twelfth month, known as Adar."
Esther,3,8,"So Haman goes to King Ahasuerus and says, listen up, there's this group of people scattered all over your kingdom, and they have different laws than everyone else. And guess what? They don't even follow your laws, dude. It's not cool, man. Letting them do their own thing is not gonna benefit you at all. Just saying."
Esther,3,9,"Yo king, if you're cool with it, let's write a decree to totally annihilate these guys. And to sweeten the deal, I'm willing to drop ten thousand stacks of silver to the people in charge to make it happen, and add it to your royal cash flow."
Esther,3,10,"So, like, the king was all, 'Yo, Haman, dude, here's my ring,' and he handed it over to this guy Haman, son of Hammedatha the Agagite, who was like, the total enemy of the Jews. Or you could say, the oppressor, if you're into fancy words."
Esther,3,11,"The king was like, 'Hey Haman, here's all this cash and a bunch of peeps. Do whatever you want with them, do your thing.'"
Esther,3,12,"So, like, on the thirteenth day of the first month, the king's scribes were totally summoned. They wrote down everything that Haman had commanded to the king's lieutenants, governors of each province, and rulers of every people in every province, in their own language. This whole thing was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king's ring. Pretty official, ya know?"
Esther,3,13,"So basically, they sent letters all over the place, just like email blasts but without the spam folder. The plan was to wipe out all the Jews, regardless of age or gender, in a single day. Can you believe it? They even set a specific date, like a twisted holiday, the thirteenth of the twelfth month known as Adar, just to make it official. And to top it off, they wanted to take all their stuff as a prize. Talk about heartless!"
Esther,3,14,"The memo with the instructions for everyone in each area went viral, letting everyone know they needed to be prepared for that day."
Esther,3,15,"The king sent out those posts real quick, doing what he told them to do, and the order was made official in the palace of Shushan. Then the king and Haman chilled out and had some drinks, but the people in Shushan were totally confused."
Esther,4,1,"When Mordecai saw everything that happened, he ripped his clothes, put on some sad-looking clothes, and went out into the middle of the city. He cried really loudly with a lot of sadness."
Esther,4,2,"And he went right up to the king's gate, because no one was allowed to enter the king's gate wearing sad clothes."
Esther,4,3,"In like, every single province where the king's orders were followed, there was major sadness among the Jews, with lots of fasting, crying, and mourning. People were even dressing in sackcloth and sitting in ashes, like, a ton of them."
Esther,4,4,"So Esther's maids and her squad came and spilled the tea to her. Then the queen was super upset and she sent some fresh fits to dress up Mordecai and take off his mourning clothes, but he totally refused it. #unbothered"
Esther,4,5,"So Esther hit up Hatach, one of the king's crew who was keeping it real with her, and straight up asked him to find out the deal from Mordecai – like, what's going on and why? The king had put Hatach in charge of taking care of Esther, so she knew he could handle it. No cap."
Esther,4,6,"So Hatach went to Mordecai in the city, right in front of the king's gate."
Esther,4,7,"So basically, Mordecai spills the tea about everything that went down, including how Haman offered up a big bag of cash to the king's treasury in order to wipe out the Jews."
Esther,4,8,"So he gave him a written decree from Shushan, telling him to give it to Esther and explain to her what was going on. He charged her to go to the king and beg for mercy, and to make a request on behalf of her people."
Esther,4,9,So Hatach slid into Esther's DMs and spilled the tea on what Mordecai had to say.
Esther,4,10,Esther spoke to Hatach once more and told him to deliver a message to Mordecai;
Esther,4,11,"Yo, all the homies who work for the king and everyone in his hood needs to know this: if anyone, whether they're a dude or a chick, tries to roll up into the king's private space without an invite, they straight up risking their life. The only way they gon' survive is if the king throws them a golden sceptre as a sign of mercy. But yo, it's been a solid month and I still haven't been invited to kick it with the king."
Esther,4,12,So Mordecai got the tea on what Esther said.
Esther,4,13,"Yo, Mordecai straight up told Esther, don't be thinking you're gonna be safe in the king's crib while all the Jews suffer, fam."
Esther,4,14,"If you stay quiet now, there will be help and freedom for the Jews from somewhere else, but you and your family will suffer destruction. Who knows if you were put in power for a time like this?"
Esther,4,15,"And Esther told Mordecai to come back with this response,"
Esther,4,16,"Yo, gather up all the Jewish peeps in Shushan. We gonna do a major fast for three whole days, no food or drink, day or night. Me and my squad of girls gonna fast too. Then I'm gonna risk it and slide into the king's presence, even though it's against the law. If I die, I die. #YOLO"
Esther,4,17,"So Mordecai was like, 'Bet, I gotchu, Esther!' And he totally did everything Esther told him to do. #loyalty"
Esther,5,1,"So on the third day, Esther dressed up in her fancy clothes and stood in the fancy courtyard of the king's crib, right in front of it. And the king was chilling on his super fancy throne in the pimped-out crib, right by the entrance."
Esther,5,2,"The king totally noticed Queen Esther chilling in the court and thought she was super awesome. He even reached out his golden sceptre to her like, 'You the fav, Esther!' So Esther walked up and tapped the top of the sceptre."
Esther,5,3,"So, the king was like, 'Hey, queen Esther, what's up? What do you want? You can have anything, even half the kingdom.'"
Esther,5,4,"And Esther was like, if the king is down with it, tell him and Haman to come to the lit banquet I got planned for him today."
Esther,5,5,"And the king was like, 'Hurry up, Haman, do what Esther told you to do!' So the king and Haman went to the lit party that Esther had set up."
Esther,5,6,"So the king was like, yo Esther, at this lit wine party, tell me what you want. I gotchu. Like seriously, name your request and I'll make it happen, even if it means giving you half of my whole kingdom."
Esther,5,7,"So Esther responded and said, here's what I'm asking for:"
Esther,5,8,"Yo, if the king thinks I'm cool and he's down to hook me up, then tell him to come chill at the lit banquet I'm throwing. Tomorrow, I'll make sure to do exactly what the king wants. #NailedIt"
Esther,5,9,"So, like, Haman was all hyped and stoked that day, feeling super joyful and pumped up. But when Haman noticed Mordecai in the king's gate, not showing any respect by not getting up or acknowledging him, he got mad AF and totally lost it against Mordecai."
Esther,5,10,"But Haman kept his cool and when he got home, he hit up his squad and summoned his wife, Zeresh. {summoned...: or texted for}"
Esther,5,11,"So Haman flexed on them, bragging about all his mad stacks, his huge squad of kids, and how the king totally recognized his hustle and promoted him to a higher level than all the other bosses and peeps in the kingdom."
Esther,5,12,"Yo, so basically, Haman was all like, 'Yo, check it, Queen Esther didn't let any of the homies come to the banquet she set up with the king, except for me. And, bro, guess what? Tomorrow she's inviting me AGAIN along with the king!'"
Esther,5,13,"But dude, honestly, all this stuff doesn't even matter to me if that Mordecai dude, who's Jewish, keeps sitting at the king's gate."
Esther,5,14,"So, like, Zeresh, Haman's wife, and all his squad were like, 'Yo, let's build, like, a massive fifty-cubit tall gallows, and then tomorrow, you can totally convince the king to hang Mordecai on it. After that, you can, like, party with the king at the banquet.' Haman was totally down with the idea and had the gallows built and stuff. (Gallows means, like, a tree in Hebrew, by the way.)"
Esther,6,1,"That night, the king couldn't sleep, so he was like, 'yo, bring me the book with all the cool stories and stuff.' And they read it to him."
Esther,6,2,"So, like, they found out that Mordecai snitched on these two dudes, Bigthana (or Bigthan, same difference) and Teresh. These guys were chamberlains for King Ahasuerus, you know, and they were plotting to like, attack him or something. Oh, and by the way, the whole 'door' thing in the original Hebrew is actually talking about the threshold. Just a fun fact."
Esther,6,3,"And the king was like, 'Yo, did we even do anything cool to honor Mordecai for this?' Then the king's homies who serve him replied, 'Nah, man, we haven't done anything for him.'"
Esther,6,4,"The king was like, 'Yo, who's out in the court?' So, turns out Haman rolled up to the king's crib, all ready to ask for permission to hang Mordecai on the gallows he set up."
Esther,6,5,"Yo, the king's squad was like, 'Yo, Haman's in the house, dude.' And the king was like, 'Tell that homie to come on in, man.'"
Esther,6,6,"So Haman walked in, and the king asked him, 'Dude, how should we honor someone that I, the king, really dig?' And Haman secretly thought, 'Bro, who else could the king possibly want to honor more than me?'"
Esther,6,7,"Haman was like, 'Yo, King, for real, if there's anyone you're totally vibin' with and wanna give mad props to..."
Esther,6,8,"Yo, bring out the king's drip - his fresh fits, the horse he rides, and that crown that sits on his head."
Esther,6,9,"Yo, get one of the king's top-notch dudes to hook up this sick outfit and a dope ride for the man the king wants to show love to. Then, they'll take him on a lit horse ride through the city streets, with everyone shouting how this is how you honor the man the king vibes with. Oh, and make sure he's riding, not walking – that's what the Hebrew says!"
Esther,6,10,"Then the king was like, 'Yo Haman, hurry up and get the swag and the whip, just like you said, and do exactly that to Mordecai, the Jew, who's chilling at the king's crib. Make sure you don't mess up any of what you said.'"
Esther,6,11,"So, Haman grabbed the swag and the sick ride, and dressed up Mordecai, and flexed on him by parading him on horseback through the city streets, announcing to everyone, 'This is what happens to the dude that the king is totally stoked to honor!'"
Esther,6,12,"So Mordecai went back to the king's gate, but Haman quickly went home, feeling sad and hiding his face."
Esther,6,13,"So Haman spilled all the tea to his wifey Zeresh and his squad about all the bad stuff that went down. Then his crew, along with wifey Zeresh, dropped some truth bombs on him and said, 'If Mordecai is one of them Jewish descendants, who you're already losing to, you ain't gonna come out on top, but you're gonna flop for sure.'"
Esther,6,14,"And while they were still talking with him, the king's peeps rushed to fetch Haman for the lit party that Esther put together."
Esther,7,1,"So, like, the king and Haman totally pulled up to hang with Esther, the queen. And by 'hang', I mean they were there to party and have a good time, you know? #let'sdrink"
Esther,7,2,"And the king was like, 'Yo, Esther, what's up? What do you want, queen Esther? Just name it, and it's yours. Seriously, anything you ask for, even if it's half of my kingdom, I got you.'"
Esther,7,3,"So, Queen Esther was like, 'Hey, King, if you think I'm cool and all, could you pretty please grant me a favor? Spare my life and save my peeps, pretty please?'"
Esther,7,4,"Yo, like, we're totally sold out here. Me and my crew, we're all destined for destruction, to be taken out, and to straight up perish. But if we were just sold as, like, servants and stuff, I would've kept my mouth shut, even though it wouldn't make up for the damage caused to the king by the enemy."
Esther,7,5,"So, like, King Ahasuerus straight up responds to Queen Esther, like, who even dares to think they can do this? Who are they and where can we find them?"
Esther,7,6,"Esther was like, 'Yo, this Haman dude is straight up evil and he's our enemy.' And then Haman got scared AF in front of the king and the queen. Like, literally shook."
Esther,7,7,"So, like, the king got super mad and stormed out of the fancy wine party and went to the palace garden. And Haman, this dude who was in serious trouble, stood up and begged Queen Esther for his life. He knew that the king was planning something bad for him."
Esther,7,8,"So the king came back from the chill palace garden to where the lit party was happening, and there was Haman lying on the same bed where Esther was. The king was like, 'Is this dude gonna go after the queen right in front of me, in my own crib?' Before anyone could say anything, they covered Haman's face and shut him down."
Esther,7,9,"Yo, listen up! Harbonah, one of the king's high-ranking dudes, straight up told the king, 'Check it, bruh! Haman built this massive, 50 cubits tall gallows for Mordecai. And get this, Mordecai had actually done some good stuff for the king!' The gallows were chilling at Haman's crib. So the king was like, 'Yo, hang Haman up on that thing right now!' (By the way, 'gallows' means a tall tree in Hebrew.)"
Esther,7,10,"So they totally roasted Haman on the gallows he set up for Mordecai. And like, the king's anger was totally chilled out."
Esther,8,1,"So, like, on that day, the king Ahasuerus gave Haman's crib (yeah, that dude who hated the Jews) to Queen Esther. And Mordecai, Esther's homie, stepped up to the king 'cause Esther had spilled the tea about who he really was to her."
Esther,8,2,Then the king snatched his ring back from Haman and handed it to Mordecai. And Esther put Mordecai in charge of Haman's crib.
Esther,8,3,"So, like, Esther went up to the king again and totally bowed down at his feet, and, like, begged him with all her tears to, legit, get rid of the wickedness that Haman the Agagite planned against the Jewish people. A total plot, you know?"
Esther,8,4,"Dude, the king totally extends his golden sceptre to Esther. And then Esther gets up and stands in front of the king."
Esther,8,5,"So I went up to the king and said, 'If you're cool with it and you think I'm rad, and this idea seems legit to you and you're feeling me, how about we write a new letter to cancel out the messed up plan that Haman, that dude Hammedatha's son, cooked up to wipe out the Jewish peeps in all your territories? Like, seriously, he even came up with this whole scheme.'"
Esther,8,6,"Like, how am I supposed to handle witnessing all the bad stuff that's gonna happen to my peeps? I mean, seriously, how am I supposed to deal with seeing my fam getting destroyed?"
Esther,8,7,"So, like, the king Ahasuerus was talking to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, and he was all like, check it, I gave Esther the crib of Haman, and you know what? They totally hung him on the gallows because he messed with the Jews!"
Esther,8,8,"Yo, make sure you write to the Jews however you want, using the king's name and seal it with the king's ring. 'Cause once it's written in the king's name and sealed with his ring, no one can change it up."
Esther,8,9,"So, the king's squad of writers were summoned in the third month, know as Sivan, on the twenty-third day. They wrote down everything Mordecai instructed them to write for the Jews, as well as for the leaders and officials of the 127 provinces extending from India to Ethiopia. Each province received a written copy in their own language, tailored to their people, and the Jews were given their own version in their own language."
Esther,8,10,"So, like, he totally composed this letter in the name of King Ahasuerus, yo! And to make it legit, he sealed it with the king's ring, no cap. Then he sent the letter out with swift messengers riding horses, mules, camels, and young dromedaries – total power move, amirite?"
Esther,8,11,"So basically, the king gave the Jewish peeps in every city permission to gather up and defend themselves. They had the green light to wipe out anyone and everyone who wanted to cause them harm, even the kids and the ladies. And they could totally take whatever they wanted from them as a reward."
Esther,8,12,"So like, one day in all the cool provinces of king Ahasuerus, you know, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is, like, the month Adar."
Esther,8,13,"The written commandment was sent to every province, letting everyone know that the Jews should prepare to take revenge on their enemies on that day."
Esther,8,14,"So, like, the messages were, you know, sent out real fast by the king's order. They rode on mules and camels, and it all happened in Shushan, where the palace is, ya get it?"
Esther,8,15,"And Mordecai flexed out of the king's presence, looking all fly in a dope outfit of blue and white. He had this sick crown made of pure gold and was rockin' a fine linen and purple outfit. The whole city of Shushan was lit af and super stoked."
Esther,8,16,"The Jews were living their best lives, feeling lit 🔥 and vibing with happiness 😄, spreading positive energy ✨ and receiving major respect 🙌."
Esther,8,17,"And like, in every province and every city, wherever the king's command and his decree were, the Jews were totally stoked and happy. They threw a lit party and it was a solid day. Plus, a bunch of people who were already living there also joined in and became Jews because they were low-key scared of them."
Esther,9,1,"So like, it was in this month called Adar, specifically on the thirteenth day, when the king's command and decree were about to be carried out. It was the day that the enemies of the Jews thought they'd finally have power over them. But guess what? Totally backfired! Instead, it was the Jews who ended up having control over their haters. Epic plot twist, right?"
Esther,9,2,"The Jews were like, 'Let's meet up in our cities across the king Ahasuerus' provinces and take care of anyone who wants to harm us.' And no one could even think of standing up against them cuz everyone was totally terrified of them."
Esther,9,3,"Like, all the big shots in the different provinces, and the important guys working for the king, totally had the Jews' back because they were hella scared of Mordecai. These were the peeps in charge of handling the king's business, by the way."
Esther,9,4,"Mordecai was like, super popular in the king's crib, and word about him spread across all the provinces. This dude Mordecai just kept leveling up and getting even more awesome."
Esther,9,5,"So, like, the Jews totally demolished all their enemies with their swords and, like, annihilated them and stuff. They did whatever they wanted to those who hated them. #Savage 🗡️"
Esther,9,6,"So, in the palace of Shushan, the Jews straight up took out and demolished five hundred dudes."
Esther,9,7,"And like, Parshandatha, Dalphon, and Aspatha,"
Esther,9,8,"And like, there's Poratha, Adalia, and Aridatha, you know?"
Esther,9,9,"And like, there were these cool dudes named Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha,"
Esther,9,10,"So, like, the ten sons of Haman, who totally hated the Jews, they straight up wiped them out. But get this, they didn't even touch their loot, man."
Esther,9,11,"Yo, on that day, they told the king how many people got wrecked in Shushan the palace. Just keeping him in the loop, you know?"
Esther,9,12,"So, like, the king was talking to Queen Esther and he was all like, 'Yo, the Jews totally wrecked five hundred dudes in the palace at Shushan, including Haman's ten sons. So, like, what did they do in the rest of my kingdom? What do you want, girl? Just tell me and I'll make it happen. Anything else you want, just ask and consider it done.'"
Esther,9,13,"So, like, Esther was, like, talking to the king and she was all like, 'Hey, if it's cool with you, can the Jews in Shushan have, like, another day to deal with their enemies? Oh, and by the way, we should totally hang Haman's ten sons on the gallows too. It's only fair, ya know?'"
Esther,9,14,"So like, the king totally ordered it and stuff: they were like, 'yeah, it's going down,' in Shushan. And they straight-up hung Haman's ten sons, no joke."
Esther,9,15,"So, like, all the Jewish peeps in Shushan got together on the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and, yo, they straight up took down three hundred dudes in Shushan. But, like, they didn't even touch the loot though."
Esther,9,16,"But all the other Jews in the king's regions joined forces, stood up for themselves, and found peace from their enemies. They defeated seventy-five thousand of their foes, but didn't take any spoils."
Esther,9,17,"On the 13th day of the super lit month called Adar, and on the 14th day they took a chill pill and made it a day of epic feasting and total happiness. {in it: which means it was pretty awesome}"
Esther,9,18,"So, like, all the Jewish peeps in Shushan got together on the thirteenth and fourteenth of the month. Then, on the fifteenth, they took a break and turned it into a total celebration, full of yummy food and good vibes."
Esther,9,19,"So, like, the Jewish peeps who lived in the chill little towns celebrated big time on the fourteenth day of Adar. It was legit a day of pure joy, feasting, and just spreading the love by sending each other some special treats."
Esther,9,20,"So Mordecai penned this message and sent out DMs to all the Jewish peeps across the entire kingdom of King Ahasuerus, no matter how close or far they were."
Esther,9,21,"So basically, they needed to make it a thing to celebrate the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar every year."
Esther,9,22,"Like, back in the days, the Jews totally chilled out from their haters. And this one month went from being a total bummer to a legit awesome time. They decided to throw massive parties and spread major happiness. Everyone shared delicious food with each other and gave cool gifts to those in need."
Esther,9,23,"So, the Jews were all like, totally down to what they had planned, just as Mordecai had told them to do;"
Esther,9,24,"So this guy Haman, son of Hammedatha, who hated all the Jews, had this wicked plan to wipe them out. He threw this thing called Pur, which is like a lottery, to choose a time to crush them and annihilate them."
Esther,9,25,"But when Esther approached the king, he sent out a message to make sure that all the evil plans he had plotted against the Jews would backfire on him instead. As a consequence, he and his sons ended up getting hanged on the very gallows he set up. (by letters means through messages)"
Esther,9,26,"That's why they named these days Purim, after Pur. So, basically, this letter explained everything that went down and what they witnessed, you know? And it's all about this thing called Pur, which is like, another name for Lot."
Esther,9,27,"The Jews were like, 'Okay guys, let's make it official. We're gonna celebrate these two days every year, and this is gonna include all of us, our kids, and anyone who wants to join us. It's gonna be written down and everything. And trust us, we're not gonna miss out on this, it's gonna happen like clockwork.'"
Esther,9,28,"And it's super important to remember and celebrate these days, like, forever and ever - every generation, every fam, every city, and every spot. We can't let Purim go away from us Jews, like, never ever, and we totally can't forget about it or let it disappear from future generations. That would be so not cool."
Esther,9,29,"So Queen Esther, who's Abihail's daughter, and Mordecai the Jew, they were like in charge and stuff, and they wrote this totally legit second letter about Purim to make sure everyone knows what's up. #bossmove #official"
Esther,9,30,"And he DM'd all the Jewish homies, in like a hundred and twenty-seven different provinces of Ahasuerus' kingdom, with a message of peace and realness."
Esther,9,31,"To keep celebrating Purim during the right time, just like Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther told them to, and as they had decided for themselves and their descendants, with all the fasting and crying that was involved."
Esther,9,32,So Esther made it official and wrote down the details of Purim in the book.
Esther,10,1,"So, like, King Ahasuerus placed this thing called a tribute on the land, you know, and also on the cool islands in the sea."
Esther,10,2,"Yo, all the epic stuff that King Mordecai did and how he totally leveled up, I'm talking about all his epic power moves and how he became a legend, you can read about it in the super cool history book of the Media and Persia kings. They were totally impressed by him and made him a big deal. It's all there, no cap!"
Esther,10,3,"Mordecai, the Jew, was basically homies with King Ahasuerus, and he was a big deal among the Jews. Everyone respected him and he always had his peoples' back, working to make them richer and spreading harmony to his descendants."
Job,1,1,"So, there was this dude named Job in the land of Uz, and let me tell you, he was the real deal. Like, he was all about being righteous and straight-up decent. He had mad respect for God and steered clear of anything shady."
Job,1,2,"And he had, like, seven sons and three daughters, ya know?"
Job,1,3,"This guy had, like, 7000 sheep, 3000 camels, 500 pairs of oxen, and 500 she-asses. And not to mention, he had a massive crew and was basically the most successful dude in the entire east."
Job,1,4,"So, like, his sons went and had lit parties at their crib, each one on their own day. And they hit up their three sisters to come through and grub and chillax with them."
Job,1,5,"So, like, after the fam were done with their big parties, Job was all like, 'yo, I gotta make sure my kids are legit.' So he sent them to get sanctified, and woke up super early the next day to offer burnt offerings for each one of them. Job was like, 'You never know, maybe my kids messed up and cursed God secretly in their hearts.' And he did this on the reg, like, all the time."
Job,1,6,"So, like, one day the squad of heaven's fam came to chill with the big man upstairs, and even Satan showed up with them. (BTW, Satan means like 'the adversary' and he was, you know, hanging out right there in the mix.)"
Job,1,7,"And God was like, 'Yo Satan, where you been at?' And Satan was like, 'Bruh, I've been roaming the earth, just taking my casual strolls and stuff.'"
Job,1,8,"So, God was like, yo Satan, have you ever checked out Job? He's seriously one of a kind on this planet, a total legend. He's a stand-up guy who respects God and avoids anything sketchy. Have you even given him any thought?"
Job,1,9,"And then Satan, like, replied to the LORD, and was like, 'Does Job just praise God for nothing?'"
Job,1,10,"Like, haven't you totally like put up a protective shield around him and his crib and all his stuff? You've blessed everything he does, and he's getting mad stacks of cash. #blessed"
Job,1,11,"But go ahead, touch everything he owns, and he'll totally diss you to your face. {and he...: If he doesn't diss you to your face}"
Job,1,12,"And God was like, 'Yo Satan, check it out. Everything this guy has is in your control, but don't mess with him personally, okay?' So Satan bounced from God's presence, respectin' his boundaries and all. (By the way, the Hebrew word for 'control' here is handd'.)"
Job,1,13,So there was a time when his siblings were having a lit feast with wine at their older bro's crib:
Job,1,14,"So, like, this messenger comes up to Job and is like, 'Dude, I saw the oxen doing their plowing thing and the donkeys chilling and eating right next to 'em.'"
Job,1,15,"And then these Sabeans showed up, totally attacking and snatching them away. It was brutal, man. They straight up killed all the servants with their swords. And guess what? I'm the only one left alive to tell you about it."
Job,1,16,"While he was still talking, another person showed up and said, 'Dude, God's fire just rained down from the sky and totally torched all the sheep and the servants. They're all gone, man. I'm the only one left, and I came to give you the low-down.'"
Job,1,17,"While he was still talking, another person showed up and said, 'Dude, the Chaldeans totally attacked in three groups and ambushed our camels. They straight up took them all, and to make matters worse, they killed the poor workers with their swords. It's crazy, man. I'm the only one who managed to escape, and I came here just to let you know.'"
Job,1,18,"And just as he was talking, another person came and said, 'Dude, your kids were totally chillin' and having a blast, eating good food and sippin' wine at your oldest son's crib:'"
Job,1,19,"Yo, check it! So, outta nowhere, this crazy huge wind came from the wilderness and straight up wrecked the whole house. And get this, it fell right on top of the young dudes and, yup, they're toast now. It's just me, the sole survivor, here to spill the tea and let you know what went down. {from...: Hebrew means like, off to the side, ya know?}"
Job,1,20,"So Job stood up, tore his cool clothes, shaved his head, and completely hit the floor. And he was like, 'Yo, praise vibes.'"
Job,1,21,"I was born with nothing, and I'll go back with nothing: whatever God gives, He can take back. Praise the Lord no matter what."
Job,1,22,"Throughout all of this, Job did not sin or disrespect God with foolish accusations."
Job,2,1,"Once again, there was a day when the squad rolled up to flex on the LORD, and even Satan joined in to flex on the LORD too."
Job,2,2,"God asked Satan, 'Where have you been?' And Satan replied, 'Just roaming around the earth, exploring every nook and cranny.'"
Job,2,3,"And God was like, 'Yo Satan, have you seen my guy Job? He's like one in a million, a straight-up legend. He's always repping me, avoiding all the bad stuff, and keeping it real. Even though you tried to mess him up for no reason, he's still holding it down and staying true to himself.'"
Job,2,4,"So, Satan replied to the LORD and was like, 'Bro, people will do anything to save their own skin. They'll give up everything they've got just to stay alive, ya know.'"
Job,2,5,"But like, go ahead and put your hand on his body, you'll see that he'll totally curse you straight to your face."
Job,2,6,"And God was like, 'Yo, Satan, check it out, you can mess with him, but don't mess with his life, alright? Just sayin'."
Job,2,7,So Satan bounced out of God's presence and totally wrecked Job with some gnarly boils from head to toe.
Job,2,8,"Then he grabbed a broken piece of pottery to scrape his skin with, and plopped down amongst the dusty remains."
Job,2,9,"His wife said to him, 'Are you seriously still holding onto your values? Just give up, man, and let go of your faith.'"
Job,2,10,"But he was like, 'Girl, you talking nonsense right now. Seriously though, should we only expect good things from God and not any hardships? Job didn't even sin by saying all this."
Job,2,11,"So, like, when Job's three friends caught wind of all the terrible stuff that happened to him, they all rolled up from their own hood. We got Eliphaz from Teman, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar from Naamath. They had actually planned to meet up and support Job through his tough times."
Job,2,12,"And when they looked from a distance and didn't recognize him, they cried out loud and started crying. They tore their clothes and threw dust on their heads towards the sky."
Job,2,13,"So they were like, chilling with him for a whole week, not saying anything, just sitting on the ground. They totally saw how devastated he was, so they didn't wanna disturb him or anything."
Job,3,1,Then Job went off and started venting about how much his day sucked.
Job,3,2,"So Job was like, 'Listen up, y'all. I've got something to say...' 💬"
Job,3,3,"OMG, I wish the day I was born and the night when people found out I was a baby dude never even existed! 🙅‍♂️"
Job,3,4,"Just make that day all dark and stuff, like, don't even let God pay attention to it up in the sky, and don't let any light shine on it, ya know?"
Job,3,5,"Yo, let darkness and the shadow of death totally mess it up; let a cloud just hover over it; let the blackness of the day straight up scare it. {stain: or, challenge} {let the...: or, let them scare it, like those who are having a super sucky day}"
Job,3,6,"For that night, let the darkness take over; may it not be counted among the rest of the year or the months. Let it not find joy in the passing days."
Job,3,7,"Yo, make that night super lonely, like, no happy vibes allowed."
Job,3,8,"Like, those haters who be cursing the day, you know? They're all about spreading their sadness. {their...: or, like a leviathan}"
Job,3,9,"When evening comes, may the stars fade away into darkness, with no hope of light. May the night remain, veiling the promise of a new day, like the drowsy lids of the morning."
Job,3,10,Because it didn't close the doors of my mom's womb and didn't hide the pain from my eyes.
Job,3,11,Why didn't I just die at birth? Why couldn't I have just peacefully passed away when I was born?
Job,3,12,Why were my knees in the way? Why were my breasts there to nurse?
Job,3,13,"If I had just chilled and stayed quiet, I would've knocked out and been hella peaceful."
Job,3,14,"Chillin' with all these royal homies and earth's wise peeps, who be constructing some sick empty spaces just for themselves."
Job,3,15,"Or with influencers flexing their drip, who filled their mansions with stacks of cash:"
Job,3,16,"Like, I could've just not existed, like a secret miscarriage, you know? Like those babies who never got to see the light of day."
Job,3,17,"That's the place where haters stop causing drama, and tired peeps can finally chill. (tired: like, totally exhausted in every way)"
Job,3,18,"In that place, the prisoners chill together; they don't even hear the voice of their haters."
Job,3,19,"Everyone's invited, no matter their status; even the peeps who usually have a boss get a break."
Job,3,20,Why do they give light to someone who's suffering and life to someone filled with bitterness?
Job,3,21,"They're like, sooo desperate for death, but it's like, not happening, you know? They're literally digging around for it like searching for hidden treasures. Like, super impatient. (BTW, 'long' means 'wait' in Hebrew, just sayin'.)"
Job,3,22,"They're super stoked and happy when they discover where the heck the burial ground is, like, seriously."
Job,3,23,"Like, why is light even given to a person when their path is like, totally hidden and God has them fenced in?"
Job,3,24,"Before chowing down, I can't help but let out a heavy sigh, and my loud outbursts are like a never-ending flood. (I eat: In other words, while I'm about to eat my food)"
Job,3,25,"Dude, what I was so scared of? It just happened, man! That thing I was freaking out about? Well, it's here now, bro! #unfortunate"
Job,3,26,"I was like, totally not living my best life - no safety, no chill, no actual peace - and then BAM, trouble showed up outta nowhere. 🙃"
Job,4,1,"And Eliphaz, the Temanite, replied,"
Job,4,2,"If we try to talk to you, will you be upset? But seriously, who can keep themselves from speaking? Like, it's almost impossible to stay silent, you know? So, can we just, like, have a conversation?"
Job,4,3,"Yo, check it out. You've been teaching so many peeps and empowering those who needed a boost."
Job,4,4,"Your words have been there for someone when they were down, and you've given strength to those feeling weak."
Job,4,5,"But like, now it's happening to you and you're feeling exhausted; it's affecting you and you're all stressed out."
Job,4,6,"Isn't this what you're all about - being real, feeling secure, holding onto hope, and staying true to who you are?"
Job,4,7,"Yo, like, think about it, has anyone, like, totally disappeared without doing anything wrong? Or have the righteous ever been, like, unfairly taken out?"
Job,4,8,"Like, I've totally observed how those who do messed up stuff and spread negativity end up dealing with its consequences, man."
Job,4,9,"God totally obliterates them, like with a sick gust of air and his furious vibes. Like, his anger is straight-up lethal."
Job,4,10,"Bruh, that lion be like ROAR and stuff, but guess what? It's straight up wrecked! Teeth of them young lions? CRACKED. Game over, man."
Job,4,11,"The OG lion can't survive 'cause it can't find food, and the fierce lion's babies are all over the place now."
Job,4,12,"So, like, someone came up to me on the down-low, and I kinda overheard a bit of their secret talk. {secretly: you know, like, they were sneaky about it}"
Job,4,13,"When it's late at night and we're all knocked out in a deep sleep,"
Job,4,14,"I was totally scared and shaking, like my bones were doing a crazy dance. It was intense, like a whole crowd going wild!"
Job,4,15,"And suddenly, this creepy vibe came over me, like a ghost just floated by and I was totally shook. My whole body got full-on goosebumps, man!"
Job,4,16,"Yo, it just stopped right there, but I couldn't really see what it looked like. There was like an image in front of me, everything got quiet, and then I heard this voice, you know. And the voice was all like, 'Listen up...'"
Job,4,17,"Like, can humans seriously be more righteous than God? Can we even be more pure than the one who made us?"
Job,4,18,"Yo, he didn't even trust his own crew; he even called out his angels for doing dumb sh*t: (or, he didn't trust his angels, the ones he gave the spotlight)"
Job,4,19,"Like, imagine how much smaller that is compared to peeps who live in houses made of clay. Their whole deal is built on the ground, and they can get totally squashed in no time at all, like a moth just comes and wrecks them."
Job,4,20,"They're totally wrecked from daybreak till dusk, completely wiped out with nobody giving it a second thought. Like, obliterated to the extreme level, ya know?"
Job,4,21,"Like, dude, their awesomeness like totally vanishes, they totally bite the dust even with zero wisdom."
Job,5,1,"Hit them up ASAP, if anyone's gonna respond; who you gonna hit up from the squad? {or should I say, peep?}"
Job,5,2,"Getting all worked up kills the clueless person, and being jealous takes down the silly one. {envy: or, indignation}"
Job,5,3,"Yo, I've witnessed idiots getting comfortable and establishing themselves, but out of nowhere I just ended up dissing where they live."
Job,5,4,"His kids are totally not safe, and they're getting wrecked at the gate, with absolutely no one to rescue them."
Job,5,5,"When the hungry devour the crops grown by another, picking through obstacles to take it all, and the thief consumes their belongings."
Job,5,6,"Yo, listen up! Troubles don't just randomly pop outta nowhere, and problems ain't sprouting from the ground, ya feel me?"
Job,5,7,"But life is always a struggle for humans, like sparks shooting up into the sky."
Job,5,8,"I'd totally hit up God, and like, entrust all my stuff to Him, ya know?"
Job,5,9,"Yo, this dude be out here doing some crazy awesome stuff that you can't even wrap your head around. Like, seriously mind-blowing stuff that you can't count because there's just so much of it. No cap, it's like you can't even search up and find all the amazing things he's done because they're beyond our understanding. And it's not like you can put a number on it, I mean, it's just endless. Um, yeah, it's pretty insane, bro."
Job,5,10,Who makes it rain on the earth and sends water on the outplaces.
Job,5,11,To lift up those who are down; so that those who are sad can find comfort and security.
Job,5,12,"God foils the plans of the sneaky, making it impossible for them to carry out what they intended. (or anything)"
Job,5,13,"God totally catches the smart ones off guard with their own cleverness, and the stubborn ones will totally get tripped up by their own bad advice."
Job,5,14,"They be clueless during the day, and wander aimlessly in broad daylight as if it were nighttime. {meet...: or, run into}"
Job,5,15,"He saves the strugglers from getting wrecked, from their own words, and from the grip of the powerful."
Job,5,16,"So like, the struggling ones find hope, and wickedness is silenced."
Job,5,17,"Yo, listen up. The dude who gets corrected by God is blessed, so don't diss His discipline, alright?"
Job,5,18,"Because like, he totally takes care of us when we're hurting, you know? He heals our wounds and brings us back to full strength with his hands."
Job,5,19,"He's got your back through six tough times, and not even in the seventh will any bad stuff come near you."
Job,5,20,"When things get tough and you're facing hunger and danger, God's got your back. He'll save you from death caused by famine, and protect you from the violence and harm in times of war. #DivineRescue"
Job,5,21,You won't have to worry about the haters talking smack about you or be scared when trouble comes your way.
Job,5,22,"You'll totally crack up when disaster and hunger come your way, and you won't even sweat the wild beasts that roam the earth. No fear, fam!"
Job,5,23,"Dude, even the rocks will dig you, and the wild creatures will be totally chill with you, bro."
Job,5,24,"And you gotta vibe with the fact that your chill spot will be all peaceful, and you'll totally hang out at your crib and stay away from doing anything sketchy. #goodvibesonly"
Job,5,25,"Just so you know, your fam is gonna be huge, and your descendants will be like a ton of grass on the ground. They'll be poppin' off, yo. #blessed"
Job,5,26,"You'll peacefully rest in the grave when you're old, like a bountiful harvest in its perfect timing."
Job,5,27,"Listen up! We've totally investigated this thing, so pay attention and take it to heart because it's gonna be beneficial for you, ya feel me?"
Job,6,1,"But yo, Job stepped up and was like,"
Job,6,2,"I wish someone could really understand and measure the weight of my pain and the chaos I'm going through! {lifted up: Hebrew meaning, properly evaluated}"
Job,6,3,"Right now, it's like a ton of bricks, even heavier than the whole beach. That's why I can't even find the right words. (And trust me, I really want to express how crushed I feel.)"
Job,6,4,"Bruh, it feels like I've been hit by God's arrows, and this poison is literally draining my energy. The freaky terrors from God are like attacking me head-on, no cap."
Job,6,5,Does the wild donkey make noise when it has some grub? Or does the ox moo over its meal?
Job,6,6,"Like, why would you even try to eat something that tastes so bland without seasoning? And seriously, is there even any flavor in plain egg whites?"
Job,6,7,The stuff that I totally avoided handling is like my super sad meal.
Job,6,8,"Man, I really hope my wish comes true and that God fulfills my deepest desire! Like, I'm just so stoked and hopeful for it, you know? #ExpectingIt"
Job,6,9,"Like, I seriously wish God would just obliterate me, you know? I mean, if He could totally let go and zip me out of existence!"
Job,6,10,"Honestly, if I could find any sorta solace, I'd totally lean into my sadness. Don't even hold back, 'cause I've been real with the words of the Almighty."
Job,6,11,"Like, what's the point of me having any strength or having any hope? And like, what's the deal with me thinking about how my life will turn out in the end?"
Job,6,12,Is my strength as solid as rocks? Or is my flesh literally made of metal?
Job,6,13,"Like, isn't my help, like, totally within me? And, like, has wisdom completely, like, vanished from me?"
Job,6,14,"When someone's going through a tough time, their friend should totally show them some compassion and support. But it's such a bummer when they forget to respect the big guy upstairs. Like, don't ditch your faith, dude."
Job,6,15,"Yo, my squad be out here fakin' it like those brooks, flowin' for a while and then vanishin' like streams."
Job,6,16,"They're like super dark because of the ice, and the snow is all covered up in there:"
Job,6,17,"When things start to heat up, they disappear; when it gets really hot, they are completely wiped out."
Job,6,18,"Bruh, they straight up losing their way, endin' up in absolute nothingness and straight up vanishin'."
Job,6,19,"The crew from Tema peeped, while the squad from Sheba stayed on hold for them."
Job,6,20,"They were so embarrassed because they had high expectations; they went there, and they ended up feeling totally humiliated."
Job,6,21,"Right now, you feel small and helpless, witnessing my downfall, and it freaks you out. You're basically like them, just a bunch of zeros. #NotFeelingIt"
Job,6,22,"Did I actually say, 'Bring it all to me'? or, 'Give me stuff as a bribe'?"
Job,6,23,"Like, can you, like, get me out of the enemy's grip? or, save me from those powerful peeps?"
Job,6,24,Educate me and I'll zip it: help me grasp where I messed up.
Job,6,25,"Yo, using the right words can be super powerful! But like, what's the point of all your arguing, ya know?"
Job,6,26,Do you seriously think you can criticize someone's words and desperate conversations as if they're just pointless?
Job,6,27,"Like, seriously, you're totally making life hard for the fatherless and plotting against your own homies. Not cool, dude. #betrayal"
Job,6,28,"So like, just chill out and hear me out; you can totally tell if I'm lying or not. It's, like, right in front of you."
Job,6,29,"Hey, come back and listen up, don't go down the wrong path; yeah, turn around and rethink, my integrity is at stake here. (in this matter: meaning, in this situation)"
Job,6,30,"Does my tongue speak evil? Can't I tell when something's messed up? {my taste: literally, my palate}"
Job,7,1,"Yo, isn't there like a set time for us humans on this earth? Don't our days just feel like we're on some gig worker grind? Like, it's a battle out here, man."
Job,7,2,"Just like a gig worker looks forward to their paycheck, and a servant craves some downtime,"
Job,7,3,"So, like, I'm stuck dealing with meaningless months and, OMG, I have to endure these totally exhausting nights."
Job,7,4,"When I'm about to hit the sack, I'm like, 'When will I get up and the night be over?' I toss and turn all night long until morning comes. Like, seriously, how long is this nighttime gonna last?"
Job,7,5,"Bruh, my body's like covered in worms and dirt particles; my skin's all messed up and looking hella gross."
Job,7,6,"My life goes by faster than a TikTok video, and it feels like there's no light at the end of the tunnel."
Job,7,7,"Yo, just a reminder that my life is like, a total breeze - like, it's here one moment and gone the next, ya know? Like, I won't even be able to enjoy the good stuff anymore, my eyes won't even see it again. #noreturnsies #nojoydays"
Job,7,8,"The person who has seen me won't see me again: you're looking at me, but I'm not here anymore. I can't exist any longer."
Job,7,9,"Like, you know how a cloud just disappears and poof, it's gone? Well, that's how it is when someone, like, goes down to the grave... they won't be coming back, no more."
Job,7,10,"Once he leaves, he won't come back home again, and no one will recognize him anymore."
Job,7,11,"So, like, I'm not gonna hold back, y'know? I'm gonna speak up 'cause my heart is heavy and I gotta let it out. I'm gonna express my frustration 'cause my soul is hurting, man."
Job,7,12,"Am I like, a whole ocean, or like, a giant whale, that you're like, keeping an eye on me or something?"
Job,7,13,"When I'm like, 'Yo, my bed's gonna give me mad comfort, and my couch is gonna help me deal with my struggles;'}"
Job,7,14,"You like, totally give me mad nightmares and freak me out with your mind-blowing visions:"
Job,7,15,"Ugh, I'm so over it. I'd legit rather die than keep going like this. Like, my soul can't handle it anymore, it's suffocating. Life feels bleh, like a total downer. #MentalHealthMatters"
Job,7,16,I'm so over {it}; can't deal with living forever: just leave me alone; my days are totally pointless.
Job,7,17,"Bruh, like, why you gotta make such a big deal out of us humans? Why you even care so much about us?"
Job,7,18,"Ugh, you expect to check up on him every single morning and constantly test him? Like seriously?"
Job,7,19,"Yo, like, how much longer u gonna stick around and not leave me alone? It feels like forever, man, can't even finish swallowing my spit without you bugging me."
Job,7,20,"Yo, I messed up. What should I do to make things right with you, the one who looks out for us? Why did you make me a target, feeling like I'm going against you and just weighing myself down?"
Job,7,21,"Yo, why aren't you forgiving my mistakes and wiping away my wrongdoings? 'Cause I'm 'bout to snooze in the ground, and when morning comes, you won't find me, fam."
Job,8,1,"So, like, Bildad the Shuhite spoke up and was all like,"
Job,8,2,"Dude, why you gotta keep blabbering like that? And seriously, how long are you gonna let your words blow through the air like a savage gust of wind?"
Job,8,3,"Bruh, does God mess with justice? Or does the Almighty mess with fairness?"
Job,8,4,If your squad has messed up and got canceled for their mistakes; because they couldn't handle their bad vibes.
Job,8,5,If you wanna hit up God early on and slide into the Almighty's DMs with your prayers;
Job,8,6,"If you were totally pure and righteous, for real though, God would totally notice and bless everything you do righteously."
Job,8,7,"Even though you started off small, you're gonna level up big time in the future."
Job,8,8,"Yo, like, go ahead and dig into the past, I'm talking ancient times, and start researching what our ancestors were up to, ya know?"
Job,8,9,"Because we're basically clueless and our time on earth is like a fleeting shadow, since we're just here for a hot minute and don't know squat."
Job,8,10,"Won't they, like, school you, and spill the tea, and speak from their hearts?"
Job,8,11,"Like, can a plant grow without soil? Can a cool flag grow without water?"
Job,8,12,"Before it even gets a chance to grow and flourish, it wilts away like any other plant."
Job,8,13,"Yo, peeps who straight up forget about God, their lives be all messed up and fake AF hope ain't gonna last."
Job,8,14,Those who have no hope and rely on flimsy things like a spider's web will be disappointed.
Job,8,15,"He'll rely on his crib, but it won't last: he'll cling to it, but it won't survive."
Job,8,16,"He's flexin' his greenness in the sunlight, and his branch be growin' strong in his garden."
Job,8,17,"His roots are all tangled up around the pile, and he totally checks out the spot where all the rocks are at."
Job,8,18,"If he's like, yeeting him from his turf, then he'll be ghosted, like 'Nah bro, never seen ya.'"
Job,8,19,"Yo, listen up! This is the lit vibe of his journey, and from the earth, others shall emerge."
Job,8,20,"Yo, check it out! God doesn't ditch a flawless person, and He ain't gonna support the wrongdoers either. He ain't gonna be giving the ungodly any handouts!"
Job,8,21,"Until he makes you crack up and your lips are full of hype. {shouting for joy: in other words, like total excitement}"
Job,8,22,"Those who despise you will be humiliated, and the wicked won't have a place to call their own anymore."
Job,9,1,"And Job was like, 'Hold up, lemme drop some wisdom on y'all'"
Job,9,2,"I totally get that this is true, but, like, how can us humans be all righteous in front of God?"
Job,9,3,"If someone tries to argue with him, they won't be able to come up with even one good response out of a thousand."
Job,9,4,"He's like super wise and mad strong, you know? Who even tries to go against him and thinks they'll succeed? Like, really?"
Job,9,5,"Like, this dude be taking mountains away and they're like, whaaat? And then he's all like, flipping them over 'cause he's mad."
Job,9,6,When the earth starts shaking like crazy and its foundations start freaking out.
Job,9,7,"Like, God totally tells the sun not to rise and hides the stars."
Job,9,8,"The one who expands the sky all by themselves and walks on the huge waves of the sea. {waves: in Hebrew, it means heights}"
Job,9,9,"The one who creates cool constellations like Arcturus, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the rad rooms in the southern sky. (Yo, Arcturus... in Hebrew it's Ash, Cesil, and Cimah)"
Job,9,10,"Like, this guy does mad epic things that are like, totally mind-blowing and impossible to even comprehend, like seriously, there's no limit to the insane stuff he can do."
Job,9,11,"Yo, he's like right there, but I can't even see him. He just keeps going, but I can't really tell."
Job,9,12,"Yo, check it out, when he decides to do something, who's gonna stand in his way? Like, who's gonna be all like, 'Hey, what are you even doing?'"
Job,9,13,"Yo, if God keeps being mad, those cocky homies who think they're all that will totally crumble before him. #ProudBoisGotNoChance"
Job,9,14,"Like, seriously, how am I supposed to come up with anything clever to say when it comes to talking with Him?"
Job,9,15,"Even if I was completely blameless, I wouldn't try to defend myself. Instead, I would humbly plead my case to the one who judges me."
Job,9,16,Imagine I reached out and he actually replied; even then I would struggle to trust that he truly listened to what I had to say.
Job,9,17,He totally wrecked me with a crazy storm and gave me so many scars for no reason at all.
Job,9,18,"He won't let me catch a break, always overwhelming me with bitterness."
Job,9,19,"Yo, like, if I talk about being strong, you gotta admit, I'm pretty powerful. And when it comes to making judgments, who's gonna be able to challenge me and set a specific time for me to defend myself?"
Job,9,20,"If I try to defend myself, I'll only end up criticizing myself: if I claim I'm flawless, it'll actually show that I'm messed up."
Job,9,21,"Even if I were flawless, I wouldn't understand myself. I would totally hate my life."
Job,9,22,"Like, this is something I gotta say, you know? God doesn't play favorites and He punishes both the good and the bad."
Job,9,23,"If something bad happens out of nowhere, it's messed up that it's funny how the innocent have to go through hell."
Job,9,24,"Bruh, like, the wicked totally got control of the earth. They be hiding the true faces of the judges, no cap. Like, if they didn't, then who else could it be?"
Job,9,25,"My days zoom by faster than a speeding text: they vanish in the blink of an eye, without a glimmer of positivity."
Job,9,26,"They zoomed by like speedy ships, just like an eagle swooping down for its meal. #FastAndFurious #EagleEyed"
Job,9,27,"If I'm like, okay, I'm gonna ditch my venting session, drop my moodiness, and find some self-care vibes:"
Job,9,28,"I'm freaking out about all this pain, I know you won't let me off the hook."
Job,9,29,"Like, if I'm being all wicked and stuff, then why am I even bothering to grind?"
Job,9,30,"Like, even if I use friggin' snow water to wash myself and scrub my hands until they're spotless;"
Job,9,31,"But you would totally throw me in that drama and even my own swag would be like 'nah, I'm out'. {abhor...: or, make me to be hated}"
Job,9,32,He's not just some human like me who I can argue with and judge together.
Job,9,33,There's no neutral mediator between us who could understand both sides and bring us together.
Job,9,34,"I don't want him to discipline me, and I hope he doesn't scare me with his fear:"
Job,9,35,"If only I could speak without feeling intimidated, but that's just not the case for me. I'm not in that headspace right now."
Job,10,1,"I'm so done with my life; I'm just gonna vent and let it all out, speaking from the depths of my soul. #feelingoverit"
Job,10,2,"Yo, God, don't be all judgy on me. Just let me know why you got beef with me, ya feel?"
Job,10,3,"Do you actually think it's cool to bully and look down on what you've created, just to support the ideas of people who do wicked things?"
Job,10,4,"Bruh, can you even see like a regular human or what?"
Job,10,5,"Yo, how long you livin' for? You on that human time or what?"
Job,10,6,So you really wanna dig into my wrongdoings and hunt down my mistakes?
Job,10,7,"You know I ain't evil and nobody can escape from your grasp. It's all on your radar, boss."
Job,10,8,"Dude, you totally created and put me together, like 360 degrees around. But now you're about to wreck me, why though?"
Job,10,9,"Yo, just a quick reminder, yo! You created me like clay, you feel? And now you're gonna bring me back to dust? Like, what's up with that?"
Job,10,10,"Bruh, you straight up treated me like milk, but then just went and curdled me like cheese?"
Job,10,11,"You've totally decked me out in skin and muscle, and you've totally fortified me with bones and sinew. {fenced: which means like hedged if you didn't know}"
Job,10,12,"God, you've given me this lit life and like, major blessings, and your visits have totally kept my spirit alive."
Job,10,13,And you've kept these {things} in your heart: I know you've got them with you.
Job,10,14,"If I mess up, you notice, and you won't let me off the hook for my mistakes."
Job,10,15,"Bruh, if I do something bad, it's gonna be hella rough for me. And even if I do something good, I won't even feel proud of it. I'm just straight up messed up and confused, so can you please just recognize all the struggles I'm going through, yo?"
Job,10,16,"Dude, it's getting intense. You're chasing after me like a fierce lion, and then you come at me with some mind-blowing stuff."
Job,10,17,You keep bringing up evidence against me and intensifying your anger towards me; there are constant shifts and conflicts in my life.
Job,10,18,Why did you even bring me into this world? I wish I never existed and nobody had to see me!
Job,10,19,I wish I never existed; I just wish I was born and then gone.
Job,10,20,"Like, aren't my days, like, super short? Just, like, leave me be for a bit so I can, you know, chill and take a breather,"
Job,10,21,"Before I dip, I ain't coming back, even to that dark place and death's shadow;"
Job,10,22,"It's like a super dark place, you know, like so dark it's unreal. And there's this crazy shadow of death, everywhere, man. It's totally chaotic, no sense of structure or anything. And get this, even the light there is dark, like mind-blowingly dark."
Job,11,1,"So, like, Zophar the Naamathite, he, like, spoke up and said,"
Job,11,2,"Yo, do you really think talking a lot makes you righteous? Nah, it's about actions, not just words. #ActionsSpeakLouder"
Job,11,3,"Do you really think your lies are gonna shut everyone up? And when you make fun of others, you expect no one to call you out and embarrass you? #GoodLuckWithThat"
Job,11,4,"Because, like, you've straight up claimed that my teachings are, like, totally pure and I'm, like, totally flawless in your sight."
Job,11,5,"Man, I wish God would just drop some truth bombs and call you out,"
Job,11,6,"And that He would totally spill the tea on the secrets of being wise, like, it's twice as lit as you even think! Just know, though, that God is all about being chill with you, even though you totally mess up more than you even deserve."
Job,11,7,"Like, can you actually figure out God by diving into, like, a deep search? Can you really comprehend the Almighty to the fullest extent?"
Job,11,8,"It's like, all the way up to the sky, you know? What can you even do about it? And it's like, deeper than the deepest pit. What can you even understand, bro? Like, seriously!"
Job,11,9,"It's like, super huge - way longer than the earth and like, wider than the sea, ya know?"
Job,11,10,"If he cancels, shuts down, or brings people together, then who can stop him? {cancels...: or, makes a change} {stop...: Heb. turn him away?}"
Job,11,11,"Because, like, He totally knows those who are all into themselves and like, He can see wickedness too, so, like, isn't He gonna, like, think about it?"
Job,11,12,"Because, like, humans try so hard to be all wise and stuff, but honestly, they're just born as wild donkeys, you know? Like, empty and all."
Job,11,13,If you get your mind ready and reach out to him with open arms;
Job,11,14,"If you've got any wickedness going on, ditch it ASAP and don't let any evil stuff hang in your crib."
Job,11,15,"So, like, you'll totally be able to show your face with confidence, no blemishes or regrets. You'll be absolutely solid and fearless, no doubts or worries holding you back."
Job,11,16,You'll totally forget about your tough times and see them as fleeting as a TikTok video.
Job,11,17,"And your vibe will be brighter than the peak of the day; you'll radiate, you'll be like the early morning. Rise above and shine, my friend."
Job,11,18,"And you'll be chill, 'cause there's hope; yeah, you'll explore your surroundings, and you'll take a chill break, feeling totally safe."
Job,11,19,"You'll be able to chillax without any fear of haters, and in fact, many will come to you for help. They'll be begging for your attention, fam."
Job,11,20,"But the wicked won't get away with it - their plans will totally flop, and their hopes will vanish like a fleeting TikTok trend. No escaping the consequences, their dreams gonna be like a deflated vibe."
Job,12,1,"And Job was like, yo, listen up,"
Job,12,2,"You guys are definitely the ones with all the knowledge, and wisdom is going to end with you for sure."
Job,12,3,"But like, I totally understand things too, just as much as you do, and I'm not any less knowledgeable than you. Seriously, who doesn't know this kind of stuff?"
Job,12,4,"I feel like I'm being clowned on by my neighbor. They pray to God and get an answer, while the righteous get straight up laughed at."
Job,12,5,"If you're about to stumble and lose your clout, you're like a lamp that gets zero respect from those who have it easy."
Job,12,6,"The hangouts of thieves are thriving, and those who challenge God are feeling pretty confident; God's hooking them up big time."
Job,12,7,"Yo, just hit up the animals, and they'll school you; even the birds in the sky got some wisdom to drop:"
Job,12,8,"Just ask the earth for answers, man, and it'll teach you everything. Even the fish in the sea can tell you what's up."
Job,12,9,"Like, who doesn't know that the Lord's totally responsible for all this, man?"
Job,12,10,"God has complete control over the lives and breath of every living being on earth, including all humanity."
Job,12,11,"Like, isn't it normal for our ears to filter the words we hear and our mouths to savor the food we eat? It's, like, our taste buds in action, you know? #PalatePower"
Job,12,12,"They got that OG wisdom, and have mad understanding from all dem years."
Job,12,13,"He's got all the wisdom and strength, like, his advice is always on point and he totally gets everything. Like, seriously, God is where it's at!"
Job,12,14,"Yo, check it out, when this dude tears something down, there's no way to rebuild it. And when he locks someone up, there's no escaping. (PS: 'upon' means 'on top of')"
Job,12,15,"So, like, check it out, right? God's totally in control of the water. He can hold it back and make it dry up, or he can send it out and totally shake up the whole earth, you know?"
Job,12,16,"He's got mad strength and wisdom: he's got the ones who get tricked and the ones who do the trickery, all under his control."
Job,12,17,He totally messes up the counselors and makes the judges look dumb.
Job,12,18,He sets rulers free and gives them strength to lead.
Job,12,19,He flexes on the VIPs and yeets the powerful ones.

Job,12,24,"He totally messes with the head of the top dog among the people on earth, and makes them wander around in a total maze with no clue where to go."
Job,12,25,"They're blindly stumbling around in the dark, totally clueless, like someone who's had way too many drinks. They're all over the place, totally out of control."
Job,13,1,"Yo, I've witnessed all this with my own eyes, and my ears have fully absorbed and comprehended it."
Job,13,2,"I'm on the same wavelength as you, I know what you know and I'm no less than you."
Job,13,3,"Yo, I definitely wanna have a real talk with the Most High and like, actually discuss things with God."
Job,13,4,"But y'all be spreadin' fake news, all y'all just wannabe doctors with no skills."
Job,13,5,"Just, like, if you guys could all just zip it, that would actually be pretty wise of you."
Job,13,6,"Listen up y'all, pay attention to what I'm about to say."
Job,13,7,Are you really gonna be dishonest and fake just to impress God or something?
Job,13,8,"Are you gonna be all judgmental and stuff? Like, are you gonna fight for God, or what?"
Job,13,9,"Is it cool if he tries to understand you? Or like one person making fun of another, do you also make fun of him?"
Job,13,10,"If you're being fake and showing favoritism, he'll definitely call you out on it."
Job,13,11,"Like, won't his awesomeness totally give you the creeps? And won't you be totally shook by his dread?"
Job,13,12,"Your memories be like ashes, your bodies be like clay."

Job,13,26,"Yo, you're coming at me with some harsh words, bringing up all the mistakes I made back in the day."
Job,13,27,"So like, you're totally restraining me and constantly keeping tabs on everything I do. It's like you're leaving your mark on every step I take."
Job,13,28,"And he, like something totally gross, decays, like a worn-out, moth-eaten piece of clothing."
Job,14,1,"Dude, let me tell you, being born from a woman means having a short and tough life. Seriously, we don't have much time on this Earth and it's full of endless problems. Like, it's just the reality, man."
Job,14,2,"He's like, bam, a flower blooming, but then, bam, he's cut down. Just like a fresh TikTok shadow, he's here and then poof, gone."
Job,14,3,"And like, why you gotta be paying attention to someone like that? And now you're gonna judge me too? Like, seriously?"
Job,14,4,"Like, yo, who can bring something pure out of something dirty? It's, like, totally impossible, no one can do that, you know? Seriously, not gonna happen, bro. #truth"
Job,14,5,"Like, you already know how long a person's life is gonna be, and you've totally set the limits so they can't go beyond it, down to the very last month."
Job,14,6,"Give him some space, let him recharge until he finishes his tasks like a gig worker clocking out for the day. {rest: Hebrew word for cease}"
Job,14,7,"Like, there's still hope for a tree, even if it gets cut down, 'cause it can like totally sprout again, and the young branch won't ever stop growing."
Job,14,8,Even if the foundation gets ancient and the trunk perishes in the soil;
Job,14,9,"But if it's surrounded by the refreshing vibes of water, it'll totally blossom and grow new branches, just like a trending plant."
Job,14,10,"Like, dude, humans eventually die and just fade away, you know? Like, they totally give up their spirit, so where do they even go? It's like, they get weak or even cut off, man."
Job,14,11,"Like, when the water dries up from the ocean and the whole flood just fades away and evaporates:"
Job,14,12,"So, like, when a person goes to sleep, they don't wake up until the universe is, like, gone. They're totally sleeping and won't come back to life or anything."
Job,14,13,"Man, I just wish I could disappear, like totally vanish, hiding away until all this anger and stuff blows over. It'd be dope if you could give me a heads up when it's time to resurface, and, you know, remember that I exist!"
Job,14,14,"Yo, like if a bro dies, will he actually live again? I'm gonna chill and wait all my days until I go through some transformation, you feel me?"
Job,14,15,"When you hit me up, I got you; you'll be all about the stuff you made happen."
Job,14,16,"Like, you're totally keeping track of every move I make, right? Aren't you, like, looking out for my mistakes too?"
Job,14,17,"My mistakes are securely stored away, and you cover up my wrongdoings."
Job,14,18,"And like, you know, the mountain, like, totally fades away, and the rock, like, moves from its spot. #faded #movinon #changinplaces"
Job,14,19,"Like, the water totally erodes the rocks, and stuff. It washes away all the things that come outta the dusty ground, and, like, totally crushes people's hope. It's, like, overflowing, you know?"
Job,14,20,"You always have the upper hand against him, and he just moves on: you totally change his vibe, and he's outta here."
Job,14,21,He's totally clueless about his sons' accomplishments and completely oblivious to their struggles.
Job,14,22,"But, like, his body will totally suffer and his soul deep down will be super sad."
Job,15,1,"So Eliphaz, the Temanite, responded and said,"
Job,15,2,"Like, why would a smart person waste their breath on useless stuff and get all worked up about something as pointless as a gust of wind?"
Job,15,3,"Like, why would he waste time arguing with useless chit-chat? Or with words that won't do any good at all?"
Job,15,4,"Yeah, you totally ditch the fear factor and skip out on talking to God. So uncool, dude. #notpriorities #priorities"
Job,15,5,"Like, your words are spewing all your wrongdoings, and you're, like, totally embracing the sly way of speaking. #savvyspeaker"
Job,15,6,"You're literally incriminating yourself with your own words, not me: yup, your own lips are straight-up snitching on you."
Job,15,7,"Yo, were you the OG human or were you around before the hills?"
Job,15,8,Do you even know God's deep thoughts? And are you keeping all that wisdom to yourself?
Job,15,9,"What do you know that we don't? Like, what do you understand that we just don't get?"
Job,15,10,"We've got all the boomers and grandpas here, way older than your pops."
Job,15,11,"Do you think God's comfort is insignificant? Got any hidden revelations? Like, spill the tea!"
Job,15,12,Why is your heart so caught up in it? And why are you winking with your eyes?
Job,15,13,"Are you like, seriously disrespecting God by saying stuff like that?"
Job,15,14,"Why are humans even expected to be perfect? We're all born flawed, so how can we be expected to be righteous?"
Job,15,15,"Yo, God doesn't fully rely on his squad, even the heavens ain't spotless in his eyes."
Job,15,16,"Like, can you even imagine how completely gross and disgusting humans can be? It's like they consume wrongdoing as easily as they drink water!"
Job,15,17,"I'll spill the tea, listen up; and I'll spill the deets on what I've witnessed;"
Job,15,18,"The OGs passed down this knowledge, no cap: they didn't hold back on us."
Job,15,19,"Like, the earth was literally given only to them and no random people went around there."
Job,15,20,"The bad person suffers all their days, and the oppressor doesn't know how long it will last."
Job,15,21,"He's gonna hear something super scary: when everything's going well, something really destructive is gonna happen to him. It's like a really terrifying noise in his ears."
Job,15,22,"He just doesn't believe he'll make it out of this dark place, and the sword can't wait to catch up with him."
Job,15,23,"He's out there hustling for some bread, like, 'Yo, where that at?' He knows that darkness is about to come his way, fr."
Job,15,24,"He's gonna totally freak out when trouble and stress come his way; it's gonna hit him hard, like a super powerful king getting ready for a big battle."
Job,15,25,Because he straight up disses God and thinks he's all tough against the Almighty.
Job,15,26,"He comes at him full speed, targeting his neck and striking the sturdy centers of his shields."
Job,15,27,He hides his face with his chonky cheeks and has thicc rolls of fat on his sides.
Job,15,28,"And he lives in abandoned cities, and in houses that nobody lives in, which are about to crumble into ruins."
Job,15,29,"He won't be flexing stacks, his clout won't last, and his drip won't stay lit in this world."
Job,15,30,"He won't stay in the dark anymore; his branches will wither from the scorching fire, and with a simple exhale, he'll vanish."
Job,15,31,"Don't be fooled into putting your trust in emptiness, 'cause emptiness will come back to bite ya."
Job,15,32,"It's gonna go down earlier than expected, and his fam won't be thriving. {accomplished: or, straight up cut off}"
Job,15,33,He'll drop his unfinished grape like a vine and let go of his blossom like an olive.
Job,15,34,"Like, those fake people straight up gonna be left totally alone, and fire gonna wreck the shady hideouts of corruption."
Job,15,35,"They come up with bad ideas, and end up creating emptiness, and their cravings lead to deceit."
Job,16,1,"So Job was like,"
Job,16,2,"I've heard a bunch of stuff like that before: you guys are straight up terrible at giving comfort. Like, seriously annoying."
Job,16,3,"Are you gonna keep spouting empty words or do you actually have something useful to say? Like, why are you so confident in your response?"
Job,16,4,I could totally talk like you guys if I were in your shoes. I'd have no problem slinging words at you and shaking my head in disapproval.
Job,16,5,"I gotchu, fam! My words got your back, and my soothing talk gonna ease your pain."
Job,16,6,"Like, bro, no matter how much I vent about my problems, I still feel mega down. And even if I hold back from expressing them, it doesn't really make me feel any better. Like, it's like, what's the point, you know?"
Job,16,7,"But man, I'm totally exhausted now. You've legit wiped out my whole crew."
Job,16,8,"And now I'm all wrinkly, which is a total giveaway, and my skinny face is proof of my struggles."
Job,16,9,"He's like totally tearing me apart with his anger, like he seriously hates me, you know? He's even like gnashing his teeth at me and my enemy is giving me this intense stare, like he's sharpening his eyes or something."
Job,16,10,"Yo, they straight up stared at me with their mouth wide open, then disrespectfully slapped me on the cheek. And to top it off, they all teamed up against me like a bunch of haters."
Job,16,11,"Bruh, God just let the ungodly have their way with me. He straight up handed me over to the wicked. Like, He didn't even try to stop it or anything."
Job,16,12,"I was chillin', but dude totally wrecked me: grabbed me by the neck, shook me up, and made me a target."
Job,16,13,"I'm totally surrounded by his crew of sharpshooters, he's tearing me apart from the inside out, no mercy at all; he's spilling my bitterness everywhere."
Job,16,14,"He's just constantly bringing me down, hitting me with one problem after another, like a massive force coming at me."
Job,16,15,I've draped sackcloth on my skin and stained my power in the dust.
Job,16,16,"I'm an absolute mess, tears streaming down my face, and the darkness of despair is written all over my weary eyes;"
Job,16,17,"I swear, I'm not holding onto any haters. My prayers are totally legit, no cap."
Job,16,18,"Yo, earth, don't hide my blood, and let my cry be heard."
Job,16,19,"Yo, check it out. I've got my proof up in the heavens, and my testimony is straight up top-tier. Like, we're talking next level, higher than the high places. No cap."
Job,16,20,"My squad be hating on me: but my eyes be crying out to God. They be clowning on me, but I keep it real with the Big Man upstairs."
Job,16,21,"OMG, imagine someone standing up for a bro before God, like how you'd stand up for your bestie! Like, whoa, that would be so lit!"
Job,16,22,"In like a few years, I'm gonna peace out and never come back. Like, once I'm gone, there's no going back, you feel me?"
Job,17,1,"Dude, I'm totally worn out, my life's basically over, and I can practically see my grave waiting for me. It's like my spirit is drained or something."
Job,17,2,Don't I have people who constantly mock me? And aren't my eyes witnessing their irritating behavior?
Job,17,3,"Chill, let's make a deal; who's gonna dap me up?"
Job,17,4,"Cuz you've like totally caused their minds to be clueless, so obviously you won't be giving them any praise or shoutouts."
Job,17,5,"If someone constantly tries to butter up their squad, their future children won't be able to see through their words."
Job,17,6,"People now use me as a joke, and I used to be the life of the party."
Job,17,7,"My eyes are all teary because I'm so sad, and I feel like a shadow, empty and dull. It's like my thoughts have become shadows too."
Job,17,8,"Good people will be shocked by this, and the blameless will stand up against the fake."
Job,17,9,"The ones who do what's right will keep pushing forward, and the ones who stay pure will become even more powerful than before. {be...: Heb. gain strength}"
Job,17,10,"But yo, listen up, all of y'all need to rethink and come correct: 'cause I can't find a single wise homie among you."
Job,17,11,"My days are over, my plans have fallen apart, even the deepest desires of my heart. (the desires: like all the things I've wanted to have)"
Job,17,12,"They totally flip the script, turning night into day, but it doesn't last long because darkness creeps in. Like, the light barely has a chance to shine before it gets overshadowed. It's all so messed up, man."
Job,17,13,"Yo, once I'm gone, the grave's gonna be my crib. I've set up my cozy spot in complete darkness."
Job,17,14,"I've totally vibed with corruption, like 'Yo, you my fam!' Silly worms be like, 'Yo, you my whole crew bro!'"

Job,18,3,"Yo, why do you treat us like animals and see us as worthless?"
Job,18,4,"When he's fuming mad, he's all torn up inside. Are you seriously expecting the whole world to be abandoned just for you? Like, is the freaking rock gonna suddenly decide to move from its spot?"
Job,18,5,"Like, seriously, the wicked dudes' light is gonna be snuffed out and their fire won't even shine anymore."
Job,18,6,"In his hangout spot, things will totally be gloomy and he won't have any good vibes left. His cool little lamp will also be a total buzzkill and stop shining."
Job,18,7,"His power will be limited, and his own plans will end up causing his failure."
Job,18,8,"Cuz he totally gets caught up in his own drama, tripping over his own mistakes like stepping on a trap, you know?"
Job,18,9,"The bad influence shall trip him up, and the thief shall overpower him."
Job,18,10,"They set up a trap for him, right there on the ground, and a sneaky trap along his path. (hidden: in Hebrew it means not obvious)"
Job,18,11,"He's gonna be terrified, surrounded by crazy stuff that's gonna make him jump out of his skin. And it's gonna be so bad he won't be able to stand still."
Job,18,12,He's gonna be mad hungry and destruction gonna be always by his side.
Job,18,13,"It's gonna totally wreck his vibe, like, totally draining his energy. It's gonna be like the ultimate game-over boss that drains all his strength. Like, his strength is gonna just disappear, dude. #bars"
Job,18,14,"His self-assurance will be completely shattered, and it will lead him straight to the ultimate fear factor, the king of all things terrifying."

Job,18,18,"He's gonna get totally cancelled and kicked out of existence, like, he'll be completely banished from the spotlight into a never-ending darkness. They won't even want him around anymore, like, it's gonna be a total goodbye from this whole entire world. #Cancelled"
Job,18,19,"He won't have any kids or close relatives, or anyone left in his place."
Job,18,20,"Those who come after him will be shooketh by his epicness, just as those who came before were totally spooked. They were like 'OMG, what is this horror we've encountered?'"
Job,18,21,"Dude, this is totally where the wicked hang out, you know? It's like they're clueless about knowing God and all."
Job,19,1,"So Job was like,"
Job,19,2,Why do you keep stressing me out and tearing me apart with your words?
Job,19,3,"Bruh, y'all have been dissing me like ten times already and it's crazy you ain't even embarrassed about acting all weird towards me. Like, why you gotta be so standoffish?"
Job,19,4,"And tbh, if I messed up, it's on me. No cap."
Job,19,5,If you really wanna flex on me and bring up all the embarrassing stuff about me:
Job,19,6,"Yo, just so you know, God totally wrecked me, trapping me in His net."
Job,19,7,"Yo, check it out, I'm screaming about the injustice, but nobody's listening: I'm raising my voice, but there's no fair judgment happening. (And by 'injustice' I mean violence)"
Job,19,8,"It feels like life keeps throwing roadblocks my way, and it's all so unclear and confusing."
Job,19,9,"OMG, He's totally taken away all my clout and snatched the crown off my head!"
Job,19,10,"He totally wrecked me from all directions, and now I'm just gone: my hope got yeeted away like a tree."

Job,19,12,"Yo, his squad be linking up and straight flexing on me, setting up shop all around my crib."
Job,19,13,"He like totally ditched my bros, and my squad is seriously ghosting me."
Job,19,14,My squad has ghosted me and my day ones have straight up forgotten about me.
Job,19,15,"The people who live in my crib and my squad, they see me as an outsider: I'm like an alien to them."
Job,19,16,"I tried reaching out to my servant, but they totally ghosted me; I pleaded with them to respond, but they stayed silent."
Job,19,17,"My bae finds my vibe weird, even though I begged for our own fam's sake. Like, the fam that came from my own bod. 🔥"
Job,19,18,"Yeah, little kids straight up hated on me; I stood up, and they started talking smack about me. {young...: or, the wicked}"
Job,19,19,All my close friends couldn't stand me anymore: even the ones I cared about have turned against me.
Job,19,20,"My bones are sticking out of my skin and flesh, and I barely made it out alive. {and to: or, as to}"
Job,19,21,"Yo, my homies, show some mercy, show some mercy; check it, God's hand just laid a finger on me."
Job,19,22,"Why are you treating me like a total villain, acting all high and mighty, and not content with just messing with my vibe?"
Job,19,23,"Yo, how cool would it be if my words were put down on paper? Like, printed in an actual book! It's like, I wish everyone could read what I have to say!"
Job,19,24,"Bro, they straight up etched that stuff with a super legit iron pen and lead into the rock, like it's gonna be there FOREVER!"
Job,19,25,"I totally know that my redeemer is still kickin' it, and he's gonna show up big time one day on this planet:"
Job,19,26,"Even though my body gets all messed up and destroyed, I'll still see God, like, in the flesh and all. Like, I'll wake up from this messed up state and my flesh will be there, you know?"
Job,19,27,"I can't wait to see them with my own eyes, not through a screen or someone else's photos. My heart is filled with so much excitement, it's like it's going to burst! I just want that day to come already, no more waiting around."
Job,19,28,"But like, why are we hating on him, when all the real issues stem from me?"
Job,19,29,"Yo, don't mess with the sword 'cause it brings some serious consequences. It's like a signal that there's gonna be some judgment happening, so watch out."
Job,20,1,"So Zophar, the Naamathite, came back with his response and said,"
Job,20,2,"So, like, my mind is like, super eager to respond, and I'm like, totally rushing to do it. You know what I mean, right? It's like I can't help it, it's just part of who I am."
Job,20,3,"I just caught all the shade thrown my way, and my woke mind is urging me to clap back."
Job,20,4,"Yo, haven't you heard this ancient fact since humans first hit the earth?"
Job,20,5,"Like, you know how the wicked be flexin' and showing off for a hot minute? And hypocrites, they fake happy for just a sec? Yeah, it's like their momentary hype and joy don't last long, ya know?"
Job,20,6,"Even if this person thinks they're all that, reaching for the sky and having their head in the clouds; {clouds: implying elevation}"
Job,20,7,"He's gone, vanished like a bad meme. Everyone who laid eyes on him will be like, 'Wait, where did he go?'"
Job,20,8,"He'll vanish like a dream, gone without a trace. Yup, he'll be scattered like a flicker in the depths of the night."
Job,20,9,"The person who once laid eyes on him won't see him again, and the spot where he used to be won't witness his presence ever again."
Job,20,10,"His kids will make it their mission to support the less fortunate, and he will actively work to restore what has been taken from them."
Job,20,11,"He's got a whole lot of mistakes from his early days, which will follow him to the grave."
Job,20,12,"Even though he finds pleasure in doing wrong, he keeps it secret deep down."
Job,20,13,"Even when he doesn't want to, he doesn't let it go; he keeps it close, right on his tongue."
Job,20,14,"{But} inside him, his food now feels gross, it's like he's got venomous snakes in his stomach."
Job,20,15,"He's flexing his wealth, but he'll end up regurgitating it: God's gonna kick it out of his system."
Job,20,16,"He gonna get played by toxic people, like those vipers with their deadly words."
Job,20,17,"He won't get to experience the lit rivers, the dank floods, the streams of honey and butter. {the floods...: or, super cool streaming brooks}"
Job,20,18,"He will have to give back what he worked hard for, and he won't be able to keep it for himself. The repayment will match what he has, and he won't find any joy in it."
Job,20,19,"Yo, this dude straight up messed up! He's been treating the poor like dirt and leaving them behind. Plus, he's been straight up robbing people of their homes that he didn't even build. That's messed up, man!"
Job,20,20,"For real though, this dude won't find any peace in his stomach, and he won't get to enjoy what he actually wanted. (know: Hebrew term for understanding)"
Job,20,21,None of his food will be leftover; so nobody will try to take his stuff.
Job,20,22,"When he thinks he's got it all figured out, he's gonna be in deep trouble 'cause the wicked folks are gonna come at him from all directions. They're gonna make his life a living nightmare. #seriousdrama"
Job,20,23,"Just as he's about to satisfy his hunger, God will unleash his wrath upon him, pouring it down while he's enjoying his meal."
Job,20,24,"He'll run from the iron weapon, and get hit hard by the steel bow."
Job,20,25,"Yo, check it out, this thing gets pulled outta the body, and whoa, this shiny sword comes outta the guts. Dude's freakin' terrified!"
Job,20,26,"Like, all the darkness will, like, totally be hidden in his secret spots: a fire that like, doesn't need to be blown, will totally devour him; things will go seriously bad for whoever is, like, still chilling in his place."
Job,20,27,"He's gonna get exposed by the internet, and everyone's gonna be like 'cancel him!'"
Job,20,28,"His house will lose value, and his possessions will disappear when he gets all rage-y."
Job,20,29,"Yo, this is what a wicked person gets from God, it's like their inheritance or whatever. God has made up his mind about it and it's all part of his plan."
Job,21,1,"But Job was like, wait a sec and let me drop some knowledge."
Job,21,2,"Listen up, fam, pay close attention to what I'm about to say, 'cause this is gonna be what comforts you, no cap."
Job,21,3,"Let me say what I need to say, and once I'm done, you can do your mocking thing."
Job,21,4,"Like, seriously, I'm not one to go around complaining to people, you know? But if I did, it would totally mess up my vibe. Like, why wouldn't my spirit be all like, whoa and stuff? Like, super troubled, ya know?"
Job,21,5,"Yo, listen up and prepare to be shooketh! Place your hand over your mouth in complete awe. You better recognize and direct your attention towards me, fam!"
Job,21,6,"Whenever I think about it, I get totally scared and start shaking like crazy."
Job,21,7,"Like, why do the bad dudes get to live long and grow old, and like, even become powerful and stuff?"
Job,21,8,"Their descendants are right there with them, visible and present before their very eyes."
Job,21,9,"Their crib is chill, no bad vibes from God's discipline."
Job,21,10,"Their bull be straight up producing heirs without fail, and their cow be giving birth without any complications."
Job,21,11,"They send out their squad like a squad, and their kids bust a move."
Job,21,12,"They grab the timbrel and harp, and get hype when the organ starts playing."
Job,21,13,"They flexin' their wealth all day, but in a hot sec, they end up six feet deep. #livingthatlitlife #RIP"
Job,21,14,"So, like, they're all telling God to, like, go away 'cause they're, like, not interested in knowing how He rolls."
Job,21,15,"Like, who even is the Almighty that we gotta be all about serving him? And like, what do we even get out of it if we pray to him?"
Job,21,16,"Listen up, they ain't got nothing good going for them. I want nothing to do with the advice from those wicked peeps."
Job,21,17,"Dude, wicked peoples' candles get snuffed out all the time! And boom! Destruction comes crashing down on them left and right! God spreads sorrows when He's angry. (btw, candle means like a lamp and stuff)"
Job,21,18,"They're like useless weeds blown away by the wind, and worthless debris that gets carried off by a raging storm. {stealeth: Hebrew for carries}"
Job,21,19,"God keeps track of the bad stuff you do and holds onto it for your future kids. He gives you what you deserve, so you'll totally understand it. (But by 'what you deserve', I mean the consequences for your bad actions. Just to clarify.)"
Job,21,20,"His eyes will witness his downfall, and he will taste the fury of the Almighty."
Job,21,21,"Like, why would he even care about his house after he's gone, when his time is suddenly cut short?"
Job,21,22,"Like, who's gonna school God, dude? He's the ultimate judge of even the most prestigious peeps."
Job,21,23,"Sometimes someone dies when they're in their prime, living life to the fullest without any worries or troubles."
Job,21,24,"He's got that milk game strong, and his bones be all juicy with that marrow. {breasts: or, milk pails}"
Job,21,25,"And another dies feeling extremely sad, never gets to enjoy eating with joy."
Job,21,26,"They're gonna chill together in the dust, and the worms are gonna vibe on top of them."
Job,21,27,"Yo, I peep your thoughts and all the shady schemes you got against me."
Job,21,28,"You guys be like, 'Yo, where's the crib of the boss? And where the party at for all those sinners?'"
Job,21,29,"Yo, haven't you peeps even bothered to ask those who pass by? Don't you know any of their signs or signals?"
Job,21,30,"So, like, you know how the wicked people are just waiting for their epic downfall? Yeah, they're gonna totally get what's coming to them on the day of mega anger. #justsaying #wrath #foryouknowwho"
Job,21,31,"Like, who's gonna straight-up confront him about his actions? And who's gonna pay him back for everything he's done?"
Job,21,32,"But eventually, he will end up in the grave and stay there for good. {grave: Hebrew for graves} {remain...: Hebrew for watch in the heap}"
Job,21,33,"He will find joy in the simple things, and everyone will be captivated by him, just like the countless others who came before."
Job,21,34,"So like, why are you trying to comfort me with empty words when all your responses are full of lies? Are you seriously trying to deceive me or something?"
Job,22,1,"And Eliphaz the Temanite was like, 'Yo, listen up and hear what I gotta say,'"
Job,22,2,"Yo, can a person really benefit God, like how someone smart can benefit themselves? Like, does God's vibe depend on whether we're successful and doing good or what? 🤔"
Job,22,3,"Yo, does it even matter to the Almighty if you're all righteous and perfect with your ways? Like, is He gaining anything from that?"
Job,22,4,Is he gonna call you out just because he's scared of you? Is he gonna sit down and have a face-off with you?
Job,22,5,"Bro, isn't your wickedness off the charts? Like, infinite iniquities, man?"
Job,22,6,"Bro, you straight up tapped your brother for a favor and snatched the clothes right off the backs of the vulnerable. That's messed up, man. Talkin' 'bout takin' advantage of folks in their most vulnerable state."
Job,22,7,"You didn't hook up the thirsty with some water, and you straight up ghosted the hungry on that bread."
Job,22,8,"But listen up, fam, the strong homie had the whole earth on lock, and the respected dude was chilling in it. Like, the strong dude flexed his power, ya know? And the well-regarded dude was just living his best life, being recognized and all that. #Respect"
Job,22,9,"You've ghosted widows, leaving them feeling empty, and crushed the hopes of those without dads."
Job,22,10,"So it's like, bro, traps are all around you, and outta nowhere you're freaking out, man;"
Job,22,11,"Imagine being in pitch black darkness, where you can't see a thing, and massive waves completely engulf you."
Job,22,12,"Like, dude, isn't God, like, all the way up in the sky, super high above everything? And yo, check out the stars, man, they're like crazy high up there! Like, even higher than the highest high, ya know?"
Job,22,13,"And you're like, 'How does God even know? Can He really judge from behind a dark cloud?'"
Job,22,14,"Like, big clouds totally cover Him so He can't see anything, and He's just up there, you know, walkin' around the whole sky and stuff."
Job,22,15,Have you seen the path that evil people used to take?
Job,22,16,"These guys got wiped out real quick. Their whole operation got flooded, like big time. Floodwaters just poured all over their foundation."
Job,22,17,"They're like, telling God to bounce, thinking like, what can the Almighty even do for 'em? Like, really?"
Job,22,18,"But he totally hooked them up with dope stuff for their cribs, you know? But I'm, like, totally done with the shady plans of these wicked fools, man."
Job,22,19,"When good people witness {it}, they're stoked: and the pure-hearted can't help but laugh at them."
Job,22,20,"Like, dude, our whole like materialistic stuff doesn't even matter, 'cause, you know, the fire straight-up burns it up. Like, it's all gone, man, leaving nothing behind. #SorryNotSorry #FireBeLike 🔥"
Job,22,21,"Yo, take the time to get to know God and chill out with Him. That's when good things will come your way, no cap. {him: that is, God}"
Job,22,22,"Yo, listen up! It's time to take in his teachings, straight from his mouth. Store his words like treasure deep down in your heart."
Job,22,23,"If you turn back to the Almighty, you'll level up and kick those sins to the curb at your crib."
Job,22,24,"Bruh, you 'bout to stack up gold like it's straight up dust, and that Ophir gold gonna be like mad stones in the brooks. No cap, it's gonna be lit 🔥"
Job,22,25,"Like, the Almighty's got your back, and you'll be stacking up mad silver. {defence: or, gold} {plenty...: Heb. silver of strength}"
Job,22,26,"Because when you do, you'll totally vibe with the Almighty and feel so connected to God."

Job,22,28,"Yo, you got the power to speak it, and it's gonna happen just like that. You'll be blessed and guided, with good vibes shining on your path."
Job,22,29,"When people feel down, just say, 'There's hope, and you'll be saved if you stay humble. Humblee means being modest.)"
Job,22,30,"He will save the blameless island, and it will be saved because of your pure actions."
Job,23,1,"So like, then Job was all like, yo, listen up and check this out,"
Job,23,2,"OMG, today my situation is so frustrating, like seriously! It's way worse than the amount I've been venting about. My struggles are just so overwhelming, I can't even!"
Job,23,3,"Man, I wish I knew where to find him! I'd totally go chill at his spot!"
Job,23,4,I'd make sure to present my case before him and come up with strong arguments to back it up.
Job,23,5,"I just wanna know, like, what he'd say if I hit him up and totally get where he's coming from, you know?"
Job,23,6,"Does he really have to come at me with all that power? Nah, he actually fills me up with strength."
Job,23,7,"In that place, the righteous could totally have a deep convo with the Big Guy; like, mind-blowing discussions fam. And just like that, I'd be totally saved from dealing with my judge forever. #blessed"
Job,23,8,"Yo, listen up. I keep moving, but dude ain't there. I try to look back, but I can't even sense him, man."
Job,23,9,"When he's doing his thing on the left, but I can't peep him: he's hiding out on the right, where I can't catch a glimpse of him."
Job,23,10,"But yo, he knows the path I'm on: when he puts me to the test, I'll come out shining like pure gold. You know what I mean, that's how I roll."
Job,23,11,"I've totally stuck with him, always walking in his path, never straying away."
Job,23,12,"I've never ditched the stuff God said; I value His words more than my go-to snacks. They're like my secret stash, except even more important."
Job,23,13,"But he's totally unbothered, like who's gonna change his mind? He does whatever he wants, fulfilling all his heart's desires."
Job,23,14,Because he's got my back and there's plenty more where that came from.
Job,23,15,"So, like, just being honest, I get totally stressed out when he shows up. Like, when I really think about it, he legit freaks me out."
Job,23,16,"OMG, God totally softens my heart and the Almighty brings on some major stress for me:"
Job,23,17,"I totally didn't get kicked out while things got dark, and he hasn't even shielded my face from the shadows."
Job,24,1,"Like, seriously, why can't those who don't know the Almighty, like, see that He's totally aware of everything that's happening? It's like they're so clueless about His awesome power and presence in our lives."
Job,24,2,"Some people be out there movin' dem boundaries, snatchin' flock and feedin' off of 'em. Like, takin' what ain't theirs without no respect."
Job,24,3,They straight up steal the fatherless kid's ride and use the widow's ox as collateral.
Job,24,4,"These people be kickin' the needy to the curb, makin' the poor of the earth straight up disappear."
Job,24,5,"Check it out, like wild donkeys in the desert, they head out to do their thing; getting up early to find their food: the wilderness provides sustenance for them and their offspring."
Job,24,6,"They gather up their crop in the field, and they collect the harvest of the wicked ones. (Crop here means mixed variety of crops, or by-products.) (Collect the harvest means the wicked ones gather it up.)"
Job,24,7,"They let people stay without clothes, leaving them with no protection in the freezing weather."
Job,24,8,"They're totally drenched from the epic mountain rain, desperately hugging the rock for some shelter vibes."
Job,24,9,"They be snatching the fatherless from the boobies, and flexing on the poor for collateral."
Job,24,10,"They straight up leave him all stripped, no drip, and snatch away the food from the starving;"
Job,24,11,"They're out here making oil inside their walls, grinding in their winepresses and still thirsty."
Job,24,12,"People in the city are freaking out and the wounded ones are screaming in pain, but God doesn't blame them for their mistakes."
Job,24,13,"They're like those who go against what's right, they totally don't get it and have no interest in following the right path."
Job,24,14,"When someone evil wakes up in the morning, they harm the vulnerable and helpless, and at night they sneak around like a thief."
Job,24,15,"The cheater is always looking for the perfect moment, thinking no one will catch them, and tries to hide their identity, keeping it a secret."
Job,24,16,"When it's dark, they sneak into houses they scoped out during the day, clueless about the light."
Job,24,17,"In the morning, it feels like literally dying: if someone experiences it, they're in total darkness and freaking out."
Job,24,18,"He's faster than the flow, but they're stuck with a bad deal on earth. He's totally clueless about vineyards."
Job,24,19,"When there's a serious lack of water and mad hot weather, the snow melts away. Same thing happens to those who've messed up big time, the grave swallows them up with no mercy."
Job,24,20,The womb won't even remember him; worms will feast on him without a care; he'll be forgotten completely; and wickedness will crumble like a toppled tree.
Job,24,21,He's mean to people who can't have babies and doesn't help widows at all.
Job,24,22,"He pulls in even the most influential people with his strength: he rises up, and no one can be certain about life. (Or, he doesn't even trust his own life.)"
Job,24,23,"Even if he's chillin' in a safe spot, he's still keeping an eye on what they do."
Job,24,24,"They may seem popular and successful for a short period, but eventually they fade away and fall hard just like everyone else. They're removed from the picture like the tops of corn stalks that have been cut off."
Job,24,25,"And like, if that's not the truth right now, who's gonna call me a liar and just make everything I said useless?"
Job,25,1,"So, like, Bildad the Shuhite stepped up and was all like,"
Job,25,2,"He's got all the power and respect, making everything peaceful up in his crib."
Job,25,3,"Like, can you even count how many soldiers he has? And, legit, his light shines on everyone, no exceptions."
Job,25,4,"So, like, how can anyone even be considered righteous in the eyes of God? Or like, how can someone be completely pure if they're like, born from a woman and stuff?"
Job,25,5,"Look, even the moon can't shine as brightly, and even the stars aren't considered perfect in his eyes."
Job,25,6,"Bruh, like, seriously, man? We're nothing but worms, just like, so tiny and insignificant."
Job,26,1,"So, like, Job spoke up and was like,"
Job,26,2,How have you assisted someone who's got no clout? And how are you like saving the feeble arm with zero strength?
Job,26,3,"Bruh, why you even tryna give advice to someone who clearly lacks common sense? And like, why you feel the need to explain the obvious as if it's some groundbreaking revelation?"
Job,26,4,"Who did you just talk to, and where did their vibe come from?"
Job,26,5,"Yo, check this out! All the dead stuff comes together from beneath the water, along with everyone living there. Like, the whole crew, you know?"
Job,26,6,"God sees everything, even the darkest depths of despair, and nothing can hide from His righteous judgment."
Job,26,7,"He like totally expands the north over, like, this empty space and, you know, hangs the earth without anything holding it up."
Job,26,8,He takes the water and puts it in his thick clouds; and the cloud doesn't even break apart under it.
Job,26,9,"He's like flexin' his throne, covering it with a cloud."
Job,26,10,"He's like, totally put a limit on the waters, until like, the day and night are no longer a thing. {until...: Like, until the end of light mixed with darkness, ya know?}"
Job,26,11,"BRUH, even the heavens be shook and straight up mind-blown when he calls out people."
Job,26,12,"God flexes his power, splitting the sea like a boss, and he totally shuts down anyone who thinks they're all that. #humblebrag"
Job,26,13,"With his mad skills, he's totally decked out the sky; his hand crafted that sneaky snake."
Job,26,14,"Yo, these are just glimpses of what God's all about. But seriously, we only scratch the surface of who He is. His power is like thunder, and honestly, who can even wrap their head around that?"
Job,27,1,"So Job kept going with his story and said,"
Job,27,2,"I swear to God, that dude totally messed up my life and made me feel hella bitter."
Job,27,3,"As long as I'm breathing and feeling God's presence, it's like the divine vibes are flowing through me; you know, that inner essence gifted by God."
Job,27,4,"I won't let any wickedness slip from my lips, nor will I utter any deceit with my tongue."
Job,27,5,"Like, no way am I gonna defend you, dude. I swear, even if it takes me till I'm, like, old and gray, I'm never gonna compromise my honesty and authenticity."
Job,27,6,I'm sticking with my righteousness and won't let it slip away. I won't let my heart bring me down as long as I'm alive. #NoRegrets #LivingRighteous
Job,27,7,"Make my enemy just as bad as the wicked ones, and may anyone who opposes me be no better than the unrighteous."
Job,27,8,"So, like, what's the point of the two-faced people even hoping for anything? Even if they get what they want, it's not gonna mean anything when God snatches away their souls."
Job,27,9,"Yo, will God even listen when he's in deep trouble and crying out for help?"
Job,27,10,Will he be stoked about hanging with the Almighty? Will he be constantly hitting up God?
Job,27,11,"I'm gonna drop some major wisdom from the man upstairs: I won't hold back anything that comes from the Almighty. No secrets here, fam. Trust."
Job,27,12,"Look, you all have witnessed it yourselves, so why are you acting all pointless and shallow like that?"
Job,27,13,"This is what happens to a bad person when they deal with God, and this is what they get from the Almighty - it's their karma, man."
Job,27,14,"If he has a lot of kids, it'll only bring trouble: they won't be happy with just food to eat."
Job,27,15,The few people left will pass away and no one will cry for their widows.
Job,27,16,"Even if he's flexin' stacks of silver like it's just dirt, and stuntin' with clothes like it's clay;"
Job,27,17,"He may set it up, but the righteous will rock it, and the pure will split the cash."
Job,27,18,"He be building his crib like a moth, and like a booth that the keeper be making."
Job,27,19,"The wealthy dude might rest, but there won't be anyone to gather him up. When he wakes up, he won't even be there anymore."
Job,27,20,He's freaking out like he's drowning in a mad storm that sneaks up on him at night.
Job,27,21,"The east wind just yeets him away, and he's outta there like a tornado throwing him out of his spot."
Job,27,22,"God totally ain't gonna hold back - He's about to go all in on this guy, no mercy. Dude's gonna be desperate to escape His grip, but it's not gonna happen. Like, he's gonna try and flee, but it's a straight-up futile attempt."
Job,27,23,"People will totally roast him, like big time. He'll get mad claps and major hisses, they'll basically cancel him out of his spot."
Job,28,1,"Like, for sure, there's, like, a legit spot where they find silver and gold, you know? It's all about the extraction process, you feel me?"
Job,28,2,"They pull iron from the ground, and they melt brass from stone. (Or dirt, ya know.)"
Job,28,3,He puts an end to darkness and explores everything that's flawless: even the darkest moments and the scariest challenges.
Job,28,4,"Yo, the flood just bursts out, like whoa, from where people live, and the waters are so forgotten, they're like, who cares about them anymore? They've totally dried up and disappeared from everyone's sight."
Job,28,5,"Yo, check it. The earth, it's like baking bread, you know? And underneath, it's all fiery and stuff."
Job,28,6,"The stones in it are like sapphires, and it has gold dust. (Or you could say, it's got gold ore.)"
Job,28,7,"There's this lit path that no bird knows about, not even the vulture's keen eye has spotted it:"
Job,28,8,"No baby lions have walked here, nor has a big ferocious lion come around."
Job,28,9,"He straight up flexes on the rock, totally demolishing mountains like it's nothing. {rock: or, flint}"
Job,28,10,"God carves rivers through rugged terrain, keeping a close eye on all things valuable."
Job,28,11,"He controls the floods, preventing them from spilling over; and reveals what was once hidden. It's like he turns tears into triumph."
Job,28,12,"Yo, where can we even find wisdom and understanding?"
Job,28,13,"Dude has no clue how valuable it is, and it's definitely not off the shelves in the real world."
Job,28,14,"The deep sea is like, 'Sorry, it's not here with me,' and the ocean is all like, 'Yeah, it's not in my jurisdiction either.'"
Job,28,15,"You can't buy this with cash, no matter how much bling you got. No amount of silver can match its value. And forget about exchanging it for gold, even the finest kind won't cut it."
Job,28,16,"You can't put a price tag on it, no matter how much gold, onyx, or sapphire you got."
Job,28,17,Nothing compares to how valuable it is - not even gold or fancy jewelry.
Job,28,18,"We don't even talk about coral or pearls anymore, because the value of wisdom is higher than rubies. Forget about coral, a.k.a. Ramoth."
Job,28,19,"The lit topaz from Ethiopia doesn't even come close, it can't even compare to the straight fire of pure gold."
Job,28,20,"So, like, where does wisdom even come from? And, you know, where can you find understanding?"
Job,28,21,"Since nobody can see it, not even birds in the sky."
Job,28,22,"Yo, destruction and death be like, 'We've heard all about that, no cap.'"
Job,28,23,"God totally gets how it works, and he knows exactly where it's at."
Job,28,24,"Yo, he's constantly scoping out the entire earth, checking out everything under the whole sky, you know?"
Job,28,25,He determines the strength of the winds and measures the amount of water.
Job,28,26,When he gave the signal for epic rain and set a path for the lit lightning bolts:
Job,28,27,"And then he was like, whoa, check it out, and shared it with everyone; he totally planned it, yeah, and investigated it thoroughly. {declare...: or, count it}"
Job,28,28,"And God was like, listen up, okay? Having respect for God, that's being wise, you know? And staying away from doing bad stuff, that's true understanding."
Job,29,1,"So like, Job went on telling his story and added, you know?"
Job,29,2,"Man, I wish I could go back to the good old days when God had my back and life was so much simpler."
Job,29,3,"When his glowstick lit up my path, and with its radness I navigated the vibe of darkness; (glowstick: or, flashlight)"
Job,29,4,"Back in the day when I was still a youngin', feelin' God's wisdom all around me like a secret in my soul;"
Job,29,5,"Back when the Almighty was still with me, and my squad of children were all around me;"
Job,29,6,"I was flexin' so hard, I spread some fancy butter on my kicks and the universe blessed me with an endless supply of premium oil; you know, just havin' it all with me"
Job,29,7,"Bruh, when I stepped out of my crib and hit up the city, I straight up secured my spot on the block!"
Job,29,8,"When the squad peeped me, they dipped out and the OGs stood up."
Job,29,9,The squad kept their mouths shut and held back from saying anything.
Job,29,10,"The rich and famous were silent, like they couldn't even speak. Their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths."
Job,29,11,"When people heard me, they were totally impressed, and when they saw me, they couldn't help but recognize my greatness:"
Job,29,12,"Yo, I got you, bro. I came through for the ones in need, those who were struggling and didn't have anyone to back them up."
Job,29,13,"I was blessed by someone who was about to give up, and I made a widow's heart sing with joy."
Job,29,14,I dressed myself in righteousness and it totally suited me: my sense of judgement was like a trendy outfit and a dope crown.
Job,29,15,I was like a guide for the blind and a mode of transportation for the lame.
Job,29,16,"I was like a dad to those who were struggling financially, and if I came across a problem I didn't know about, I made sure to investigate and find a solution."
Job,29,17,"And I totally wrecked the wicked dude's jaw, and nabbed all the loot he had chomping on. {the jaws: Like, the teeth in the back of his mouth, or the grinders} {plucked: Like, kicked his stuff so far it was cast away}"
Job,29,18,"And I was like, yo, I'm gonna chill in my crib until I'm old, and I'm gonna have mad days like, you know, the sand and stuff."
Job,29,19,"Yo, my roots were chillin' in the water, and the dew stayed on my branch all night long. It was like my roots were totally open to all that good stuff, ya know?"
Job,29,20,"I was feeling so lit, like my swag was on point, and my weapon was all upgraded in my grip. Ya feel me? Like, it was all new and upgraded, you know what I'm saying?"
Job,29,21,"Yo, people actually listened up, like they were all ears, and stayed quiet, totally hanging on my advice."
Job,29,22,"After I dropped some knowledge, they were speechless and couldn't say anything in response to what I said."
Job,29,23,"And they were super psyched for me to show up, like they were hyped for some epic rain. They were so ready for it, they had their mouths wide open, just like they do when the latter rain pours down."
Job,29,24,"When I tried to joke around with them, they didn't believe me at all. And they couldn't even dim my shining energy."
Job,29,25,"I totally ruled the game, became the top dog, and lived like a king in the squad, comforting those who were feeling down."
Job,30,1,"But like, now there are peeps younger than me who be straight up mocking me. Their dads are like so not cool, I wouldn't even let them chill with my flock's dogs. For real, they're like not even as old as me."
Job,30,2,"Like, seriously, what good is their strength gonna do for me? They're all old and weak, for real."
Job,30,3,"When they were in need and hungry, they felt so alone; they ran away to the deserted and desolate wilderness. It was as dark as the night, like it happened just yesterday."
Job,30,4,Whoever chopped up mallows and juniper roots for their meal.
Job,30,5,"They got kicked out of the squad, and people chased them down like they were chasing a criminal."
Job,30,6,"Chillin' in the valleys, kickin' it in caves and rocks. Like, for real tho, like holes and stuff."
Job,30,7,They were making noise in the bushes; gathered together under the nettles.
Job,30,8,"They were born from clueless people, yeah, born from lowlifes: they were worse than dirt. (lowlifes...: in other words, people with zero reputation)"
Job,30,9,"Well, now I've become their biggest joke, like seriously, they're all talking about me."
Job,30,10,"They can't stand me, they run away from me, and have no problem disrespecting me to my face. {and...: Basically, they don't hold back on the insults}"
Job,30,11,"He messed with my vibe and tried to bring me down, they even removed any control and let chaos reign."
Job,30,12,"At my right hand, there are young ones rising; they push me away and follow destructive paths."
Job,30,13,"They totally mess up my vibe, constantly bringing bad vibes to my life, and there's no one to help me out."
Job,30,14,"They came at me like a massive wave crashing down: in the chaos, they completely overwhelmed me."
Job,30,15,"I'm freaking out, man! These crazy things keep chasing after me, swooping in like the wind. And my peace and happiness vanish as quickly as a cloud in the sky. {my principal one: or, my body}"
Job,30,16,And now I feel totally drained; the days of suffering have clung onto me.
Job,30,17,"Bruh, my bones be straight up hurting at night, and my muscles ain't getting any chill."
Job,30,18,My disease is so intense that it totally transforms my clothes - it feels like I'm wearing a tight collar all the time.
Job,30,19,"He totally dumped me in the mud, and now I'm just all dusty and ashy."
Job,30,20,"I'm like, seriously reaching out to you, but you don't even hear me out. I'm here, trying to get your attention, and you're just like, not even noticing me."
Job,30,21,"You're being so harsh to me, like seriously. It feels like you're intentionally coming at me with all your strength against me. #NotCool"
Job,30,22,"You like totally lift me up like I'm riding the wind, and like totally break me down. It's like my whole existence just disappears."
Job,30,23,"I know you'll take me to the end, to the crib where everyone has to crash."
Job,30,24,"But he won't reach out his hand towards death, even if they cry out in their own demise."
Job,30,25,Didn't I cry for the one who was going through a tough time? Wasn't my heart filled with sorrow for the needy?
Job,30,26,"When I was all about that positive vibes, then the negativity came my way: and when I was patiently hoping for some enlightenment, darkness swooped in."
Job,30,27,I was feeling super anxious and couldn't chill: tough times came out of nowhere and didn't let up.
Job,30,28,"I was so down, no light in sight: I stood up, and straight up bawled in front of everyone."
Job,30,29,"I totally vibe with dragons and hang out with owls. {owls: or, ostriches}"
Job,30,30,"Yo, my skin's like, so dark, and my bones are hella burnt from the heat."
Job,30,31,"My harp is straight up sad now, and my organ sounds like those crying their eyes out."
Job,31,1,I made a promise to myself not to let my eyes wander; so why should I entertain thoughts about someone attractive?
Job,31,2,"Like, what part of God is, like, even from above? And, like, what kind of inheritance does the Almighty have from up high, you know?"
Job,31,3,"Isn't it like, total annihilation for the wicked? And like, the craziest punishment ever for those who do wrong stuff?"
Job,31,4,"Like, dude, doesn't He, like, totally see all my moves and keeps track of every step I take?"
Job,31,5,If I've ever been fake or been shady in what I do;
Job,31,6,"Just check me out, God. Weigh me on a fairness scale so you can see how legit I am. #IntegrityGoals 💯"
Job,31,7,"If I've taken a wrong turn in life, chasing after what catches my eye, and if I've made any mistakes along the way;"
Job,31,8,"So, like, I plant the seeds, but someone else gets to enjoy the harvest. Totally unfair, right? And to add insult to injury, my future generations will be wiped out. Ugh!"
Job,31,9,If I've been played by a girl and if I've pulled a sneaky move at my neighbor's place;
Job,31,10,"Allow my partner to connect with someone else, and let others show respect towards her."
Job,31,11,"Yo, this is straight up messed up, like seriously wrong. The judges gotta come down on this, it's like a major sin and they gotta punish it."
Job,31,12,"Dude, it's like a totally intense fire that straight up destroys everything in its path, wiping out all the stuff I've built up."
Job,31,13,"If I dissed my homie's or my girl's complaint, when they came at me;"
Job,31,14,"Yo, what's my move when God shows up? And when He comes through, how do I respond?"
Job,31,15,"Didn't the same person who created me in the womb also create him? Didn't we both come into being through the same process of formation in the womb? {did not one...: or, did he not fashion us in one womb?}"
Job,31,16,If I've held back from fulfilling the poor's wishes or made the widow's eyes go weary;
Job,31,17,"Or like, if I hog all the good eats for myself and don't share them with the orphaned ones;"
Job,31,18,"(Because we've practically grown up together from the time I was a kid, like a father raising a child, and I've been there for her ever since she was born, just like a mother would be; she refers to the widow in this context)"
Job,31,19,"Like, if I've ever witnessed anyone totally suffering because they couldn't afford some fresh threads, or any homie out there struggling with no cozy outfit for real..."
Job,31,20,"If his vibe hasn't hyped me up, and if he wasn't getting cozy with the swag of my sheep;"
Job,31,21,If I ever dissed or messed with someone who didn't have a dad while I knew I could get away with it:
Job,31,22,"My arm is so wrecked, it might as well snap off my shoulder and shatter into a million pieces. Like, it's a total disaster, y'know?"
Job,31,23,"Honestly, God's wrath scared the heck out of me, and His supreme power was so intense, I just couldn't handle it."
Job,31,24,"If I've put all my trust in flexing my cash flow, or if I've been flexing my bling bling like, 'Yo, you're my ride or die;'"
Job,31,25,If I flexed because I was ballin' with mad riches and my hustle brought in mad stacks;
Job,31,26,"If I saw the sun when it was lit AF, or the moon slayin' with its brightness;"
Job,31,27,"And, like, I've totally been tempted in my heart, you know? Like, maybe I've even kissed my own hand or something, but hey, don't judge me, alright? No one's perfect, dudes."
Job,31,28,"Like, that would've been totally wrong and deserving punishment, you know? 'Cause denying the Almighty would've been a major sin."
Job,31,29,"If I, like, got all pumped when my hater got wrecked or felt all proud when bad stuff happened to them:"
Job,31,30,I haven't let my mouth sin by wishing a curse on their soul. #NoSwearing
Job,31,31,"Yo, if the bros in my squad were all like, Mann, we need more of his flesh!' because we just can't get enough."
Job,31,32,"I didn't let the stranger sleep on the street. Instead, I opened my doors for the traveler."
Job,31,33,"Yo, if I tried to hide my sins like Adam, keeping them inside and acting all shady, it would be a total fail, just like any other human."
Job,31,34,"Why should I be afraid of a bunch of people or let the criticism of others get to me, so much so that I just shut up and didn't step outside the door?"
Job,31,35,"Yo, it would be lit if someone actually listened to me! Like, I'm low-key hoping the Almighty would have my back and respond to me. And imagine if my rival even bothered to write a whole book about me. Can't even imagine, bro."
Job,31,36,"I'd totally shoulder that responsibility and rock it like a crown, yo."
Job,31,37,"I'd totally spill the deets on my every move, like I'm sliding into his DMs like a boss."
Job,31,38,"If my land starts hating on me, or if the fields start complaining; {complain: Like, weep}"
Job,31,39,"If I've snagged those goodies without paying up or caused the owners to bite the dust: (goodies = strength) (owners = souls of those peeps),"
Job,31,40,"Yo, instead of wheat, we've got thistles poppin' up, and barley's gettin' replaced by cockle. Job's done spittin' facts. {cockle: or, some nasty weeds}"
Job,32,1,"So these three dudes, like, stopped responding to Job because he totally thought he was righteous and all that. Ya know? Like, he was really feeling himself. #confidence #ownworstenemy"
Job,32,2,"So Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, from the fam of Ram, got really mad at Job. He was super triggered because Job was all about defending himself instead of giving props to God. {himself: Hebrew for his soul}"
Job,32,3,Job got mad at his three friends because they couldn't come up with any good arguments and still judged him.
Job,32,4,"So Elihu was patiently waiting for Job to finish speaking, respecting his elders. He waited because they were older and more experienced than him."
Job,32,5,"When Elihu peeped that these three dudes had nothing to say, he got mad lit."
Job,32,6,"So, Elihu, the son of Barachel, a Buzite, stepped up and said, yo, I'm just a young buck here, while y'all are seasoned veterans. Gotta admit, I was kinda nervous and didn't have the guts to speak up with my own thoughts."
Job,32,7,"I was like, yo Days, you should totally start speaking up and drop some wisdom bombs. And, like, a bunch of years, they should totally school us on what's up."
Job,32,8,"Yo, listen up! Every person has a spirit inside them, and it's the Almighty who gives them that big brain energy for understanding."
Job,32,9,"Sometimes even the most popular dudes aren't necessarily smart, and you can't always count on the older generation to understand what's right."
Job,32,10,"So, like, I was just thinking, yo, listen to what I gotta say. 'Cause, you know, I got some thoughts I wanna share, fam."
Job,32,11,"Yo, I was all ears when you were trying to figure out what to say, like I was patiently waiting for your words and soaking up your thoughts."
Job,32,12,"Yo, I listened to all of y'all, but guess what? None of you could prove Job wrong or give a decent comeback to his words."
Job,32,13,"So you don't go around acting like you've got all the answers: It's not up to us to bring someone down, it's in God's hands, not ours."
Job,32,14,"He's not specifically coming at me with his words, so I'm not gonna come back at him with your words either."
Job,32,15,"OMG, they were like totally shocked, they couldn't even come up with a response and just went silent. #speechless"
Job,32,16,"So I waited, and they were all silent, not saying anything else."
Job,32,17,"So, like, I was like, 'Yo, wait up! Lemme give my two cents too.' I mean, I have my own thoughts and stuff, and I wanna share 'em with y'all."
Job,32,18,"Yo, I got so much to say, it's like my spirit won't let me keep quiet. {matter: in Hebrew means words} {spirit... : the Hebrew says it's the spirit in my belly}"
Job,32,19,"Yo, check it out, my belly is like a bottle of wine that's all backed up with no way to release it. It's about to explode like a fresh new bottle. For real, it's like sealed up tight!"
Job,32,20,I'm gonna say my piece so I can feel refreshed: gonna speak up and share my thoughts. #breathe
Job,32,21,"Like, yo, I really hope you guys can like, not judge people based on their appearances or like, give them unnecessary compliments and stuff."
Job,32,22,"Because for real, I don't do that fake nice talk stuff. If I did, my creator would cancel me real quick."
Job,33,1,"Yo, Job, I'm begging you to listen up to what I gotta say and pay attention to every word I'm spitting."
Job,33,2,"Yo, listen up! I'm about to speak some truth right now. My words are straight from the heart, coming straight off my tongue. {in my mouth: Heb. in my palate}"
Job,33,3,I'll speak from the core of my being and drop some serious wisdom with my words.
Job,33,4,"God's Spirit totally created me, and the Almighty's breath totally gave me life."
Job,33,5,"If you think you can respond, organize your words and show up."
Job,33,6,"Yo, I'm here representing God, just like you asked. I'm made from the same stuff as you, molded from the clay. (mouth: Hebrew for wish) (cut: Hebrew for formed)"
Job,33,7,"Yo, don't trip, my scares won't spook you, and my grip won't weigh you down."
Job,33,8,"For real, I was right there when you spoke, and I totally heard every word you said, like straight up. You were like, 'Listen up, everyone!' and I was all ears, you know what I'm saying?"
Job,33,9,"I'm totally blameless, no mistakes on my part, I swear; there's absolutely no evil in me either."
Job,33,10,"Yo, like, he's always looking for reasons to come at me, treating me like his enemy and stuff."
Job,33,11,"He totally traps me with stocks, monitoring my every move."
Job,33,12,"Listen up, fam, you gotta realize that in this situation, you can't front like you're in the right. I'm about to school you and let you know that God is way more superior than any human being."
Job,33,13,"Why are you even bothering to argue with Him? Like, He doesn't owe anyone an explanation for what He does."
Job,33,14,"God be dropping knowledge, like, twice, but humans don't even notice it, man."
Job,33,15,"So, like, imagine this: you're snoozing away in your cozy bed, totally knocked out, when suddenly you start having this crazy dream or like a super vivid vision in the middle of the night. It's deep, man! And your mind's just drifting off into la-la land while you're catching some Z's."
Job,33,16,"And then he like totally gets people to listen up and seals the deal with their lessons, you know, he like reveals stuff and uncovers things, you feel me?"
Job,33,17,"So that he can redirect our focus and teach us humility, instead of being self-centered and prideful."
Job,33,18,He saves himself from deep trouble and keeps his life from being destroyed by violence.
Job,33,19,"Yo, he gets totally wrecked with pain in his bed, his bones are like hurting so bad, man. It's intense, dude!"
Job,33,20,"He can't even with food anymore, and he only craves the most bougie meals. (bougie...: meaning super fancy)"
Job,33,21,"Yo, this dude's body is straight up disappearing. His flesh is like gone, nothing left to see. And his bones, man, they're sticking out like crazy!"
Job,33,22,"Yeah, his soul is getting close to the grave, and his life is, like, about to go down with the destroyers."
Job,33,23,"If there's someone who's good at explaining things, like a top-tier influencer, one in a thousand, to teach people how to live righteously:"
Job,33,24,"And like, God treats him with mad grace, and is all like, 'Save him from going to the dark place, yo! I found the ultimate rescue plan, fam. It's lit!' {a ransom: or, an atonement}"
Job,33,25,"Yo, his body gonna be mad rejuvenated, like straight up fresher than a baby's. He gonna go back to his days of youth and feel young again, you know what I mean? Like, childhood-level young and stuff."
Job,33,26,"When he prays to God, God will totally be chill with him, and he'll be stoked to see God's face with mad joy, 'cause God's gonna show him how righteous he is."

Job,34,13,"Like, who made him the boss of the whole earth? And who set up everything in the world, you know? Like, who gave him the authority to do all that? Can anyone answer that? Like, did he just take charge of everything by himself?"
Job,34,14,"If God really cared about humans and decided to keep their souls and life force to himself,"
Job,34,15,"Like, everyone's gonna die, man, and we'll all just become dust again."
Job,34,16,"Yo, if you're woke, listen up: pay attention to what I'm sayin'."
Job,34,17,"Like, should someone who totally hates fairness actually be in charge? And are you seriously gonna judge someone who's like the absolute definition of righteousness?"

Job,34,19,"Yo, imagine, like, if someone doesn't give special treatment to those fancy-shmancy VIPs, or think they're all that just 'cause they got stacks. 'Cause, like, we're all created by the same Boss, man."

Job,34,29,"Yo, when God brings peace, nobody gotta worry 'bout drama. And when He steps back, who's gonna peep Him? Whether He's pullin' a move on a whole nation or just one person, it don't matter."
Job,34,30,"We don't want the fake people running the show, otherwise everyone else gets caught in their mess."
Job,34,31,"Like, for sure it's cool to tell God, yo, I've handled the consequences, I won't mess up again:"

Job,34,33,"If that's what you think, He'll handle it. Whether you like it or not, it's not up to me. So just say what you actually know."
Job,34,34,"Yo, I need some enlightened dudes to drop some wisdom on me, and let a super smart dude listen up. {of...: Like, they gotta be real deep thinkers}"
Job,34,35,"Job just be talking without knowing what's up, his words be lacking wisdom."
Job,34,36,"I really want Job to prove himself all the way through with his responses to those wicked dudes. Like, let's put him to the test till the very end. (P.S. Dad, you cool with this?)"
Job,34,37,"He's just piling up more trouble with his rebellious attitude, getting all up in our faces and talking a big game against God."
Job,35,1,"And then Elihu went on to say,"
Job,35,2,Do you seriously think it's cool for you to say that your righteousness is better than God's?
Job,35,3,"You were like, what's the point? What will I gain if I'm really sorry for my mistake? Like, is it even worth it?"
Job,35,4,"I got you, fam! I'm about to drop some knowledge on you and your squad. {return...: Or in other words, I'll hit you back with some wise words}"
Job,35,5,"Yo, check out the sky and peep the clouds, they're way higher than you, fam."
Job,35,6,"Yo, if you mess up, what does it even do to Him? Like, if you keep on messing up, what does that even do to Him?"
Job,35,7,"If you're truly righteous, what do you really have to offer? What can you possibly give God that He doesn't already have?"
Job,35,8,"Your wickedness can harm someone just like you are, and your righteousness can benefit another person."
Job,35,9,"Because they keep on oppressing so many people, the oppressed can't help but cry out in agony. Their cries are a desperate plea for help against those who have the power to harm them."
Job,35,10,"But, like, nobody's really asking, you know, like where's God, the one who created me, the one who brings that dope music vibe in the darkest of nights?"
Job,35,11,"Who's got the lowdown on life better than the animals, and makes us more in the know than the birds up in the sky?"
Job,35,12,"They're all like, crying out for help, but no one's listening, 'cause those wicked people are too arrogant to care."
Job,35,13,"Like, seriously, God ain't gonna be into all that fake and empty stuff, man. That Almighty power? Yeah, He won't even pay attention to it."
Job,35,14,"Even if you think you won't see Him, know that He still knows what's right; So put your trust in Him."
Job,35,15,"But like, right now things aren't going so well and God's like, totally angry and stuff. But he's not like, over-the-top mad, you know? He's just venting a bit, and Job doesn't even realize it yet."
Job,35,16,"So basically, Job is just talking a whole lot of nonsense without knowing what he's saying."
Job,36,1,"And then Elihu was like,"
Job,36,2,"Hang on for a sec, I've got more to say on God's behalf. There are still some words I need to drop about the Big Guy upstairs."
Job,36,3,I'm gonna expand my horizons and give props to the one who made me with incredible skills.

Job,36,5,"Yo, check it out. God is straight up powerful, and He doesn't ignore nobody. He's got mad strength and wisdom, you feel me? Wisdom, like, deep in His heart and all that."
Job,36,6,"He doesn't let bad guys get away with it: but gives justice to those who are struggling. {struggling: or, going through a tough time}"
Job,36,7,"God never takes his eyes off the righteous, he even puts them on a throne next to kings. He keeps them there forever, and they become totally exalted."
Job,36,8,"And if they're trapped in chains, held down by endless suffering;"

Job,36,10,He helps them to understand correction and tells them to turn away from wrongdoing.
Job,36,11,"If they do what He says and serve Him, they'll have a chill life and enjoy themselves all the way."
Job,36,12,"But if they don't listen up, they'll totally get wrecked and won't even have a clue. #RIP #NoKnowledge"
Job,36,13,But the fakes who pretend to be righteous only bring upon themselves anger and don't even bother to cry out when they get caught.
Job,36,14,"They pass away while they're still young, living a life amidst those who are impure. (By impure, it means those who engage in wrongful acts)"
Job,36,15,"God helps out the struggling when they're going through tough times, and helps them understand what's really going on when they're being mistreated."
Job,36,16,"He would totally have taken you out of that tight spot and put you in a super chill place, where things are spacious and never cramped. And your table would be filled with the most delicious and satisfying food ever. Like seriously, a feast for days!"
