1 Corinthians,10,3,"all ate the same spiritual food,"
1 Corinthians,10,4,"and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ."
1 Corinthians,10,5,"But with most of them God was not well pleased, for their bodies were scattered in the wilderness."
1 Corinthians,10,6,"Now these things became our examples, to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted."
1 Corinthians,10,7,"And do not become idolaters as were some of them. As it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.”"
1 Corinthians,10,8,"Nor let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell;"
1 Corinthians,10,9,"nor let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed by serpents;"
1 Corinthians,10,10,"nor complain, as some of them also complained, and were destroyed by the destroyer."
1 Corinthians,10,11,"Now all these things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come."
1 Corinthians,10,12,Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.
1 Corinthians,10,13,"No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it."
1 Corinthians,10,14,"Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry."
1 Corinthians,10,15,I speak as to wise men; judge for yourselves what I say.
1 Corinthians,10,16,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?"
1 Corinthians,10,17,"For we, though many, are one bread and one body; for we all partake of that one bread."
1 Corinthians,10,18,Observe Israel after the flesh: Are not those who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
1 Corinthians,10,19,"What am I saying then? That an idol is anything, or what is offered to idols is anything?"
1 Corinthians,10,20,"Rather, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to have fellowship with demons."
1 Corinthians,10,21,You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the Lord’s table and of the table of demons.
1 Corinthians,10,22,Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?
1 Corinthians,10,23,"All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful; all things are lawful for me, but not all things edify."
1 Corinthians,10,24,"Let no one seek his own, but each one the other’s well-being."
1 Corinthians,10,25,"Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, asking no questions for conscience’ sake;"
1 Corinthians,10,26,"for “the earth is the LORD’s, and all its fullness.”"
1 Corinthians,10,27,"If any of those who do not believe invites you to dinner, and you desire to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no question for conscience’ sake."
1 Corinthians,10,28,"But if anyone says to you, “This was offered to idols,” do not eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for conscience’ sake; for “the earth is the LORD’s, and all its fullness.”"
1 Corinthians,10,29,"“Conscience,” I say, not your own, but that of the other. For why is my liberty judged by another man’s conscience?"
1 Corinthians,10,30,"But if I partake with thanks, why am I evil spoken of for the food over which I give thanks?"
1 Corinthians,10,31,"Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
1 Corinthians,10,32,"Give no offense, either to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the church of God,"
1 Corinthians,10,33,"just as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved."
1 Corinthians,11,1,"Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ."
1 Corinthians,11,2,"Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions just as I delivered them to you."
1 Corinthians,11,3,"But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God."
1 Corinthians,11,4,"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head."
1 Corinthians,11,5,"But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for that is one and the same as if her head were shaved."
1 Corinthians,11,6,"For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered."
1 Corinthians,11,7,"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man."
1 Corinthians,11,8,"For man is not from woman, but woman from man."
1 Corinthians,11,9,"Nor was man created for the woman, but woman for the man."
1 Corinthians,11,10,"For this reason the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels."
1 Corinthians,11,11,"Nevertheless, neither is man independent of woman, nor woman independent of man, in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,11,12,"For as woman came from man, even so man also comes through woman; but all things are from God."
1 Corinthians,11,13,Judge among yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
1 Corinthians,11,14,"Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?"
1 Corinthians,11,15,"But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering."
1 Corinthians,11,16,"But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God."
1 Corinthians,11,17,"Now in giving these instructions I do not praise you, since you come together not for the better but for the worse."
1 Corinthians,11,18,"For first of all, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it."
1 Corinthians,11,19,"For there must also be factions among you, that those who are approved may be recognized among you."
1 Corinthians,11,20,"Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper."
1 Corinthians,11,21,"For in eating, each one takes his own supper ahead of others; and one is hungry and another is drunk."
1 Corinthians,11,22,What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.
1 Corinthians,11,23,For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread;
1 Corinthians,11,24,"and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”"
1 Corinthians,11,25,"In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”"
1 Corinthians,11,26,"For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death till He comes."
1 Corinthians,11,27,Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
1 Corinthians,11,28,"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup."
1 Corinthians,11,29,"For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body."
1 Corinthians,11,30,"For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep."
1 Corinthians,11,31,"For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged."
1 Corinthians,11,32,"But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world."
1 Corinthians,11,33,"Therefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another."
1 Corinthians,11,34,"But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant:"
1 Corinthians,12,2,"You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, however you were led."
1 Corinthians,12,3,"Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,4,"There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,5,"There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord."
1 Corinthians,12,6,"And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all."
1 Corinthians,12,7,But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all:
1 Corinthians,12,8,"for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit,"
1 Corinthians,12,9,"to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit,"
1 Corinthians,12,10,"to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues."
1 Corinthians,12,11,"But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills."
1 Corinthians,12,12,"For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ."
1 Corinthians,12,13,"For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and have all been made to drink into one Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,14,For in fact the body is not one member but many.
1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body,” is it therefore not of the body?"
1 Corinthians,12,16,"And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body,” is it therefore not of the body?"
1 Corinthians,12,17,"If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?"
1 Corinthians,12,18,"But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He pleased."
1 Corinthians,12,19,"And if they were all one member, where would the body be?"
1 Corinthians,12,20,"But now indeed there are many members, yet one body."
1 Corinthians,12,21,"And the eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you”; nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”"
1 Corinthians,12,22,"No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary."
1 Corinthians,12,23,"And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable parts have greater modesty,"
1 Corinthians,12,24,"but our presentable parts have no need. But God composed the body, having given greater honor to that part which lacks it,"
1 Corinthians,12,25,"that there should be no schism in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another."
1 Corinthians,12,26,"And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it."
1 Corinthians,12,27,"Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually."
1 Corinthians,12,28,"And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues."
1 Corinthians,12,29,Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles?
1 Corinthians,12,30,Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
1 Corinthians,12,31,But earnestly desire the best gifts. And yet I show you a more excellent way.
1 Corinthians,13,1,"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal."
1 Corinthians,13,2,"And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,3,"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up;"
1 Corinthians,13,5,"does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil;"
1 Corinthians,13,6,"does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;"
1 Corinthians,13,7,"bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."
1 Corinthians,13,8,"Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away."
1 Corinthians,13,9,For we know in part and we prophesy in part.
1 Corinthians,13,10,"But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away."
1 Corinthians,13,11,"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things."
1 Corinthians,13,12,"For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known."
1 Corinthians,13,13,"And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Pursue love, and desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy."
1 Corinthians,14,2,"For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God, for no one understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries."
1 Corinthians,14,3,But he who prophesies speaks edification and exhortation and comfort to men.
1 Corinthians,14,4,"He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church."
1 Corinthians,14,5,"I wish you all spoke with tongues, but even more that you prophesied; for he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless indeed he interprets, that the church may receive edification."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation, by knowledge, by prophesying, or by teaching?"
1 Corinthians,14,7,"Even things without life, whether flute or harp, when they make a sound, unless they make a distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is piped or played?"
1 Corinthians,14,8,"For if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound, who will prepare for battle?"
1 Corinthians,14,9,"So likewise you, unless you utter by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air."
1 Corinthians,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them is without significance."
1 Corinthians,14,11,"Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be a foreigner to him who speaks, and he who speaks will be a foreigner to me."
1 Corinthians,14,12,"Even so you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, let it be for the edification of the church that you seek to excel."
1 Corinthians,14,13,Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
1 Corinthians,14,14,"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful."
1 Corinthians,14,15,"What is the conclusion then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the understanding. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the understanding."
1 Corinthians,14,16,"Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say “Amen” at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you say?"
1 Corinthians,14,17,"For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not edified."
1 Corinthians,14,18,I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all;
1 Corinthians,14,19,"yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue."
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brethren, do not be children in understanding; however, in malice be babes, but in understanding be mature."
1 Corinthians,14,21,"In the law it is written: “With men of other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; And yet, for all that, they will not hear Me,” says the Lord."
1 Corinthians,14,22,"Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe."
1 Corinthians,14,23,"Therefore if the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those who are uninformed or unbelievers, will they not say that you are out of your mind?"
1 Corinthians,14,24,"But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an uninformed person comes in, he is convinced by all, he is convicted by all."
1 Corinthians,14,25,"And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed; and so, falling down on his face, he will worship God and report that God is truly among you."
1 Corinthians,14,26,"How is it then, brethren? Whenever you come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification."
1 Corinthians,14,27,"If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at the most three, each in turn, and let one interpret."
1 Corinthians,14,28,"But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God."
1 Corinthians,14,29,"Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge."
1 Corinthians,14,30,"But if anything is revealed to another who sits by, let the first keep silent."
1 Corinthians,14,31,"For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged."
1 Corinthians,14,32,And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
1 Corinthians,14,33,"For God is not the author of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints."
1 Corinthians,14,34,"Let your women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they are to be submissive, as the law also says."
1 Corinthians,14,35,"And if they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in church."
1 Corinthians,14,36,Or did the word of God come originally from you? Or was it you only that it reached?
1 Corinthians,14,37,"If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord."
1 Corinthians,14,38,"But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant."
1 Corinthians,14,39,"Therefore, brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues."
1 Corinthians,14,40,Let all things be done decently and in order.
1 Corinthians,15,1,"Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand,"
1 Corinthians,15,2,"by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain."
1 Corinthians,15,3,"For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,"
1 Corinthians,15,4,"and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,"
1 Corinthians,15,5,"and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve."
1 Corinthians,15,6,"After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep."
1 Corinthians,15,7,"After that He was seen by James, then by all the apostles."
1 Corinthians,15,8,"Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time."
1 Corinthians,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
1 Corinthians,15,10,"But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."
1 Corinthians,15,11,"Therefore, whether it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed."
1 Corinthians,15,12,"Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
1 Corinthians,15,13,"But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen."
1 Corinthians,15,14,"And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty."
1 Corinthians,15,15,"Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up—if in fact the dead do not rise."
1 Corinthians,15,16,"For if the dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen."
1 Corinthians,15,17,"And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins!"
1 Corinthians,15,18,Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
1 Corinthians,15,19,"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable."
1 Corinthians,15,20,"But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep."
1 Corinthians,15,21,"For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead."
1 Corinthians,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive."
1 Corinthians,15,23,"But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who are Christ’s at His coming."
1 Corinthians,15,24,"Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power."
1 Corinthians,15,25,For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet.
1 Corinthians,15,26,The last enemy that will be destroyed is death.
1 Corinthians,15,27,"For “He has put all things under His feet.” But when He says “all things are put under Him,” it is evident that He who put all things under Him is excepted."
1 Corinthians,15,28,"Now when all things are made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all."
1 Corinthians,15,29,"Otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why then are they baptized for the dead?"
1 Corinthians,15,30,And why do we stand in jeopardy every hour?
1 Corinthians,15,31,"I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."
1 Corinthians,15,32,"If, in the manner of men, I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me? If the dead do not rise, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!”"
1 Corinthians,15,33,Do not be deceived: “Evil company corrupts good habits.”
1 Corinthians,15,34,"Awake to righteousness, and do not sin; for some do not have the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame."
1 Corinthians,15,35,"But someone will say, “How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?”"
1 Corinthians,15,36,"Foolish one, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies."
1 Corinthians,15,37,"And what you sow, you do not sow that body that shall be, but mere grain—perhaps wheat or some other grain."
1 Corinthians,15,38,"But God gives it a body as He pleases, and to each seed its own body."
1 Corinthians,15,39,"All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds."
1 Corinthians,15,40,"There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another."
1 Corinthians,15,41,"There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory."
1 Corinthians,15,42,"So also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption."
1 Corinthians,15,43,"It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power."
1 Corinthians,15,44,"It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."
1 Corinthians,15,45,"And so it is written, “The first man Adam became a living being.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit."
1 Corinthians,15,46,"However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual."
1 Corinthians,15,47,"The first man was of the earth, made of dust; the second Man is the Lord from heaven."
1 Corinthians,15,48,"As was the man of dust, so also are those who are made of dust; and as is the heavenly Man, so also are those who are heavenly."
1 Corinthians,15,49,"And as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly Man."
1 Corinthians,15,50,"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does corruption inherit incorruption."
1 Corinthians,15,51,"Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed—"
1 Corinthians,15,52,"in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."
1 Corinthians,15,53,"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."
1 Corinthians,15,54,"So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”"
1 Corinthians,15,55,"“O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?”"
1 Corinthians,15,56,"The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law."
1 Corinthians,15,57,"But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,15,58,"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,16,1,"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, so you must do also:"
1 Corinthians,16,2,"On the first day of the week let each one of you lay something aside, storing up as he may prosper, that there be no collections when I come."
1 Corinthians,16,3,"And when I come, whomever you approve by your letters I will send to bear your gift to Jerusalem."
1 Corinthians,16,4,"But if it is fitting that I go also, they will go with me."
1 Corinthians,16,5,Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia (for I am passing through Macedonia).
1 Corinthians,16,6,"And it may be that I will remain, or even spend the winter with you, that you may send me on my journey, wherever I go."
1 Corinthians,16,7,"For I do not wish to see you now on the way; but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits."
1 Corinthians,16,8,But I will tarry in Ephesus until Pentecost.
1 Corinthians,16,9,"For a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries."
1 Corinthians,16,10,"And if Timothy comes, see that he may be with you without fear; for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do."
1 Corinthians,16,11,"Therefore let no one despise him. But send him on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I am waiting for him with the brethren."
1 Corinthians,16,12,"Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brethren, but he was quite unwilling to come at this time; however, he will come when he has a convenient time."
1 Corinthians,16,13,"Watch, stand fast in the faith, be brave, be strong."
1 Corinthians,16,14,Let all that you do be done with love.
1 Corinthians,16,15,"I urge you, brethren—you know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the ministry of the saints—"
1 Corinthians,16,16,"that you also submit to such, and to everyone who works and labors with us."
1 Corinthians,16,17,"I am glad about the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, for what was lacking on your part they supplied."
1 Corinthians,16,18,For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men.
1 Corinthians,16,19,"The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house."
1 Corinthians,16,20,All the brethren greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1 Corinthians,16,21,The salutation with my own hand—Paul’s.
1 Corinthians,16,22,"If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. O Lord, come!"
1 Corinthians,16,23,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
1 Corinthians,16,24,My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2 Corinthians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:"
2 Corinthians,1,2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Corinthians,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,"
2 Corinthians,1,4,"who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God."
2 Corinthians,1,5,"For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds through Christ."
2 Corinthians,1,6,"Now if we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effective for enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer. Or if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation."
2 Corinthians,1,7,"And our hope for you is steadfast, because we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you will partake of the consolation."
2 Corinthians,1,8,"For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our trouble which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life."
2 Corinthians,1,9,"Yes, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead,"
2 Corinthians,1,10,"who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver us; in whom we trust that He will still deliver us,"
2 Corinthians,1,11,"you also helping together in prayer for us, that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the gift granted to us through many."
2 Corinthians,1,12,"For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God, and more abundantly toward you."
2 Corinthians,1,13,"For we are not writing any other things to you than what you read or understand. Now I trust you will understand, even to the end"
2 Corinthians,1,14,"(as also you have understood us in part), that we are your boast as you also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus."
2 Corinthians,1,15,"And in this confidence I intended to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit—"
2 Corinthians,1,16,"to pass by way of you to Macedonia, to come again from Macedonia to you, and be helped by you on my way to Judea."
2 Corinthians,1,17,"Therefore, when I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or the things I plan, do I plan according to the flesh, that with me there should be Yes, Yes, and No, No?"
2 Corinthians,1,18,"But as God is faithful, our word to you was not Yes and No."
2 Corinthians,1,19,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me, Silvanus, and Timothy—was not Yes and No, but in Him was Yes."
2 Corinthians,1,20,"For all the promises of God in Him are Yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God through us."
2 Corinthians,1,21,"Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us is God,"
2 Corinthians,1,22,who also has sealed us and given us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.
2 Corinthians,1,23,"Moreover I call God as witness against my soul, that to spare you I came no more to Corinth."
2 Corinthians,1,24,"Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are fellow workers for your joy; for by faith you stand."
2 Corinthians,2,1,"But I determined this within myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow."
2 Corinthians,2,2,"For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me?"
2 Corinthians,2,3,"And I wrote this very thing to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow over those from whom I ought to have joy, having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all."
2 Corinthians,2,4,"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you."
2 Corinthians,2,5,"But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but all of you to some extent—not to be too severe."
2 Corinthians,2,6,"This punishment which was inflicted by the majority is sufficient for such a man,"
2 Corinthians,2,7,"so that, on the contrary, you ought rather to forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow."
2 Corinthians,2,8,Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love to him.
2 Corinthians,2,9,"For to this end I also wrote, that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things."
2 Corinthians,2,10,"Now whom you forgive anything, I also forgive. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,"
2 Corinthians,2,11,lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.
2 Corinthians,2,12,"Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened to me by the Lord,"
2 Corinthians,2,13,"I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia."
2 Corinthians,2,14,"Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place."
2 Corinthians,2,15,For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.
2 Corinthians,2,16,"To the one we are the aroma of death leading to death, and to the other the aroma of life leading to life. And who is sufficient for these things?"
2 Corinthians,2,17,"For we are not, as so many, peddling the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ."
2 Corinthians,3,1,"Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some others, epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you?"
2 Corinthians,3,2,"You are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read by all men;"
2 Corinthians,3,3,"clearly you are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of flesh, that is, of the heart."
2 Corinthians,3,4,And we have such trust through Christ toward God.
2 Corinthians,3,5,"Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as being from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God,"
2 Corinthians,3,6,"who also made us sufficient as ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."
2 Corinthians,3,7,"But if the ministry of death, written and engraved on stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance, which glory was passing away,"
2 Corinthians,3,8,how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious?
2 Corinthians,3,9,"For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, the ministry of righteousness exceeds much more in glory."
2 Corinthians,3,10,"For even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that excels."
2 Corinthians,3,11,"For if what is passing away was glorious, what remains is much more glorious."
2 Corinthians,3,12,"Therefore, since we have such hope, we use great boldness of speech—"
2 Corinthians,3,13,"unlike Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the end of what was passing away."
2 Corinthians,3,14,"But their minds were blinded. For until this day the same veil remains unlifted in the reading of the Old Testament, because the veil is taken away in Christ."
2 Corinthians,3,15,"But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart."
2 Corinthians,3,16,"Nevertheless when one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away."
2 Corinthians,3,17,"Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
2 Corinthians,3,18,"But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord."
2 Corinthians,4,1,"Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not lose heart."
2 Corinthians,4,2,"But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God."
2 Corinthians,4,3,"But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,"
2 Corinthians,4,4,"whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them."
2 Corinthians,4,5,"For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus’ sake."
2 Corinthians,4,6,"For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
2 Corinthians,4,7,"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us."
2 Corinthians,4,8,"We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;"
2 Corinthians,4,9,"persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed—"
2 Corinthians,4,10,"always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body."
2 Corinthians,4,11,"For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus’ sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh."
2 Corinthians,4,12,"So then death is working in us, but life in you."
2 Corinthians,4,13,"And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, “I believed and therefore I spoke,” we also believe and therefore speak,"
2 Corinthians,4,14,"knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus, and will present us with you."
2 Corinthians,4,15,"For all things are for your sakes, that grace, having spread through the many, may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God."
2 Corinthians,4,16,"Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day."
2 Corinthians,4,17,"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,"
2 Corinthians,4,18,"while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
2 Corinthians,5,1,"For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
2 Corinthians,5,2,"For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven,"
2 Corinthians,5,3,"if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked."
2 Corinthians,5,4,"For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life."
2 Corinthians,5,5,"Now He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee."
2 Corinthians,5,6,"So we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord."
2 Corinthians,5,7,"For we walk by faith, not by sight."
2 Corinthians,5,8,"We are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord."
2 Corinthians,5,9,"Therefore we make it our aim, whether present or absent, to be well pleasing to Him."
2 Corinthians,5,10,"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad."
2 Corinthians,5,11,"Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are well known to God, and I also trust are well known in your consciences."
2 Corinthians,5,12,"For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but give you opportunity to boast on our behalf, that you may have an answer for those who boast in appearance and not in heart."
2 Corinthians,5,13,"For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; or if we are of sound mind, it is for you."
2 Corinthians,5,14,"For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died;"
2 Corinthians,5,15,"and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again."
2 Corinthians,5,16,"Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him thus no longer."
2 Corinthians,5,17,"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new."
2 Corinthians,5,18,"Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation,"
2 Corinthians,5,19,"that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation."
2 Corinthians,5,20,"Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ’s behalf, be reconciled to God."
2 Corinthians,5,21,"For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."
2 Corinthians,6,1,"We then, as workers together with Him also plead with you not to receive the grace of God in vain."
2 Corinthians,6,2,"For He says: “In an acceptable time I have heard you, And in the day of salvation I have helped you.” Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation."
2 Corinthians,6,3,"We give no offense in anything, that our ministry may not be blamed."
2 Corinthians,6,4,"But in all things we commend ourselves as ministers of God: in much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distresses,"
2 Corinthians,6,5,"in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in fastings;"
2 Corinthians,6,6,"by purity, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love,"
2 Corinthians,6,7,"by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,"
2 Corinthians,6,8,"by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;"
2 Corinthians,6,9,"as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and yet not killed;"
2 Corinthians,6,10,"as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things."
2 Corinthians,6,11,"O Corinthians! We have spoken openly to you, our heart is wide open."
2 Corinthians,6,12,"You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections."
2 Corinthians,6,13,"Now in return for the same (I speak as to children), you also be open."
2 Corinthians,6,14,Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?
2 Corinthians,6,15,And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever?
2 Corinthians,6,16,"And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will dwell in them And walk among them. I will be their God, And they shall be My people.”"
2 Corinthians,6,17,"Therefore “Come out from among them And be separate, says the Lord. Do not touch what is unclean, And I will receive you.”"
2 Corinthians,6,18,"“I will be a Father to you, And you shall be My sons and daughters, Says the LORD Almighty.”"
2 Corinthians,7,1,"Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
2 Corinthians,7,2,"Open your hearts to us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have cheated no one."
2 Corinthians,7,3,"I do not say this to condemn; for I have said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together."
2 Corinthians,7,4,"Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation."
2 Corinthians,7,5,"For indeed, when we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were troubled on every side. Outside were conflicts, inside were fears."
2 Corinthians,7,6,"Nevertheless God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,"
2 Corinthians,7,7,"and not only by his coming, but also by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us of your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more."
2 Corinthians,7,8,"For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it. For I perceive that the same epistle made you sorry, though only for a while."
2 Corinthians,7,9,"Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow led to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer loss from us in nothing."
2 Corinthians,7,10,"For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death."
2 Corinthians,7,11,"For observe this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What diligence it produced in you, what clearing of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what vehement desire, what zeal, what vindication! In all things you proved yourselves to be clear in this matter."
2 Corinthians,7,12,"Therefore, although I wrote to you, I did not do it for the sake of him who had done the wrong, nor for the sake of him who suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you."
2 Corinthians,7,13,"Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort. And we rejoiced exceedingly more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all."
2 Corinthians,7,14,"For if in anything I have boasted to him about you, I am not ashamed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting to Titus was found true."
2 Corinthians,7,15,"And his affections are greater for you as he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him."
2 Corinthians,7,16,Therefore I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.
2 Corinthians,8,1,"Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia:"
2 Corinthians,8,2,that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their liberality.
2 Corinthians,8,3,"For I bear witness that according to their ability, yes, and beyond their ability, they were freely willing,"
2 Corinthians,8,4,imploring us with much urgency that we would receive the gift and the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
2 Corinthians,8,5,"And not only as we had hoped, but they first gave themselves to the Lord, and then to us by the will of God."
2 Corinthians,8,6,"So we urged Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also complete this grace in you as well."
2 Corinthians,8,7,"But as you abound in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us—see that you abound in this grace also."
2 Corinthians,8,8,"I speak not by commandment, but I am testing the sincerity of your love by the diligence of others."
2 Corinthians,8,9,"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich."
2 Corinthians,8,10,And in this I give advice: It is to your advantage not only to be doing what you began and were desiring to do a year ago;
2 Corinthians,8,11,"but now you also must complete the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to desire it, so there also may be a completion out of what you have."
2 Corinthians,8,12,"For if there is first a willing mind, it is accepted according to what one has, and not according to what he does not have."
2 Corinthians,8,13,For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened;
2 Corinthians,8,14,"but by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may supply their lack, that their abundance also may supply your lack—that there may be equality."
2 Corinthians,8,15,"As it is written, “He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack.”"
2 Corinthians,8,16,But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.
2 Corinthians,8,17,"For he not only accepted the exhortation, but being more diligent, he went to you of his own accord."
2 Corinthians,8,18,"And we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches,"
2 Corinthians,8,19,"and not only that, but who was also chosen by the churches to travel with us with this gift, which is administered by us to the glory of the Lord Himself and to show your ready mind,"
2 Corinthians,8,20,avoiding this: that anyone should blame us in this lavish gift which is administered by us—
2 Corinthians,8,21,"providing honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men."
2 Corinthians,8,22,"And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, because of the great confidence which we have in you."
2 Corinthians,8,23,"If anyone inquires about Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker concerning you. Or if our brethren are inquired about, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ."
2 Corinthians,8,24,"Therefore show to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf."
2 Corinthians,9,1,"Now concerning the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you;"
2 Corinthians,9,2,"for I know your willingness, about which I boast of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has stirred up the majority."
2 Corinthians,9,3,"Yet I have sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this respect, that, as I said, you may be ready;"
2 Corinthians,9,4,"lest if some Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to mention you!) should be ashamed of this confident boasting."
2 Corinthians,9,5,"Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to go to you ahead of time, and prepare your generous gift beforehand, which you had previously promised, that it may be ready as a matter of generosity and not as a grudging obligation."
2 Corinthians,9,6,"But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully."
2 Corinthians,9,7,"So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver."
2 Corinthians,9,8,"And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work."
2 Corinthians,9,9,"As it is written: “He has dispersed abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.”"
2 Corinthians,9,10,"Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness,"
2 Corinthians,9,11,"while you are enriched in everything for all liberality, which causes thanksgiving through us to God."
2 Corinthians,9,12,"For the administration of this service not only supplies the needs of the saints, but also is abounding through many thanksgivings to God,"
2 Corinthians,9,13,"while, through the proof of this ministry, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal sharing with them and all men,"
2 Corinthians,9,14,"and by their prayer for you, who long for you because of the exceeding grace of God in you."
2 Corinthians,9,15,Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!
2 Corinthians,10,1,"Now I, Paul, myself am pleading with you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ—who in presence am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you."
2 Corinthians,10,2,"But I beg you that when I am present I may not be bold with that confidence by which I intend to be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh."
2 Corinthians,10,3,"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh."
2 Corinthians,10,4,"For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds,"
2 Corinthians,10,5,"casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ,"
2 Corinthians,10,6,and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.
2 Corinthians,10,7,"Do you look at things according to the outward appearance? If anyone is convinced in himself that he is Christ’s, let him again consider this in himself, that just as he is Christ’s, even so we are Christ’s."
2 Corinthians,10,8,"For even if I should boast somewhat more about our authority, which the Lord gave us for edification and not for your destruction, I shall not be ashamed—"
2 Corinthians,10,9,lest I seem to terrify you by letters.
2 Corinthians,10,10,"“For his letters,” they say, “are weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.”"
2 Corinthians,10,11,"Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such we will also be in deed when we are present."
2 Corinthians,10,12,"For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with those who commend themselves. But they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise."
2 Corinthians,10,13,"We, however, will not boast beyond measure, but within the limits of the sphere which God appointed us—a sphere which especially includes you."
2 Corinthians,10,14,"For we are not overextending ourselves (as though our authority did not extend to you), for it was to you that we came with the gospel of Christ;"
2 Corinthians,10,15,"not boasting of things beyond measure, that is, in other men’s labors, but having hope, that as your faith is increased, we shall be greatly enlarged by you in our sphere,"
2 Corinthians,10,16,"to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man’s sphere of accomplishment."
2 Corinthians,10,17,"But “he who glories, let him glory in the LORD.”"
2 Corinthians,10,18,"For not he who commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends."
2 Corinthians,11,1,"Oh, that you would bear with me in a little folly—and indeed you do bear with me."
2 Corinthians,11,2,"For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,3,"But I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,4,"For if he who comes preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or if you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted—you may well put up with it!"
2 Corinthians,11,5,For I consider that I am not at all inferior to the most eminent apostles.
2 Corinthians,11,6,"Even though I am untrained in speech, yet I am not in knowledge. But we have been thoroughly manifested among you in all things."
2 Corinthians,11,7,"Did I commit sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge?"
2 Corinthians,11,8,"I robbed other churches, taking wages from them to minister to you."
2 Corinthians,11,9,"And when I was present with you, and in need, I was a burden to no one, for what I lacked the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied. And in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so I will keep myself."
2 Corinthians,11,10,"As the truth of Christ is in me, no one shall stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia."
2 Corinthians,11,11,Why? Because I do not love you? God knows!
2 Corinthians,11,12,"But what I do, I will also continue to do, that I may cut off the opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the things of which they boast."
2 Corinthians,11,13,"For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,14,And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.
2 Corinthians,11,15,"Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works."
2 Corinthians,11,16,"I say again, let no one think me a fool. If otherwise, at least receive me as a fool, that I also may boast a little."
2 Corinthians,11,17,"What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as it were, foolishly, in this confidence of boasting."
2 Corinthians,11,18,"Seeing that many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast."
2 Corinthians,11,19,"For you put up with fools gladly, since you yourselves are wise!"
2 Corinthians,11,20,"For you put up with it if one brings you into bondage, if one devours you, if one takes from you, if one exalts himself, if one strikes you on the face."
2 Corinthians,11,21,To our shame I say that we were too weak for that! But in whatever anyone is bold—I speak foolishly—I am bold also.
2 Corinthians,11,22,Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.
2 Corinthians,11,23,"Are they ministers of Christ?—I speak as a fool—I am more: in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often."
2 Corinthians,11,24,From the Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one.
2 Corinthians,11,25,Three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been in the deep;
2 Corinthians,11,26,"in journeys often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of my own countrymen, in perils of the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;"
2 Corinthians,11,27,"in weariness and toil, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness—"
2 Corinthians,11,28,"besides the other things, what comes upon me daily: my deep concern for all the churches."
2 Corinthians,11,29,"Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn with indignation?"
2 Corinthians,11,30,"If I must boast, I will boast in the things which concern my infirmity."
2 Corinthians,11,31,"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying."
2 Corinthians,11,32,"In Damascus the governor, under Aretas the king, was guarding the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desiring to arrest me;"
2 Corinthians,11,33,"but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped from his hands."
2 Corinthians,12,1,It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord:
2 Corinthians,12,2,"I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows—such a one was caught up to the third heaven."
2 Corinthians,12,3,"And I know such a man—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows—"
2 Corinthians,12,4,"how he was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."
2 Corinthians,12,5,"Of such a one I will boast; yet of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities."
2 Corinthians,12,6,"For though I might desire to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, lest anyone should think of me above what he sees me to be or hears from me."
2 Corinthians,12,7,"And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure."
2 Corinthians,12,8,Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me.
2 Corinthians,12,9,"And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me."
2 Corinthians,12,10,"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong."
2 Corinthians,12,11,"I have become a fool in boasting; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing was I behind the most eminent apostles, though I am nothing."
2 Corinthians,12,12,"Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you with all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds."
2 Corinthians,12,13,"For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong!"
2 Corinthians,12,14,"Now for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be burdensome to you; for I do not seek yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children."
2 Corinthians,12,15,"And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved."
2 Corinthians,12,16,"But be that as it may, I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you by cunning!"
2 Corinthians,12,17,Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you?
2 Corinthians,12,18,"I urged Titus, and sent our brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?"
2 Corinthians,12,19,"Again, do you think that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ. But we do all things, beloved, for your edification."
2 Corinthians,12,20,"For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish, and that I shall be found by you such as you do not wish; lest there be contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, backbitings, whisperings, conceits, tumults;"
2 Corinthians,12,21,"lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and I shall mourn for many who have sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness, fornication, and lewdness which they have practiced."
2 Corinthians,13,1,This will be the third time I am coming to you. “By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.”
2 Corinthians,13,2,"I have told you before, and foretell as if I were present the second time, and now being absent I write to those who have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare—"
2 Corinthians,13,3,"since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but mighty in you."
2 Corinthians,13,4,"For though He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, but we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you."
2 Corinthians,13,5,"Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you are disqualified."
2 Corinthians,13,6,But I trust that you will know that we are not disqualified.
2 Corinthians,13,7,"Now I pray to God that you do no evil, not that we should appear approved, but that you should do what is honorable, though we may seem disqualified."
2 Corinthians,13,8,"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth."
2 Corinthians,13,9,"For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. And this also we pray, that you may be made complete."
2 Corinthians,13,10,"Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the authority which the Lord has given me for edification and not for destruction."
2 Corinthians,13,11,"Finally, brethren, farewell. Become complete. Be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you."
2 Corinthians,13,12,Greet one another with a holy kiss.
2 Corinthians,13,13,All the saints greet you.
2 Corinthians,13,14,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen."
Galatians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead),"
Galatians,1,2,"and all the brethren who are with me, To the churches of Galatia:"
Galatians,1,3,"Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,"
Galatians,1,4,"who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,"
Galatians,1,5,to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
Galatians,1,6,"I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel,"
Galatians,1,7,which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.
Galatians,1,8,"But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed."
Galatians,1,9,"As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed."
Galatians,1,10,"For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ."
Galatians,1,11,"But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man."
Galatians,1,12,"For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through the revelation of Jesus Christ."
Galatians,1,13,"For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it."
Galatians,1,14,"And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers."
Galatians,1,15,"But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through His grace,"
Galatians,1,16,"to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood,"
Galatians,1,17,"nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus."
Galatians,1,18,"Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and remained with him fifteen days."
Galatians,1,19,"But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s brother."
Galatians,1,20,"(Now concerning the things which I write to you, indeed, before God, I do not lie.)"
Galatians,1,21,Afterward I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
Galatians,1,22,And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ.
Galatians,1,23,"But they were hearing only, “He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which he once tried to destroy.”"
Galatians,1,24,And they glorified God in me.
Galatians,2,1,"Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and also took Titus with me."
Galatians,2,2,"And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of reputation, lest by any means I might run, or had run, in vain."
Galatians,2,3,"Yet not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised."
Galatians,2,4,"And this occurred because of false brethren secretly brought in (who came in by stealth to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage),"
Galatians,2,5,"to whom we did not yield submission even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you."
Galatians,2,6,"But from those who seemed to be something—whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God shows personal favoritism to no man—for those who seemed to be something added nothing to me."
Galatians,2,7,"But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel for the uncircumcised had been committed to me, as the gospel for the circumcised was to Peter"
Galatians,2,8,"(for He who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised also worked effectively in me toward the Gentiles),"
Galatians,2,9,"and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that had been given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised."
Galatians,2,10,"They desired only that we should remember the poor, the very thing which I also was eager to do."
Galatians,2,11,"Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed;"
Galatians,2,12,"for before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision."
Galatians,2,13,"And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy."
Galatians,2,14,"But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, “If you, being a Jew, live in the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews, why do you compel Gentiles to live as Jews?"
Galatians,2,15,"We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,"
Galatians,2,16,"knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified."
Galatians,2,17,"“But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ therefore a minister of sin? Certainly not!"
Galatians,2,18,"For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor."
Galatians,2,19,For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God.
Galatians,2,20,"I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me."
Galatians,2,21,"I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died in vain.”"
Galatians,3,1,"O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified?"
Galatians,3,2,"This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
Galatians,3,3,"Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?"
Galatians,3,4,Have you suffered so many things in vain—if indeed it was in vain?
Galatians,3,5,"Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, does He do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?—"
Galatians,3,6,"just as Abraham “believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.”"
Galatians,3,7,Therefore know that only those who are of faith are sons of Abraham.
Galatians,3,8,"And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, “In you all the nations shall be blessed.”"
Galatians,3,9,So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.
Galatians,3,10,"For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.”"
Galatians,3,11,"But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for “the just shall live by faith.”"
Galatians,3,12,"Yet the law is not of faith, but “the man who does them shall live by them.”"
Galatians,3,13,"Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”),"
Galatians,3,14,"that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."
Galatians,3,15,"Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though it is only a man’s covenant, yet if it is confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it."
Galatians,3,16,"Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, “And to seeds,” as of many, but as of one, “And to your Seed,” who is Christ."
Galatians,3,17,"And this I say, that the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect."
Galatians,3,18,"For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no longer of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise."
Galatians,3,19,"What purpose then does the law serve? It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator."
Galatians,3,20,"Now a mediator does not mediate for one only, but God is one."
Galatians,3,21,"Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law."
Galatians,3,22,"But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe."
Galatians,3,23,"But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed."
Galatians,3,24,"Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith."
Galatians,3,25,"But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor."
Galatians,3,26,For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
Galatians,3,27,For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
Galatians,3,28,"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
Galatians,3,29,"And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise."
Galatians,4,1,"Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all,"
Galatians,4,2,but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father.
Galatians,4,3,"Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world."
Galatians,4,4,"But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law,"
Galatians,4,5,"to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons."
Galatians,4,6,"And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father!”"
Galatians,4,7,"Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ."
Galatians,4,8,"But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods."
Galatians,4,9,"But now after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how is it that you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage?"
Galatians,4,10,You observe days and months and seasons and years.
Galatians,4,11,"I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain."
Galatians,4,12,"Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I became like you. You have not injured me at all."
Galatians,4,13,You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first.
Galatians,4,14,"And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus."
Galatians,4,15,"What then was the blessing you enjoyed? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me."
Galatians,4,16,Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?
Galatians,4,17,"They zealously court you, but for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them."
Galatians,4,18,"But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you."
Galatians,4,19,"My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you,"
Galatians,4,20,I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.
Galatians,4,21,"Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?"
Galatians,4,22,"For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman."
Galatians,4,23,"But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise,"
Galatians,4,24,"which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar—"
Galatians,4,25,"for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children—"
Galatians,4,26,"but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all."
Galatians,4,27,"For it is written: “Rejoice, O barren, You who do not bear! Break forth and shout, You who are not in labor! For the desolate has many more children Than she who has a husband.”"
Galatians,4,28,"Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise."
Galatians,4,29,"But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now."
Galatians,4,30,"Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.”"
Galatians,4,31,"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free."
Galatians,5,1,"Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage."
Galatians,5,2,"Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing."
Galatians,5,3,And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law.
Galatians,5,4,"You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace."
Galatians,5,5,For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
Galatians,5,6,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love."
Galatians,5,7,You ran well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?
Galatians,5,8,This persuasion does not come from Him who calls you.
Galatians,5,9,A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
Galatians,5,10,"I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will have no other mind; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is."
Galatians,5,11,"And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then the offense of the cross has ceased."
Galatians,5,12,I could wish that those who trouble you would even cut themselves off!
Galatians,5,13,"For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another."
Galatians,5,14,"For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”"
Galatians,5,15,"But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another!"
Galatians,5,16,"I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh."
Galatians,5,17,"For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish."
Galatians,5,18,"But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law."
Galatians,5,19,"Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness,"
Galatians,5,20,"idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies,"
Galatians,5,21,"envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God."
Galatians,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,"
Galatians,5,23,"gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law."
Galatians,5,24,And those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
Galatians,5,25,"If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."
Galatians,5,26,"Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another."
Galatians,6,1,"Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted."
Galatians,6,2,"Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ."
Galatians,6,3,"For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself."
Galatians,6,4,"But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another."
Galatians,6,5,For each one shall bear his own load.
Galatians,6,6,Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.
Galatians,6,7,"Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap."
Galatians,6,8,"For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life."
Galatians,6,9,"And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart."
Galatians,6,10,"Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith."
Galatians,6,11,See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand!
Galatians,6,12,"As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, these would compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ."
Galatians,6,13,"For not even those who are circumcised keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh."
Galatians,6,14,"But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world."
Galatians,6,15,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation."
Galatians,6,16,"And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God."
Galatians,6,17,"From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus."
Galatians,6,18,"Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
Ephesians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, To the saints who are in Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus:"
Ephesians,1,2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,"
Ephesians,1,4,"just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love,"
Ephesians,1,5,"having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,"
Ephesians,1,6,"to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved."
Ephesians,1,7,"In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace"
Ephesians,1,8,"which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,"
Ephesians,1,9,"having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself,"
Ephesians,1,10,"that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth—in Him."
Ephesians,1,11,"In Him also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will,"
Ephesians,1,12,that we who first trusted in Christ should be to the praise of His glory.
Ephesians,1,13,"In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,"
Ephesians,1,14,"who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory."
Ephesians,1,15,"Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,"
Ephesians,1,16,"do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers:"
Ephesians,1,17,"that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him,"
Ephesians,1,18,"the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,"
Ephesians,1,19,"and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power"
Ephesians,1,20,"which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places,"
Ephesians,1,21,"far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come."
Ephesians,1,22,"And He put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church,"
Ephesians,1,23,"which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all."
Ephesians,2,1,"And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins,"
Ephesians,2,2,"in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience,"
Ephesians,2,3,"among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others."
Ephesians,2,4,"But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,"
Ephesians,2,5,"even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),"
Ephesians,2,6,"and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,"
Ephesians,2,7,that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
Ephesians,2,8,"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,"
Ephesians,2,9,"not of works, lest anyone should boast."
Ephesians,2,10,"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them."
Ephesians,2,11,"Therefore remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh—who are called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made in the flesh by hands—"
Ephesians,2,12,"that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world."
Ephesians,2,13,But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
Ephesians,2,14,"For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation,"
Ephesians,2,15,"having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace,"
Ephesians,2,16,"and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity."
Ephesians,2,17,And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near.
Ephesians,2,18,For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.
Ephesians,2,19,"Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God,"
Ephesians,2,20,"having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone,"
Ephesians,2,21,"in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord,"
Ephesians,2,22,in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.
Ephesians,3,1,"For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles—"
Ephesians,3,2,"if indeed you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given to me for you,"
Ephesians,3,3,"how that by revelation He made known to me the mystery (as I have briefly written already,"
Ephesians,3,4,"by which, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ),"
Ephesians,3,5,"which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets:"
Ephesians,3,6,"that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ through the gospel,"
Ephesians,3,7,of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effective working of His power.
Ephesians,3,8,"To me, who am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,"
Ephesians,3,9,"and to make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the ages has been hidden in God who created all things through Jesus Christ;"
Ephesians,3,10,"to the intent that now the manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places,"
Ephesians,3,11,"according to the eternal purpose which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,"
Ephesians,3,12,in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through faith in Him.
Ephesians,3,13,"Therefore I ask that you do not lose heart at my tribulations for you, which is your glory."
Ephesians,3,14,"For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
Ephesians,3,15,"from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,"
Ephesians,3,16,"that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man,"
Ephesians,3,17,"that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,"
Ephesians,3,18,may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height—
Ephesians,3,19,to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
Ephesians,3,20,"Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,"
Ephesians,3,21,"to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen."
Ephesians,4,1,"I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you to walk worthy of the calling with which you were called,"
Ephesians,4,2,"with all lowliness and gentleness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love,"
Ephesians,4,3,endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
Ephesians,4,4,"There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called in one hope of your calling;"
Ephesians,4,5,"one Lord, one faith, one baptism;"
Ephesians,4,6,"one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all."
Ephesians,4,7,But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s gift.
Ephesians,4,8,"Therefore He says: “When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive, And gave gifts to men.”"
Ephesians,4,9,"(Now this, “He ascended”—what does it mean but that He also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?"
Ephesians,4,10,"He who descended is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things.)"
Ephesians,4,11,"And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers,"
Ephesians,4,12,"for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ,"
Ephesians,4,13,"till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;"
Ephesians,4,14,"that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting,"
Ephesians,4,15,"but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ—"
Ephesians,4,16,"from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love."
Ephesians,4,17,"This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their mind,"
Ephesians,4,18,"having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart;"
Ephesians,4,19,"who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lewdness, to work all uncleanness with greediness."
Ephesians,4,20,"But you have not so learned Christ,"
Ephesians,4,21,"if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Jesus:"
Ephesians,4,22,"that you put off, concerning your former conduct, the old man which grows corrupt according to the deceitful lusts,"
Ephesians,4,23,"and be renewed in the spirit of your mind,"
Ephesians,4,24,"and that you put on the new man which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness."
Ephesians,4,25,"Therefore, putting away lying, “Let each one of you speak truth with his neighbor,” for we are members of one another."
Ephesians,4,26,"“Be angry, and do not sin”: do not let the sun go down on your wrath,"
Ephesians,4,27,nor give place to the devil.
Ephesians,4,28,"Let him who stole steal no longer, but rather let him labor, working with his hands what is good, that he may have something to give him who has need."
Ephesians,4,29,"Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but what is good for necessary edification, that it may impart grace to the hearers."
Ephesians,4,30,"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."
Ephesians,4,31,"Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice."
Ephesians,4,32,"And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you."
Ephesians,5,1,Therefore be imitators of God as dear children.
Ephesians,5,2,"And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma."
Ephesians,5,3,"But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints;"
Ephesians,5,4,"neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks."
Ephesians,5,5,"For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God."
Ephesians,5,6,"Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience."
Ephesians,5,7,Therefore do not be partakers with them.
Ephesians,5,8,"For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light"
Ephesians,5,9,"(for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth),"
Ephesians,5,10,finding out what is acceptable to the Lord.
Ephesians,5,11,"And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them."
Ephesians,5,12,For it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret.
Ephesians,5,13,"But all things that are exposed are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest is light."
Ephesians,5,14,"Therefore He says: “Awake, you who sleep, Arise from the dead, And Christ will give you light.”"
Ephesians,5,15,"See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise,"
Ephesians,5,16,"redeeming the time, because the days are evil."
Ephesians,5,17,"Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is."
Ephesians,5,18,"And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit,"
Ephesians,5,19,"speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,"
Ephesians,5,20,"giving thanks always for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
Ephesians,5,21,submitting to one another in the fear of God.
Ephesians,5,22,"Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord."
Ephesians,5,23,"For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body."
Ephesians,5,24,"Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything."
Ephesians,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her,"
Ephesians,5,26,"that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word,"
Ephesians,5,27,"that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish."
Ephesians,5,28,So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his wife loves himself.
Ephesians,5,29,"For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord does the church."
Ephesians,5,30,"For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones."
Ephesians,5,31,"“For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.”"
Ephesians,5,32,"This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church."
Ephesians,5,33,"Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband."
Ephesians,6,1,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right."
Ephesians,6,2,"“Honor your father and mother,” which is the first commandment with promise:"
Ephesians,6,3,“that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth.”
Ephesians,6,4,"And you, fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord."
Ephesians,6,5,"Bondservants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ;"
Ephesians,6,6,"not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,"
Ephesians,6,7,"with goodwill doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men,"
Ephesians,6,8,"knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free."
Ephesians,6,9,"And you, masters, do the same things to them, giving up threatening, knowing that your own Master also is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him."
Ephesians,6,10,"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might."
Ephesians,6,11,"Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."
Ephesians,6,12,"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places."
Ephesians,6,13,"Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."
Ephesians,6,14,"Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness,"
Ephesians,6,15,and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
Ephesians,6,16,"above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one."
Ephesians,6,17,"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God;"
Ephesians,6,18,"praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints—"
Ephesians,6,19,"and for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel,"
Ephesians,6,20,"for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak."
Ephesians,6,21,"But that you also may know my affairs and how I am doing, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make all things known to you;"
Ephesians,6,22,"whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may know our affairs, and that he may comfort your hearts."
Ephesians,6,23,"Peace to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
Ephesians,6,24,Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
Philippians,1,1,"Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ, To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:"
Philippians,1,2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philippians,1,3,"I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,"
Philippians,1,4,"always in every prayer of mine making request for you all with joy,"
Philippians,1,5,"for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now,"
Philippians,1,6,"being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ;"
Philippians,1,7,"just as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as both in my chains and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers with me of grace."
Philippians,1,8,"For God is my witness, how greatly I long for you all with the affection of Jesus Christ."
Philippians,1,9,"And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment,"
Philippians,1,10,"that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ,"
Philippians,1,11,"being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God."
Philippians,1,12,"But I want you to know, brethren, that the things which happened to me have actually turned out for the furtherance of the gospel,"
Philippians,1,13,"so that it has become evident to the whole palace guard, and to all the rest, that my chains are in Christ;"
Philippians,1,14,"and most of the brethren in the Lord, having become confident by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without fear."
Philippians,1,15,"Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from goodwill:"
Philippians,1,16,"The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains;"
Philippians,1,17,"but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel."
Philippians,1,18,"What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice."
Philippians,1,19,"For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,"
Philippians,1,20,"according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death."
Philippians,1,21,"For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain."
Philippians,1,22,"But if I live on in the flesh, this will mean fruit from my labor; yet what I shall choose I cannot tell."
Philippians,1,23,"For I am hard-pressed between the two, having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better."
Philippians,1,24,Nevertheless to remain in the flesh is more needful for you.
Philippians,1,25,"And being confident of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of faith,"
Philippians,1,26,that your rejoicing for me may be more abundant in Jesus Christ by my coming to you again.
Philippians,1,27,"Only let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel,"
Philippians,1,28,"and not in any way terrified by your adversaries, which is to them a proof of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that from God."
Philippians,1,29,"For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,"
Philippians,1,30,having the same conflict which you saw in me and now hear is in me.
Philippians,2,1,"Therefore if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and mercy,"
Philippians,2,2,"fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind."
Philippians,2,3,"Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself."
Philippians,2,4,"Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others."
Philippians,2,5,"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,"
Philippians,2,6,"who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God,"
Philippians,2,7,"but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men."
Philippians,2,8,"And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross."
Philippians,2,9,"Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name,"
Philippians,2,10,"that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth,"
Philippians,2,11,"and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
Philippians,2,12,"Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;"
Philippians,2,13,for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.
Philippians,2,14,"Do all things without complaining and disputing,"
Philippians,2,15,"that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,"
Philippians,2,16,"holding fast the word of life, so that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain or labored in vain."
Philippians,2,17,"Yes, and if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all."
Philippians,2,18,For the same reason you also be glad and rejoice with me.
Philippians,2,19,"But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged when I know your state."
Philippians,2,20,"For I have no one like-minded, who will sincerely care for your state."
Philippians,2,21,"For all seek their own, not the things which are of Christ Jesus."
Philippians,2,22,"But you know his proven character, that as a son with his father he served with me in the gospel."
Philippians,2,23,"Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it goes with me."
Philippians,2,24,But I trust in the Lord that I myself shall also come shortly.
Philippians,2,25,"Yet I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, but your messenger and the one who ministered to my need;"
Philippians,2,26,"since he was longing for you all, and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick."
Philippians,2,27,"For indeed he was sick almost unto death; but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow."
Philippians,2,28,"Therefore I sent him the more eagerly, that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less sorrowful."
Philippians,2,29,"Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such men in esteem;"
Philippians,2,30,"because for the work of Christ he came close to death, not regarding his life, to supply what was lacking in your service toward me."
Philippians,3,1,"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. For me to write the same things to you is not tedious, but for you it is safe."
Philippians,3,2,"Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the mutilation!"
Philippians,3,3,"For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh,"
Philippians,3,4,"though I also might have confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he may have confidence in the flesh, I more so:"
Philippians,3,5,"circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;"
Philippians,3,6,"concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless."
Philippians,3,7,"But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ."
Philippians,3,8,"Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ"
Philippians,3,9,"and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;"
Philippians,3,10,"that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,"
Philippians,3,11,"if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead."
Philippians,3,12,"Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me."
Philippians,3,13,"Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead,"
Philippians,3,14,I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
Philippians,3,15,"Therefore let us, as many as are mature, have this mind; and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal even this to you."
Philippians,3,16,"Nevertheless, to the degree that we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us be of the same mind."
Philippians,3,17,"Brethren, join in following my example, and note those who so walk, as you have us for a pattern."
Philippians,3,18,"For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:"
Philippians,3,19,"whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame—who set their mind on earthly things."
Philippians,3,20,"For our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,"
Philippians,3,21,"who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working by which He is able even to subdue all things to Himself."
Philippians,4,1,"Therefore, my beloved and longed-for brethren, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, beloved."
Philippians,4,2,I implore Euodia and I implore Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.
Philippians,4,3,"And I urge you also, true companion, help these women who labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life."
Philippians,4,4,"Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice!"
Philippians,4,5,Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.
Philippians,4,6,"Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;"
Philippians,4,7,"and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."
Philippians,4,8,"Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things."
Philippians,4,9,"The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me, these do, and the God of peace will be with you."
Philippians,4,10,"But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last your care for me has flourished again; though you surely did care, but you lacked opportunity."
Philippians,4,11,"Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content:"
Philippians,4,12,"I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need."
Philippians,4,13,I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
Philippians,4,14,Nevertheless you have done well that you shared in my distress.
Philippians,4,15,"Now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me concerning giving and receiving but you only."
Philippians,4,16,For even in Thessalonica you sent aid once and again for my necessities.
Philippians,4,17,"Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that abounds to your account."
Philippians,4,18,"Indeed I have all and abound. I am full, having received from Epaphroditus the things sent from you, a sweet-smelling aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God."
Philippians,4,19,And my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
Philippians,4,20,Now to our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.
Philippians,4,21,Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.
Philippians,4,22,"All the saints greet you, but especially those who are of Caesar’s household."
Philippians,4,23,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Colossians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,"
Colossians,1,2,To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are in Colosse: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Colossians,1,3,"We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,"
Colossians,1,4,since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of your love for all the saints;
Colossians,1,5,"because of the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel,"
Colossians,1,6,"which has come to you, as it has also in all the world, and is bringing forth fruit, as it is also among you since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth;"
Colossians,1,7,"as you also learned from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf,"
Colossians,1,8,who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.
Colossians,1,9,"For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;"
Colossians,1,10,"that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;"
Colossians,1,11,"strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, for all patience and longsuffering with joy;"
Colossians,1,12,giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light.
Colossians,1,13,"He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love,"
Colossians,1,14,"in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins."
Colossians,1,15,"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation."
Colossians,1,16,"For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him."
Colossians,1,17,"And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist."
Colossians,1,18,"And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence."
Colossians,1,19,"For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell,"
Colossians,1,20,"and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross."
Colossians,1,21,"And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled"
Colossians,1,22,"in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight—"
Colossians,1,23,"if indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard, which was preached to every creature under heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister."
Colossians,1,24,"I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ, for the sake of His body, which is the church,"
Colossians,1,25,"of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God which was given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God,"
Colossians,1,26,"the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His saints."
Colossians,1,27,"To them God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles: which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."
Colossians,1,28,"Him we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus."
Colossians,1,29,"To this end I also labor, striving according to His working which works in me mightily."
Colossians,2,1,"For I want you to know what a great conflict I have for you and those in Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,"
Colossians,2,2,"that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, and attaining to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the knowledge of the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ,"
Colossians,2,3,in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Colossians,2,4,Now this I say lest anyone should deceive you with persuasive words.
Colossians,2,5,"For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ."
Colossians,2,6,"As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him,"
Colossians,2,7,"rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving."
Colossians,2,8,"Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ."
Colossians,2,9,For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily;
Colossians,2,10,"and you are complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power."
Colossians,2,11,"In Him you were also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,"
Colossians,2,12,"buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead."
Colossians,2,13,"And you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses,"
Colossians,2,14,"having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us, which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross."
Colossians,2,15,"Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it."
Colossians,2,16,"So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths,"
Colossians,2,17,"which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ."
Colossians,2,18,"Let no one cheat you of your reward, taking delight in false humility and worship of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,"
Colossians,2,19,"and not holding fast to the Head, from whom all the body, nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments, grows with the increase that is from God."
Colossians,2,20,"Therefore, if you died with Christ from the basic principles of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to regulations—"
Colossians,2,21,"“Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle,”"
Colossians,2,22,which all concern things which perish with the using—according to the commandments and doctrines of men?
Colossians,2,23,"These things indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed religion, false humility, and neglect of the body, but are of no value against the indulgence of the flesh."
Colossians,3,1,"If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God."
Colossians,3,2,"Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth."
Colossians,3,3,"For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God."
Colossians,3,4,"When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory."
Colossians,3,5,"Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry."
Colossians,3,6,"Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience,"
Colossians,3,7,in which you yourselves once walked when you lived in them.
Colossians,3,8,"But now you yourselves are to put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language out of your mouth."
Colossians,3,9,"Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds,"
Colossians,3,10,"and have put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him,"
Colossians,3,11,"where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all and in all."
Colossians,3,12,"Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering;"
Colossians,3,13,"bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do."
Colossians,3,14,"But above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection."
Colossians,3,15,"And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful."
Colossians,3,16,"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord."
Colossians,3,17,"And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him."
Colossians,3,18,"Wives, submit to your own husbands, as is fitting in the Lord."
Colossians,3,19,"Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter toward them."
Colossians,3,20,"Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing to the Lord."
Colossians,3,21,"Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged."
Colossians,3,22,"Bondservants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God."
Colossians,3,23,"And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men,"
Colossians,3,24,knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.
Colossians,3,25,"But he who does wrong will be repaid for what he has done, and there is no partiality."
Colossians,4,1,"Masters, give your bondservants what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven."
Colossians,4,2,"Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving;"
Colossians,4,3,"meanwhile praying also for us, that God would open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in chains,"
Colossians,4,4,"that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak."
Colossians,4,5,"Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time."
Colossians,4,6,"Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one."
Colossians,4,7,"Tychicus, a beloved brother, faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord, will tell you all the news about me."
Colossians,4,8,"I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts,"
Colossians,4,9,"with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all things which are happening here."
Colossians,4,10,"Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, with Mark the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions: if he comes to you, welcome him),"
Colossians,4,11,and Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are of the circumcision; they have proved to be a comfort to me.
Colossians,4,12,"Epaphras, who is one of you, a bondservant of Christ, greets you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God."
Colossians,4,13,"For I bear him witness that he has a great zeal for you, and those who are in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis."
Colossians,4,14,Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you.
Colossians,4,15,"Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas and the church that is in his house."
Colossians,4,16,"Now when this epistle is read among you, see that it is read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you likewise read the epistle from Laodicea."
Colossians,4,17,"And say to Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it.”"
Colossians,4,18,This salutation by my own hand—Paul. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. Amen.
1 Thessalonians,1,1,"Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Thessalonians,1,2,"We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,"
1 Thessalonians,1,3,"remembering without ceasing your work of faith, labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of our God and Father,"
1 Thessalonians,1,4,"knowing, beloved brethren, your election by God."
1 Thessalonians,1,5,"For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance, as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake."
1 Thessalonians,1,6,"And you became followers of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,"
1 Thessalonians,1,7,so that you became examples to all in Macedonia and Achaia who believe.
1 Thessalonians,1,8,"For from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place. Your faith toward God has gone out, so that we do not need to say anything."
1 Thessalonians,1,9,"For they themselves declare concerning us what manner of entry we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,"
1 Thessalonians,1,10,"and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come."
1 Thessalonians,2,1,"For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was not in vain."
1 Thessalonians,2,2,"But even after we had suffered before and were spitefully treated at Philippi, as you know, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much conflict."
1 Thessalonians,2,3,"For our exhortation did not come from error or uncleanness, nor was it in deceit."
1 Thessalonians,2,4,"But as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who tests our hearts."
1 Thessalonians,2,5,"For neither at any time did we use flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak for covetousness—God is witness."
1 Thessalonians,2,6,"Nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, when we might have made demands as apostles of Christ."
1 Thessalonians,2,7,"But we were gentle among you, just as a nursing mother cherishes her own children."
1 Thessalonians,2,8,"So, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us."
1 Thessalonians,2,9,"For you remember, brethren, our labor and toil; for laboring night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God."
1 Thessalonians,2,10,"You are witnesses, and God also, how devoutly and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you who believe;"
1 Thessalonians,2,11,"as you know how we exhorted, and comforted, and charged every one of you, as a father does his own children,"
1 Thessalonians,2,12,that you would walk worthy of God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.
1 Thessalonians,2,13,"For this reason we also thank God without ceasing, because when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe."
1 Thessalonians,2,14,"For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, just as they did from the Judeans,"
1 Thessalonians,2,15,"who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they do not please God and are contrary to all men,"
1 Thessalonians,2,16,"forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, so as always to fill up the measure of their sins; but wrath has come upon them to the uttermost."
1 Thessalonians,2,17,"But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored more eagerly to see your face with great desire."
1 Thessalonians,2,18,"Therefore we wanted to come to you—even I, Paul, time and again—but Satan hindered us."
1 Thessalonians,2,19,"For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Is it not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming?"
1 Thessalonians,2,20,For you are our glory and joy.
1 Thessalonians,3,1,"Therefore, when we could no longer endure it, we thought it good to be left in Athens alone,"
1 Thessalonians,3,2,"and sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and encourage you concerning your faith,"
1 Thessalonians,3,3,that no one should be shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this.
1 Thessalonians,3,4,"For, in fact, we told you before when we were with you that we would suffer tribulation, just as it happened, and you know."
1 Thessalonians,3,5,"For this reason, when I could no longer endure it, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor might be in vain."
1 Thessalonians,3,6,"But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always have good remembrance of us, greatly desiring to see us, as we also to see you—"
1 Thessalonians,3,7,"therefore, brethren, in all our affliction and distress we were comforted concerning you by your faith."
1 Thessalonians,3,8,"For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord."
1 Thessalonians,3,9,"For what thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sake before our God,"
1 Thessalonians,3,10,night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face and perfect what is lacking in your faith?
1 Thessalonians,3,11,"Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you."
1 Thessalonians,3,12,"And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love to one another and to all, just as we do to you,"
1 Thessalonians,3,13,so that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.
1 Thessalonians,4,1,"Finally then, brethren, we urge and exhort in the Lord Jesus that you should abound more and more, just as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God;"
1 Thessalonians,4,2,for you know what commandments we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians,4,3,"For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you should abstain from sexual immorality;"
1 Thessalonians,4,4,"that each of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,"
1 Thessalonians,4,5,"not in passion of lust, like the Gentiles who do not know God;"
1 Thessalonians,4,6,"that no one should take advantage of and defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also forewarned you and testified."
1 Thessalonians,4,7,"For God did not call us to uncleanness, but in holiness."
1 Thessalonians,4,8,"Therefore he who rejects this does not reject man, but God, who has also given us His Holy Spirit."
1 Thessalonians,4,9,"But concerning brotherly love you have no need that I should write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another;"
1 Thessalonians,4,10,"and indeed you do so toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, that you increase more and more;"
1 Thessalonians,4,11,"that you also aspire to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you,"
1 Thessalonians,4,12,"that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and that you may lack nothing."
1 Thessalonians,4,13,"But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope."
1 Thessalonians,4,14,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus."
1 Thessalonians,4,15,"For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep."
1 Thessalonians,4,16,"For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first."
1 Thessalonians,4,17,Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.
1 Thessalonians,4,18,Therefore comfort one another with these words.
1 Thessalonians,5,1,"But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I should write to you."
1 Thessalonians,5,2,For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.
1 Thessalonians,5,3,"For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape."
1 Thessalonians,5,4,"But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief."
1 Thessalonians,5,5,You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.
1 Thessalonians,5,6,"Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober."
1 Thessalonians,5,7,"For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night."
1 Thessalonians,5,8,"But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation."
1 Thessalonians,5,9,"For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,"
1 Thessalonians,5,10,"who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him."
1 Thessalonians,5,11,"Therefore comfort each other and edify one another, just as you also are doing."
1 Thessalonians,5,12,"And we urge you, brethren, to recognize those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,"
1 Thessalonians,5,13,and to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.
1 Thessalonians,5,14,"Now we exhort you, brethren, warn those who are unruly, comfort the fainthearted, uphold the weak, be patient with all."
1 Thessalonians,5,15,"See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all."
1 Thessalonians,5,16,"Rejoice always,"
1 Thessalonians,5,17,"pray without ceasing,"
1 Thessalonians,5,18,in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.
1 Thessalonians,5,19,Do not quench the Spirit.
1 Thessalonians,5,20,Do not despise prophecies.
1 Thessalonians,5,21,Test all things; hold fast what is good.
1 Thessalonians,5,22,Abstain from every form of evil.
1 Thessalonians,5,23,"Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Thessalonians,5,24,"He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it."
1 Thessalonians,5,25,"Brethren, pray for us."
1 Thessalonians,5,26,Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.
1 Thessalonians,5,27,I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.
1 Thessalonians,5,28,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
2 Thessalonians,1,1,"Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
2 Thessalonians,1,2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians,1,3,"We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all abounds toward each other,"
2 Thessalonians,1,4,"so that we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure,"
2 Thessalonians,1,5,"which is manifest evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer;"
2 Thessalonians,1,6,"since it is a righteous thing with God to repay with tribulation those who trouble you,"
2 Thessalonians,1,7,"and to give you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels,"
2 Thessalonians,1,8,"in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,1,9,"These shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,"
2 Thessalonians,1,10,"when He comes, in that Day, to be glorified in His saints and to be admired among all those who believe, because our testimony among you was believed."
2 Thessalonians,1,11,"Therefore we also pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of His goodness and the work of faith with power,"
2 Thessalonians,1,12,"that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,2,1,"Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, we ask you,"
2 Thessalonians,2,2,"not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of Christ had come."
2 Thessalonians,2,3,"Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition,"
2 Thessalonians,2,4,"who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God."
2 Thessalonians,2,5,Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?
2 Thessalonians,2,6,"And now you know what is restraining, that he may be revealed in his own time."
2 Thessalonians,2,7,For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only He who now restrains will do so until He is taken out of the way.
2 Thessalonians,2,8,"And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming."
2 Thessalonians,2,9,"The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders,"
2 Thessalonians,2,10,"and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved."
2 Thessalonians,2,11,"And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie,"
2 Thessalonians,2,12,that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
2 Thessalonians,2,13,"But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God from the beginning chose you for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth,"
2 Thessalonians,2,14,"to which He called you by our gospel, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,2,15,"Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle."
2 Thessalonians,2,16,"Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us and given us everlasting consolation and good hope by grace,"
2 Thessalonians,2,17,comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work.
2 Thessalonians,3,1,"Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run swiftly and be glorified, just as it is with you,"
2 Thessalonians,3,2,and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for not all have faith.
2 Thessalonians,3,3,"But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one."
2 Thessalonians,3,4,"And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, both that you do and will do the things we command you."
2 Thessalonians,3,5,Now may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.
2 Thessalonians,3,6,"But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition which he received from us."
2 Thessalonians,3,7,"For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us, for we were not disorderly among you;"
2 Thessalonians,3,8,"nor did we eat anyone’s bread free of charge, but worked with labor and toil night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you,"
2 Thessalonians,3,9,"not because we do not have authority, but to make ourselves an example of how you should follow us."
2 Thessalonians,3,10,"For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat."
2 Thessalonians,3,11,"For we hear that there are some who walk among you in a disorderly manner, not working at all, but are busybodies."
2 Thessalonians,3,12,Now those who are such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ that they work in quietness and eat their own bread.
2 Thessalonians,3,13,"But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary in doing good."
2 Thessalonians,3,14,"And if anyone does not obey our word in this epistle, note that person and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed."
2 Thessalonians,3,15,"Yet do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."
2 Thessalonians,3,16,Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with you all.
2 Thessalonians,3,17,"The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is a sign in every epistle; so I write."
2 Thessalonians,3,18,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
1 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,"
1 Timothy,1,2,"To Timothy, a true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord."
1 Timothy,1,3,"As I urged you when I went into Macedonia—remain in Ephesus that you may charge some that they teach no other doctrine,"
1 Timothy,1,4,"nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith."
1 Timothy,1,5,"Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from sincere faith,"
1 Timothy,1,6,"from which some, having strayed, have turned aside to idle talk,"
1 Timothy,1,7,"desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor the things which they affirm."
1 Timothy,1,8,"But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully,"
1 Timothy,1,9,"knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,"
1 Timothy,1,10,"for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine,"
1 Timothy,1,11,according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trust.
1 Timothy,1,12,"And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me, because He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry,"
1 Timothy,1,13,"although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; but I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief."
1 Timothy,1,14,"And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus."
1 Timothy,1,15,"This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief."
1 Timothy,1,16,"However, for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all longsuffering, as a pattern to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life."
1 Timothy,1,17,"Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen."
1 Timothy,1,18,"This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare,"
1 Timothy,1,19,"having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck,"
1 Timothy,1,20,"of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme."
1 Timothy,2,1,"Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men,"
1 Timothy,2,2,"for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence."
1 Timothy,2,3,"For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,"
1 Timothy,2,4,who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
1 Timothy,2,5,"For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus,"
1 Timothy,2,6,"who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time,"
1 Timothy,2,7,for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am speaking the truth in Christ and not lying—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
1 Timothy,2,8,"I desire therefore that the men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting;"
1 Timothy,2,9,"in like manner also, that the women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing,"
1 Timothy,2,10,"but, which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works."
1 Timothy,2,11,Let a woman learn in silence with all submission.
1 Timothy,2,12,"And I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence."
1 Timothy,2,13,"For Adam was formed first, then Eve."
1 Timothy,2,14,"And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression."
1 Timothy,2,15,"Nevertheless she will be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control."
1 Timothy,3,1,"This is a faithful saying: If a man desires the position of a bishop, he desires a good work."
1 Timothy,3,2,"A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach;"
1 Timothy,3,3,"not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous;"
1 Timothy,3,4,"one who rules his own house well, having his children in submission with all reverence"
1 Timothy,3,5,"(for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?);"
1 Timothy,3,6,"not a novice, lest being puffed up with pride he fall into the same condemnation as the devil."
1 Timothy,3,7,"Moreover he must have a good testimony among those who are outside, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil."
1 Timothy,3,8,"Likewise deacons must be reverent, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for money,"
1 Timothy,3,9,holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.
1 Timothy,3,10,"But let these also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons, being found blameless."
1 Timothy,3,11,"Likewise, their wives must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things."
1 Timothy,3,12,"Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well."
1 Timothy,3,13,For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy,3,14,"These things I write to you, though I hope to come to you shortly;"
1 Timothy,3,15,"but if I am delayed, I write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
1 Timothy,3,16,"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Preached among the Gentiles, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory."
1 Timothy,4,1,"Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons,"
1 Timothy,4,2,"speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared with a hot iron,"
1 Timothy,4,3,"forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth."
1 Timothy,4,4,"For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving;"
1 Timothy,4,5,for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
1 Timothy,4,6,"If you instruct the brethren in these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which you have carefully followed."
1 Timothy,4,7,"But reject profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise yourself toward godliness."
1 Timothy,4,8,"For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come."
1 Timothy,4,9,This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance.
1 Timothy,4,10,"For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe."
1 Timothy,4,11,These things command and teach.
1 Timothy,4,12,"Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity."
1 Timothy,4,13,"Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine."
1 Timothy,4,14,"Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership."
1 Timothy,4,15,"Meditate on these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all."
1 Timothy,4,16,"Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you."
1 Timothy,5,1,"Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers,"
1 Timothy,5,2,"older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, with all purity."
1 Timothy,5,3,Honor widows who are really widows.
1 Timothy,5,4,"But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety at home and to repay their parents; for this is good and acceptable before God."
1 Timothy,5,5,"Now she who is really a widow, and left alone, trusts in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day."
1 Timothy,5,6,But she who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.
1 Timothy,5,7,"And these things command, that they may be blameless."
1 Timothy,5,8,"But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
1 Timothy,5,9,"Do not let a widow under sixty years old be taken into the number, and not unless she has been the wife of one man,"
1 Timothy,5,10,"well reported for good works: if she has brought up children, if she has lodged strangers, if she has washed the saints’ feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work."
1 Timothy,5,11,"But refuse the younger widows; for when they have begun to grow wanton against Christ, they desire to marry,"
1 Timothy,5,12,having condemnation because they have cast off their first faith.
1 Timothy,5,13,"And besides they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house, and not only idle but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not."
1 Timothy,5,14,"Therefore I desire that the younger widows marry, bear children, manage the house, give no opportunity to the adversary to speak reproachfully."
1 Timothy,5,15,For some have already turned aside after Satan.
1 Timothy,5,16,"If any believing man or woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be burdened, that it may relieve those who are really widows."
1 Timothy,5,17,"Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and doctrine."
1 Timothy,5,18,"For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain,” and, “The laborer is worthy of his wages.”"
1 Timothy,5,19,Do not receive an accusation against an elder except from two or three witnesses.
1 Timothy,5,20,"Those who are sinning rebuke in the presence of all, that the rest also may fear."
1 Timothy,5,21,"I charge you before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing with partiality."
1 Timothy,5,22,"Do not lay hands on anyone hastily, nor share in other people’s sins; keep yourself pure."
1 Timothy,5,23,"No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for your stomach’s sake and your frequent infirmities."
1 Timothy,5,24,"Some men’s sins are clearly evident, preceding them to judgment, but those of some men follow later."
1 Timothy,5,25,"Likewise, the good works of some are clearly evident, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden."
1 Timothy,6,1,"Let as many bondservants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and His doctrine may not be blasphemed."
1 Timothy,6,2,"And those who have believing masters, let them not despise them because they are brethren, but rather serve them because those who are benefited are believers and beloved. Teach and exhort these things."
1 Timothy,6,3,"If anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which accords with godliness,"
1 Timothy,6,4,"he is proud, knowing nothing, but is obsessed with disputes and arguments over words, from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions,"
1 Timothy,6,5,"useless wranglings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. From such withdraw yourself."
1 Timothy,6,6,Now godliness with contentment is great gain.
1 Timothy,6,7,"For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out."
1 Timothy,6,8,"And having food and clothing, with these we shall be content."
1 Timothy,6,9,"But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and harmful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition."
1 Timothy,6,10,"For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."
1 Timothy,6,11,"But you, O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness."
1 Timothy,6,12,"Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses."
1 Timothy,6,13,"I urge you in the sight of God who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus who witnessed the good confession before Pontius Pilate,"
1 Timothy,6,14,"that you keep this commandment without spot, blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ’s appearing,"
1 Timothy,6,15,"which He will manifest in His own time, He who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,"
1 Timothy,6,16,"who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom be honor and everlasting power. Amen."
1 Timothy,6,17,"Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy."
1 Timothy,6,18,"Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share,"
1 Timothy,6,19,"storing up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life."
1 Timothy,6,20,"O Timothy! Guard what was committed to your trust, avoiding the profane and idle babblings and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge—"
1 Timothy,6,21,by professing it some have strayed concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.
2 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,"
2 Timothy,1,2,"To Timothy, a beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
2 Timothy,1,3,"I thank God, whom I serve with a pure conscience, as my forefathers did, as without ceasing I remember you in my prayers night and day,"
2 Timothy,1,4,"greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy,"
2 Timothy,1,5,"when I call to remembrance the genuine faith that is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded is in you also."
2 Timothy,1,6,Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
2 Timothy,1,7,"For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind."
2 Timothy,1,8,"Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner, but share with me in the sufferings for the gospel according to the power of God,"
2 Timothy,1,9,"who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began,"
2 Timothy,1,10,"but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,"
2 Timothy,1,11,"to which I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles."
2 Timothy,1,12,"For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day."
2 Timothy,1,13,"Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,1,14,"That good thing which was committed to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us."
2 Timothy,1,15,"This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes."
2 Timothy,1,16,"The Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;"
2 Timothy,1,17,"but when he arrived in Rome, he sought me out very zealously and found me."
2 Timothy,1,18,The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that Day—and you know very well how many ways he ministered to me at Ephesus.
2 Timothy,2,1,"You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,2,"And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also."
2 Timothy,2,3,You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
2 Timothy,2,4,"No one engaged in warfare entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who enlisted him as a soldier."
2 Timothy,2,5,"And also if anyone competes in athletics, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules."
2 Timothy,2,6,The hardworking farmer must be first to partake of the crops.
2 Timothy,2,7,"Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things."
2 Timothy,2,8,"Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead according to my gospel,"
2 Timothy,2,9,"for which I suffer trouble as an evildoer, even to the point of chains; but the word of God is not chained."
2 Timothy,2,10,"Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."
2 Timothy,2,11,"This is a faithful saying: For if we died with Him, We shall also live with Him."
2 Timothy,2,12,"If we endure, We shall also reign with Him. If we deny Him, He also will deny us."
2 Timothy,2,13,"If we are faithless, He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself."
2 Timothy,2,14,"Remind them of these things, charging them before the Lord not to strive about words to no profit, to the ruin of the hearers."
2 Timothy,2,15,"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."
2 Timothy,2,16,"But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness."
2 Timothy,2,17,"And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort,"
2 Timothy,2,18,"who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some."
2 Timothy,2,19,"Nevertheless the solid foundation of God stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.”"
2 Timothy,2,20,"But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honor and some for dishonor."
2 Timothy,2,21,"Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from the latter, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work."
2 Timothy,2,22,"Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart."
2 Timothy,2,23,"But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they generate strife."
2 Timothy,2,24,"And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient,"
2 Timothy,2,25,"in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth,"
2 Timothy,2,26,"and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will."
2 Timothy,3,1,"But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come:"
2 Timothy,3,2,"For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,"
2 Timothy,3,3,"unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good,"
2 Timothy,3,4,"traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,"
2 Timothy,3,5,having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away!
2 Timothy,3,6,"For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,"
2 Timothy,3,7,always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
2 Timothy,3,8,"Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith;"
2 Timothy,3,9,"but they will progress no further, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was."
2 Timothy,3,10,"But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance,"
2 Timothy,3,11,"persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra—what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me."
2 Timothy,3,12,"Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution."
2 Timothy,3,13,"But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived."
2 Timothy,3,14,"But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them,"
2 Timothy,3,15,"and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,3,16,"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,"
2 Timothy,3,17,"that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work."
2 Timothy,4,1,"I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom:"
2 Timothy,4,2,"Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching."
2 Timothy,4,3,"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers;"
2 Timothy,4,4,"and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables."
2 Timothy,4,5,"But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry."
2 Timothy,4,6,"For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand."
2 Timothy,4,7,"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith."
2 Timothy,4,8,"Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing."
2 Timothy,4,9,Be diligent to come to me quickly;
2 Timothy,4,10,"for Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and has departed for Thessalonica—Crescens for Galatia, Titus for Dalmatia."
2 Timothy,4,11,"Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministry."
2 Timothy,4,12,And Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
2 Timothy,4,13,"Bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas when you come—and the books, especially the parchments."
2 Timothy,4,14,Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay him according to his works.
2 Timothy,4,15,"You also must beware of him, for he has greatly resisted our words."
2 Timothy,4,16,"At my first defense no one stood with me, but all forsook me. May it not be charged against them."
2 Timothy,4,17,"But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that the message might be preached fully through me, and that all the Gentiles might hear. Also I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion."
2 Timothy,4,18,And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and preserve me for His heavenly kingdom. To Him be glory forever and ever. Amen!
2 Timothy,4,19,"Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus."
2 Timothy,4,20,"Erastus stayed in Corinth, but Trophimus I have left in Miletus sick."
2 Timothy,4,21,"Do your utmost to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, as well as Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brethren."
2 Timothy,4,22,The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
Titus,1,1,"Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect and the acknowledgment of the truth which accords with godliness,"
Titus,1,2,"in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began,"
Titus,1,3,"but has in due time manifested His word through preaching, which was committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior;"
Titus,1,4,"To Titus, a true son in our common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior."
Titus,1,5,"For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I commanded you—"
Titus,1,6,"if a man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of dissipation or insubordination."
Titus,1,7,"For a bishop must be blameless, as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money,"
Titus,1,8,"but hospitable, a lover of what is good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled,"
Titus,1,9,"holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict those who contradict."
Titus,1,10,"For there are many insubordinate, both idle talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,"
Titus,1,11,"whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole households, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain."
Titus,1,12,"One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”"
Titus,1,13,"This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,"
Titus,1,14,not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn from the truth.
Titus,1,15,"To the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled."
Titus,1,16,"They profess to know God, but in works they deny Him, being abominable, disobedient, and disqualified for every good work."
Titus,2,1,"But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine:"
Titus,2,2,"that the older men be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience;"
Titus,2,3,"the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things—"
Titus,2,4,"that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,"
Titus,2,5,"to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed."
Titus,2,6,"Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded,"
Titus,2,7,"in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility,"
Titus,2,8,"sound speech that cannot be condemned, that one who is an opponent may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you."
Titus,2,9,"Exhort bondservants to be obedient to their own masters, to be well pleasing in all things, not answering back,"
Titus,2,10,"not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things."
Titus,2,11,"For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,"
Titus,2,12,"teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age,"
Titus,2,13,"looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,"
Titus,2,14,"who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself His own special people, zealous for good works."
Titus,2,15,"Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you."
Titus,3,1,"Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work,"
Titus,3,2,"to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility to all men."
Titus,3,3,"For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another."
Titus,3,4,"But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared,"
Titus,3,5,"not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,"
Titus,3,6,"whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior,"
Titus,3,7,that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
Titus,3,8,"This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, that those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men."
Titus,3,9,"But avoid foolish disputes, genealogies, contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and useless."
Titus,3,10,"Reject a divisive man after the first and second admonition,"
Titus,3,11,"knowing that such a person is warped and sinning, being self-condemned."
Titus,3,12,"When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there."
Titus,3,13,"Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey with haste, that they may lack nothing."
Titus,3,14,"And let our people also learn to maintain good works, to meet urgent needs, that they may not be unfruitful."
Titus,3,15,All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
Philemon,1,1,"Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved friend and fellow laborer,"
Philemon,1,2,"to the beloved Apphia, Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:"
Philemon,1,3,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philemon,1,4,"I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,"
Philemon,1,5,"hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,"
Philemon,1,6,that the sharing of your faith may become effective by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
Philemon,1,7,"For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother."
Philemon,1,8,"Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command you what is fitting,"
Philemon,1,9,"yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you—being such a one as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ—"
Philemon,1,10,"I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten while in my chains,"
Philemon,1,11,"who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable to you and to me."
Philemon,1,12,"I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,"
Philemon,1,13,"whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might minister to me in my chains for the gospel."
Philemon,1,14,"But without your consent I wanted to do nothing, that your good deed might not be by compulsion, as it were, but voluntary."
Philemon,1,15,"For perhaps he departed for a while for this purpose, that you might receive him forever,"
Philemon,1,16,"no longer as a slave but more than a slave—a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord."
Philemon,1,17,"If then you count me as a partner, receive him as you would me."
Philemon,1,18,"But if he has wronged you or owes anything, put that on my account."
Philemon,1,19,"I, Paul, am writing with my own hand. I will repay—not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self besides."
Philemon,1,20,"Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord."
Philemon,1,21,"Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say."
Philemon,1,22,"But, meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for I trust that through your prayers I shall be granted to you."
Philemon,1,23,"Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,"
Philemon,1,24,"as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers."
Philemon,1,25,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
Hebrews,1,1,"God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,"
Hebrews,1,2,"has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds;"
Hebrews,1,3,"who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,"
Hebrews,1,4,"having become so much better than the angels, as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they."
Hebrews,1,5,"For to which of the angels did He ever say: “You are My Son, Today I have begotten You”? And again: “I will be to Him a Father, And He shall be to Me a Son”?"
Hebrews,1,6,"But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: “Let all the angels of God worship Him.”"
Hebrews,1,7,And of the angels He says: “Who makes His angels spirits And His ministers a flame of fire.”
Hebrews,1,8,"But to the Son He says: “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom."
Hebrews,1,9,"You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions.”"
Hebrews,1,10,"And: “You, LORD, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the work of Your hands."
Hebrews,1,11,"They will perish, but You remain; And they will all grow old like a garment;"
Hebrews,1,12,"Like a cloak You will fold them up, And they will be changed. But You are the same, And Your years will not fail.”"
Hebrews,1,13,"But to which of the angels has He ever said: “Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool”?"
Hebrews,1,14,Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who will inherit salvation?
Hebrews,2,1,"Therefore we must give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest we drift away."
Hebrews,2,2,"For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just reward,"
Hebrews,2,3,"how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard Him,"
Hebrews,2,4,"God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders, with various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will?"
Hebrews,2,5,"For He has not put the world to come, of which we speak, in subjection to angels."
Hebrews,2,6,"But one testified in a certain place, saying: “What is man that You are mindful of him, Or the son of man that You take care of him?"
Hebrews,2,7,"You have made him a little lower than the angels; You have crowned him with glory and honor, And set him over the works of Your hands."
Hebrews,2,8,"You have put all things in subjection under his feet.” For in that He put all in subjection under him, He left nothing that is not put under him. But now we do not yet see all things put under him."
Hebrews,2,9,"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, might taste death for everyone."
Hebrews,2,10,"For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
Hebrews,2,11,"For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren,"
Hebrews,2,12,saying: “I will declare Your name to My brethren; In the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to You.”
Hebrews,2,13,And again: “I will put My trust in Him.” And again: “Here am I and the children whom God has given Me.”
Hebrews,2,14,"Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,"
Hebrews,2,15,and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
Hebrews,2,16,"For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham."
Hebrews,2,17,"Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people."
Hebrews,2,18,"For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted."
Hebrews,3,1,"Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus,"
Hebrews,3,2,"who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was faithful in all His house."
Hebrews,3,3,"For this One has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as He who built the house has more honor than the house."
Hebrews,3,4,"For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God."
Hebrews,3,5,"And Moses indeed was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which would be spoken afterward,"
Hebrews,3,6,"but Christ as a Son over His own house, whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end."
Hebrews,3,7,"Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you will hear His voice,"
Hebrews,3,8,"Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, In the day of trial in the wilderness,"
Hebrews,3,9,"Where your fathers tested Me, tried Me, And saw My works forty years."
Hebrews,3,10,"Therefore I was angry with that generation, And said, ‘They always go astray in their heart, And they have not known My ways.’"
Hebrews,3,11,"So I swore in My wrath, ‘They shall not enter My rest.’”"
Hebrews,3,12,"Beware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God;"
Hebrews,3,13,"but exhort one another daily, while it is called “Today,” lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."
Hebrews,3,14,"For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end,"
Hebrews,3,15,"while it is said: “Today, if you will hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”"
Hebrews,3,16,"For who, having heard, rebelled? Indeed, was it not all who came out of Egypt, led by Moses?"
Hebrews,3,17,"Now with whom was He angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness?"
Hebrews,3,18,"And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who did not obey?"
Hebrews,3,19,So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
Hebrews,4,1,"Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it."
Hebrews,4,2,"For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it."
Hebrews,4,3,"For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said: “So I swore in My wrath, ‘They shall not enter My rest,’” although the works were finished from the foundation of the world."
Hebrews,4,4,For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all His works”;
Hebrews,4,5,and again in this place: “They shall not enter My rest.”
Hebrews,4,6,"Since therefore it remains that some must enter it, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter because of disobedience,"
Hebrews,4,7,"again He designates a certain day, saying in David, “Today,” after such a long time, as it has been said: “Today, if you will hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts.”"
Hebrews,4,8,"For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day."
Hebrews,4,9,There remains therefore a rest for the people of God.
Hebrews,4,10,For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.
Hebrews,4,11,"Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience."
Hebrews,4,12,"For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."
Hebrews,4,13,"And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account."
Hebrews,4,14,"Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession."
Hebrews,4,15,"For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin."
Hebrews,4,16,"Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
Hebrews,5,1,"For every high priest taken from among men is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins."
Hebrews,5,2,"He can have compassion on those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is also subject to weakness."
Hebrews,5,3,"Because of this he is required as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifices for sins."
Hebrews,5,4,"And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called by God, just as Aaron was."
Hebrews,5,5,"So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but it was He who said to Him: “You are My Son, Today I have begotten You.”"
Hebrews,5,6,As He also says in another place: “You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek”;
Hebrews,5,7,"who, in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications, with vehement cries and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and was heard because of His godly fear,"
Hebrews,5,8,"though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered."
Hebrews,5,9,"And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him,"
Hebrews,5,10,"called by God as High Priest “according to the order of Melchizedek,”"
Hebrews,5,11,"of whom we have much to say, and hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing."
Hebrews,5,12,"For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food."
Hebrews,5,13,"For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe."
Hebrews,5,14,"But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."
Hebrews,6,1,"Therefore, leaving the discussion of the elementary principles of Christ, let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,"
Hebrews,6,2,"of the doctrine of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment."
Hebrews,6,3,And this we will do if God permits.
Hebrews,6,4,"For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit,"
Hebrews,6,5,"and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,"
Hebrews,6,6,"if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame."
Hebrews,6,7,"For the earth which drinks in the rain that often comes upon it, and bears herbs useful for those by whom it is cultivated, receives blessing from God;"
Hebrews,6,8,"but if it bears thorns and briers, it is rejected and near to being cursed, whose end is to be burned."
Hebrews,6,9,"But, beloved, we are confident of better things concerning you, yes, things that accompany salvation, though we speak in this manner."
Hebrews,6,10,"For God is not unjust to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister."
Hebrews,6,11,"And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end,"
Hebrews,6,12,"that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
Hebrews,6,13,"For when God made a promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,"
Hebrews,6,14,"saying, “Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.”"
Hebrews,6,15,"And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise."
Hebrews,6,16,"For men indeed swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is for them an end of all dispute."
Hebrews,6,17,"Thus God, determining to show more abundantly to the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel, confirmed it by an oath,"
Hebrews,6,18,"that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us."
Hebrews,6,19,"This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters the Presence behind the veil,"
Hebrews,6,20,"where the forerunner has entered for us, even Jesus, having become High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
Hebrews,7,1,"For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,"
Hebrews,7,2,"to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being translated “king of righteousness,” and then also king of Salem, meaning “king of peace,”"
Hebrews,7,3,"without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually."
Hebrews,7,4,"Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils."
Hebrews,7,5,"And indeed those who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to receive tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brethren, though they have come from the loins of Abraham;"
Hebrews,7,6,but he whose genealogy is not derived from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.
Hebrews,7,7,Now beyond all contradiction the lesser is blessed by the better.
Hebrews,7,8,"Here mortal men receive tithes, but there he receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives."
Hebrews,7,9,"Even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, so to speak,"
Hebrews,7,10,for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
Hebrews,7,11,"Therefore, if perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be called according to the order of Aaron?"
Hebrews,7,12,"For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there is also a change of the law."
Hebrews,7,13,"For He of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no man has officiated at the altar."
Hebrews,7,14,"For it is evident that our Lord arose from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood."
Hebrews,7,15,"And it is yet far more evident if, in the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest"
Hebrews,7,16,"who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life."
Hebrews,7,17,For He testifies: “You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek.”
Hebrews,7,18,"For on the one hand there is an annulling of the former commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness,"
Hebrews,7,19,"for the law made nothing perfect; on the other hand, there is the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God."
Hebrews,7,20,And inasmuch as He was not made priest without an oath
Hebrews,7,21,"(for they have become priests without an oath, but He with an oath by Him who said to Him: “The LORD has sworn And will not relent, ‘You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek’”),"
Hebrews,7,22,by so much more Jesus has become a surety of a better covenant.
Hebrews,7,23,"Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing."
Hebrews,7,24,"But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood."
Hebrews,7,25,"Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them."
Hebrews,7,26,"For such a High Priest was fitting for us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens;"
Hebrews,7,27,"who does not need daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the people’s, for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself."
Hebrews,7,28,"For the law appoints as high priests men who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, appoints the Son who has been perfected forever."
Hebrews,8,1,"Now this is the main point of the things we are saying: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,"
Hebrews,8,2,"a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man."
Hebrews,8,3,For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this One also have something to offer.
Hebrews,8,4,"For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;"
Hebrews,8,5,"who serve the copy and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the tabernacle. For He said, “See that you make all things according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”"
Hebrews,8,6,"But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises."
Hebrews,8,7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second."
Hebrews,8,8,"Because finding fault with them, He says: “Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah—"
Hebrews,8,9,"not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the LORD."
Hebrews,8,10,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."
Hebrews,8,11,"None of them shall teach his neighbor, and none his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them."
Hebrews,8,12,"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.”"
Hebrews,8,13,"In that He says, “A new covenant,” He has made the first obsolete. Now what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away."
Hebrews,9,1,"Then indeed, even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service and the earthly sanctuary."
Hebrews,9,2,"For a tabernacle was prepared: the first part, in which was the lampstand, the table, and the showbread, which is called the sanctuary;"
Hebrews,9,3,"and behind the second veil, the part of the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of All,"
Hebrews,9,4,"which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;"
Hebrews,9,5,and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.
Hebrews,9,6,"Now when these things had been thus prepared, the priests always went into the first part of the tabernacle, performing the services."
Hebrews,9,7,"But into the second part the high priest went alone once a year, not without blood, which he offered for himself and for the people’s sins committed in ignorance;"
Hebrews,9,8,"the Holy Spirit indicating this, that the way into the Holiest of All was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing."
Hebrews,9,9,It was symbolic for the present time in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make him who performed the service perfect in regard to the conscience—
Hebrews,9,10,"concerned only with foods and drinks, various washings, and fleshly ordinances imposed until the time of reformation."
Hebrews,9,11,"But Christ came as High Priest of the good things to come, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation."
Hebrews,9,12,"Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption."
Hebrews,9,13,"For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies for the purifying of the flesh,"
Hebrews,9,14,"how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
Hebrews,9,15,"And for this reason He is the Mediator of the new covenant, by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, that those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance."
Hebrews,9,16,"For where there is a testament, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator."
Hebrews,9,17,"For a testament is in force after men are dead, since it has no power at all while the testator lives."
Hebrews,9,18,Therefore not even the first covenant was dedicated without blood.
Hebrews,9,19,"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,"
Hebrews,9,20,"saying, “This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.”"
Hebrews,9,21,Then likewise he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry.
Hebrews,9,22,"And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission."
Hebrews,9,23,"Therefore it was necessary that the copies of the things in the heavens should be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."
Hebrews,9,24,"For Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;"
Hebrews,9,25,"not that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood of another—"
Hebrews,9,26,"He then would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now, once at the end of the ages, He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself."
Hebrews,9,27,"And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment,"
Hebrews,9,28,"so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation."
Hebrews,10,1,"For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with these same sacrifices, which they offer continually year by year, make those who approach perfect."
Hebrews,10,2,"For then would they not have ceased to be offered? For the worshipers, once purified, would have had no more consciousness of sins."
Hebrews,10,3,But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year.
Hebrews,10,4,For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins.
Hebrews,10,5,"Therefore, when He came into the world, He said: “Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, But a body You have prepared for Me."
Hebrews,10,6,In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You had no pleasure.
Hebrews,10,7,"Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come— In the volume of the book it is written of Me— To do Your will, O God.’”"
Hebrews,10,8,"Previously saying, “Sacrifice and offering, burnt offerings, and offerings for sin You did not desire, nor had pleasure in them” (which are offered according to the law),"
Hebrews,10,9,"then He said, “Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God.” He takes away the first that He may establish the second."
Hebrews,10,10,By that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
Hebrews,10,11,"And every priest stands ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins."
Hebrews,10,12,"But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God,"
Hebrews,10,13,from that time waiting till His enemies are made His footstool.
Hebrews,10,14,For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.
Hebrews,10,15,"But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before,"
Hebrews,10,16,"“This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the LORD: I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,”"
Hebrews,10,17,"then He adds, “Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.”"
Hebrews,10,18,"Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin."
Hebrews,10,19,"Therefore, brethren, having boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus,"
Hebrews,10,20,"by a new and living way which He consecrated for us, through the veil, that is, His flesh,"
Hebrews,10,21,"and having a High Priest over the house of God,"
Hebrews,10,22,"let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water."
Hebrews,10,23,"Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful."
Hebrews,10,24,"And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works,"
Hebrews,10,25,"not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching."
Hebrews,10,26,"For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,"
Hebrews,10,27,"but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries."
Hebrews,10,28,Anyone who has rejected Moses’ law dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
Hebrews,10,29,"Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace?"
Hebrews,10,30,"For we know Him who said, “Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,” says the Lord. And again, “The LORD will judge His people.”"
Hebrews,10,31,It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews,10,32,"But recall the former days in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great struggle with sufferings:"
Hebrews,10,33,"partly while you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and tribulations, and partly while you became companions of those who were so treated;"
Hebrews,10,34,"for you had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your goods, knowing that you have a better and an enduring possession for yourselves in heaven."
Hebrews,10,35,"Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward."
Hebrews,10,36,"For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise:"
Hebrews,10,37,"“For yet a little while, And He who is coming will come and will not tarry."
Hebrews,10,38,"Now the just shall live by faith; But if anyone draws back, My soul has no pleasure in him.”"
Hebrews,10,39,"But we are not of those who draw back to perdition, but of those who believe to the saving of the soul."
Hebrews,11,1,"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
Hebrews,11,2,For by it the elders obtained a good testimony.
Hebrews,11,3,"By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible."
Hebrews,11,4,"By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks."
Hebrews,11,5,"By faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death, “and was not found, because God had taken him”; for before he was taken he had this testimony, that he pleased God."
Hebrews,11,6,"But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him."
Hebrews,11,7,"By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith."
Hebrews,11,8,"By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going."
Hebrews,11,9,"By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise;"
Hebrews,11,10,"for he waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God."
Hebrews,11,11,"By faith Sarah herself also received strength to conceive seed, and she bore a child when she was past the age, because she judged Him faithful who had promised."
Hebrews,11,12,"Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born as many as the stars of the sky in multitude—innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore."
Hebrews,11,13,"These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off were assured of them, embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth."
Hebrews,11,14,For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland.
Hebrews,11,15,"And truly if they had called to mind that country from which they had come out, they would have had opportunity to return."
Hebrews,11,16,"But now they desire a better, that is, a heavenly country. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them."
Hebrews,11,17,"By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,"
Hebrews,11,18,"of whom it was said, “In Isaac your seed shall be called,”"
Hebrews,11,19,"concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense."
Hebrews,11,20,By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
Hebrews,11,21,"By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff."
Hebrews,11,22,"By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel, and gave instructions concerning his bones."
Hebrews,11,23,"By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s command."
Hebrews,11,24,"By faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,"
Hebrews,11,25,"choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin,"
Hebrews,11,26,esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the reward.
Hebrews,11,27,"By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible."
Hebrews,11,28,"By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he who destroyed the firstborn should touch them."
Hebrews,11,29,"By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land, whereas the Egyptians, attempting to do so, were drowned."
Hebrews,11,30,By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were encircled for seven days.
Hebrews,11,31,"By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who did not believe, when she had received the spies with peace."
Hebrews,11,32,"And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barak and Samson and Jephthah, also of David and Samuel and the prophets:"
Hebrews,11,33,"who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,"
Hebrews,11,34,"quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in battle, turned to flight the armies of the aliens."
Hebrews,11,35,"Women received their dead raised to life again. Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection."
Hebrews,11,36,"Still others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yes, and of chains and imprisonment."
Hebrews,11,37,"They were stoned, they were sawn in two, were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented—"
Hebrews,11,38,"of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, in dens and caves of the earth."
Hebrews,11,39,"And all these, having obtained a good testimony through faith, did not receive the promise,"
Hebrews,11,40,"God having provided something better for us, that they should not be made perfect apart from us."
Hebrews,12,1,"Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,"
Hebrews,12,2,"looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
Hebrews,12,3,"For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls."
Hebrews,12,4,"You have not yet resisted to bloodshed, striving against sin."
Hebrews,12,5,"And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons: “My son, do not despise the chastening of the LORD, Nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him;"
Hebrews,12,6,"For whom the LORD loves He chastens, And scourges every son whom He receives.”"
Hebrews,12,7,"If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom a father does not chasten?"
Hebrews,12,8,"But if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons."
Hebrews,12,9,"Furthermore, we have had human fathers who corrected us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?"
Hebrews,12,10,"For they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed best to them, but He for our profit, that we may be partakers of His holiness."
Hebrews,12,11,"Now no chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it."
Hebrews,12,12,"Therefore strengthen the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees,"
Hebrews,12,13,"and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed."
Hebrews,12,14,"Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord:"
Hebrews,12,15,"looking carefully lest anyone fall short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up cause trouble, and by this many become defiled;"
Hebrews,12,16,"lest there be any fornicator or profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright."
Hebrews,12,17,"For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears."
Hebrews,12,18,"For you have not come to the mountain that may be touched and that burned with fire, and to blackness and darkness and tempest,"
Hebrews,12,19,"and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, so that those who heard it begged that the word should not be spoken to them anymore."
Hebrews,12,20,"(For they could not endure what was commanded: “And if so much as a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned or shot with an arrow.”"
Hebrews,12,21,"And so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, “I am exceedingly afraid and trembling.”)"
Hebrews,12,22,"But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels,"
Hebrews,12,23,"to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are registered in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,"
Hebrews,12,24,"to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel."
Hebrews,12,25,"See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape who refused Him who spoke on earth, much more shall we not escape if we turn away from Him who speaks from heaven,"
Hebrews,12,26,"whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, “Yet once more I shake not only the earth, but also heaven.”"
Hebrews,12,27,"Now this, “Yet once more,” indicates the removal of those things that are being shaken, as of things that are made, that the things which cannot be shaken may remain."
Hebrews,12,28,"Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear."
Hebrews,12,29,For our God is a consuming fire.
Hebrews,13,1,Let brotherly love continue.
Hebrews,13,2,"Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some have unwittingly entertained angels."
Hebrews,13,3,Remember the prisoners as if chained with them—those who are mistreated—since you yourselves are in the body also.
Hebrews,13,4,"Marriage is honorable among all, and the bed undefiled; but fornicators and adulterers God will judge."
Hebrews,13,5,"Let your conduct be without covetousness; be content with such things as you have. For He Himself has said, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.”"
Hebrews,13,6,So we may boldly say: “The LORD is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?”
Hebrews,13,7,"Remember those who rule over you, who have spoken the word of God to you, whose faith follow, considering the outcome of their conduct."
Hebrews,13,8,"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever."
Hebrews,13,9,"Do not be carried about with various and strange doctrines. For it is good that the heart be established by grace, not with foods which have not profited those who have been occupied with them."
Hebrews,13,10,We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.
Hebrews,13,11,"For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp."
Hebrews,13,12,"Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered outside the gate."
Hebrews,13,13,"Therefore let us go forth to Him, outside the camp, bearing His reproach."
Hebrews,13,14,"For here we have no continuing city, but we seek the one to come."
Hebrews,13,15,"Therefore by Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His name."
Hebrews,13,16,"But do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased."
Hebrews,13,17,"Obey those who rule over you, and be submissive, for they watch out for your souls, as those who must give account. Let them do so with joy and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable for you."
Hebrews,13,18,"Pray for us; for we are confident that we have a good conscience, in all things desiring to live honorably."
Hebrews,13,19,"But I especially urge you to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner."
Hebrews,13,20,"Now may the God of peace who brought up our Lord Jesus from the dead, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,"
Hebrews,13,21,"make you complete in every good work to do His will, working in you what is well pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen."
Hebrews,13,22,"And I appeal to you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words."
Hebrews,13,23,"Know that our brother Timothy has been set free, with whom I shall see you if he comes shortly."
Hebrews,13,24,"Greet all those who rule over you, and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you."
Hebrews,13,25,Grace be with you all. Amen.
James,1,1,"James, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad: Greetings."
James,1,2,"My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,"
James,1,3,knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.
James,1,4,"But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing."
James,1,5,"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him."
James,1,6,"But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind."
James,1,7,For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;
James,1,8,"he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways."
James,1,9,"Let the lowly brother glory in his exaltation,"
James,1,10,"but the rich in his humiliation, because as a flower of the field he will pass away."
James,1,11,"For no sooner has the sun risen with a burning heat than it withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beautiful appearance perishes. So the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits."
James,1,12,"Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him."
James,1,13,"Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone."
James,1,14,But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed.
James,1,15,"Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death."
James,1,16,"Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren."
James,1,17,"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning."
James,1,18,"Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures."
James,1,19,"So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;"
James,1,20,for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
James,1,21,"Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls."
James,1,22,"But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves."
James,1,23,"For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror;"
James,1,24,"for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was."
James,1,25,"But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does."
James,1,26,"If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one’s religion is useless."
James,1,27,"Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world."
James,2,1,"My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with partiality."
James,2,2,"For if there should come into your assembly a man with gold rings, in fine apparel, and there should also come in a poor man in filthy clothes,"
James,2,3,"and you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him, “You sit here in a good place,” and say to the poor man, “You stand there,” or, “Sit here at my footstool,”"
James,2,4,"have you not shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?"
James,2,5,"Listen, my beloved brethren: Has God not chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?"
James,2,6,But you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts?
James,2,7,Do they not blaspheme that noble name by which you are called?
James,2,8,"If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well;"
James,2,9,"but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors."
James,2,10,"For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all."
James,2,11,"For He who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law."
James,2,12,So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty.
James,2,13,For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
James,2,14,"What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him?"
James,2,15,"If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,"
James,2,16,"and one of you says to them, “Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit?"
James,2,17,"Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead."
James,2,18,"But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works."
James,2,19,You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble!
James,2,20,"But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?"
James,2,21,Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar?
James,2,22,"Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect?"
James,2,23,"And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.” And he was called the friend of God."
James,2,24,"You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only."
James,2,25,"Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way?"
James,2,26,"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."
James,3,1,"My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment."
James,3,2,"For we all stumble in many things. If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body."
James,3,3,"Indeed, we put bits in horses’ mouths that they may obey us, and we turn their whole body."
James,3,4,"Look also at ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires."
James,3,5,Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things. See how great a forest a little fire kindles!
James,3,6,"And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by hell."
James,3,7,"For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and creature of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind."
James,3,8,"But no man can tame the tongue. It is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison."
James,3,9,"With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the similitude of God."
James,3,10,"Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so."
James,3,11,Does a spring send forth fresh water and bitter from the same opening?
James,3,12,"Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh."
James,3,13,Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by good conduct that his works are done in the meekness of wisdom.
James,3,14,"But if you have bitter envy and self-seeking in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth."
James,3,15,"This wisdom does not descend from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic."
James,3,16,"For where envy and self-seeking exist, confusion and every evil thing are there."
James,3,17,"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy."
James,3,18,Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
James,4,1,Where do wars and fights come from among you? Do they not come from your desires for pleasure that war in your members?
James,4,2,You lust and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and war. Yet you do not have because you do not ask.
James,4,3,"You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures."
James,4,4,Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
James,4,5,"Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously”?"
James,4,6,"But He gives more grace. Therefore He says: “God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble.”"
James,4,7,Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
James,4,8,"Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded."
James,4,9,Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.
James,4,10,"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up."
James,4,11,"Do not speak evil of one another, brethren. He who speaks evil of a brother and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge."
James,4,12,"There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you to judge another?"
James,4,13,"Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, spend a year there, buy and sell, and make a profit”;"
James,4,14,whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.
James,4,15,"Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that.”"
James,4,16,But now you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.
James,4,17,"Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin."
James,5,1,"Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you!"
James,5,2,"Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten."
James,5,3,"Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have heaped up treasure in the last days."
James,5,4,"Indeed the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth."
James,5,5,You have lived on the earth in pleasure and luxury; you have fattened your hearts as in a day of slaughter.
James,5,6,"You have condemned, you have murdered the just; he does not resist you."
James,5,7,"Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and latter rain."
James,5,8,"You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand."
James,5,9,"Do not grumble against one another, brethren, lest you be condemned. Behold, the Judge is standing at the door!"
James,5,10,"My brethren, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, as an example of suffering and patience."
James,5,11,Indeed we count them blessed who endure. You have heard of the perseverance of Job and seen the end intended by the Lord—that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful.
James,5,12,"But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath. But let your “Yes” be “Yes,” and your “No,” “No,” lest you fall into judgment."
James,5,13,Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms.
James,5,14,"Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord."
James,5,15,"And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven."
James,5,16,"Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much."
James,5,17,"Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months."
James,5,18,"And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit."
James,5,19,"Brethren, if anyone among you wanders from the truth, and someone turns him back,"
James,5,20,let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins.
1 Peter,1,1,"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To the pilgrims of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"
1 Peter,1,2,"elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied."
1 Peter,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,"
1 Peter,1,4,"to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,"
1 Peter,1,5,who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
1 Peter,1,6,"In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials,"
1 Peter,1,7,"that the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ,"
1 Peter,1,8,"whom having not seen you love. Though now you do not see Him, yet believing, you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory,"
1 Peter,1,9,receiving the end of your faith—the salvation of your souls.
1 Peter,1,10,"Of this salvation the prophets have inquired and searched carefully, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,"
1 Peter,1,11,"searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ who was in them was indicating when He testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow."
1 Peter,1,12,"To them it was revealed that, not to themselves, but to us they were ministering the things which now have been reported to you through those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things which angels desire to look into."
1 Peter,1,13,"Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and rest your hope fully upon the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;"
1 Peter,1,14,"as obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts, as in your ignorance;"
1 Peter,1,15,"but as He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct,"
1 Peter,1,16,"because it is written, “Be holy, for I am holy.”"
1 Peter,1,17,"And if you call on the Father, who without partiality judges according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves throughout the time of your stay here in fear;"
1 Peter,1,18,"knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver or gold, from your aimless conduct received by tradition from your fathers,"
1 Peter,1,19,"but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot."
1 Peter,1,20,"He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you"
1 Peter,1,21,"who through Him believe in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God."
1 Peter,1,22,"Since you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit in sincere love of the brethren, love one another fervently with a pure heart,"
1 Peter,1,23,"having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever,"
1 Peter,1,24,"because “All flesh is as grass, And all the glory of man as the flower of the grass. The grass withers, And its flower falls away,"
1 Peter,1,25,But the word of the LORD endures forever.” Now this is the word which by the gospel was preached to you.
1 Peter,2,1,"Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil speaking,"
1 Peter,2,2,"as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby,"
1 Peter,2,3,if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.
1 Peter,2,4,"Coming to Him as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God and precious,"
1 Peter,2,5,"you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,2,6,"Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture, “Behold, I lay in Zion A chief cornerstone, elect, precious, And he who believes on Him will by no means be put to shame.”"
1 Peter,2,7,"Therefore, to you who believe, He is precious; but to those who are disobedient, “The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone,”"
1 Peter,2,8,"and “A stone of stumbling And a rock of offense.” They stumble, being disobedient to the word, to which they also were appointed."
1 Peter,2,9,"But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;"
1 Peter,2,10,"who once were not a people but are now the people of God, who had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy."
1 Peter,2,11,"Beloved, I beg you as sojourners and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul,"
1 Peter,2,12,"having your conduct honorable among the Gentiles, that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by your good works which they observe, glorify God in the day of visitation."
1 Peter,2,13,"Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake, whether to the king as supreme,"
1 Peter,2,14,"or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do good."
1 Peter,2,15,"For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men—"
1 Peter,2,16,"as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of God."
1 Peter,2,17,Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
1 Peter,2,18,"Servants, be submissive to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh."
1 Peter,2,19,"For this is commendable, if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering wrongfully."
1 Peter,2,20,"For what credit is it if, when you are beaten for your faults, you take it patiently? But when you do good and suffer, if you take it patiently, this is commendable before God."
1 Peter,2,21,"For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:"
1 Peter,2,22,"“Who committed no sin, Nor was deceit found in His mouth”;"
1 Peter,2,23,"who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously;"
1 Peter,2,24,"who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness—by whose stripes you were healed."
1 Peter,2,25,"For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls."
1 Peter,3,1,"Wives, likewise, be submissive to your own husbands, that even if some do not obey the word, they, without a word, may be won by the conduct of their wives,"
1 Peter,3,2,when they observe your chaste conduct accompanied by fear.
1 Peter,3,3,"Do not let your adornment be merely outward—arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on fine apparel—"
1 Peter,3,4,"rather let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God."
1 Peter,3,5,"For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, being submissive to their own husbands,"
1 Peter,3,6,"as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose daughters you are if you do good and are not afraid with any terror."
1 Peter,3,7,"Husbands, likewise, dwell with them with understanding, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered."
1 Peter,3,8,"Finally, all of you be of one mind, having compassion for one another; love as brothers, be tenderhearted, be courteous;"
1 Peter,3,9,"not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing."
1 Peter,3,10,"For “He who would love life And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips from speaking deceit."
1 Peter,3,11,Let him turn away from evil and do good; Let him seek peace and pursue it.
1 Peter,3,12,"For the eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, And His ears are open to their prayers; But the face of the LORD is against those who do evil.”"
1 Peter,3,13,And who is he who will harm you if you become followers of what is good?
1 Peter,3,14,"But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. “And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.”"
1 Peter,3,15,"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;"
1 Peter,3,16,"having a good conscience, that when they defame you as evildoers, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed."
1 Peter,3,17,"For it is better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil."
1 Peter,3,18,"For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit,"
1 Peter,3,19,"by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,"
1 Peter,3,20,"who formerly were disobedient, when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water."
1 Peter,3,21,"There is also an antitype which now saves us—baptism (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,"
1 Peter,3,22,"who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers having been made subject to Him."
1 Peter,4,1,"Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind, for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,"
1 Peter,4,2,"that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God."
1 Peter,4,3,"For we have spent enough of our past lifetime in doing the will of the Gentiles—when we walked in lewdness, lusts, drunkenness, revelries, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries."
1 Peter,4,4,"In regard to these, they think it strange that you do not run with them in the same flood of dissipation, speaking evil of you."
1 Peter,4,5,They will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
1 Peter,4,6,"For this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit."
1 Peter,4,7,But the end of all things is at hand; therefore be serious and watchful in your prayers.
1 Peter,4,8,"And above all things have fervent love for one another, for “love will cover a multitude of sins.”"
1 Peter,4,9,Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.
1 Peter,4,10,"As each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."
1 Peter,4,11,"If anyone speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God. If anyone ministers, let him do it as with the ability which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen."
1 Peter,4,12,"Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you;"
1 Peter,4,13,"but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ’s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy."
1 Peter,4,14,"If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified."
1 Peter,4,15,"But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people’s matters."
1 Peter,4,16,"Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter."
1 Peter,4,17,"For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?"
1 Peter,4,18,"Now “If the righteous one is scarcely saved, Where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?”"
1 Peter,4,19,"Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls to Him in doing good, as to a faithful Creator."
1 Peter,5,1,"The elders who are among you I exhort, I who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed:"
1 Peter,5,2,"Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but willingly, not for dishonest gain but eagerly;"
1 Peter,5,3,"nor as being lords over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock;"
1 Peter,5,4,"and when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away."
1 Peter,5,5,"Likewise you younger people, submit yourselves to your elders. Yes, all of you be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility, for “God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble.”"
1 Peter,5,6,"Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time,"
1 Peter,5,7,"casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you."
1 Peter,5,8,"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour."
1 Peter,5,9,"Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world."
1 Peter,5,10,"But may the God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you."
1 Peter,5,11,To Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter,5,12,"By Silvanus, our faithful brother as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand."
1 Peter,5,13,"She who is in Babylon, elect together with you, greets you; and so does Mark my son."
1 Peter,5,14,Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2 Peter,1,1,"Simon Peter, a bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who have obtained like precious faith with us by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:"
2 Peter,1,2,"Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,"
2 Peter,1,3,"as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue,"
2 Peter,1,4,"by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
2 Peter,1,5,"But also for this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge,"
2 Peter,1,6,"to knowledge self-control, to self-control perseverance, to perseverance godliness,"
2 Peter,1,7,"to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness love."
2 Peter,1,8,"For if these things are yours and abound, you will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Peter,1,9,"For he who lacks these things is shortsighted, even to blindness, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins."
2 Peter,1,10,"Therefore, brethren, be even more diligent to make your call and election sure, for if you do these things you will never stumble;"
2 Peter,1,11,for so an entrance will be supplied to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
2 Peter,1,12,"For this reason I will not be negligent to remind you always of these things, though you know and are established in the present truth."
2 Peter,1,13,"Yes, I think it is right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by reminding you,"
2 Peter,1,14,"knowing that shortly I must put off my tent, just as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me."
2 Peter,1,15,Moreover I will be careful to ensure that you always have a reminder of these things after my decease.
2 Peter,1,16,"For we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty."
2 Peter,1,17,"For He received from God the Father honor and glory when such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Glory: “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”"
2 Peter,1,18,And we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.
2 Peter,1,19,"And so we have the prophetic word confirmed, which you do well to heed as a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts;"
2 Peter,1,20,"knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation,"
2 Peter,1,21,"for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit."
2 Peter,2,1,"But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction."
2 Peter,2,2,"And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed."
2 Peter,2,3,"By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction does not slumber."
2 Peter,2,4,"For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved for judgment;"
2 Peter,2,5,"and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;"
2 Peter,2,6,"and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, making them an example to those who afterward would live ungodly;"
2 Peter,2,7,"and delivered righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked"
2 Peter,2,8,"(for that righteous man, dwelling among them, tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds)—"
2 Peter,2,9,"then the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment,"
2 Peter,2,10,"and especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. They are presumptuous, self-willed. They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries,"
2 Peter,2,11,"whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord."
2 Peter,2,12,"But these, like natural brute beasts made to be caught and destroyed, speak evil of the things they do not understand, and will utterly perish in their own corruption,"
2 Peter,2,13,"and will receive the wages of unrighteousness, as those who count it pleasure to carouse in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes, carousing in their own deceptions while they feast with you,"
2 Peter,2,14,"having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls. They have a heart trained in covetous practices, and are accursed children."
2 Peter,2,15,"They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;"
2 Peter,2,16,but he was rebuked for his iniquity: a dumb donkey speaking with a man’s voice restrained the madness of the prophet.
2 Peter,2,17,"These are wells without water, clouds carried by a tempest, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever."
2 Peter,2,18,"For when they speak great swelling words of emptiness, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through lewdness, the ones who have actually escaped from those who live in error."
2 Peter,2,19,"While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage."
2 Peter,2,20,"For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the latter end is worse for them than the beginning."
2 Peter,2,21,"For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them."
2 Peter,2,22,"But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: “A dog returns to his own vomit,” and, “a sow, having washed, to her wallowing in the mire.”"
2 Peter,3,1,"Beloved, I now write to you this second epistle (in both of which I stir up your pure minds by way of reminder),"
2 Peter,3,2,"that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior,"
2 Peter,3,3,"knowing this first: that scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts,"
2 Peter,3,4,"and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.”"
2 Peter,3,5,"For this they willfully forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water,"
2 Peter,3,6,"by which the world that then existed perished, being flooded with water."
2 Peter,3,7,"But the heavens and the earth which are now preserved by the same word, are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men."
2 Peter,3,8,"But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."
2 Peter,3,9,"The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance."
2 Peter,3,10,"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up."
2 Peter,3,11,"Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,"
2 Peter,3,12,"looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be dissolved, being on fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?"
2 Peter,3,13,"Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells."
2 Peter,3,14,"Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless;"
2 Peter,3,15,"and consider that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation—as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you,"
2 Peter,3,16,"as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which untaught and unstable people twist to their own destruction, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures."
2 Peter,3,17,"You therefore, beloved, since you know this beforehand, beware lest you also fall from your own steadfastness, being led away with the error of the wicked;"
2 Peter,3,18,but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and forever. Amen.
1 John,1,1,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of life—"
1 John,1,2,"the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare to you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us—"
1 John,1,3,"that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ."
1 John,1,4,And these things we write to you that your joy may be full.
1 John,1,5,"This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all."
1 John,1,6,"If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth."
1 John,1,7,"But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin."
1 John,1,8,"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."
1 John,1,9,"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
1 John,1,10,"If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us."
1 John,2,1,"My little children, these things I write to you, so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous."
1 John,2,2,"And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world."
1 John,2,3,"Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments."
1 John,2,4,"He who says, “I know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."
1 John,2,5,"But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him."
1 John,2,6,He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.
1 John,2,7,"Brethren, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning."
1 John,2,8,"Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining."
1 John,2,9,"He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness until now."
1 John,2,10,"He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him."
1 John,2,11,"But he who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes."
1 John,2,12,"I write to you, little children, Because your sins are forgiven you for His name’s sake."
1 John,2,13,"I write to you, fathers, Because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, Because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, Because you have known the Father."
1 John,2,14,"I have written to you, fathers, Because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, Because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, And you have overcome the wicked one."
1 John,2,15,"Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
1 John,2,16,"For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world."
1 John,2,17,"And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever."
1 John,2,18,"Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come, by which we know that it is the last hour."
1 John,2,19,"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they went out that they might be made manifest, that none of them were of us."
1 John,2,20,"But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things."
1 John,2,21,"I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth."
1 John,2,22,Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.
1 John,2,23,Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also.
1 John,2,24,"Therefore let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father."
1 John,2,25,And this is the promise that He has promised us—eternal life.
1 John,2,26,These things I have written to you concerning those who try to deceive you.
1 John,2,27,"But the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will abide in Him."
1 John,2,28,"And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming."
1 John,2,29,"If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of Him."
1 John,3,1,"Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God! Therefore the world does not know us, because it did not know Him."
1 John,3,2,"Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is."
1 John,3,3,"And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure."
1 John,3,4,"Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness."
1 John,3,5,"And you know that He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin."
1 John,3,6,Whoever abides in Him does not sin. Whoever sins has neither seen Him nor known Him.
1 John,3,7,"Little children, let no one deceive you. He who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous."
1 John,3,8,"He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil."
1 John,3,9,"Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God."
1 John,3,10,"In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother."
1 John,3,11,"For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another,"
1 John,3,12,not as Cain who was of the wicked one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his works were evil and his brother’s righteous.
1 John,3,13,"Do not marvel, my brethren, if the world hates you."
1 John,3,14,"We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love his brother abides in death."
1 John,3,15,"Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him."
1 John,3,16,"By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren."
1 John,3,17,"But whoever has this world’s goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him?"
1 John,3,18,"My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth."
1 John,3,19,"And by this we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him."
1 John,3,20,"For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things."
1 John,3,21,"Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God."
1 John,3,22,"And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight."
1 John,3,23,"And this is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as He gave us commandment."
1 John,3,24,"Now he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us."
1 John,4,1,"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world."
1 John,4,2,"By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,"
1 John,4,3,"and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world."
1 John,4,4,"You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world."
1 John,4,5,"They are of the world. Therefore they speak as of the world, and the world hears them."
1 John,4,6,We are of God. He who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
1 John,4,7,"Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God."
1 John,4,8,"He who does not love does not know God, for God is love."
1 John,4,9,"In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him."
1 John,4,10,"In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins."
1 John,4,11,"Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another."
1 John,4,12,"No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us."
1 John,4,13,"By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit."
1 John,4,14,And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world.
1 John,4,15,"Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God."
1 John,4,16,"And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him."
1 John,4,17,"Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as He is, so are we in this world."
1 John,4,18,"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love."
1 John,4,19,We love Him because He first loved us.
1 John,4,20,"If someone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?"
1 John,4,21,And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God must love his brother also.
1 John,5,1,"Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves Him who begot also loves him who is begotten of Him."
1 John,5,2,"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep His commandments."
1 John,5,3,"For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome."
1 John,5,4,For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith.
1 John,5,5,"Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?"
1 John,5,6,"This is He who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ; not only by water, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is truth."
1 John,5,7,"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one."
1 John,5,8,"And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree as one."
1 John,5,9,"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is the witness of God which He has testified of His Son."
1 John,5,10,"He who believes in the Son of God has the witness in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed the testimony that God has given of His Son."
1 John,5,11,"And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son."
1 John,5,12,He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.
1 John,5,13,"These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God."
1 John,5,14,"Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us."
1 John,5,15,"And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him."
1 John,5,16,"If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin which does not lead to death, he will ask, and He will give him life for those who commit sin not leading to death. There is sin leading to death. I do not say that he should pray about that."
1 John,5,17,"All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not leading to death."
1 John,5,18,"We know that whoever is born of God does not sin; but he who has been born of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him."
1 John,5,19,"We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one."
1 John,5,20,"And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding, that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life."
1 John,5,21,"Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen."
2 John,1,1,"The Elder, To the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth,"
2 John,1,2,because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever:
2 John,1,3,"Grace, mercy, and peace will be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love."
2 John,1,4,"I rejoiced greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, as we received commandment from the Father."
2 John,1,5,"And now I plead with you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another."
2 John,1,6,"This is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it."
2 John,1,7,For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.
2 John,1,8,"Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we worked for, but that we may receive a full reward."
2 John,1,9,Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son.
2 John,1,10,"If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor greet him;"
2 John,1,11,for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds.
2 John,1,12,"Having many things to write to you, I did not wish to do so with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, that our joy may be full."
2 John,1,13,The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.
3 John,1,1,"The Elder, To the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth:"
3 John,1,2,"Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers."
3 John,1,3,"For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and testified of the truth that is in you, just as you walk in the truth."
3 John,1,4,I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
3 John,1,5,"Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the brethren and for strangers,"
3 John,1,6,"who have borne witness of your love before the church. If you send them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God, you will do well,"
3 John,1,7,"because they went forth for His name’s sake, taking nothing from the Gentiles."
3 John,1,8,"We therefore ought to receive such, that we may become fellow workers for the truth."
3 John,1,9,"I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive us."
3 John,1,10,"Therefore, if I come, I will call to mind his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words. And not content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbids those who wish to, putting them out of the church."
3 John,1,11,"Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God, but he who does evil has not seen God."
3 John,1,12,"Demetrius has a good testimony from all, and from the truth itself. And we also bear witness, and you know that our testimony is true."
3 John,1,13,"I had many things to write, but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink;"
3 John,1,14,"but I hope to see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face. Peace to you. Our friends greet you. Greet the friends by name."
Jude,1,1,"Jude, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, To those who are called, sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ:"
Jude,1,2,"Mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you."
Jude,1,3,"Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints."
Jude,1,4,"For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ."
Jude,1,5,"But I want to remind you, though you once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe."
Jude,1,6,"And the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day;"
Jude,1,7,"as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."
Jude,1,8,"Likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh, reject authority, and speak evil of dignitaries."
Jude,1,9,"Yet Michael the archangel, in contending with the devil, when he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a reviling accusation, but said, “The Lord rebuke you!”"
Jude,1,10,"But these speak evil of whatever they do not know; and whatever they know naturally, like brute beasts, in these things they corrupt themselves."
Jude,1,11,"Woe to them! For they have gone in the way of Cain, have run greedily in the error of Balaam for profit, and perished in the rebellion of Korah."
Jude,1,12,"These are spots in your love feasts, while they feast with you without fear, serving only themselves. They are clouds without water, carried about by the winds; late autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots;"
Jude,1,13,"raging waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; wandering stars for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever."
Jude,1,14,"Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men also, saying, “Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints,"
Jude,1,15,"to execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.”"
Jude,1,16,"These are grumblers, complainers, walking according to their own lusts; and they mouth great swelling words, flattering people to gain advantage."
Jude,1,17,"But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
Jude,1,18,how they told you that there would be mockers in the last time who would walk according to their own ungodly lusts.
Jude,1,19,"These are sensual persons, who cause divisions, not having the Spirit."
Jude,1,20,"But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,"
Jude,1,21,"keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life."
Jude,1,22,"And on some have compassion, making a distinction;"
Jude,1,23,"but others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh."
Jude,1,24,"Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, And to present you faultless Before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy,"
Jude,1,25,"To God our Savior, Who alone is wise, Be glory and majesty, Dominion and power, Both now and forever. Amen."
Revelation,1,1,"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show His servants—things which must shortly take place. And He sent and signified it by His angel to His servant John,"
Revelation,1,2,"who bore witness to the word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to all things that he saw."
Revelation,1,3,"Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near."
Revelation,1,4,"John, to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne,"
Revelation,1,5,"and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler over the kings of the earth. To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood,"

Revelation,1,7,"Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him. Even so, Amen."

Revelation,1,9,"I, John, both your brother and companion in the tribulation and kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was on the island that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ."
Revelation,1,10,"I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet,"
Revelation,1,11,"saying, “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last,” and, “What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamos, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.”"
Revelation,1,12,"Then I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands,"
Revelation,1,13,"and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band."
Revelation,1,14,"His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire;"
Revelation,1,15,"His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters;"
Revelation,1,16,"He had in His right hand seven stars, out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and His countenance was like the sun shining in its strength."
Revelation,1,17,"And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, “Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last."
Revelation,1,18,"I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death."

Revelation,1,20,"The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches."
Revelation,2,1,"“To the angel of the church of Ephesus write, ‘These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands:"
Revelation,2,2,"“I know your works, your labor, your patience, and that you cannot bear those who are evil. And you have tested those who say they are apostles and are not, and have found them liars;"
Revelation,2,3,"and you have persevered and have patience, and have labored for My name’s sake and have not become weary."
Revelation,2,4,"Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love."
Revelation,2,5,"Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent and do the first works, or else I will come to you quickly and remove your lampstand from its place—unless you repent."

Revelation,2,14,"But I have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality."
Revelation,2,15,"Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate."
Revelation,2,16,"Repent, or else I will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of My mouth."
Revelation,2,17,"“He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give some of the hidden manna to eat. And I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written which no one knows except him who receives it.”’"

Revelation,4,10,"the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:"
Revelation,4,11,"“You are worthy, O Lord, To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will they exist and were created.”"
Revelation,5,1,"And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals."

Revelation,5,3,"And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look at it."
Revelation,5,4,"So I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open and read the scroll, or to look at it."
Revelation,5,5,"But one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and to loose its seven seals.”"
Revelation,5,6,"And I looked, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth."
Revelation,5,7,Then He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.
Revelation,5,8,"Now when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints."
Revelation,5,9,"And they sang a new song, saying: “You are worthy to take the scroll, And to open its seals; For You were slain, And have redeemed us to God by Your blood Out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,"
Revelation,5,10,And have made us kings and priests to our God; And we shall reign on the earth.”
Revelation,5,11,"Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,"
Revelation,5,12,"saying with a loud voice: “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain To receive power and riches and wisdom, And strength and honor and glory and blessing!”"
Revelation,5,13,"And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying: “Blessing and honor and glory and power Be to Him who sits on the throne, And to the Lamb, forever and ever!”"
Revelation,5,14,"Then the four living creatures said, “Amen!” And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped Him who lives forever and ever."
Revelation,6,1,"Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals; and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a voice like thunder, “Come and see.”"
Revelation,6,2,"And I looked, and behold, a white horse. He who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer."
Revelation,6,3,"When He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come and see.”"

Revelation,6,5,"When He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come and see.” So I looked, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand."
Revelation,6,6,"And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.”"
Revelation,6,7,"When He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, “Come and see.”"
Revelation,6,8,"So I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth."
Revelation,6,9,"When He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held."
Revelation,6,10,"And they cried with a loud voice, saying, “How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?”"
Revelation,6,11,"Then a white robe was given to each of them; and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both the number of their fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, was completed."
Revelation,6,12,"I looked when He opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood."
Revelation,6,13,"And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind."
Revelation,6,14,"Then the sky receded as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place."
Revelation,6,15,"And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains,"
Revelation,6,16,"and said to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!"
Revelation,6,17,"For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?”"
Revelation,7,1,"After these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, on the sea, or on any tree."
Revelation,7,2,"Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,"
Revelation,7,3,"saying, “Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.”"
Revelation,7,4,And I heard the number of those who were sealed. One hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel were sealed:

Revelation,7,10,"and crying out with a loud voice, saying, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!”"
Revelation,7,11,"All the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,"
Revelation,7,12,"saying: “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom, Thanksgiving and honor and power and might, Be to our God forever and ever. Amen.”"
Revelation,7,13,"Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, “Who are these arrayed in white robes, and where did they come from?”"
Revelation,7,14,"And I said to him, “Sir, you know.” So he said to me, “These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
Revelation,7,15,"Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple. And He who sits on the throne will dwell among them."
Revelation,7,16,"They shall neither hunger anymore nor thirst anymore; the sun shall not strike them, nor any heat;"
Revelation,7,17,for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to living fountains of waters. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”
Revelation,8,1,"When He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour."
Revelation,8,2,"And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets."
Revelation,8,3,"Then another angel, having a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne."
Revelation,8,4,"And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God from the angel’s hand."
Revelation,8,5,"Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth. And there were noises, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake."
Revelation,8,6,So the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
Revelation,8,7,"The first angel sounded: And hail and fire followed, mingled with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. And a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up."
Revelation,8,8,"Then the second angel sounded: And something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood."
Revelation,8,9,"And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed."
Revelation,8,10,"Then the third angel sounded: And a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water."
Revelation,8,11,"The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the water, because it was made bitter."
Revelation,8,12,"Then the fourth angel sounded: And a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night."
Revelation,8,13,"And I looked, and I heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, “Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!”"
Revelation,9,1,Then the fifth angel sounded: And I saw a star fallen from heaven to the earth. To him was given the key to the bottomless pit.
Revelation,9,2,"And he opened the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace. So the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit."
Revelation,9,3,"Then out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth. And to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power."
Revelation,9,4,"They were commanded not to harm the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads."
Revelation,9,5,"And they were not given authority to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man."
Revelation,9,6,"In those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will desire to die, and death will flee from them."
Revelation,9,7,"The shape of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. On their heads were crowns of something like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men."
Revelation,9,8,"They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth."
Revelation,9,9,"And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots with many horses running into battle."
Revelation,9,10,"They had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. Their power was to hurt men five months."
Revelation,9,11,"And they had as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon."
Revelation,9,12,"One woe is past. Behold, still two more woes are coming after these things."
Revelation,9,13,"Then the sixth angel sounded: And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,"
Revelation,9,14,"saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.”"
Revelation,9,15,"So the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released to kill a third of mankind."
Revelation,9,16,Now the number of the army of the horsemen was two hundred million; I heard the number of them.
Revelation,9,17,"And thus I saw the horses in the vision: those who sat on them had breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths came fire, smoke, and brimstone."
Revelation,9,18,By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed—by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which came out of their mouths.
Revelation,9,19,"For their power is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads; and with them they do harm."
Revelation,9,20,"But the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk."
Revelation,9,21,And they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their sexual immorality or their thefts.
Revelation,10,1,"I saw still another mighty angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow was on his head, his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire."
Revelation,10,2,"He had a little book open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,"
Revelation,10,3,"and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. When he cried out, seven thunders uttered their voices."
Revelation,10,4,"Now when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, “Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and do not write them.”"
Revelation,10,5,The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised up his hand to heaven
Revelation,10,6,"and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there should be delay no longer,"
Revelation,10,7,"but in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of God would be finished, as He declared to His servants the prophets."
Revelation,10,8,"Then the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again and said, “Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the earth.”"
Revelation,10,9,"So I went to the angel and said to him, “Give me the little book.” And he said to me, “Take and eat it; and it will make your stomach bitter, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth.”"
Revelation,10,10,"Then I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. But when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter."
Revelation,10,11,"And he said to me, “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings.”"
Revelation,11,1,"Then I was given a reed like a measuring rod. And the angel stood, saying, “Rise and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship there."
Revelation,11,2,"But leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles. And they will tread the holy city underfoot for forty-two months."
Revelation,11,3,"And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.”"
Revelation,11,4,These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth.
Revelation,11,5,"And if anyone wants to harm them, fire proceeds from their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this manner."
Revelation,11,6,"These have power to shut heaven, so that no rain falls in the days of their prophecy; and they have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with all plagues, as often as they desire."
Revelation,11,7,"When they finish their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them, overcome them, and kill them."
Revelation,11,8,"And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified."
Revelation,11,9,"Then those from the peoples, tribes, tongues, and nations will see their dead bodies three-and-a-half days, and not allow their dead bodies to be put into graves."
Revelation,11,10,"And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them, make merry, and send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth."
Revelation,11,11,"Now after the three-and-a-half days the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them."
Revelation,11,12,"And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” And they ascended to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies saw them."
Revelation,11,13,"In the same hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. In the earthquake seven thousand people were killed, and the rest were afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven."
Revelation,11,14,"The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly."
Revelation,11,15,"Then the seventh angel sounded: And there were loud voices in heaven, saying, “The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!”"
Revelation,11,16,"And the twenty-four elders who sat before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshiped God,"
Revelation,11,17,"saying: “We give You thanks, O Lord God Almighty, The One who is and who was and who is to come, Because You have taken Your great power and reigned."
Revelation,11,18,"The nations were angry, and Your wrath has come, And the time of the dead, that they should be judged, And that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, And those who fear Your name, small and great, And should destroy those who destroy the earth.”"
Revelation,11,19,"Then the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple. And there were lightnings, noises, thunderings, an earthquake, and great hail."
Revelation,12,1,"Now a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars."
Revelation,12,2,"Then being with child, she cried out in labor and in pain to give birth."
Revelation,12,3,"And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great, fiery red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads."
Revelation,12,4,"His tail drew a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to give birth, to devour her Child as soon as it was born."
Revelation,12,5,She bore a male Child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her Child was caught up to God and His throne.
Revelation,12,6,"Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they should feed her there one thousand two hundred and sixty days."
Revelation,12,7,"And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought,"
Revelation,12,8,"but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer."
Revelation,12,9,"So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."
Revelation,12,10,"Then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, “Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down."
Revelation,12,11,"And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death."
Revelation,12,12,"Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time.”"
Revelation,12,13,"Now when the dragon saw that he had been cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male Child."
Revelation,12,14,"But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent."
Revelation,12,15,"So the serpent spewed water out of his mouth like a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood."
Revelation,12,16,"But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon had spewed out of his mouth."
Revelation,12,17,"And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."
Revelation,13,1,"Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name."
Revelation,13,2,"Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority."
Revelation,13,3,"And I saw one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world marveled and followed the beast."
Revelation,13,4,"So they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?”"
Revelation,13,5,"And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months."
Revelation,13,6,"Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven."
Revelation,13,7,"It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation."
Revelation,13,8,"All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
Revelation,13,9,"If anyone has an ear, let him hear."
Revelation,13,10,He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity; he who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
Revelation,13,11,"Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon."
Revelation,13,12,"And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed."
Revelation,13,13,"He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men."
Revelation,13,14,"And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived."
Revelation,13,15,"He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed."
Revelation,13,16,"He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads,"
Revelation,13,17,"and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."
Revelation,13,18,"Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666."
Revelation,14,1,"Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father’s name written on their foreheads."
Revelation,14,2,"And I heard a voice from heaven, like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder. And I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps."
Revelation,14,3,"They sang as it were a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one could learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth."
Revelation,14,4,"These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were redeemed from among men, being firstfruits to God and to the Lamb."
Revelation,14,5,"And in their mouth was found no deceit, for they are without fault before the throne of God."
Revelation,14,6,"Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth—to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people—"
Revelation,14,7,"saying with a loud voice, “Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.”"
Revelation,14,8,"And another angel followed, saying, “Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.”"
Revelation,14,9,"Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand,"
Revelation,14,10,"he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb."
Revelation,14,11,"And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.”"
Revelation,14,12,Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
Revelation,14,13,"Then I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, “Write: ‘Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.’” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “that they may rest from their labors, and their works follow them.”"
Revelation,14,14,"Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat One like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle."
Revelation,14,15,"And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, “Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the time has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.”"
Revelation,14,16,"So He who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped."
Revelation,14,17,"Then another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle."
Revelation,14,18,"And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire, and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, “Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe.”"
Revelation,14,19,"So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God."
Revelation,14,20,"And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, up to the horses’ bridles, for one thousand six hundred furlongs."
Revelation,15,1,"Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them the wrath of God is complete."
Revelation,15,2,"And I saw something like a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who have the victory over the beast, over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God."
Revelation,15,3,"They sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: “Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints!"
Revelation,15,4,"Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy. For all nations shall come and worship before You, For Your judgments have been manifested.”"
Revelation,15,5,"After these things I looked, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened."
Revelation,15,6,"And out of the temple came the seven angels having the seven plagues, clothed in pure bright linen, and having their chests girded with golden bands."
Revelation,15,7,Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever.
Revelation,15,8,"The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power, and no one was able to enter the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed."
Revelation,16,1,"Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour out the bowls of the wrath of God on the earth.”"
Revelation,16,2,"So the first went and poured out his bowl upon the earth, and a foul and loathsome sore came upon the men who had the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image."
Revelation,16,3,"Then the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living creature in the sea died."
Revelation,16,4,"Then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood."
Revelation,16,5,"And I heard the angel of the waters saying: “You are righteous, O Lord, The One who is and who was and who is to be, Because You have judged these things."
Revelation,16,6,"For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, And You have given them blood to drink. For it is their just due.”"
Revelation,16,7,"And I heard another from the altar saying, “Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.”"
Revelation,16,8,"Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and power was given to him to scorch men with fire."
Revelation,16,9,"And men were scorched with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God who has power over these plagues; and they did not repent and give Him glory."
Revelation,16,10,"Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues because of the pain."
Revelation,16,11,"They blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and did not repent of their deeds."
Revelation,16,12,"Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, so that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared."
Revelation,16,13,"And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet."
Revelation,16,14,"For they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty."
Revelation,16,15,"“Behold, I am coming as a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.”"
Revelation,16,16,"And they gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon."
Revelation,16,17,"Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, “It is done!”"
Revelation,16,18,"And there were noises and thunderings and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such a mighty and great earthquake as had not occurred since men were on the earth."
Revelation,16,19,"Now the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And great Babylon was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath."
Revelation,16,20,"Then every island fled away, and the mountains were not found."
Revelation,16,21,"And great hail from heaven fell upon men, each hailstone about the weight of a talent. Men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, since that plague was exceedingly great."
Revelation,17,1,"Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and talked with me, saying to me, “Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,"
Revelation,17,2,"with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication.”"
Revelation,17,3,"So he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns."
Revelation,17,4,"The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication."
Revelation,17,5,"And on her forehead a name was written: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT,THE MOTHER OF HARLOTSAND OF THE ABOMINATIONSOF THE EARTH."
Revelation,17,6,"I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I marveled with great amazement."
Revelation,17,7,"But the angel said to me, “Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns."
Revelation,17,8,"The beast that you saw was, and is not, and will ascend out of the bottomless pit and go to perdition. And those who dwell on the earth will marvel, whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet is."
Revelation,17,9,“Here is the mind which has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.
Revelation,17,10,"There are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come. And when he comes, he must continue a short time."
Revelation,17,11,"The beast that was, and is not, is himself also the eighth, and is of the seven, and is going to perdition."
Revelation,17,12,"“The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority for one hour as kings with the beast."
Revelation,17,13,"These are of one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast."
Revelation,17,14,"These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those who are with Him are called, chosen, and faithful.”"
Revelation,17,15,"Then he said to me, “The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues."
Revelation,17,16,"And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these will hate the harlot, make her desolate and naked, eat her flesh and burn her with fire."
Revelation,17,17,"For God has put it into their hearts to fulfill His purpose, to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled."
Revelation,17,18,And the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth.”
Revelation,18,1,"After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illuminated with his glory."
Revelation,18,2,"And he cried mightily with a loud voice, saying, “Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and has become a dwelling place of demons, a prison for every foul spirit, and a cage for every unclean and hated bird!"
Revelation,18,3,"For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich through the abundance of her luxury.”"
Revelation,18,4,"And I heard another voice from heaven saying, “Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues."
Revelation,18,5,"For her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities."
Revelation,18,6,"Render to her just as she rendered to you, and repay her double according to her works; in the cup which she has mixed, mix double for her."
Revelation,18,7,"In the measure that she glorified herself and lived luxuriously, in the same measure give her torment and sorrow; for she says in her heart, ‘I sit as queen, and am no widow, and will not see sorrow.’"
Revelation,18,8,"Therefore her plagues will come in one day—death and mourning and famine. And she will be utterly burned with fire, for strong is the Lord God who judges her."
Revelation,18,9,"“The kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her will weep and lament for her, when they see the smoke of her burning,"
Revelation,18,10,"standing at a distance for fear of her torment, saying, ‘Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! For in one hour your judgment has come.’"
Revelation,18,11,"“And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise anymore:"
Revelation,18,12,"merchandise of gold and silver, precious stones and pearls, fine linen and purple, silk and scarlet, every kind of citron wood, every kind of object of ivory, every kind of object of most precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble;"
Revelation,18,13,"and cinnamon and incense, fragrant oil and frankincense, wine and oil, fine flour and wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and bodies and souls of men."
Revelation,18,14,"The fruit that your soul longed for has gone from you, and all the things which are rich and splendid have gone from you, and you shall find them no more at all."
Revelation,18,15,"The merchants of these things, who became rich by her, will stand at a distance for fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,"
Revelation,18,16,"and saying, ‘Alas, alas, that great city that was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!"
Revelation,18,17,"For in one hour such great riches came to nothing.’ Every shipmaster, all who travel by ship, sailors, and as many as trade on the sea, stood at a distance"
Revelation,18,18,"and cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What is like this great city?’"
Revelation,18,19,"“They threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and wailing, and saying, ‘Alas, alas, that great city, in which all who had ships on the sea became rich by her wealth! For in one hour she is made desolate.’"
Revelation,18,20,"“Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, for God has avenged you on her!”"
Revelation,18,21,"Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, “Thus with violence the great city Babylon shall be thrown down, and shall not be found anymore."
Revelation,18,22,"The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters shall not be heard in you anymore. No craftsman of any craft shall be found in you anymore, and the sound of a millstone shall not be heard in you anymore."
Revelation,18,23,"The light of a lamp shall not shine in you anymore, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall not be heard in you anymore. For your merchants were the great men of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were deceived."
Revelation,18,24,"And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who were slain on the earth.”"
Revelation,19,1,"After these things I heard a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, “Alleluia! Salvation and glory and honor and power belong to the Lord our God!"
Revelation,19,2,"For true and righteous are His judgments, because He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication; and He has avenged on her the blood of His servants shed by her.”"
Revelation,19,3,"Again they said, “Alleluia! Her smoke rises up forever and ever!”"
Revelation,19,4,"And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sat on the throne, saying, “Amen! Alleluia!”"
Revelation,19,5,"Then a voice came from the throne, saying, “Praise our God, all you His servants and those who fear Him, both small and great!”"
Revelation,19,6,"And I heard, as it were, the voice of a great multitude, as the sound of many waters and as the sound of mighty thunderings, saying, “Alleluia! For the Lord God Omnipotent reigns!"
Revelation,19,7,"Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.”"
Revelation,19,8,"And to her it was granted to be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints."
Revelation,19,9,"Then he said to me, “Write: ‘Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb!’” And he said to me, “These are the true sayings of God.”"
Revelation,19,10,"And I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, “See that you do not do that! I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”"
Revelation,19,11,"Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war."
Revelation,19,12,"His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself."
Revelation,19,13,"He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God."
Revelation,19,14,"And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses."
Revelation,19,15,"Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God."
Revelation,19,16,And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written: KING OF KINGS ANDLORD OF LORDS.
Revelation,19,17,"Then I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, “Come and gather together for the supper of the great God,"
Revelation,19,18,"that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, both small and great.”"
Revelation,19,19,"And I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army."
Revelation,19,20,"Then the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who worked signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone."
Revelation,19,21,And the rest were killed with the sword which proceeded from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse. And all the birds were filled with their flesh.
Revelation,20,1,"Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand."
Revelation,20,2,"He laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;"
Revelation,20,3,"and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while."
Revelation,20,4,"And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them. Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years."
Revelation,20,5,But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
Revelation,20,6,"Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years."
Revelation,20,7,"Now when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison"
Revelation,20,8,"and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea."
Revelation,20,9,They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.
Revelation,20,10,"The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever."
Revelation,20,11,"Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And there was found no place for them."
Revelation,20,12,"And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books."
Revelation,20,13,"The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works."
Revelation,20,14,Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
Revelation,20,15,And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.
Revelation,21,1,"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea."
Revelation,21,2,"Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."
Revelation,21,3,"And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God."
Revelation,21,4,"And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.”"
Revelation,21,5,"Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”"
Revelation,21,6,"And He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts."
Revelation,21,7,"He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son."
Revelation,21,8,"But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”"
Revelation,21,9,"Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came to me and talked with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the bride, the Lamb’s wife.”"
Revelation,21,10,"And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,"
Revelation,21,11,"having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal."
Revelation,21,12,"Also she had a great and high wall with twelve gates, and twelve angels at the gates, and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:"
Revelation,21,13,"three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west."
Revelation,21,14,"Now the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
Revelation,21,15,"And he who talked with me had a gold reed to measure the city, its gates, and its wall."
Revelation,21,16,"The city is laid out as a square; its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed: twelve thousand furlongs. Its length, breadth, and height are equal."
Revelation,21,17,"Then he measured its wall: one hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel."
Revelation,21,18,"The construction of its wall was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass."
Revelation,21,19,"The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kinds of precious stones: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,"
Revelation,21,20,"the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst."
Revelation,21,21,"The twelve gates were twelve pearls: each individual gate was of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass."
Revelation,21,22,"But I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple."
Revelation,21,23,"The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it. The Lamb is its light."
Revelation,21,24,"And the nations of those who are saved shall walk in its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it."
Revelation,21,25,Its gates shall not be shut at all by day (there shall be no night there).
Revelation,21,26,And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.
Revelation,21,27,"But there shall by no means enter it anything that defiles, or causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life."
Revelation,22,1,"And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb."
Revelation,22,2,"In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river, was the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits, each tree yielding its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."
Revelation,22,3,"And there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him."
Revelation,22,4,"They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads."
Revelation,22,5,"There shall be no night there: They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever."
Revelation,22,6,"Then he said to me, “These words are faithful and true.” And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel to show His servants the things which must shortly take place."
Revelation,22,7,"“Behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”"
Revelation,22,8,"Now I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things."
Revelation,22,9,"Then he said to me, “See that you do not do that. For I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.”"
Revelation,22,10,"And he said to me, “Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand."
Revelation,22,11,"He who is unjust, let him be unjust still; he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; he who is righteous, let him be righteous still; he who is holy, let him be holy still.”"
Revelation,22,12,"“And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to his work."
Revelation,22,13,"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last.”"
Revelation,22,14,"Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city."
Revelation,22,15,"But outside are dogs and sorcerers and sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and whoever loves and practices a lie."
Revelation,22,16,"“I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star.”"
Revelation,22,17,"And the Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let him who hears say, “Come!” And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely."
Revelation,22,18,"For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book;"
Revelation,22,19,"and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."
Revelation,22,20,"He who testifies to these things says, “Surely I am coming quickly.” Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus!"
Revelation,22,21,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Job,1,1,"There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil."
Job,1,2,And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.
Job,1,3,"Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East."
Job,1,4,"And his sons would go and feast in their houses, each on his appointed day, and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them."
Job,1,5,"So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did regularly."
Job,1,6,"Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them."
Job,1,7,"And the LORD said to Satan, “From where do you come?” So Satan answered the LORD and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.”"
Job,1,8,"Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?”"
Job,1,9,"So Satan answered the LORD and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?"
Job,1,10,"Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land."
Job,1,11,"But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!”"
Job,1,12,"And the LORD said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power; only do not lay a hand on his person.” So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD."
Job,1,13,Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house;
Job,1,14,"and a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,"
Job,1,15,when the Sabeans raided them and took them away—indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
Job,1,16,"While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”"
Job,1,17,"While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”"
Job,1,18,"While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,"
Job,1,19,"and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”"
Job,1,20,"Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell to the ground and worshiped."
Job,1,21,"And he said: “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, And naked shall I return there. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; Blessed be the name of the LORD.”"
Job,1,22,In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong.
Job,2,1,"Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD."
Job,2,2,"And the LORD said to Satan, “From where do you come?” Satan answered the LORD and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.”"
Job,2,3,"Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause.”"
Job,2,4,"So Satan answered the LORD and said, “Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life."
Job,2,5,"But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will surely curse You to Your face!”"
Job,2,6,"And the LORD said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand, but spare his life.”"
Job,2,7,"So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD, and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head."
Job,2,8,And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes.
Job,2,9,"Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!”"
Job,2,10,"But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips."
Job,2,11,"Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, each one came from his own place—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come and mourn with him, and to comfort him."
Job,2,12,"And when they raised their eyes from afar, and did not recognize him, they lifted their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and sprinkled dust on his head toward heaven."
Job,2,13,"So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great."
Job,3,1,After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
Job,3,2,"And Job spoke, and said:"
Job,3,3,"“May the day perish on which I was born, And the night in which it was said, ‘A male child is conceived.’"
Job,3,4,"May that day be darkness; May God above not seek it, Nor the light shine upon it."
Job,3,5,May darkness and the shadow of death claim it; May a cloud settle on it; May the blackness of the day terrify it.
Job,3,6,"As for that night, may darkness seize it; May it not rejoice among the days of the year, May it not come into the number of the months."
Job,3,7,"Oh, may that night be barren! May no joyful shout come into it!"
Job,3,8,"May those curse it who curse the day, Those who are ready to arouse Leviathan."
Job,3,9,"May the stars of its morning be dark; May it look for light, but have none, And not see the dawning of the day;"
Job,3,10,"Because it did not shut up the doors of my mother’s womb, Nor hide sorrow from my eyes."
Job,3,11,“Why did I not die at birth? Why did I not perish when I came from the womb?
Job,3,12,"Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?"
Job,3,13,"For now I would have lain still and been quiet, I would have been asleep; Then I would have been at rest"
Job,3,14,"With kings and counselors of the earth, Who built ruins for themselves,"
Job,3,15,"Or with princes who had gold, Who filled their houses with silver;"
Job,3,16,"Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child, Like infants who never saw light?"
Job,3,17,"There the wicked cease from troubling, And there the weary are at rest."
Job,3,18,There the prisoners rest together; They do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
Job,3,19,"The small and great are there, And the servant is free from his master."
Job,3,20,"“Why is light given to him who is in misery, And life to the bitter of soul,"
Job,3,21,"Who long for death, but it does not come, And search for it more than hidden treasures;"
Job,3,22,"Who rejoice exceedingly, And are glad when they can find the grave?"
Job,3,23,"Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, And whom God has hedged in?"
Job,3,24,"For my sighing comes before I eat, And my groanings pour out like water."
Job,3,25,"For the thing I greatly feared has come upon me, And what I dreaded has happened to me."
Job,3,26,"I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, for trouble comes.”"
Job,4,1,Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
Job,4,2,"“If one attempts a word with you, will you become weary? But who can withhold himself from speaking?"
Job,4,3,"Surely you have instructed many, And you have strengthened weak hands."
Job,4,4,"Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, And you have strengthened the feeble knees;"
Job,4,5,"But now it comes upon you, and you are weary; It touches you, and you are troubled."
Job,4,6,Is not your reverence your confidence? And the integrity of your ways your hope?
Job,4,7,"“Remember now, who ever perished being innocent? Or where were the upright ever cut off?"
Job,4,8,"Even as I have seen, Those who plow iniquity And sow trouble reap the same."
Job,4,9,"By the blast of God they perish, And by the breath of His anger they are consumed."
Job,4,10,"The roaring of the lion, The voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions are broken."
Job,4,11,"The old lion perishes for lack of prey, And the cubs of the lioness are scattered."
Job,4,12,"“Now a word was secretly brought to me, And my ear received a whisper of it."
Job,4,13,"In disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falls on men,"
Job,4,14,"Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which made all my bones shake."
Job,4,15,Then a spirit passed before my face; The hair on my body stood up.
Job,4,16,"It stood still, But I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; There was silence; Then I heard a voice saying:"
Job,4,17,‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?
Job,4,18,"If He puts no trust in His servants, If He charges His angels with error,"
Job,4,19,"How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before a moth?"
Job,4,20,"They are broken in pieces from morning till evening; They perish forever, with no one regarding."
Job,4,21,"Does not their own excellence go away? They die, even without wisdom.’"
Job,5,1,“Call out now; Is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn?
Job,5,2,"For wrath kills a foolish man, And envy slays a simple one."
Job,5,3,"I have seen the foolish taking root, But suddenly I cursed his dwelling place."
Job,5,4,"His sons are far from safety, They are crushed in the gate, And there is no deliverer."
Job,5,5,"Because the hungry eat up his harvest, Taking it even from the thorns, And a snare snatches their substance."
Job,5,6,"For affliction does not come from the dust, Nor does trouble spring from the ground;"
Job,5,7,"Yet man is born to trouble, As the sparks fly upward."
Job,5,8,"“But as for me, I would seek God, And to God I would commit my cause—"
Job,5,9,"Who does great things, and unsearchable, Marvelous things without number."
Job,5,10,"He gives rain on the earth, And sends waters on the fields."
Job,5,11,"He sets on high those who are lowly, And those who mourn are lifted to safety."
Job,5,12,"He frustrates the devices of the crafty, So that their hands cannot carry out their plans."
Job,5,13,"He catches the wise in their own craftiness, And the counsel of the cunning comes quickly upon them."
Job,5,14,"They meet with darkness in the daytime, And grope at noontime as in the night."
Job,5,15,"But He saves the needy from the sword, From the mouth of the mighty, And from their hand."
Job,5,16,"So the poor have hope, And injustice shuts her mouth."
Job,5,17,"“Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects; Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty."
Job,5,18,"For He bruises, but He binds up; He wounds, but His hands make whole."
Job,5,19,"He shall deliver you in six troubles, Yes, in seven no evil shall touch you."
Job,5,20,"In famine He shall redeem you from death, And in war from the power of the sword."
Job,5,21,"You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, And you shall not be afraid of destruction when it comes."
Job,5,22,"You shall laugh at destruction and famine, And you shall not be afraid of the beasts of the earth."
Job,5,23,"For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field, And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you."
Job,5,24,You shall know that your tent is in peace; You shall visit your dwelling and find nothing amiss.
Job,5,25,"You shall also know that your descendants shall be many, And your offspring like the grass of the earth."
Job,5,26,"You shall come to the grave at a full age, As a sheaf of grain ripens in its season."
Job,5,27,"Behold, this we have searched out; It is true. Hear it, and know for yourself.”"
Job,6,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,6,2,"“Oh, that my grief were fully weighed, And my calamity laid with it on the scales!"
Job,6,3,For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea— Therefore my words have been rash.
Job,6,4,For the arrows of the Almighty are within me; My spirit drinks in their poison; The terrors of God are arrayed against me.
Job,6,5,"Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass, Or does the ox low over its fodder?"
Job,6,6,Can flavorless food be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
Job,6,7,My soul refuses to touch them; They are as loathsome food to me.
Job,6,8,"“Oh, that I might have my request, That God would grant me the thing that I long for!"
Job,6,9,"That it would please God to crush me, That He would loose His hand and cut me off!"
Job,6,10,"Then I would still have comfort; Though in anguish I would exult, He will not spare; For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One."
Job,6,11,"“What strength do I have, that I should hope? And what is my end, that I should prolong my life?"
Job,6,12,Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh bronze?
Job,6,13,Is my help not within me? And is success driven from me?
Job,6,14,"“To him who is afflicted, kindness should be shown by his friend, Even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty."
Job,6,15,"My brothers have dealt deceitfully like a brook, Like the streams of the brooks that pass away,"
Job,6,16,"Which are dark because of the ice, And into which the snow vanishes."
Job,6,17,"When it is warm, they cease to flow; When it is hot, they vanish from their place."
Job,6,18,"The paths of their way turn aside, They go nowhere and perish."
Job,6,19,"The caravans of Tema look, The travelers of Sheba hope for them."
Job,6,20,They are disappointed because they were confident; They come there and are confused.
Job,6,21,"For now you are nothing, You see terror and are afraid."
Job,6,22,"Did I ever say, ‘Bring something to me’? Or, ‘Offer a bribe for me from your wealth’?"
Job,6,23,"Or, ‘Deliver me from the enemy’s hand’? Or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of oppressors’?"
Job,6,24,"“Teach me, and I will hold my tongue; Cause me to understand wherein I have erred."
Job,6,25,How forceful are right words! But what does your arguing prove?
Job,6,26,"Do you intend to rebuke my words, And the speeches of a desperate one, which are as wind?"
Job,6,27,"Yes, you overwhelm the fatherless, And you undermine your friend."
Job,6,28,"Now therefore, be pleased to look at me; For I would never lie to your face."
Job,6,29,"Yield now, let there be no injustice! Yes, concede, my righteousness still stands!"
Job,6,30,Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern the unsavory?
Job,7,1,“Is there not a time of hard service for man on earth? Are not his days also like the days of a hired man?
Job,7,2,"Like a servant who earnestly desires the shade, And like a hired man who eagerly looks for his wages,"
Job,7,3,"So I have been allotted months of futility, And wearisome nights have been appointed to me."
Job,7,4,"When I lie down, I say, ‘When shall I arise, And the night be ended?’ For I have had my fill of tossing till dawn."
Job,7,5,"My flesh is caked with worms and dust, My skin is cracked and breaks out afresh."
Job,7,6,"“My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, And are spent without hope."
Job,7,7,"Oh, remember that my life is a breath! My eye will never again see good."
Job,7,8,"The eye of him who sees me will see me no more; While your eyes are upon me, I shall no longer be."
Job,7,9,"As the cloud disappears and vanishes away, So he who goes down to the grave does not come up."
Job,7,10,"He shall never return to his house, Nor shall his place know him anymore."
Job,7,11,“Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,7,12,"Am I a sea, or a sea serpent, That You set a guard over me?"
Job,7,13,"When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me, My couch will ease my complaint,’"
Job,7,14,"Then You scare me with dreams And terrify me with visions,"
Job,7,15,So that my soul chooses strangling And death rather than my body.
Job,7,16,"I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone, For my days are but a breath."
Job,7,17,"“What is man, that You should exalt him, That You should set Your heart on him,"
Job,7,18,"That You should visit him every morning, And test him every moment?"
Job,7,19,"How long? Will You not look away from me, And let me alone till I swallow my saliva?"
Job,7,20,"Have I sinned? What have I done to You, O watcher of men? Why have You set me as Your target, So that I am a burden to myself?"
Job,7,21,"Why then do You not pardon my transgression, And take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust, And You will seek me diligently, But I will no longer be.”"
Job,8,1,Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
Job,8,2,"“How long will you speak these things, And the words of your mouth be like a strong wind?"
Job,8,3,Does God subvert judgment? Or does the Almighty pervert justice?
Job,8,4,"If your sons have sinned against Him, He has cast them away for their transgression."
Job,8,5,"If you would earnestly seek God And make your supplication to the Almighty,"
Job,8,6,"If you were pure and upright, Surely now He would awake for you, And prosper your rightful dwelling place."
Job,8,7,"Though your beginning was small, Yet your latter end would increase abundantly."
Job,8,8,"“For inquire, please, of the former age, And consider the things discovered by their fathers;"
Job,8,9,"For we were born yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days on earth are a shadow."
Job,8,10,"Will they not teach you and tell you, And utter words from their heart?"
Job,8,11,“Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh? Can the reeds flourish without water?
Job,8,12,"While it is yet green and not cut down, It withers before any other plant."
Job,8,13,"So are the paths of all who forget God; And the hope of the hypocrite shall perish,"
Job,8,14,"Whose confidence shall be cut off, And whose trust is a spider’s web."
Job,8,15,"He leans on his house, but it does not stand. He holds it fast, but it does not endure."
Job,8,16,"He grows green in the sun, And his branches spread out in his garden."
Job,8,17,"His roots wrap around the rock heap, And look for a place in the stones."
Job,8,18,"If he is destroyed from his place, Then it will deny him, saying, ‘I have not seen you.’"
Job,8,19,"“Behold, this is the joy of His way, And out of the earth others will grow."
Job,8,20,"Behold, God will not cast away the blameless, Nor will He uphold the evildoers."
Job,8,21,"He will yet fill your mouth with laughing, And your lips with rejoicing."
Job,8,22,"Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, And the dwelling place of the wicked will come to nothing.”"
Job,9,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,9,2,"“Truly I know it is so, But how can a man be righteous before God?"
Job,9,3,"If one wished to contend with Him, He could not answer Him one time out of a thousand."
Job,9,4,God is wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has hardened himself against Him and prospered?
Job,9,5,"He removes the mountains, and they do not know When He overturns them in His anger;"
Job,9,6,"He shakes the earth out of its place, And its pillars tremble;"
Job,9,7,"He commands the sun, and it does not rise; He seals off the stars;"
Job,9,8,"He alone spreads out the heavens, And treads on the waves of the sea;"
Job,9,9,"He made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south;"
Job,9,10,"He does great things past finding out, Yes, wonders without number."
Job,9,11,"If He goes by me, I do not see Him; If He moves past, I do not perceive Him;"
Job,9,12,"If He takes away, who can hinder Him? Who can say to Him, ‘What are You doing?’"
Job,9,13,"God will not withdraw His anger, The allies of the proud lie prostrate beneath Him."
Job,9,14,"“How then can I answer Him, And choose my words to reason with Him?"
Job,9,15,"For though I were righteous, I could not answer Him; I would beg mercy of my Judge."
Job,9,16,"If I called and He answered me, I would not believe that He was listening to my voice."
Job,9,17,"For He crushes me with a tempest, And multiplies my wounds without cause."
Job,9,18,"He will not allow me to catch my breath, But fills me with bitterness."
Job,9,19,"If it is a matter of strength, indeed He is strong; And if of justice, who will appoint my day in court?"
Job,9,20,"Though I were righteous, my own mouth would condemn me; Though I were blameless, it would prove me perverse."
Job,9,21,"“I am blameless, yet I do not know myself; I despise my life."
Job,9,22,"It is all one thing; Therefore I say, ‘He destroys the blameless and the wicked.’"
Job,9,23,"If the scourge slays suddenly, He laughs at the plight of the innocent."
Job,9,24,"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not He, who else could it be?"
Job,9,25,"“Now my days are swifter than a runner; They flee away, they see no good."
Job,9,26,"They pass by like swift ships, Like an eagle swooping on its prey."
Job,9,27,"If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face and wear a smile,’"
Job,9,28,I am afraid of all my sufferings; I know that You will not hold me innocent.
Job,9,29,"If I am condemned, Why then do I labor in vain?"
Job,9,30,"If I wash myself with snow water, And cleanse my hands with soap,"
Job,9,31,"Yet You will plunge me into the pit, And my own clothes will abhor me."
Job,9,32,"“For He is not a man, as I am, That I may answer Him, And that we should go to court together."
Job,9,33,"Nor is there any mediator between us, Who may lay his hand on us both."
Job,9,34,"Let Him take His rod away from me, And do not let dread of Him terrify me."
Job,9,35,"Then I would speak and not fear Him, But it is not so with me."
Job,10,1,"“My soul loathes my life; I will give free course to my complaint, I will speak in the bitterness of my soul."
Job,10,2,"I will say to God, ‘Do not condemn me; Show me why You contend with me."
Job,10,3,"Does it seem good to You that You should oppress, That You should despise the work of Your hands, And smile on the counsel of the wicked?"
Job,10,4,Do You have eyes of flesh? Or do You see as man sees?
Job,10,5,"Are Your days like the days of a mortal man? Are Your years like the days of a mighty man,"
Job,10,6,"That You should seek for my iniquity And search out my sin,"
Job,10,7,"Although You know that I am not wicked, And there is no one who can deliver from Your hand?"
Job,10,8,"‘Your hands have made me and fashioned me, An intricate unity; Yet You would destroy me."
Job,10,9,"Remember, I pray, that You have made me like clay. And will You turn me into dust again?"
Job,10,10,"Did You not pour me out like milk, And curdle me like cheese,"
Job,10,11,"Clothe me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews?"
Job,10,12,"You have granted me life and favor, And Your care has preserved my spirit."
Job,10,13,‘And these things You have hidden in Your heart; I know that this was with You:
Job,10,14,"If I sin, then You mark me, And will not acquit me of my iniquity."
Job,10,15,"If I am wicked, woe to me; Even if I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head. I am full of disgrace; See my misery!"
Job,10,16,"If my head is exalted, You hunt me like a fierce lion, And again You show Yourself awesome against me."
Job,10,17,"You renew Your witnesses against me, And increase Your indignation toward me; Changes and war are ever with me."
Job,10,18,"‘Why then have You brought me out of the womb? Oh, that I had perished and no eye had seen me!"
Job,10,19,I would have been as though I had not been. I would have been carried from the womb to the grave.
Job,10,20,"Are not my days few? Cease! Leave me alone, that I may take a little comfort,"
Job,10,21,"Before I go to the place from which I shall not return, To the land of darkness and the shadow of death,"
Job,10,22,"A land as dark as darkness itself, As the shadow of death, without any order, Where even the light is like darkness.’”"
Job,11,1,Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
Job,11,2,“Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be vindicated?
Job,11,3,"Should your empty talk make men hold their peace? And when you mock, should no one rebuke you?"
Job,11,4,"For you have said, ‘My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in your eyes.’"
Job,11,5,"But oh, that God would speak, And open His lips against you,"
Job,11,6,That He would show you the secrets of wisdom! For they would double your prudence. Know therefore that God exacts from you Less than your iniquity deserves.
Job,11,7,“Can you search out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limits of the Almighty?
Job,11,8,They are higher than heaven— what can you do? Deeper than Sheol— what can you know?
Job,11,9,Their measure is longer than the earth And broader than the sea.
Job,11,10,"“If He passes by, imprisons, and gathers to judgment, Then who can hinder Him?"
Job,11,11,For He knows deceitful men; He sees wickedness also. Will He not then consider it?
Job,11,12,"For an empty-headed man will be wise, When a wild donkey’s colt is born a man."
Job,11,13,"“If you would prepare your heart, And stretch out your hands toward Him;"
Job,11,14,"If iniquity were in your hand, and you put it far away, And would not let wickedness dwell in your tents;"
Job,11,15,"Then surely you could lift up your face without spot; Yes, you could be steadfast, and not fear;"
Job,11,16,"Because you would forget your misery, And remember it as waters that have passed away,"
Job,11,17,"And your life would be brighter than noonday. Though you were dark, you would be like the morning."
Job,11,18,"And you would be secure, because there is hope; Yes, you would dig around you, and take your rest in safety."
Job,11,19,"You would also lie down, and no one would make you afraid; Yes, many would court your favor."
Job,11,20,"But the eyes of the wicked will fail, And they shall not escape, And their hope—loss of life!”"
Job,12,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,12,2,"“No doubt you are the people, And wisdom will die with you!"
Job,12,3,"But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Indeed, who does not know such things as these?"
Job,12,4,"“I am one mocked by his friends, Who called on God, and He answered him, The just and blameless who is ridiculed."
Job,12,5,A lamp is despised in the thought of one who is at ease; It is made ready for those whose feet slip.
Job,12,6,"The tents of robbers prosper, And those who provoke God are secure— In what God provides by His hand."
Job,12,7,"“But now ask the beasts, and they will teach you; And the birds of the air, and they will tell you;"
Job,12,8,"Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; And the fish of the sea will explain to you."
Job,12,9,"Who among all these does not know That the hand of the LORD has done this,"
Job,12,10,"In whose hand is the life of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind?"
Job,12,11,Does not the ear test words And the mouth taste its food?
Job,12,12,"Wisdom is with aged men, And with length of days, understanding."
Job,12,13,"“With Him are wisdom and strength, He has counsel and understanding."
Job,12,14,"If He breaks a thing down, it cannot be rebuilt; If He imprisons a man, there can be no release."
Job,12,15,"If He withholds the waters, they dry up; If He sends them out, they overwhelm the earth."
Job,12,16,With Him are strength and prudence. The deceived and the deceiver are His.
Job,12,17,"He leads counselors away plundered, And makes fools of the judges."
Job,12,18,"He loosens the bonds of kings, And binds their waist with a belt."
Job,12,19,"He leads princes away plundered, And overthrows the mighty."
Job,12,20,"He deprives the trusted ones of speech, And takes away the discernment of the elders."
Job,12,21,"He pours contempt on princes, And disarms the mighty."
Job,12,22,"He uncovers deep things out of darkness, And brings the shadow of death to light."
Job,12,23,"He makes nations great, and destroys them; He enlarges nations, and guides them."
Job,12,24,"He takes away the understanding of the chiefs of the people of the earth, And makes them wander in a pathless wilderness."
Job,12,25,"They grope in the dark without light, And He makes them stagger like a drunken man."
Job,13,1,"“Behold, my eye has seen all this, My ear has heard and understood it."
Job,13,2,"What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you."
Job,13,3,"But I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to reason with God."
Job,13,4,"But you forgers of lies, You are all worthless physicians."
Job,13,5,"Oh, that you would be silent, And it would be your wisdom!"
Job,13,6,"Now hear my reasoning, And heed the pleadings of my lips."
Job,13,7,"Will you speak wickedly for God, And talk deceitfully for Him?"
Job,13,8,Will you show partiality for Him? Will you contend for God?
Job,13,9,Will it be well when He searches you out? Or can you mock Him as one mocks a man?
Job,13,10,He will surely rebuke you If you secretly show partiality.
Job,13,11,"Will not His excellence make you afraid, And the dread of Him fall upon you?"
Job,13,12,"Your platitudes are proverbs of ashes, Your defenses are defenses of clay."
Job,13,13,"“Hold your peace with me, and let me speak, Then let come on me what may!"
Job,13,14,"Why do I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hands?"
Job,13,15,"Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him. Even so, I will defend my own ways before Him."
Job,13,16,"He also shall be my salvation, For a hypocrite could not come before Him."
Job,13,17,"Listen carefully to my speech, And to my declaration with your ears."
Job,13,18,"See now, I have prepared my case, I know that I shall be vindicated."
Job,13,19,"Who is he who will contend with me? If now I hold my tongue, I perish."
Job,13,20,"“Only two things do not do to me, Then I will not hide myself from You:"
Job,13,21,"Withdraw Your hand far from me, And let not the dread of You make me afraid."
Job,13,22,"Then call, and I will answer; Or let me speak, then You respond to me."
Job,13,23,How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me know my transgression and my sin.
Job,13,24,"Why do You hide Your face, And regard me as Your enemy?"
Job,13,25,Will You frighten a leaf driven to and fro? And will You pursue dry stubble?
Job,13,26,"For You write bitter things against me, And make me inherit the iniquities of my youth."
Job,13,27,"You put my feet in the stocks, And watch closely all my paths. You set a limit for the soles of my feet."
Job,13,28,"“Man decays like a rotten thing, Like a garment that is moth-eaten."
Job,14,1,“Man who is born of woman Is of few days and full of trouble.
Job,14,2,He comes forth like a flower and fades away; He flees like a shadow and does not continue.
Job,14,3,"And do You open Your eyes on such a one, And bring me to judgment with Yourself?"
Job,14,4,Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one!
Job,14,5,"Since his days are determined, The number of his months is with You; You have appointed his limits, so that he cannot pass."
Job,14,6,"Look away from him that he may rest, Till like a hired man he finishes his day."
Job,14,7,"“For there is hope for a tree, If it is cut down, that it will sprout again, And that its tender shoots will not cease."
Job,14,8,"Though its root may grow old in the earth, And its stump may die in the ground,"
Job,14,9,Yet at the scent of water it will bud And bring forth branches like a plant.
Job,14,10,But man dies and is laid away; Indeed he breathes his last And where is he?
Job,14,11,"As water disappears from the sea, And a river becomes parched and dries up,"
Job,14,12,"So man lies down and does not rise. Till the heavens are no more, They will not awake Nor be roused from their sleep."
Job,14,13,"“Oh, that You would hide me in the grave, That You would conceal me until Your wrath is past, That You would appoint me a set time, and remember me!"
Job,14,14,"If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait, Till my change comes."
Job,14,15,"You shall call, and I will answer You; You shall desire the work of Your hands."
Job,14,16,"For now You number my steps, But do not watch over my sin."
Job,14,17,"My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And You cover my iniquity."
Job,14,18,"“But as a mountain falls and crumbles away, And as a rock is moved from its place;"
Job,14,19,"As water wears away stones, And as torrents wash away the soil of the earth; So You destroy the hope of man."
Job,14,20,"You prevail forever against him, and he passes on; You change his countenance and send him away."
Job,14,21,"His sons come to honor, and he does not know it; They are brought low, and he does not perceive it."
Job,14,22,"But his flesh will be in pain over it, And his soul will mourn over it.”"
Job,15,1,Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
Job,15,2,"“Should a wise man answer with empty knowledge, And fill himself with the east wind?"
Job,15,3,"Should he reason with unprofitable talk, Or by speeches with which he can do no good?"
Job,15,4,"Yes, you cast off fear, And restrain prayer before God."
Job,15,5,"For your iniquity teaches your mouth, And you choose the tongue of the crafty."
Job,15,6,"Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; Yes, your own lips testify against you."
Job,15,7,“Are you the first man who was born? Or were you made before the hills?
Job,15,8,Have you heard the counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?
Job,15,9,What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that is not in us?
Job,15,10,"Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us, Much older than your father."
Job,15,11,"Are the consolations of God too small for you, And the word spoken gently with you?"
Job,15,12,"Why does your heart carry you away, And what do your eyes wink at,"
Job,15,13,"That you turn your spirit against God, And let such words go out of your mouth?"
Job,15,14,"“What is man, that he could be pure? And he who is born of a woman, that he could be righteous?"
Job,15,15,"If God puts no trust in His saints, And the heavens are not pure in His sight,"
Job,15,16,"How much less man, who is abominable and filthy, Who drinks iniquity like water!"
Job,15,17,"“I will tell you, hear me; What I have seen I will declare,"
Job,15,18,"What wise men have told, Not hiding anything received from their fathers,"
Job,15,19,"To whom alone the land was given, And no alien passed among them:"
Job,15,20,"The wicked man writhes with pain all his days, And the number of years is hidden from the oppressor."
Job,15,21,Dreadful sounds are in his ears; In prosperity the destroyer comes upon him.
Job,15,22,"He does not believe that he will return from darkness, For a sword is waiting for him."
Job,15,23,"He wanders about for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’ He knows that a day of darkness is ready at his hand."
Job,15,24,"Trouble and anguish make him afraid; They overpower him, like a king ready for battle."
Job,15,25,"For he stretches out his hand against God, And acts defiantly against the Almighty,"
Job,15,26,"Running stubbornly against Him With his strong, embossed shield."
Job,15,27,"“Though he has covered his face with his fatness, And made his waist heavy with fat,"
Job,15,28,"He dwells in desolate cities, In houses which no one inhabits, Which are destined to become ruins."
Job,15,29,"He will not be rich, Nor will his wealth continue, Nor will his possessions overspread the earth."
Job,15,30,"He will not depart from darkness; The flame will dry out his branches, And by the breath of His mouth he will go away."
Job,15,31,"Let him not trust in futile things, deceiving himself, For futility will be his reward."
Job,15,32,"It will be accomplished before his time, And his branch will not be green."
Job,15,33,"He will shake off his unripe grape like a vine, And cast off his blossom like an olive tree."
Job,15,34,"For the company of hypocrites will be barren, And fire will consume the tents of bribery."
Job,15,35,They conceive trouble and bring forth futility; Their womb prepares deceit.”
Job,16,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,16,2,“I have heard many such things; Miserable comforters are you all!
Job,16,3,Shall words of wind have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer?
Job,16,4,"I also could speak as you do, If your soul were in my soul’s place. I could heap up words against you, And shake my head at you;"
Job,16,5,"But I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the comfort of my lips would relieve your grief."
Job,16,6,"“Though I speak, my grief is not relieved; And if I remain silent, how am I eased?"
Job,16,7,But now He has worn me out; You have made desolate all my company.
Job,16,8,"You have shriveled me up, And it is a witness against me; My leanness rises up against me And bears witness to my face."
Job,16,9,"He tears me in His wrath, and hates me; He gnashes at me with His teeth; My adversary sharpens His gaze on me."
Job,16,10,"They gape at me with their mouth, They strike me reproachfully on the cheek, They gather together against me."
Job,16,11,"God has delivered me to the ungodly, And turned me over to the hands of the wicked."
Job,16,12,"I was at ease, but He has shattered me; He also has taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces; He has set me up for His target,"
Job,16,13,His archers surround me. He pierces my heart and does not pity; He pours out my gall on the ground.
Job,16,14,He breaks me with wound upon wound; He runs at me like a warrior.
Job,16,15,"“I have sewn sackcloth over my skin, And laid my head in the dust."
Job,16,16,"My face is flushed from weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;"
Job,16,17,"Although no violence is in my hands, And my prayer is pure."
Job,16,18,"“O earth, do not cover my blood, And let my cry have no resting place!"
Job,16,19,"Surely even now my witness is in heaven, And my evidence is on high."
Job,16,20,My friends scorn me; My eyes pour out tears to God.
Job,16,21,"Oh, that one might plead for a man with God, As a man pleads for his neighbor!"
Job,16,22,"For when a few years are finished, I shall go the way of no return."
Job,17,1,"“My spirit is broken, My days are extinguished, The grave is ready for me."
Job,17,2,Are not mockers with me? And does not my eye dwell on their provocation?
Job,17,3,“Now put down a pledge for me with Yourself. Who is he who will shake hands with me?
Job,17,4,For You have hidden their heart from understanding; Therefore You will not exalt them.
Job,17,5,"He who speaks flattery to his friends, Even the eyes of his children will fail."
Job,17,6,"“But He has made me a byword of the people, And I have become one in whose face men spit."
Job,17,7,"My eye has also grown dim because of sorrow, And all my members are like shadows."
Job,17,8,"Upright men are astonished at this, And the innocent stirs himself up against the hypocrite."
Job,17,9,"Yet the righteous will hold to his way, And he who has clean hands will be stronger and stronger."
Job,17,10,"“But please, come back again, all of you, For I shall not find one wise man among you."
Job,17,11,"My days are past, My purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart."
Job,17,12,"They change the night into day; ‘The light is near,’ they say, in the face of darkness."
Job,17,13,"If I wait for the grave as my house, If I make my bed in the darkness,"
Job,17,14,"If I say to corruption, ‘You are my father,’ And to the worm, ‘You are my mother and my sister,’"
Job,17,15,"Where then is my hope? As for my hope, who can see it?"
Job,17,16,Will they go down to the gates of Sheol? Shall we have rest together in the dust?”
Job,18,1,Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
Job,18,2,"“How long till you put an end to words? Gain understanding, and afterward we will speak."
Job,18,3,"Why are we counted as beasts, And regarded as stupid in your sight?"
Job,18,4,"You who tear yourself in anger, Shall the earth be forsaken for you? Or shall the rock be removed from its place?"
Job,18,5,"“The light of the wicked indeed goes out, And the flame of his fire does not shine."
Job,18,6,"The light is dark in his tent, And his lamp beside him is put out."
Job,18,7,"The steps of his strength are shortened, And his own counsel casts him down."
Job,18,8,"For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walks into a snare."
Job,18,9,"The net takes him by the heel, And a snare lays hold of him."
Job,18,10,"A noose is hidden for him on the ground, And a trap for him in the road."
Job,18,11,"Terrors frighten him on every side, And drive him to his feet."
Job,18,12,"His strength is starved, And destruction is ready at his side."
Job,18,13,It devours patches of his skin; The firstborn of death devours his limbs.
Job,18,14,"He is uprooted from the shelter of his tent, And they parade him before the king of terrors."
Job,18,15,They dwell in his tent who are none of his; Brimstone is scattered on his dwelling.
Job,18,16,"His roots are dried out below, And his branch withers above."
Job,18,17,"The memory of him perishes from the earth, And he has no name among the renowned."
Job,18,18,"He is driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world."
Job,18,19,"He has neither son nor posterity among his people, Nor any remaining in his dwellings."
Job,18,20,"Those in the west are astonished at his day, As those in the east are frightened."
Job,18,21,"Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, And this is the place of him who does not know God.”"
Job,19,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,19,2,"“How long will you torment my soul, And break me in pieces with words?"
Job,19,3,These ten times you have reproached me; You are not ashamed that you have wronged me.
Job,19,4,"And if indeed I have erred, My error remains with me."
Job,19,5,"If indeed you exalt yourselves against me, And plead my disgrace against me,"
Job,19,6,"Know then that God has wronged me, And has surrounded me with His net."
Job,19,7,"“If I cry out concerning wrong, I am not heard. If I cry aloud, there is no justice."
Job,19,8,"He has fenced up my way, so that I cannot pass; And He has set darkness in my paths."
Job,19,9,"He has stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown from my head."
Job,19,10,"He breaks me down on every side, And I am gone; My hope He has uprooted like a tree."
Job,19,11,"He has also kindled His wrath against me, And He counts me as one of His enemies."
Job,19,12,His troops come together And build up their road against me; They encamp all around my tent.
Job,19,13,"“He has removed my brothers far from me, And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me."
Job,19,14,"My relatives have failed, And my close friends have forgotten me."
Job,19,15,"Those who dwell in my house, and my maidservants, Count me as a stranger; I am an alien in their sight."
Job,19,16,"I call my servant, but he gives no answer; I beg him with my mouth."
Job,19,17,"My breath is offensive to my wife, And I am repulsive to the children of my own body."
Job,19,18,"Even young children despise me; I arise, and they speak against me."
Job,19,19,"All my close friends abhor me, And those whom I love have turned against me."
Job,19,20,"My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh, And I have escaped by the skin of my teeth."
Job,19,21,"“Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends, For the hand of God has struck me!"
Job,19,22,"Why do you persecute me as God does, And are not satisfied with my flesh?"
Job,19,23,"“Oh, that my words were written! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book!"
Job,19,24,"That they were engraved on a rock With an iron pen and lead, forever!"
Job,19,25,"For I know that my Redeemer lives, And He shall stand at last on the earth;"
Job,19,26,"And after my skin is destroyed, this I know, That in my flesh I shall see God,"
Job,19,27,"Whom I shall see for myself, And my eyes shall behold, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!"
Job,19,28,"If you should say, ‘How shall we persecute him?’— Since the root of the matter is found in me,"
Job,19,29,"Be afraid of the sword for yourselves; For wrath brings the punishment of the sword, That you may know there is a judgment.”"
Job,20,1,Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
Job,20,2,"“Therefore my anxious thoughts make me answer, Because of the turmoil within me."
Job,20,3,"I have heard the rebuke that reproaches me, And the spirit of my understanding causes me to answer."
Job,20,4,"“Do you not know this of old, Since man was placed on earth,"
Job,20,5,"That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment?"
Job,20,6,"Though his haughtiness mounts up to the heavens, And his head reaches to the clouds,"
Job,20,7,"Yet he will perish forever like his own refuse; Those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’"
Job,20,8,"He will fly away like a dream, and not be found; Yes, he will be chased away like a vision of the night."
Job,20,9,"The eye that saw him will see him no more, Nor will his place behold him anymore."
Job,20,10,"His children will seek the favor of the poor, And his hands will restore his wealth."
Job,20,11,"His bones are full of his youthful vigor, But it will lie down with him in the dust."
Job,20,12,"“Though evil is sweet in his mouth, And he hides it under his tongue,"
Job,20,13,"Though he spares it and does not forsake it, But still keeps it in his mouth,"
Job,20,14,Yet his food in his stomach turns sour; It becomes cobra venom within him.
Job,20,15,He swallows down riches And vomits them up again; God casts them out of his belly.
Job,20,16,He will suck the poison of cobras; The viper’s tongue will slay him.
Job,20,17,"He will not see the streams, The rivers flowing with honey and cream."
Job,20,18,"He will restore that for which he labored, And will not swallow it down; From the proceeds of business He will get no enjoyment."
Job,20,19,"For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor, He has violently seized a house which he did not build."
Job,20,20,"“Because he knows no quietness in his heart, He will not save anything he desires."
Job,20,21,Nothing is left for him to eat; Therefore his well-being will not last.
Job,20,22,In his self-sufficiency he will be in distress; Every hand of misery will come against him.
Job,20,23,"When he is about to fill his stomach, God will cast on him the fury of His wrath, And will rain it on him while he is eating."
Job,20,24,He will flee from the iron weapon; A bronze bow will pierce him through.
Job,20,25,"It is drawn, and comes out of the body; Yes, the glittering point comes out of his gall. Terrors come upon him;"
Job,20,26,Total darkness is reserved for his treasures. An unfanned fire will consume him; It shall go ill with him who is left in his tent.
Job,20,27,"The heavens will reveal his iniquity, And the earth will rise up against him."
Job,20,28,"The increase of his house will depart, And his goods will flow away in the day of His wrath."
Job,20,29,"This is the portion from God for a wicked man, The heritage appointed to him by God.”"
Job,21,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,21,2,"“Listen carefully to my speech, And let this be your consolation."
Job,21,3,"Bear with me that I may speak, And after I have spoken, keep mocking."
Job,21,4,"“As for me, is my complaint against man? And if it were, why should I not be impatient?"
Job,21,5,Look at me and be astonished; Put your hand over your mouth.
Job,21,6,"Even when I remember I am terrified, And trembling takes hold of my flesh."
Job,21,7,"Why do the wicked live and become old, Yes, become mighty in power?"
Job,21,8,"Their descendants are established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes."
Job,21,9,"Their houses are safe from fear, Neither is the rod of God upon them."
Job,21,10,Their bull breeds without failure; Their cow calves without miscarriage.
Job,21,11,"They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance."
Job,21,12,"They sing to the tambourine and harp, And rejoice to the sound of the flute."
Job,21,13,"They spend their days in wealth, And in a moment go down to the grave."
Job,21,14,"Yet they say to God, ‘Depart from us, For we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways."
Job,21,15,"Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit do we have if we pray to Him?’"
Job,21,16,Indeed their prosperity is not in their hand; The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job,21,17,"“How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? How often does their destruction come upon them, The sorrows God distributes in His anger?"
Job,21,18,"They are like straw before the wind, And like chaff that a storm carries away."
Job,21,19,"They say, ‘God lays up one’s iniquity for his children’; Let Him recompense him, that he may know it."
Job,21,20,"Let his eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty."
Job,21,21,"For what does he care about his household after him, When the number of his months is cut in half?"
Job,21,22,"“Can anyone teach God knowledge, Since He judges those on high?"
Job,21,23,"One dies in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and secure;"
Job,21,24,"His pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moist."
Job,21,25,"Another man dies in the bitterness of his soul, Never having eaten with pleasure."
Job,21,26,"They lie down alike in the dust, And worms cover them."
Job,21,27,"“Look, I know your thoughts, And the schemes with which you would wrong me."
Job,21,28,"For you say, ‘Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent, The dwelling place of the wicked?’"
Job,21,29,Have you not asked those who travel the road? And do you not know their signs?
Job,21,30,For the wicked are reserved for the day of doom; They shall be brought out on the day of wrath.
Job,21,31,Who condemns his way to his face? And who repays him for what he has done?
Job,21,32,"Yet he shall be brought to the grave, And a vigil kept over the tomb."
Job,21,33,"The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him; Everyone shall follow him, As countless have gone before him."
Job,21,34,"How then can you comfort me with empty words, Since falsehood remains in your answers?”"
Job,22,1,Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
Job,22,2,"“Can a man be profitable to God, Though he who is wise may be profitable to himself?"
Job,22,3,Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous? Or is it gain to Him that you make your ways blameless?
Job,22,4,"“Is it because of your fear of Him that He corrects you, And enters into judgment with you?"
Job,22,5,"Is not your wickedness great, And your iniquity without end?"
Job,22,6,"For you have taken pledges from your brother for no reason, And stripped the naked of their clothing."
Job,22,7,"You have not given the weary water to drink, And you have withheld bread from the hungry."
Job,22,8,"But the mighty man possessed the land, And the honorable man dwelt in it."
Job,22,9,"You have sent widows away empty, And the strength of the fatherless was crushed."
Job,22,10,"Therefore snares are all around you, And sudden fear troubles you,"
Job,22,11,Or darkness so that you cannot see; And an abundance of water covers you.
Job,22,12,"“Is not God in the height of heaven? And see the highest stars, how lofty they are!"
Job,22,13,"And you say, ‘What does God know? Can He judge through the deep darkness?"
Job,22,14,"Thick clouds cover Him, so that He cannot see, And He walks above the circle of heaven.’"
Job,22,15,"Will you keep to the old way Which wicked men have trod,"
Job,22,16,"Who were cut down before their time, Whose foundations were swept away by a flood?"
Job,22,17,"They said to God, ‘Depart from us! What can the Almighty do to them?’"
Job,22,18,Yet He filled their houses with good things; But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job,22,19,"“The righteous see it and are glad, And the innocent laugh at them:"
Job,22,20,"‘Surely our adversaries are cut down, And the fire consumes their remnant.’"
Job,22,21,"“Now acquaint yourself with Him, and be at peace; Thereby good will come to you."
Job,22,22,"Receive, please, instruction from His mouth, And lay up His words in your heart."
Job,22,23,"If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up; You will remove iniquity far from your tents."
Job,22,24,"Then you will lay your gold in the dust, And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks."
Job,22,25,"Yes, the Almighty will be your gold And your precious silver;"
Job,22,26,"For then you will have your delight in the Almighty, And lift up your face to God."
Job,22,27,"You will make your prayer to Him, He will hear you, And you will pay your vows."
Job,22,28,"You will also declare a thing, And it will be established for you; So light will shine on your ways."
Job,22,29,"When they cast you down, and you say, ‘Exaltation will come!’ Then He will save the humble person."
Job,22,30,"He will even deliver one who is not innocent; Yes, he will be delivered by the purity of your hands.”"
Job,23,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,23,2,“Even today my complaint is bitter; My hand is listless because of my groaning.
Job,23,3,"Oh, that I knew where I might find Him, That I might come to His seat!"
Job,23,4,"I would present my case before Him, And fill my mouth with arguments."
Job,23,5,"I would know the words which He would answer me, And understand what He would say to me."
Job,23,6,Would He contend with me in His great power? No! But He would take note of me.
Job,23,7,"There the upright could reason with Him, And I would be delivered forever from my Judge."
Job,23,8,"“Look, I go forward, but He is not there, And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;"
Job,23,9,"When He works on the left hand, I cannot behold Him; When He turns to the right hand, I cannot see Him."
Job,23,10,"But He knows the way that I take; When He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold."
Job,23,11,My foot has held fast to His steps; I have kept His way and not turned aside.
Job,23,12,I have not departed from the commandment of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my necessary food.
Job,23,13,"“But He is unique, and who can make Him change? And whatever His soul desires, that He does."
Job,23,14,"For He performs what is appointed for me, And many such things are with Him."
Job,23,15,"Therefore I am terrified at His presence; When I consider this, I am afraid of Him."
Job,23,16,"For God made my heart weak, And the Almighty terrifies me;"
Job,23,17,"Because I was not cut off from the presence of darkness, And He did not hide deep darkness from my face."
Job,24,1,"“Since times are not hidden from the Almighty, Why do those who know Him see not His days?"
Job,24,2,“Some remove landmarks; They seize flocks violently and feed on them;
Job,24,3,They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; They take the widow’s ox as a pledge.
Job,24,4,They push the needy off the road; All the poor of the land are forced to hide.
Job,24,5,"Indeed, like wild donkeys in the desert, They go out to their work, searching for food. The wilderness yields food for them and for their children."
Job,24,6,They gather their fodder in the field And glean in the vineyard of the wicked.
Job,24,7,"They spend the night naked, without clothing, And have no covering in the cold."
Job,24,8,"They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And huddle around the rock for want of shelter."
Job,24,9,"“Some snatch the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge from the poor."
Job,24,10,"They cause the poor to go naked, without clothing; And they take away the sheaves from the hungry."
Job,24,11,"They press out oil within their walls, And tread winepresses, yet suffer thirst."
Job,24,12,"The dying groan in the city, And the souls of the wounded cry out; Yet God does not charge them with wrong."
Job,24,13,“There are those who rebel against the light; They do not know its ways Nor abide in its paths.
Job,24,14,The murderer rises with the light; He kills the poor and needy; And in the night he is like a thief.
Job,24,15,"The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, Saying, ‘No eye will see me’; And he disguises his face."
Job,24,16,In the dark they break into houses Which they marked for themselves in the daytime; They do not know the light.
Job,24,17,"For the morning is the same to them as the shadow of death; If someone recognizes them, They are in the terrors of the shadow of death."
Job,24,18,"“They should be swift on the face of the waters, Their portion should be cursed in the earth, So that no one would turn into the way of their vineyards."
Job,24,19,"As drought and heat consume the snow waters, So the grave consumes those who have sinned."
Job,24,20,"The womb should forget him, The worm should feed sweetly on him; He should be remembered no more, And wickedness should be broken like a tree."
Job,24,21,"For he preys on the barren who do not bear, And does no good for the widow."
Job,24,22,"“But God draws the mighty away with His power; He rises up, but no man is sure of life."
Job,24,23,"He gives them security, and they rely on it; Yet His eyes are on their ways."
Job,24,24,"They are exalted for a little while, Then they are gone. They are brought low; They are taken out of the way like all others; They dry out like the heads of grain."
Job,24,25,"“Now if it is not so, who will prove me a liar, And make my speech worth nothing?”"
Job,25,1,Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
Job,25,2,“Dominion and fear belong to Him; He makes peace in His high places.
Job,25,3,Is there any number to His armies? Upon whom does His light not rise?
Job,25,4,How then can man be righteous before God? Or how can he be pure who is born of a woman?
Job,25,5,"If even the moon does not shine, And the stars are not pure in His sight,"
Job,25,6,"How much less man, who is a maggot, And a son of man, who is a worm?”"
Job,26,1,But Job answered and said:
Job,26,2,“How have you helped him who is without power? How have you saved the arm that has no strength?
Job,26,3,How have you counseled one who has no wisdom? And how have you declared sound advice to many?
Job,26,4,To whom have you uttered words? And whose spirit came from you?
Job,26,5,"“The dead tremble, Those under the waters and those inhabiting them."
Job,26,6,"Sheol is naked before Him, And Destruction has no covering."
Job,26,7,He stretches out the north over empty space; He hangs the earth on nothing.
Job,26,8,"He binds up the water in His thick clouds, Yet the clouds are not broken under it."
Job,26,9,"He covers the face of His throne, And spreads His cloud over it."
Job,26,10,"He drew a circular horizon on the face of the waters, At the boundary of light and darkness."
Job,26,11,"The pillars of heaven tremble, And are astonished at His rebuke."
Job,26,12,"He stirs up the sea with His power, And by His understanding He breaks up the storm."
Job,26,13,By His Spirit He adorned the heavens; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
Job,26,14,"Indeed these are the mere edges of His ways, And how small a whisper we hear of Him! But the thunder of His power who can understand?”"
Job,27,1,"Moreover Job continued his discourse, and said:"
Job,27,2,"“As God lives, who has taken away my justice, And the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter,"
Job,27,3,"As long as my breath is in me, And the breath of God in my nostrils,"
Job,27,4,"My lips will not speak wickedness, Nor my tongue utter deceit."
Job,27,5,Far be it from me That I should say you are right; Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
Job,27,6,"My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go; My heart shall not reproach me as long as I live."
Job,27,7,"“May my enemy be like the wicked, And he who rises up against me like the unrighteous."
Job,27,8,"For what is the hope of the hypocrite, Though he may gain much, If God takes away his life?"
Job,27,9,Will God hear his cry When trouble comes upon him?
Job,27,10,Will he delight himself in the Almighty? Will he always call on God?
Job,27,11,“I will teach you about the hand of God; What is with the Almighty I will not conceal.
Job,27,12,Surely all of you have seen it; Why then do you behave with complete nonsense?
Job,27,13,"“This is the portion of a wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, received from the Almighty:"
Job,27,14,"If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword; And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread."
Job,27,15,"Those who survive him shall be buried in death, And their widows shall not weep,"
Job,27,16,"Though he heaps up silver like dust, And piles up clothing like clay—"
Job,27,17,"He may pile it up, but the just will wear it, And the innocent will divide the silver."
Job,27,18,"He builds his house like a moth, Like a booth which a watchman makes."
Job,27,19,"The rich man will lie down, But not be gathered up; He opens his eyes, And he is no more."
Job,27,20,Terrors overtake him like a flood; A tempest steals him away in the night.
Job,27,21,"The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; It sweeps him out of his place."
Job,27,22,It hurls against him and does not spare; He flees desperately from its power.
Job,27,23,"Men shall clap their hands at him, And shall hiss him out of his place."
Job,28,1,"“Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place where gold is refined."
Job,28,2,"Iron is taken from the earth, And copper is smelted from ore."
Job,28,3,"Man puts an end to darkness, And searches every recess For ore in the darkness and the shadow of death."
Job,28,4,He breaks open a shaft away from people; In places forgotten by feet They hang far away from men; They swing to and fro.
Job,28,5,"As for the earth, from it comes bread, But underneath it is turned up as by fire;"
Job,28,6,"Its stones are the source of sapphires, And it contains gold dust."
Job,28,7,"That path no bird knows, Nor has the falcon’s eye seen it."
Job,28,8,"The proud lions have not trodden it, Nor has the fierce lion passed over it."
Job,28,9,He puts his hand on the flint; He overturns the mountains at the roots.
Job,28,10,"He cuts out channels in the rocks, And his eye sees every precious thing."
Job,28,11,He dams up the streams from trickling; What is hidden he brings forth to light.
Job,28,12,“But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,13,"Man does not know its value, Nor is it found in the land of the living."
Job,28,14,"The deep says, ‘It is not in me’; And the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’"
Job,28,15,"It cannot be purchased for gold, Nor can silver be weighed for its price."
Job,28,16,"It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, In precious onyx or sapphire."
Job,28,17,"Neither gold nor crystal can equal it, Nor can it be exchanged for jewelry of fine gold."
Job,28,18,"No mention shall be made of coral or quartz, For the price of wisdom is above rubies."
Job,28,19,"The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, Nor can it be valued in pure gold."
Job,28,20,“From where then does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,21,"It is hidden from the eyes of all living, And concealed from the birds of the air."
Job,28,22,"Destruction and Death say, ‘We have heard a report about it with our ears.’"
Job,28,23,"God understands its way, And He knows its place."
Job,28,24,"For He looks to the ends of the earth, And sees under the whole heavens,"
Job,28,25,"To establish a weight for the wind, And apportion the waters by measure."
Job,28,26,"When He made a law for the rain, And a path for the thunderbolt,"
Job,28,27,"Then He saw wisdom and declared it; He prepared it, indeed, He searched it out."
Job,28,28,"And to man He said, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, And to depart from evil is understanding.’”"
Job,29,1,"Job further continued his discourse, and said:"
Job,29,2,"“Oh, that I were as in months past, As in the days when God watched over me;"
Job,29,3,"When His lamp shone upon my head, And when by His light I walked through darkness;"
Job,29,4,"Just as I was in the days of my prime, When the friendly counsel of God was over my tent;"
Job,29,5,"When the Almighty was yet with me, When my children were around me;"
Job,29,6,"When my steps were bathed with cream, And the rock poured out rivers of oil for me!"
Job,29,7,"“When I went out to the gate by the city, When I took my seat in the open square,"
Job,29,8,"The young men saw me and hid, And the aged arose and stood;"
Job,29,9,"The princes refrained from talking, And put their hand on their mouth;"
Job,29,10,"The voice of nobles was hushed, And their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth."
Job,29,11,"When the ear heard, then it blessed me, And when the eye saw, then it approved me;"
Job,29,12,"Because I delivered the poor who cried out, The fatherless and the one who had no helper."
Job,29,13,"The blessing of a perishing man came upon me, And I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy."
Job,29,14,"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; My justice was like a robe and a turban."
Job,29,15,"I was eyes to the blind, And I was feet to the lame."
Job,29,16,"I was a father to the poor, And I searched out the case that I did not know."
Job,29,17,"I broke the fangs of the wicked, And plucked the victim from his teeth."
Job,29,18,"“Then I said, ‘I shall die in my nest, And multiply my days as the sand."
Job,29,19,"My root is spread out to the waters, And the dew lies all night on my branch."
Job,29,20,"My glory is fresh within me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.’"
Job,29,21,"“Men listened to me and waited, And kept silence for my counsel."
Job,29,22,"After my words they did not speak again, And my speech settled on them as dew."
Job,29,23,"They waited for me as for the rain, And they opened their mouth wide as for the spring rain."
Job,29,24,"If I mocked at them, they did not believe it, And the light of my countenance they did not cast down."
Job,29,25,"I chose the way for them, and sat as chief; So I dwelt as a king in the army, As one who comforts mourners."
Job,30,1,"“But now they mock at me, men younger than I, Whose fathers I disdained to put with the dogs of my flock."
Job,30,2,"Indeed, what profit is the strength of their hands to me? Their vigor has perished."
Job,30,3,"They are gaunt from want and famine, Fleeing late to the wilderness, desolate and waste,"
Job,30,4,"Who pluck mallow by the bushes, And broom tree roots for their food."
Job,30,5,"They were driven out from among men, They shouted at them as at a thief."
Job,30,6,"They had to live in the clefts of the valleys, In caves of the earth and the rocks."
Job,30,7,"Among the bushes they brayed, Under the nettles they nestled."
Job,30,8,"They were sons of fools, Yes, sons of vile men; They were scourged from the land."
Job,30,9,"“And now I am their taunting song; Yes, I am their byword."
Job,30,10,"They abhor me, they keep far from me; They do not hesitate to spit in my face."
Job,30,11,"Because He has loosed my bowstring and afflicted me, They have cast off restraint before me."
Job,30,12,"At my right hand the rabble arises; They push away my feet, And they raise against me their ways of destruction."
Job,30,13,"They break up my path, They promote my calamity; They have no helper."
Job,30,14,They come as broad breakers; Under the ruinous storm they roll along.
Job,30,15,"Terrors are turned upon me; They pursue my honor as the wind, And my prosperity has passed like a cloud."
Job,30,16,“And now my soul is poured out because of my plight; The days of affliction take hold of me.
Job,30,17,"My bones are pierced in me at night, And my gnawing pains take no rest."
Job,30,18,By great force my garment is disfigured; It binds me about as the collar of my coat.
Job,30,19,"He has cast me into the mire, And I have become like dust and ashes."
Job,30,20,"“I cry out to You, but You do not answer me; I stand up, and You regard me."
Job,30,21,But You have become cruel to me; With the strength of Your hand You oppose me.
Job,30,22,You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride on it; You spoil my success.
Job,30,23,"For I know that You will bring me to death, And to the house appointed for all living."
Job,30,24,"“Surely He would not stretch out His hand against a heap of ruins, If they cry out when He destroys it."
Job,30,25,Have I not wept for him who was in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor?
Job,30,26,"But when I looked for good, evil came to me; And when I waited for light, then came darkness."
Job,30,27,My heart is in turmoil and cannot rest; Days of affliction confront me.
Job,30,28,"I go about mourning, but not in the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry out for help."
Job,30,29,"I am a brother of jackals, And a companion of ostriches."
Job,30,30,My skin grows black and falls from me; My bones burn with fever.
Job,30,31,"My harp is turned to mourning, And my flute to the voice of those who weep."
Job,31,1,“I have made a covenant with my eyes; Why then should I look upon a young woman?
Job,31,2,"For what is the allotment of God from above, And the inheritance of the Almighty from on high?"
Job,31,3,"Is it not destruction for the wicked, And disaster for the workers of iniquity?"
Job,31,4,"Does He not see my ways, And count all my steps?"
Job,31,5,"“If I have walked with falsehood, Or if my foot has hastened to deceit,"
Job,31,6,"Let me be weighed on honest scales, That God may know my integrity."
Job,31,7,"If my step has turned from the way, Or my heart walked after my eyes, Or if any spot adheres to my hands,"
Job,31,8,"Then let me sow, and another eat; Yes, let my harvest be rooted out."
Job,31,9,"“If my heart has been enticed by a woman, Or if I have lurked at my neighbor’s door,"
Job,31,10,"Then let my wife grind for another, And let others bow down over her."
Job,31,11,"For that would be wickedness; Yes, it would be iniquity deserving of judgment."
Job,31,12,"For that would be a fire that consumes to destruction, And would root out all my increase."
Job,31,13,"“If I have despised the cause of my male or female servant When they complained against me,"
Job,31,14,"What then shall I do when God rises up? When He punishes, how shall I answer Him?"
Job,31,15,Did not He who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same One fashion us in the womb?
Job,31,16,"“If I have kept the poor from their desire, Or caused the eyes of the widow to fail,"
Job,31,17,"Or eaten my morsel by myself, So that the fatherless could not eat of it"
Job,31,18,"(But from my youth I reared him as a father, And from my mother’s womb I guided the widow);"
Job,31,19,"If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, Or any poor man without covering;"
Job,31,20,"If his heart has not blessed me, And if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;"
Job,31,21,"If I have raised my hand against the fatherless, When I saw I had help in the gate;"
Job,31,22,"Then let my arm fall from my shoulder, Let my arm be torn from the socket."
Job,31,23,"For destruction from God is a terror to me, And because of His magnificence I cannot endure."
Job,31,24,"“If I have made gold my hope, Or said to fine gold, ‘You are my confidence’;"
Job,31,25,"If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, And because my hand had gained much;"
Job,31,26,"If I have observed the sun when it shines, Or the moon moving in brightness,"
Job,31,27,"So that my heart has been secretly enticed, And my mouth has kissed my hand;"
Job,31,28,"This also would be an iniquity deserving of judgment, For I would have denied God who is above."
Job,31,29,"“If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, Or lifted myself up when evil found him"
Job,31,30,(Indeed I have not allowed my mouth to sin By asking for a curse on his soul);
Job,31,31,"If the men of my tent have not said, ‘Who is there that has not been satisfied with his meat?’"
Job,31,32,"(But no sojourner had to lodge in the street, For I have opened my doors to the traveler);"
Job,31,33,"If I have covered my transgressions as Adam, By hiding my iniquity in my bosom,"
Job,31,34,"Because I feared the great multitude, And dreaded the contempt of families, So that I kept silence And did not go out of the door—"
Job,31,35,"Oh, that I had one to hear me! Here is my mark. Oh, that the Almighty would answer me, That my Prosecutor had written a book!"
Job,31,36,"Surely I would carry it on my shoulder, And bind it on me like a crown;"
Job,31,37,I would declare to Him the number of my steps; Like a prince I would approach Him.
Job,31,38,"“If my land cries out against me, And its furrows weep together;"
Job,31,39,"If I have eaten its fruit without money, Or caused its owners to lose their lives;"
Job,31,40,"Then let thistles grow instead of wheat, And weeds instead of barley.” The words of Job are ended."
Job,32,1,"So these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
Job,32,2,"Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was aroused against Job; his wrath was aroused because he justified himself rather than God."
Job,32,3,"Also against his three friends his wrath was aroused, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job."
Job,32,4,"Now because they were years older than he, Elihu had waited to speak to Job."
Job,32,5,"When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was aroused."
Job,32,6,"So Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said: “I am young in years, and you are very old; Therefore I was afraid, And dared not declare my opinion to you."
Job,32,7,"I said, ‘Age should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.’"
Job,32,8,"But there is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding."
Job,32,9,"Great men are not always wise, Nor do the aged always understand justice."
Job,32,10,"“Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me, I also will declare my opinion.’"
Job,32,11,"Indeed I waited for your words, I listened to your reasonings, while you searched out what to say."
Job,32,12,"I paid close attention to you; And surely not one of you convinced Job, Or answered his words—"
Job,32,13,"Lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom’; God will vanquish him, not man."
Job,32,14,Now he has not directed his words against me; So I will not answer him with your words.
Job,32,15,“They are dismayed and answer no more; Words escape them.
Job,32,16,"And I have waited, because they did not speak, Because they stood still and answered no more."
Job,32,17,"I also will answer my part, I too will declare my opinion."
Job,32,18,For I am full of words; The spirit within me compels me.
Job,32,19,Indeed my belly is like wine that has no vent; It is ready to burst like new wineskins.
Job,32,20,"I will speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer."
Job,32,21,"Let me not, I pray, show partiality to anyone; Nor let me flatter any man."
Job,32,22,"For I do not know how to flatter, Else my Maker would soon take me away."
Job,33,1,"“But please, Job, hear my speech, And listen to all my words."
Job,33,2,"Now, I open my mouth; My tongue speaks in my mouth."
Job,33,3,My words come from my upright heart; My lips utter pure knowledge.
Job,33,4,"The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of the Almighty gives me life."
Job,33,5,"If you can answer me, Set your words in order before me; Take your stand."
Job,33,6,Truly I am as your spokesman before God; I also have been formed out of clay.
Job,33,7,"Surely no fear of me will terrify you, Nor will my hand be heavy on you."
Job,33,8,"“Surely you have spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the sound of your words, saying,"
Job,33,9,"‘I am pure, without transgression; I am innocent, and there is no iniquity in me."
Job,33,10,"Yet He finds occasions against me, He counts me as His enemy;"
Job,33,11,"He puts my feet in the stocks, He watches all my paths.’"
Job,33,12,"“Look, in this you are not righteous. I will answer you, For God is greater than man."
Job,33,13,Why do you contend with Him? For He does not give an accounting of any of His words.
Job,33,14,"For God may speak in one way, or in another, Yet man does not perceive it."
Job,33,15,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falls upon men, While slumbering on their beds,"
Job,33,16,"Then He opens the ears of men, And seals their instruction."
Job,33,17,"In order to turn man from his deed, And conceal pride from man,"
Job,33,18,"He keeps back his soul from the Pit, And his life from perishing by the sword."
Job,33,19,"“Man is also chastened with pain on his bed, And with strong pain in many of his bones,"
Job,33,20,"So that his life abhors bread, And his soul succulent food."
Job,33,21,"His flesh wastes away from sight, And his bones stick out which once were not seen."
Job,33,22,"Yes, his soul draws near the Pit, And his life to the executioners."
Job,33,23,"“If there is a messenger for him, A mediator, one among a thousand, To show man His uprightness,"
Job,33,24,"Then He is gracious to him, and says, ‘Deliver him from going down to the Pit; I have found a ransom’;"
Job,33,25,"His flesh shall be young like a child’s, He shall return to the days of his youth."
Job,33,26,"He shall pray to God, and He will delight in him, He shall see His face with joy, For He restores to man His righteousness."
Job,33,27,"Then he looks at men and says, ‘I have sinned, and perverted what was right, And it did not profit me.’"
Job,33,28,"He will redeem his soul from going down to the Pit, And his life shall see the light."
Job,33,29,"“Behold, God works all these things, Twice, in fact, three times with a man,"
Job,33,30,"To bring back his soul from the Pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of life."
Job,33,31,"“Give ear, Job, listen to me; Hold your peace, and I will speak."
Job,33,32,"If you have anything to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify you."
Job,33,33,"If not, listen to me; Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.”"
Job,34,1,Elihu further answered and said:
Job,34,2,"“Hear my words, you wise men; Give ear to me, you who have knowledge."
Job,34,3,For the ear tests words As the palate tastes food.
Job,34,4,Let us choose justice for ourselves; Let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job,34,5,"“For Job has said, ‘I am righteous, But God has taken away my justice;"
Job,34,6,"Should I lie concerning my right? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’"
Job,34,7,"What man is like Job, Who drinks scorn like water,"
Job,34,8,"Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, And walks with wicked men?"
Job,34,9,"For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing That he should delight in God.’"
Job,34,10,"“Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding: Far be it from God to do wickedness, And from the Almighty to commit iniquity."
Job,34,11,"For He repays man according to his work, And makes man to find a reward according to his way."
Job,34,12,"Surely God will never do wickedly, Nor will the Almighty pervert justice."
Job,34,13,Who gave Him charge over the earth? Or who appointed Him over the whole world?
Job,34,14,"If He should set His heart on it, If He should gather to Himself His Spirit and His breath,"
Job,34,15,"All flesh would perish together, And man would return to dust."
Job,34,16,"“If you have understanding, hear this; Listen to the sound of my words:"
Job,34,17,Should one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn Him who is most just?
Job,34,18,"Is it fitting to say to a king, ‘You are worthless,’ And to nobles, ‘You are wicked’?"
Job,34,19,"Yet He is not partial to princes, Nor does He regard the rich more than the poor; For they are all the work of His hands."
Job,34,20,"In a moment they die, in the middle of the night; The people are shaken and pass away; The mighty are taken away without a hand."
Job,34,21,"“For His eyes are on the ways of man, And He sees all his steps."
Job,34,22,There is no darkness nor shadow of death Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
Job,34,23,"For He need not further consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment."
Job,34,24,"He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry, And sets others in their place."
Job,34,25,"Therefore He knows their works; He overthrows them in the night, And they are crushed."
Job,34,26,"He strikes them as wicked men In the open sight of others,"
Job,34,27,"Because they turned back from Him, And would not consider any of His ways,"
Job,34,28,So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him; For He hears the cry of the afflicted.
Job,34,29,"When He gives quietness, who then can make trouble? And when He hides His face, who then can see Him, Whether it is against a nation or a man alone?—"
Job,34,30,"That the hypocrite should not reign, Lest the people be ensnared."
Job,34,31,"“For has anyone said to God, ‘I have borne chastening; I will offend no more;"
Job,34,32,"Teach me what I do not see; If I have done iniquity, I will do no more’?"
Job,34,33,"Should He repay it according to your terms, Just because you disavow it? You must choose, and not I; Therefore speak what you know."
Job,34,34,"“Men of understanding say to me, Wise men who listen to me:"
Job,34,35,"‘Job speaks without knowledge, His words are without wisdom.’"
Job,34,36,"Oh, that Job were tried to the utmost, Because his answers are like those of wicked men!"
Job,34,37,"For he adds rebellion to his sin; He claps his hands among us, And multiplies his words against God.”"
Job,35,1,Moreover Elihu answered and said:
Job,35,2,"“Do you think this is right? Do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s’?"
Job,35,3,"For you say, ‘What advantage will it be to You? What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?’"
Job,35,4,"“I will answer you, And your companions with you."
Job,35,5,Look to the heavens and see; And behold the clouds— They are higher than you.
Job,35,6,"If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? Or, if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him?"
Job,35,7,"If you are righteous, what do you give Him? Or what does He receive from your hand?"
Job,35,8,"Your wickedness affects a man such as you, And your righteousness a son of man."
Job,35,9,“Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry out for help because of the arm of the mighty.
Job,35,10,"But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs in the night,"
Job,35,11,"Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?’"
Job,35,12,"There they cry out, but He does not answer, Because of the pride of evil men."
Job,35,13,"Surely God will not listen to empty talk, Nor will the Almighty regard it."
Job,35,14,"Although you say you do not see Him, Yet justice is before Him, and you must wait for Him."
Job,35,15,"And now, because He has not punished in His anger, Nor taken much notice of folly,"
Job,35,16,Therefore Job opens his mouth in vain; He multiplies words without knowledge.”
Job,36,1,Elihu also proceeded and said:
Job,36,2,"“Bear with me a little, and I will show you That there are yet words to speak on God’s behalf."
Job,36,3,I will fetch my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
Job,36,4,For truly my words are not false; One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
Job,36,5,"“Behold, God is mighty, but despises no one; He is mighty in strength of understanding."
Job,36,6,"He does not preserve the life of the wicked, But gives justice to the oppressed."
Job,36,7,"He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; But they are on the throne with kings, For He has seated them forever, And they are exalted."
Job,36,8,"And if they are bound in fetters, Held in the cords of affliction,"
Job,36,9,Then He tells them their work and their transgressions— That they have acted defiantly.
Job,36,10,"He also opens their ear to instruction, And commands that they turn from iniquity."
Job,36,11,"If they obey and serve Him, They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures."
Job,36,12,"But if they do not obey, They shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge."
Job,36,13,“But the hypocrites in heart store up wrath; They do not cry for help when He binds them.
Job,36,14,"They die in youth, And their life ends among the perverted persons."
Job,36,15,"He delivers the poor in their affliction, And opens their ears in oppression."
Job,36,16,"“Indeed He would have brought you out of dire distress, Into a broad place where there is no restraint; And what is set on your table would be full of richness."
Job,36,17,But you are filled with the judgment due the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold of you.
Job,36,18,"Because there is wrath, beware lest He take you away with one blow; For a large ransom would not help you avoid it."
Job,36,19,"Will your riches, Or all the mighty forces, Keep you from distress?"
Job,36,20,"Do not desire the night, When people are cut off in their place."
Job,36,21,"Take heed, do not turn to iniquity, For you have chosen this rather than affliction."
Job,36,22,"“Behold, God is exalted by His power; Who teaches like Him?"
Job,36,23,"Who has assigned Him His way, Or who has said, ‘You have done wrong’?"
Job,36,24,"“Remember to magnify His work, Of which men have sung."
Job,36,25,Everyone has seen it; Man looks on it from afar.
Job,36,26,"“Behold, God is great, and we do not know Him; Nor can the number of His years be discovered."
Job,36,27,"For He draws up drops of water, Which distill as rain from the mist,"
Job,36,28,Which the clouds drop down And pour abundantly on man.
Job,36,29,"Indeed, can anyone understand the spreading of clouds, The thunder from His canopy?"
Job,36,30,"Look, He scatters His light upon it, And covers the depths of the sea."
Job,36,31,For by these He judges the peoples; He gives food in abundance.
Job,36,32,"He covers His hands with lightning, And commands it to strike."
Job,36,33,"His thunder declares it, The cattle also, concerning the rising storm."
Job,37,1,"“At this also my heart trembles, And leaps from its place."
Job,37,2,"Hear attentively the thunder of His voice, And the rumbling that comes from His mouth."
Job,37,3,"He sends it forth under the whole heaven, His lightning to the ends of the earth."
Job,37,4,"After it a voice roars; He thunders with His majestic voice, And He does not restrain them when His voice is heard."
Job,37,5,God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things which we cannot comprehend.
Job,37,6,"For He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth’; Likewise to the gentle rain and the heavy rain of His strength."
Job,37,7,"He seals the hand of every man, That all men may know His work."
Job,37,8,"The beasts go into dens, And remain in their lairs."
Job,37,9,"From the chamber of the south comes the whirlwind, And cold from the scattering winds of the north."
Job,37,10,"By the breath of God ice is given, And the broad waters are frozen."
Job,37,11,Also with moisture He saturates the thick clouds; He scatters His bright clouds.
Job,37,12,"And they swirl about, being turned by His guidance, That they may do whatever He commands them On the face of the whole earth."
Job,37,13,"He causes it to come, Whether for correction, Or for His land, Or for mercy."
Job,37,14,"“Listen to this, O Job; Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God."
Job,37,15,"Do you know when God dispatches them, And causes the light of His cloud to shine?"
Job,37,16,"Do you know how the clouds are balanced, Those wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge?"
Job,37,17,"Why are your garments hot, When He quiets the earth by the south wind?"
Job,37,18,"With Him, have you spread out the skies, Strong as a cast metal mirror?"
Job,37,19,"“Teach us what we should say to Him, For we can prepare nothing because of the darkness."
Job,37,20,"Should He be told that I wish to speak? If a man were to speak, surely he would be swallowed up."
Job,37,21,"Even now men cannot look at the light when it is bright in the skies, When the wind has passed and cleared them."
Job,37,22,He comes from the north as golden splendor; With God is awesome majesty.
Job,37,23,"As for the Almighty, we cannot find Him; He is excellent in power, In judgment and abundant justice; He does not oppress."
Job,37,24,Therefore men fear Him; He shows no partiality to any who are wise of heart.”
Job,38,1,"Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:"
Job,38,2,“Who is this who darkens counsel By words without knowledge?
Job,38,3,"Now prepare yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer Me."
Job,38,4,"“Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding."
Job,38,5,Who determined its measurements? Surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it?
Job,38,6,"To what were its foundations fastened? Or who laid its cornerstone,"
Job,38,7,"When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy?"
Job,38,8,"“Or who shut in the sea with doors, When it burst forth and issued from the womb;"
Job,38,9,"When I made the clouds its garment, And thick darkness its swaddling band;"
Job,38,10,"When I fixed My limit for it, And set bars and doors;"
Job,38,11,"When I said, ‘This far you may come, but no farther, And here your proud waves must stop!’"
Job,38,12,"“Have you commanded the morning since your days began, And caused the dawn to know its place,"
Job,38,13,"That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it?"
Job,38,14,"It takes on form like clay under a seal, And stands out like a garment."
Job,38,15,"From the wicked their light is withheld, And the upraised arm is broken."
Job,38,16,“Have you entered the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in search of the depths?
Job,38,17,Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the doors of the shadow of death?
Job,38,18,"Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth? Tell Me, if you know all this."
Job,38,19,"“Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And darkness, where is its place,"
Job,38,20,"That you may take it to its territory, That you may know the paths to its home?"
Job,38,21,"Do you know it, because you were born then, Or because the number of your days is great?"
Job,38,22,"“Have you entered the treasury of snow, Or have you seen the treasury of hail,"
Job,38,23,"Which I have reserved for the time of trouble, For the day of battle and war?"
Job,38,24,"By what way is light diffused, Or the east wind scattered over the earth?"
Job,38,25,"“Who has divided a channel for the overflowing water, Or a path for the thunderbolt,"
Job,38,26,"To cause it to rain on a land where there is no one, A wilderness in which there is no man;"
Job,38,27,"To satisfy the desolate waste, And cause to spring forth the growth of tender grass?"
Job,38,28,Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew?
Job,38,29,"From whose womb comes the ice? And the frost of heaven, who gives it birth?"
Job,38,30,"The waters harden like stone, And the surface of the deep is frozen."
Job,38,31,"“Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades, Or loose the belt of Orion?"
Job,38,32,Can you bring out Mazzaroth in its season? Or can you guide the Great Bear with its cubs?
Job,38,33,Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you set their dominion over the earth?
Job,38,34,"“Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, That an abundance of water may cover you?"
Job,38,35,"Can you send out lightnings, that they may go, And say to you, ‘Here we are!’?"
Job,38,36,Who has put wisdom in the mind? Or who has given understanding to the heart?
Job,38,37,"Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,"
Job,38,38,"When the dust hardens in clumps, And the clods cling together?"
Job,38,39,"“Can you hunt the prey for the lion, Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,"
Job,38,40,"When they crouch in their dens, Or lurk in their lairs to lie in wait?"
Job,38,41,"Who provides food for the raven, When its young ones cry to God, And wander about for lack of food?"
Job,39,1,“Do you know the time when the wild mountain goats bear young? Or can you mark when the deer gives birth?
Job,39,2,Can you number the months that they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they bear young?
Job,39,3,"They bow down, They bring forth their young, They deliver their offspring."
Job,39,4,"Their young ones are healthy, They grow strong with grain; They depart and do not return to them."
Job,39,5,"“Who set the wild donkey free? Who loosed the bonds of the onager,"
Job,39,6,"Whose home I have made the wilderness, And the barren land his dwelling?"
Job,39,7,He scorns the tumult of the city; He does not heed the shouts of the driver.
Job,39,8,"The range of the mountains is his pasture, And he searches after every green thing."
Job,39,9,“Will the wild ox be willing to serve you? Will he bed by your manger?
Job,39,10,Can you bind the wild ox in the furrow with ropes? Or will he plow the valleys behind you?
Job,39,11,Will you trust him because his strength is great? Or will you leave your labor to him?
Job,39,12,"Will you trust him to bring home your grain, And gather it to your threshing floor?"
Job,39,13,"“The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, But are her wings and pinions like the kindly stork’s?"
Job,39,14,"For she leaves her eggs on the ground, And warms them in the dust;"
Job,39,15,"She forgets that a foot may crush them, Or that a wild beast may break them."
Job,39,16,"She treats her young harshly, as though they were not hers; Her labor is in vain, without concern,"
Job,39,17,"Because God deprived her of wisdom, And did not endow her with understanding."
Job,39,18,"When she lifts herself on high, She scorns the horse and its rider."
Job,39,19,“Have you given the horse strength? Have you clothed his neck with thunder?
Job,39,20,Can you frighten him like a locust? His majestic snorting strikes terror.
Job,39,21,"He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength; He gallops into the clash of arms."
Job,39,22,"He mocks at fear, and is not frightened; Nor does he turn back from the sword."
Job,39,23,"The quiver rattles against him, The glittering spear and javelin."
Job,39,24,He devours the distance with fierceness and rage; Nor does he come to a halt because the trumpet has sounded.
Job,39,25,"At the blast of the trumpet he says, ‘Aha!’ He smells the battle from afar, The thunder of captains and shouting."
Job,39,26,"“Does the hawk fly by your wisdom, And spread its wings toward the south?"
Job,39,27,"Does the eagle mount up at your command, And make its nest on high?"
Job,39,28,"On the rock it dwells and resides, On the crag of the rock and the stronghold."
Job,39,29,From there it spies out the prey; Its eyes observe from afar.
Job,39,30,"Its young ones suck up blood; And where the slain are, there it is.”"
Job,40,1,"Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said:"
Job,40,2,"“Shall the one who contends with the Almighty correct Him? He who rebukes God, let him answer it.”"
Job,40,3,Then Job answered the LORD and said:
Job,40,4,"“Behold, I am vile; What shall I answer You? I lay my hand over my mouth."
Job,40,5,"Once I have spoken, but I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.”"
Job,40,6,"Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:"
Job,40,7,"“Now prepare yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer Me:"
Job,40,8,“Would you indeed annul My judgment? Would you condemn Me that you may be justified?
Job,40,9,Have you an arm like God? Or can you thunder with a voice like His?
Job,40,10,"Then adorn yourself with majesty and splendor, And array yourself with glory and beauty."
Job,40,11,"Disperse the rage of your wrath; Look on everyone who is proud, and humble him."
Job,40,12,"Look on everyone who is proud, and bring him low; Tread down the wicked in their place."
Job,40,13,"Hide them in the dust together, Bind their faces in hidden darkness."
Job,40,14,Then I will also confess to you That your own right hand can save you.
Job,40,15,"“Look now at the behemoth, which I made along with you; He eats grass like an ox."
Job,40,16,"See now, his strength is in his hips, And his power is in his stomach muscles."
Job,40,17,He moves his tail like a cedar; The sinews of his thighs are tightly knit.
Job,40,18,"His bones are like beams of bronze, His ribs like bars of iron."
Job,40,19,He is the first of the ways of God; Only He who made him can bring near His sword.
Job,40,20,"Surely the mountains yield food for him, And all the beasts of the field play there."
Job,40,21,"He lies under the lotus trees, In a covert of reeds and marsh."
Job,40,22,The lotus trees cover him with their shade; The willows by the brook surround him.
Job,40,23,"Indeed the river may rage, Yet he is not disturbed; He is confident, though the Jordan gushes into his mouth,"
Job,40,24,"Though he takes it in his eyes, Or one pierces his nose with a snare."
Job,41,1,"“Can you draw out Leviathan with a hook, Or snare his tongue with a line which you lower?"
Job,41,2,"Can you put a reed through his nose, Or pierce his jaw with a hook?"
Job,41,3,Will he make many supplications to you? Will he speak softly to you?
Job,41,4,Will he make a covenant with you? Will you take him as a servant forever?
Job,41,5,"Will you play with him as with a bird, Or will you leash him for your maidens?"
Job,41,6,Will your companions make a banquet of him? Will they apportion him among the merchants?
Job,41,7,"Can you fill his skin with harpoons, Or his head with fishing spears?"
Job,41,8,Lay your hand on him; Remember the battle— Never do it again!
Job,41,9,"Indeed, any hope of overcoming him is false; Shall one not be overwhelmed at the sight of him?"
Job,41,10,No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up. Who then is able to stand against Me?
Job,41,11,"Who has preceded Me, that I should pay him? Everything under heaven is Mine."
Job,41,12,"“I will not conceal his limbs, His mighty power, or his graceful proportions."
Job,41,13,Who can remove his outer coat? Who can approach him with a double bridle?
Job,41,14,"Who can open the doors of his face, With his terrible teeth all around?"
Job,41,15,"His rows of scales are his pride, Shut up tightly as with a seal;"
Job,41,16,One is so near another That no air can come between them;
Job,41,17,"They are joined one to another, They stick together and cannot be parted."
Job,41,18,"His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning."
Job,41,19,Out of his mouth go burning lights; Sparks of fire shoot out.
Job,41,20,"Smoke goes out of his nostrils, As from a boiling pot and burning rushes."
Job,41,21,"His breath kindles coals, And a flame goes out of his mouth."
Job,41,22,"Strength dwells in his neck, And sorrow dances before him."
Job,41,23,The folds of his flesh are joined together; They are firm on him and cannot be moved.
Job,41,24,"His heart is as hard as stone, Even as hard as the lower millstone."
Job,41,25,"When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid; Because of his crashings they are beside themselves."
Job,41,26,"Though the sword reaches him, it cannot avail; Nor does spear, dart, or javelin."
Job,41,27,"He regards iron as straw, And bronze as rotten wood."
Job,41,28,The arrow cannot make him flee; Slingstones become like stubble to him.
Job,41,29,Darts are regarded as straw; He laughs at the threat of javelins.
Job,41,30,His undersides are like sharp potsherds; He spreads pointed marks in the mire.
Job,41,31,He makes the deep boil like a pot; He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.
Job,41,32,He leaves a shining wake behind him; One would think the deep had white hair.
Job,41,33,"On earth there is nothing like him, Which is made without fear."
Job,41,34,He beholds every high thing; He is king over all the children of pride.”
Job,42,1,Then Job answered the LORD and said:
Job,42,2,"“I know that You can do everything, And that no purpose of Yours can be withheld from You."
Job,42,3,"You asked, ‘Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?’ Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know."
Job,42,4,"Listen, please, and let me speak; You said, ‘I will question you, and you shall answer Me.’"
Job,42,5,"“I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, But now my eye sees You."
Job,42,6,"Therefore I abhor myself, And repent in dust and ashes.”"
Job,42,7,"And so it was, after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, that the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is aroused against you and your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has."
Job,42,8,"Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job shall pray for you. For I will accept him, lest I deal with you according to your folly; because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has.”"
Job,42,9,So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD commanded them; for the LORD had accepted Job.
Job,42,10,And the LORD restored Job’s losses when he prayed for his friends. Indeed the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
Job,42,11,"Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been his acquaintances before, came to him and ate food with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the adversity that the LORD had brought upon him. Each one gave him a piece of silver and each a ring of gold."
Job,42,12,"Now the LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys."
Job,42,13,He also had seven sons and three daughters.
Job,42,14,"And he called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-Happuch."
Job,42,15,In all the land were found no women so beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.
Job,42,16,"After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children and grandchildren for four generations."
Job,42,17,"So Job died, old and full of days."
