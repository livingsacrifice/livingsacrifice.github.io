Deuteronomy,29,13,"that He may establish you today as a people for Himself, and that He may be God to you, just as He has spoken to you, and just as He has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Deuteronomy,29,14,"“I make this covenant and this oath, not with you alone,"
Deuteronomy,29,15,"but with him who stands here with us today before the LORD our God, as well as with him who is not here with us today"
Deuteronomy,29,16,"(for you know that we dwelt in the land of Egypt and that we came through the nations which you passed by,"
Deuteronomy,29,17,and you saw their abominations and their idols which were among them—wood and stone and silver and gold);
Deuteronomy,29,18,"so that there may not be among you man or woman or family or tribe, whose heart turns away today from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations, and that there may not be among you a root bearing bitterness or wormwood;"
Deuteronomy,29,19,"and so it may not happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he blesses himself in his heart, saying, ‘I shall have peace, even though I follow the dictates of my heart’—as though the drunkard could be included with the sober."
Deuteronomy,29,20,"“The LORD would not spare him; for then the anger of the LORD and His jealousy would burn against that man, and every curse that is written in this book would settle on him, and the LORD would blot out his name from under heaven."
Deuteronomy,29,21,"And the LORD would separate him from all the tribes of Israel for adversity, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this Book of the Law,"
Deuteronomy,29,22,"so that the coming generation of your children who rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a far land, would say, when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which the LORD has laid on it:"
Deuteronomy,29,23,"‘The whole land is brimstone, salt, and burning; it is not sown, nor does it bear, nor does any grass grow there, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in His anger and His wrath.’"
Deuteronomy,29,24,"“All nations would say, ‘Why has the LORD done so to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?’"
Deuteronomy,29,25,"Then people would say: ‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt;"
Deuteronomy,29,26,"for they went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods that they did not know and that He had not given to them."
Deuteronomy,29,27,"Then the anger of the LORD was aroused against this land, to bring on it every curse that is written in this book."
Deuteronomy,29,28,"And the LORD uprooted them from their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.’"
Deuteronomy,29,29,"“The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but those things which are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law."
Deuteronomy,30,1,"“Now it shall come to pass, when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have set before you, and you call them to mind among all the nations where the LORD your God drives you,"
Deuteronomy,30,2,"and you return to the LORD your God and obey His voice, according to all that I command you today, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul,"
Deuteronomy,30,3,"that the LORD your God will bring you back from captivity, and have compassion on you, and gather you again from all the nations where the LORD your God has scattered you."
Deuteronomy,30,4,"If any of you are driven out to the farthest parts under heaven, from there the LORD your God will gather you, and from there He will bring you."
Deuteronomy,30,5,"Then the LORD your God will bring you to the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it. He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers."
Deuteronomy,30,6,"And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, to love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live."
Deuteronomy,30,7,"“Also the LORD your God will put all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, who persecuted you."
Deuteronomy,30,8,And you will again obey the voice of the LORD and do all His commandments which I command you today.
Deuteronomy,30,9,"The LORD your God will make you abound in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, in the increase of your livestock, and in the produce of your land for good. For the LORD will again rejoice over you for good as He rejoiced over your fathers,"
Deuteronomy,30,10,"if you obey the voice of the LORD your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this Book of the Law, and if you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul."
Deuteronomy,30,11,"“For this commandment which I command you today is not too mysterious for you, nor is it far off."
Deuteronomy,30,12,"It is not in heaven, that you should say, ‘Who will ascend into heaven for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?’"
Deuteronomy,30,13,"Nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, ‘Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?’"
Deuteronomy,30,14,"But the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it."
Deuteronomy,30,15,"“See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil,"
Deuteronomy,30,16,"in that I command you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments, His statutes, and His judgments, that you may live and multiply; and the LORD your God will bless you in the land which you go to possess."
Deuteronomy,30,17,"But if your heart turns away so that you do not hear, and are drawn away, and worship other gods and serve them,"
Deuteronomy,30,18,I announce to you today that you shall surely perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land which you cross over the Jordan to go in and possess.
Deuteronomy,30,19,"I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live;"
Deuteronomy,30,20,"that you may love the LORD your God, that you may obey His voice, and that you may cling to Him, for He is your life and the length of your days; and that you may dwell in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them.”"
Deuteronomy,31,1,Then Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
Deuteronomy,31,2,"And he said to them: “I am one hundred and twenty years old today. I can no longer go out and come in. Also the LORD has said to me, ‘You shall not cross over this Jordan.’"
Deuteronomy,31,3,"The LORD your God Himself crosses over before you; He will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua himself crosses over before you, just as the LORD has said."
Deuteronomy,31,4,"And the LORD will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites and their land, when He destroyed them."
Deuteronomy,31,5,"The LORD will give them over to you, that you may do to them according to every commandment which I have commanded you."
Deuteronomy,31,6,"Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you.”"
Deuteronomy,31,7,"Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, “Be strong and of good courage, for you must go with this people to the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall cause them to inherit it."
Deuteronomy,31,8,"And the LORD, He is the One who goes before you. He will be with you, He will not leave you nor forsake you; do not fear nor be dismayed.”"
Deuteronomy,31,9,"So Moses wrote this law and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel."
Deuteronomy,31,10,"And Moses commanded them, saying: “At the end of every seven years, at the appointed time in the year of release, at the Feast of Tabernacles,"
Deuteronomy,31,11,"when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God in the place which He chooses, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing."
Deuteronomy,31,12,"Gather the people together, men and women and little ones, and the stranger who is within your gates, that they may hear and that they may learn to fear the LORD your God and carefully observe all the words of this law,"
Deuteronomy,31,13,"and that their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to fear the LORD your God as long as you live in the land which you cross the Jordan to possess.”"
Deuteronomy,31,14,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, the days approach when you must die; call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of meeting, that I may inaugurate him.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of meeting."
Deuteronomy,31,15,"Now the LORD appeared at the tabernacle in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood above the door of the tabernacle."
Deuteronomy,31,16,"And the LORD said to Moses: “Behold, you will rest with your fathers; and this people will rise and play the harlot with the gods of the foreigners of the land, where they go to be among them, and they will forsake Me and break My covenant which I have made with them."
Deuteronomy,31,17,"Then My anger shall be aroused against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured. And many evils and troubles shall befall them, so that they will say in that day, ‘Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?’"
Deuteronomy,31,18,"And I will surely hide My face in that day because of all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other gods."
Deuteronomy,31,19,"“Now therefore, write down this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel."
Deuteronomy,31,20,"When I have brought them to the land flowing with milk and honey, of which I swore to their fathers, and they have eaten and filled themselves and grown fat, then they will turn to other gods and serve them; and they will provoke Me and break My covenant."
Deuteronomy,31,21,"Then it shall be, when many evils and troubles have come upon them, that this song will testify against them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten in the mouths of their descendants, for I know the inclination of their behavior today, even before I have brought them to the land of which I swore to give them.”"
Deuteronomy,31,22,"Therefore Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel."
Deuteronomy,31,23,"Then He inaugurated Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and of good courage; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land of which I swore to them, and I will be with you.”"
Deuteronomy,31,24,"So it was, when Moses had completed writing the words of this law in a book, when they were finished,"
Deuteronomy,31,25,"that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying:"
Deuteronomy,31,26,"“Take this Book of the Law, and put it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there as a witness against you;"
Deuteronomy,31,27,"for I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. If today, while I am yet alive with you, you have been rebellious against the LORD, then how much more after my death?"
Deuteronomy,31,28,"Gather to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them."
Deuteronomy,31,29,"For I know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you. And evil will befall you in the latter days, because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands.”"
Deuteronomy,31,30,Then Moses spoke in the hearing of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song until they were ended:
Deuteronomy,32,1,"“Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak; And hear, O earth, the words of my mouth."
Deuteronomy,32,2,"Let my teaching drop as the rain, My speech distill as the dew, As raindrops on the tender herb, And as showers on the grass."
Deuteronomy,32,3,For I proclaim the name of the LORD: Ascribe greatness to our God.
Deuteronomy,32,4,"He is the Rock, His work is perfect; For all His ways are justice, A God of truth and without injustice; Righteous and upright is He."
Deuteronomy,32,5,"“They have corrupted themselves; They are not His children, Because of their blemish: A perverse and crooked generation."
Deuteronomy,32,6,"Do you thus deal with the LORD, O foolish and unwise people? Is He not your Father, who bought you? Has He not made you and established you?"
Deuteronomy,32,7,"“Remember the days of old, Consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; Your elders, and they will tell you:"
Deuteronomy,32,8,"When the Most High divided their inheritance to the nations, When He separated the sons of Adam, He set the boundaries of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel."
Deuteronomy,32,9,For the LORD’s portion is His people; Jacob is the place of His inheritance.
Deuteronomy,32,10,"“He found him in a desert land And in the wasteland, a howling wilderness; He encircled him, He instructed him, He kept him as the apple of His eye."
Deuteronomy,32,11,"As an eagle stirs up its nest, Hovers over its young, Spreading out its wings, taking them up, Carrying them on its wings,"
Deuteronomy,32,12,"So the LORD alone led him, And there was no foreign god with him."
Deuteronomy,32,13,"“He made him ride in the heights of the earth, That he might eat the produce of the fields; He made him draw honey from the rock, And oil from the flinty rock;"
Deuteronomy,32,14,"Curds from the cattle, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs; And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the choicest wheat; And you drank wine, the blood of the grapes."
Deuteronomy,32,15,"“But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked; You grew fat, you grew thick, You are obese! Then he forsook God who made him, And scornfully esteemed the Rock of his salvation."
Deuteronomy,32,16,They provoked Him to jealousy with foreign gods; With abominations they provoked Him to anger.
Deuteronomy,32,17,"They sacrificed to demons, not to God, To gods they did not know, To new gods, new arrivals That your fathers did not fear."
Deuteronomy,32,18,"Of the Rock who begot you, you are unmindful, And have forgotten the God who fathered you."
Deuteronomy,32,19,"“And when the LORD saw it, He spurned them, Because of the provocation of His sons and His daughters."
Deuteronomy,32,20,"And He said: ‘I will hide My face from them, I will see what their end will be, For they are a perverse generation, Children in whom is no faith."
Deuteronomy,32,21,They have provoked Me to jealousy by what is not God; They have moved Me to anger by their foolish idols. But I will provoke them to jealousy by those who are not a nation; I will move them to anger by a foolish nation.
Deuteronomy,32,22,"For a fire is kindled in My anger, And shall burn to the lowest hell; It shall consume the earth with her increase, And set on fire the foundations of the mountains."
Deuteronomy,32,23,‘I will heap disasters on them; I will spend My arrows on them.
Deuteronomy,32,24,"They shall be wasted with hunger, Devoured by pestilence and bitter destruction; I will also send against them the teeth of beasts, With the poison of serpents of the dust."
Deuteronomy,32,25,"The sword shall destroy outside; There shall be terror within For the young man and virgin, The nursing child with the man of gray hairs."
Deuteronomy,32,26,"I would have said, “I will dash them in pieces, I will make the memory of them to cease from among men,”"
Deuteronomy,32,27,"Had I not feared the wrath of the enemy, Lest their adversaries should misunderstand, Lest they should say, “Our hand is high; And it is not the LORD who has done all this.”’"
Deuteronomy,32,28,"“For they are a nation void of counsel, Nor is there any understanding in them."
Deuteronomy,32,29,"Oh, that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would consider their latter end!"
Deuteronomy,32,30,"How could one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Unless their Rock had sold them, And the LORD had surrendered them?"
Deuteronomy,32,31,"For their rock is not like our Rock, Even our enemies themselves being judges."
Deuteronomy,32,32,"For their vine is of the vine of Sodom And of the fields of Gomorrah; Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter."
Deuteronomy,32,33,"Their wine is the poison of serpents, And the cruel venom of cobras."
Deuteronomy,32,34,"‘Is this not laid up in store with Me, Sealed up among My treasures?"
Deuteronomy,32,35,"Vengeance is Mine, and recompense; Their foot shall slip in due time; For the day of their calamity is at hand, And the things to come hasten upon them.’"
Deuteronomy,32,36,"“For the LORD will judge His people And have compassion on His servants, When He sees that their power is gone, And there is no one remaining, bond or free."
Deuteronomy,32,37,"He will say: ‘Where are their gods, The rock in which they sought refuge?"
Deuteronomy,32,38,"Who ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise and help you, And be your refuge."
Deuteronomy,32,39,"‘Now see that I, even I, am He, And there is no God besides Me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; Nor is there any who can deliver from My hand."
Deuteronomy,32,40,"For I raise My hand to heaven, And say, “As I live forever,"
Deuteronomy,32,41,"If I whet My glittering sword, And My hand takes hold on judgment, I will render vengeance to My enemies, And repay those who hate Me."
Deuteronomy,32,42,"I will make My arrows drunk with blood, And My sword shall devour flesh, With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the heads of the leaders of the enemy.”’"
Deuteronomy,32,43,"“Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people; For He will avenge the blood of His servants, And render vengeance to His adversaries; He will provide atonement for His land and His people.”"
Deuteronomy,32,44,So Moses came with Joshua the son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.
Deuteronomy,32,45,"Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel,"
Deuteronomy,32,46,"and he said to them: “Set your hearts on all the words which I testify among you today, which you shall command your children to be careful to observe—all the words of this law."
Deuteronomy,32,47,"For it is not a futile thing for you, because it is your life, and by this word you shall prolong your days in the land which you cross over the Jordan to possess.”"
Deuteronomy,32,48,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses that very same day, saying:"
Deuteronomy,32,49,"“Go up this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, across from Jericho; view the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel as a possession;"
Deuteronomy,32,50,"and die on the mountain which you ascend, and be gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people;"
Deuteronomy,32,51,"because you trespassed against Me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the Wilderness of Zin, because you did not hallow Me in the midst of the children of Israel."
Deuteronomy,32,52,"Yet you shall see the land before you, though you shall not go there, into the land which I am giving to the children of Israel.”"
Deuteronomy,33,1,Now this is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
Deuteronomy,33,2,"And he said: “The LORD came from Sinai, And dawned on them from Seir; He shone forth from Mount Paran, And He came with ten thousands of saints; From His right hand Came a fiery law for them."
Deuteronomy,33,3,"Yes, He loves the people; All His saints are in Your hand; They sit down at Your feet; Everyone receives Your words."
Deuteronomy,33,4,"Moses commanded a law for us, A heritage of the congregation of Jacob."
Deuteronomy,33,5,"And He was King in Jeshurun, When the leaders of the people were gathered, All the tribes of Israel together."
Deuteronomy,33,6,"“Let Reuben live, and not die, Nor let his men be few.”"
Deuteronomy,33,7,"And this he said of Judah: “Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, And bring him to his people; Let his hands be sufficient for him, And may You be a help against his enemies.”"
Deuteronomy,33,8,"And of Levi he said: “Let Your Thummim and Your Urim be with Your holy one, Whom You tested at Massah, And with whom You contended at the waters of Meribah,"
Deuteronomy,33,9,"Who says of his father and mother, ‘I have not seen them’; Nor did he acknowledge his brothers, Or know his own children; For they have observed Your word And kept Your covenant."
Deuteronomy,33,10,"They shall teach Jacob Your judgments, And Israel Your law. They shall put incense before You, And a whole burnt sacrifice on Your altar."
Deuteronomy,33,11,"Bless his substance, LORD, And accept the work of his hands; Strike the loins of those who rise against him, And of those who hate him, that they rise not again.”"
Deuteronomy,33,12,"Of Benjamin he said: “The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by Him, Who shelters him all the day long; And he shall dwell between His shoulders.”"
Deuteronomy,33,13,"And of Joseph he said: “Blessed of the LORD is his land, With the precious things of heaven, with the dew, And the deep lying beneath,"
Deuteronomy,33,14,"With the precious fruits of the sun, With the precious produce of the months,"
Deuteronomy,33,15,"With the best things of the ancient mountains, With the precious things of the everlasting hills,"
Deuteronomy,33,16,"With the precious things of the earth and its fullness, And the favor of Him who dwelt in the bush. Let the blessing come ‘on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers.’"
Deuteronomy,33,17,"His glory is like a firstborn bull, And his horns like the horns of the wild ox; Together with them He shall push the peoples To the ends of the earth; They are the ten thousands of Ephraim, And they are the thousands of Manasseh.”"
Deuteronomy,33,18,"And of Zebulun he said: “Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, And Issachar in your tents!"
Deuteronomy,33,19,They shall call the peoples to the mountain; There they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness; For they shall partake of the abundance of the seas And of treasures hidden in the sand.”
Deuteronomy,33,20,"And of Gad he said: “Blessed is he who enlarges Gad; He dwells as a lion, And tears the arm and the crown of his head."
Deuteronomy,33,21,"He provided the first part for himself, Because a lawgiver’s portion was reserved there. He came with the heads of the people; He administered the justice of the LORD, And His judgments with Israel.”"
Deuteronomy,33,22,And of Dan he said: “Dan is a lion’s whelp; He shall leap from Bashan.”
Deuteronomy,33,23,"And of Naphtali he said: “O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, And full of the blessing of the LORD, Possess the west and the south.”"
Deuteronomy,33,24,"And of Asher he said: “Asher is most blessed of sons; Let him be favored by his brothers, And let him dip his foot in oil."
Deuteronomy,33,25,"Your sandals shall be iron and bronze; As your days, so shall your strength be."
Deuteronomy,33,26,"“There is no one like the God of Jeshurun, Who rides the heavens to help you, And in His excellency on the clouds."
Deuteronomy,33,27,"The eternal God is your refuge, And underneath are the everlasting arms; He will thrust out the enemy from before you, And will say, ‘Destroy!’"
Deuteronomy,33,28,"Then Israel shall dwell in safety, The fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of grain and new wine; His heavens shall also drop dew."
Deuteronomy,33,29,"Happy are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD, The shield of your help And the sword of your majesty! Your enemies shall submit to you, And you shall tread down their high places.”"
Deuteronomy,34,1,"Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is across from Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land of Gilead as far as Dan,"
Deuteronomy,34,2,"all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea,"
Deuteronomy,34,3,"the South, and the plain of the Valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar."
Deuteronomy,34,4,"Then the LORD said to him, “This is the land of which I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there.”"
Deuteronomy,34,5,"So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD."
Deuteronomy,34,6,"And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth Peor; but no one knows his grave to this day."
Deuteronomy,34,7,Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eyes were not dim nor his natural vigor diminished.
Deuteronomy,34,8,And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. So the days of weeping and mourning for Moses ended.
Deuteronomy,34,9,"Now Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him; so the children of Israel heeded him, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Deuteronomy,34,10,"But since then there has not arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,"
Deuteronomy,34,11,"in all the signs and wonders which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt, before Pharaoh, before all his servants, and in all his land,"
Deuteronomy,34,12,and by all that mighty power and all the great terror which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.
Joshua,1,1,"After the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, it came to pass that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying:"
Joshua,1,2,"“Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them—the children of Israel."
Joshua,1,3,"Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses."
Joshua,1,4,"From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your territory."
Joshua,1,5,"No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you."
Joshua,1,6,"Be strong and of good courage, for to this people you shall divide as an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them."
Joshua,1,7,"Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go."
Joshua,1,8,"This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success."
Joshua,1,9,"Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”"
Joshua,1,10,"Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,"
Joshua,1,11,"“Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you will cross over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you to possess.’”"
Joshua,1,12,"And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh Joshua spoke, saying,"
Joshua,1,13,"“Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, ‘The LORD your God is giving you rest and is giving you this land.’"
Joshua,1,14,"Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But you shall pass before your brethren armed, all your mighty men of valor, and help them,"
Joshua,1,15,"until the LORD has given your brethren rest, as He gave you, and they also have taken possession of the land which the LORD your God is giving them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD’s servant gave you on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrise.”"
Joshua,1,16,"So they answered Joshua, saying, “All that you command us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go."
Joshua,1,17,"Just as we heeded Moses in all things, so we will heed you. Only the LORD your God be with you, as He was with Moses."
Joshua,1,18,"Whoever rebels against your command and does not heed your words, in all that you command him, shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage.”"
Joshua,2,1,"Now Joshua the son of Nun sent out two men from Acacia Grove to spy secretly, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” So they went, and came to the house of a harlot named Rahab, and lodged there."
Joshua,2,2,"And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, “Behold, men have come here tonight from the children of Israel to search out the country.”"
Joshua,2,3,"So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the country.”"
Joshua,2,4,"Then the woman took the two men and hid them. So she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from."
Joshua,2,5,"And it happened as the gate was being shut, when it was dark, that the men went out. Where the men went I do not know; pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them.”"
Joshua,2,6,"(But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.)"
Joshua,2,7,"Then the men pursued them by the road to the Jordan, to the fords. And as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate."
Joshua,2,8,"Now before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof,"
Joshua,2,9,"and said to the men: “I know that the LORD has given you the land, that the terror of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are fainthearted because of you."
Joshua,2,10,"For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed."
Joshua,2,11,"And as soon as we heard these things, our hearts melted; neither did there remain any more courage in anyone because of you, for the LORD your God, He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath."
Joshua,2,12,"Now therefore, I beg you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have shown you kindness, that you also will show kindness to my father’s house, and give me a true token,"
Joshua,2,13,"and spare my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.”"
Joshua,2,14,"So the men answered her, “Our lives for yours, if none of you tell this business of ours. And it shall be, when the LORD has given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.”"
Joshua,2,15,"Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the city wall; she dwelt on the wall."
Joshua,2,16,"And she said to them, “Get to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you. Hide there three days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward you may go your way.”"
Joshua,2,17,"So the men said to her: “We will be blameless of this oath of yours which you have made us swear,"
Joshua,2,18,"unless, when we come into the land, you bind this line of scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you bring your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father’s household to your own home."
Joshua,2,19,"So it shall be that whoever goes outside the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his own head, and we will be guiltless. And whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head if a hand is laid on him."
Joshua,2,20,"And if you tell this business of ours, then we will be free from your oath which you made us swear.”"
Joshua,2,21,"Then she said, “According to your words, so be it.” And she sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet cord in the window."
Joshua,2,22,"They departed and went to the mountain, and stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers sought them all along the way, but did not find them."
Joshua,2,23,"So the two men returned, descended from the mountain, and crossed over; and they came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all that had befallen them."
Joshua,2,24,"And they said to Joshua, “Truly the LORD has delivered all the land into our hands, for indeed all the inhabitants of the country are fainthearted because of us.”"
Joshua,3,1,"Then Joshua rose early in the morning; and they set out from Acacia Grove and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they crossed over."
Joshua,3,2,"So it was, after three days, that the officers went through the camp;"
Joshua,3,3,"and they commanded the people, saying, “When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests, the Levites, bearing it, then you shall set out from your place and go after it."
Joshua,3,4,"Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go, for you have not passed this way before.”"
Joshua,3,5,"And Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.”"
Joshua,3,6,"Then Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, “Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over before the people.” So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people."
Joshua,3,7,"And the LORD said to Joshua, “This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you."
Joshua,3,8,"You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you have come to the edge of the water of the Jordan, you shall stand in the Jordan.’”"
Joshua,3,9,"So Joshua said to the children of Israel, “Come here, and hear the words of the LORD your God.”"
Joshua,3,10,"And Joshua said, “By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that He will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Jebusites:"
Joshua,3,11,"Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over before you into the Jordan."
Joshua,3,12,"Now therefore, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from every tribe."
Joshua,3,13,"And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, the waters that come down from upstream, and they shall stand as a heap.”"
Joshua,3,14,"So it was, when the people set out from their camp to cross over the Jordan, with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,"
Joshua,3,15,"and as those who bore the ark came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks during the whole time of harvest),"
Joshua,3,16,"that the waters which came down from upstream stood still, and rose in a heap very far away at Adam, the city that is beside Zaretan. So the waters that went down into the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, failed, and were cut off; and the people crossed over opposite Jericho."
Joshua,3,17,"Then the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until all the people had crossed completely over the Jordan."
Joshua,4,1,"And it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over the Jordan, that the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying:"
Joshua,4,2,"“Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from every tribe,"
Joshua,4,3,"and command them, saying, ‘Take for yourselves twelve stones from here, out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the priests’ feet stood firm. You shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you lodge tonight.’”"
Joshua,4,4,"Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the children of Israel, one man from every tribe;"
Joshua,4,5,"and Joshua said to them: “Cross over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of the Jordan, and each one of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel,"
Joshua,4,6,"that this may be a sign among you when your children ask in time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’"
Joshua,4,7,"Then you shall answer them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever.”"
Joshua,4,8,"And the children of Israel did so, just as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of the Jordan, as the LORD had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there."
Joshua,4,9,"Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day."
Joshua,4,10,"So the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the LORD had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and crossed over."
Joshua,4,11,"Then it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over, that the ark of the LORD and the priests crossed over in the presence of the people."
Joshua,4,12,"And the men of Reuben, the men of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them."
Joshua,4,13,"About forty thousand prepared for war crossed over before the LORD for battle, to the plains of Jericho."
Joshua,4,14,"On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life."
Joshua,4,15,"Then the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,"
Joshua,4,16,“Command the priests who bear the ark of the Testimony to come up from the Jordan.”
Joshua,4,17,"Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Jordan.”"
Joshua,4,18,"And it came to pass, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet touched the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks as before."
Joshua,4,19,"Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho."
Joshua,4,20,"And those twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal."
Joshua,4,21,"Then he spoke to the children of Israel, saying: “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What are these stones?’"
Joshua,4,22,"then you shall let your children know, saying, ‘Israel crossed over this Jordan on dry land’;"
Joshua,4,23,"for the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over,"
Joshua,4,24,"that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty, that you may fear the LORD your God forever.”"
Joshua,5,1,"So it was, when all the kings of the Amorites who were on the west side of the Jordan, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel until we had crossed over, that their heart melted; and there was no spirit in them any longer because of the children of Israel."
Joshua,5,2,"At that time the LORD said to Joshua, “Make flint knives for yourself, and circumcise the sons of Israel again the second time.”"
Joshua,5,3,"So Joshua made flint knives for himself, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins."
Joshua,5,4,"And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: All the people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way, after they had come out of Egypt."
Joshua,5,5,"For all the people who came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness, on the way as they came out of Egypt, had not been circumcised."
Joshua,5,6,"For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people who were men of war, who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not obey the voice of the LORD—to whom the LORD swore that He would not show them the land which the LORD had sworn to their fathers that He would give us, “a land flowing with milk and honey.”"
Joshua,5,7,"Then Joshua circumcised their sons whom He raised up in their place; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way."
Joshua,5,8,"So it was, when they had finished circumcising all the people, that they stayed in their places in the camp till they were healed."
Joshua,5,9,"Then the LORD said to Joshua, “This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” Therefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day."
Joshua,5,10,"Now the children of Israel camped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight on the plains of Jericho."
Joshua,5,11,"And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the Passover, unleavened bread and parched grain, on the very same day."
Joshua,5,12,"Then the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten the produce of the land; and the children of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate the food of the land of Canaan that year."
Joshua,5,13,"And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, “Are You for us or for our adversaries?”"
Joshua,5,14,"So He said, “No, but as Commander of the army of the LORD I have now come.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped, and said to Him, “What does my Lord say to His servant?”"
Joshua,5,15,"Then the Commander of the LORD’s army said to Joshua, “Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you stand is holy.” And Joshua did so."
Joshua,6,1,"Now Jericho was securely shut up because of the children of Israel; none went out, and none came in."
Joshua,6,2,"And the LORD said to Joshua: “See! I have given Jericho into your hand, its king, and the mighty men of valor."
Joshua,6,3,"You shall march around the city, all you men of war; you shall go all around the city once. This you shall do six days."
Joshua,6,4,"And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. But the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets."
Joshua,6,5,"It shall come to pass, when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, that all the people shall shout with a great shout; then the wall of the city will fall down flat. And the people shall go up every man straight before him.”"
Joshua,6,6,"Then Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD.”"
Joshua,6,7,"And he said to the people, “Proceed, and march around the city, and let him who is armed advance before the ark of the LORD.”"
Joshua,6,8,"So it was, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the LORD advanced and blew the trumpets, and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them."
Joshua,6,9,"The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while the priests continued blowing the trumpets."
Joshua,6,10,"Now Joshua had commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout or make any noise with your voice, nor shall a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, ‘Shout!’ Then you shall shout.”"
Joshua,6,11,"So he had the ark of the LORD circle the city, going around it once. Then they came into the camp and lodged in the camp."
Joshua,6,12,"And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD."
Joshua,6,13,"Then seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually and blew with the trumpets. And the armed men went before them. But the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, while the priests continued blowing the trumpets."
Joshua,6,14,And the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. So they did six days.
Joshua,6,15,"But it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early, about the dawning of the day, and marched around the city seven times in the same manner. On that day only they marched around the city seven times."
Joshua,6,16,"And the seventh time it happened, when the priests blew the trumpets, that Joshua said to the people: “Shout, for the LORD has given you the city!"
Joshua,6,17,"Now the city shall be doomed by the LORD to destruction, it and all who are in it. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent."
Joshua,6,18,"And you, by all means abstain from the accursed things, lest you become accursed when you take of the accursed things, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it."
Joshua,6,19,"But all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are consecrated to the LORD; they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.”"
Joshua,6,20,"So the people shouted when the priests blew the trumpets. And it happened when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat. Then the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city."
Joshua,6,21,"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword."
Joshua,6,22,"But Joshua had said to the two men who had spied out the country, “Go into the harlot’s house, and from there bring out the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her.”"
Joshua,6,23,"And the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. So they brought out all her relatives and left them outside the camp of Israel."
Joshua,6,24,"But they burned the city and all that was in it with fire. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD."
Joshua,6,25,"And Joshua spared Rahab the harlot, her father’s household, and all that she had. So she dwells in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho."
Joshua,6,26,"Then Joshua charged them at that time, saying, “Cursed be the man before the LORD who rises up and builds this city Jericho; he shall lay its foundation with his firstborn, and with his youngest he shall set up its gates.”"
Joshua,6,27,"So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout all the country."
Joshua,7,1,"But the children of Israel committed a trespass regarding the accursed things, for Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed things; so the anger of the LORD burned against the children of Israel."
Joshua,7,2,"Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, “Go up and spy out the country.” So the men went up and spied out Ai."
Joshua,7,3,"And they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not let all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not weary all the people there, for the people of Ai are few.”"
Joshua,7,4,"So about three thousand men went up there from the people, but they fled before the men of Ai."
Joshua,7,5,"And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six men, for they chased them from before the gate as far as Shebarim, and struck them down on the descent; therefore the hearts of the people melted and became like water."
Joshua,7,6,"Then Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads."
Joshua,7,7,"And Joshua said, “Alas, Lord GOD, why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all—to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Oh, that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan!"
Joshua,7,8,"O Lord, what shall I say when Israel turns its back before its enemies?"
Joshua,7,9,"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear it, and surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?”"
Joshua,7,10,So the LORD said to Joshua: “Get up! Why do you lie thus on your face?
Joshua,7,11,"Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. For they have even taken some of the accursed things, and have both stolen and deceived; and they have also put it among their own stuff."
Joshua,7,12,"Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they have become doomed to destruction. Neither will I be with you anymore, unless you destroy the accursed from among you."
Joshua,7,13,"Get up, sanctify the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, because thus says the LORD God of Israel: “There is an accursed thing in your midst, O Israel; you cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the accursed thing from among you.”"
Joshua,7,14,In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which the LORD takes shall come according to families; and the family which the LORD takes shall come by households; and the household which the LORD takes shall come man by man.
Joshua,7,15,"Then it shall be that he who is taken with the accursed thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel.’”"
Joshua,7,16,"So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken."
Joshua,7,17,"He brought the clan of Judah, and he took the family of the Zarhites; and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man, and Zabdi was taken."
Joshua,7,18,"Then he brought his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken."
Joshua,7,19,"Now Joshua said to Achan, “My son, I beg you, give glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to Him, and tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me.”"
Joshua,7,20,"And Achan answered Joshua and said, “Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and this is what I have done:"
Joshua,7,21,"When I saw among the spoils a beautiful Babylonian garment, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. And there they are, hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, with the silver under it.”"
Joshua,7,22,"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver under it."
Joshua,7,23,"And they took them from the midst of the tent, brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD."
Joshua,7,24,"Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the garment, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had, and they brought them to the Valley of Achor."
Joshua,7,25,"And Joshua said, “Why have you troubled us? The LORD will trouble you this day.” So all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones."
Joshua,7,26,"Then they raised over him a great heap of stones, still there to this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Achor to this day."
Joshua,8,1,"Now the LORD said to Joshua: “Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land."
Joshua,8,2,And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king. Only its spoil and its cattle you shall take as booty for yourselves. Lay an ambush for the city behind it.”
Joshua,8,3,"So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai; and Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor and sent them away by night."
Joshua,8,4,"And he commanded them, saying: “Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready."
Joshua,8,5,"Then I and all the people who are with me will approach the city; and it will come about, when they come out against us as at the first, that we shall flee before them."
Joshua,8,6,"For they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city, for they will say, ‘They are fleeing before us as at the first.’ Therefore we will flee before them."
Joshua,8,7,"Then you shall rise from the ambush and seize the city, for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand."
Joshua,8,8,"And it will be, when you have taken the city, that you shall set the city on fire. According to the commandment of the LORD you shall do. See, I have commanded you.”"
Joshua,8,9,"Joshua therefore sent them out; and they went to lie in ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua lodged that night among the people."
Joshua,8,10,"Then Joshua rose up early in the morning and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai."
Joshua,8,11,And all the people of war who were with him went up and drew near; and they came before the city and camped on the north side of Ai. Now a valley lay between them and Ai.
Joshua,8,12,"So he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city."
Joshua,8,13,"And when they had set the people, all the army that was on the north of the city, and its rear guard on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley."
Joshua,8,14,"Now it happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hurried and rose early and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at an appointed place before the plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city."
Joshua,8,15,"And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness."
Joshua,8,16,So all the people who were in Ai were called together to pursue them. And they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city.
Joshua,8,17,There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel. So they left the city open and pursued Israel.
Joshua,8,18,"Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.” And Joshua stretched out the spear that was in his hand toward the city."
Joshua,8,19,"So those in ambush arose quickly out of their place; they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and they entered the city and took it, and hurried to set the city on fire."
Joshua,8,20,"And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended to heaven. So they had no power to flee this way or that way, and the people who had fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers."
Joshua,8,21,"Now when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai."
Joshua,8,22,"Then the others came out of the city against them; so they were caught in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side. And they struck them down, so that they let none of them remain or escape."
Joshua,8,23,"But the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua."
Joshua,8,24,"And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness where they pursued them, and when they all had fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword."
Joshua,8,25,"So it was that all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand—all the people of Ai."
Joshua,8,26,"For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai."
Joshua,8,27,"Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty for themselves, according to the word of the LORD which He had commanded Joshua."
Joshua,8,28,"So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap forever, a desolation to this day."
Joshua,8,29,"And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening. And as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his corpse down from the tree, cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raise over it a great heap of stones that remains to this day."
Joshua,8,30,"Now Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in Mount Ebal,"
Joshua,8,31,"as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: “an altar of whole stones over which no man has wielded an iron tool.” And they offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings."
Joshua,8,32,"And there, in the presence of the children of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written."
Joshua,8,33,"Then all Israel, with their elders and officers and judges, stood on either side of the ark before the priests, the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, the stranger as well as he who was born among them. Half of them were in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel."
Joshua,8,34,"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and the cursings, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law."
Joshua,8,35,"There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the strangers who were living among them."
Joshua,9,1,"And it came to pass when all the kings who were on this side of the Jordan, in the hills and in the lowland and in all the coasts of the Great Sea toward Lebanon—the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite—heard about it,"
Joshua,9,2,that they gathered together to fight with Joshua and Israel with one accord.
Joshua,9,3,"But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,"
Joshua,9,4,"they worked craftily, and went and pretended to be ambassadors. And they took old sacks on their donkeys, old wineskins torn and mended,"
Joshua,9,5,"old and patched sandals on their feet, and old garments on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy."
Joshua,9,6,"And they went to Joshua, to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country; now therefore, make a covenant with us.”"
Joshua,9,7,"Then the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you dwell among us; so how can we make a covenant with you?”"
Joshua,9,8,"But they said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” And Joshua said to them, “Who are you, and where do you come from?”"
Joshua,9,9,"So they said to him: “From a very far country your servants have come, because of the name of the LORD your God; for we have heard of His fame, and all that He did in Egypt,"
Joshua,9,10,"and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan—to Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth."
Joshua,9,11,"Therefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, ‘Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, “We are your servants; now therefore, make a covenant with us.”’"
Joshua,9,12,"This bread of ours we took hot for our provision from our houses on the day we departed to come to you. But now look, it is dry and moldy."
Joshua,9,13,"And these wineskins which we filled were new, and see, they are torn; and these our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey.”"
Joshua,9,14,Then the men of Israel took some of their provisions; but they did not ask counsel of the LORD.
Joshua,9,15,"So Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them to let them live; and the rulers of the congregation swore to them."
Joshua,9,16,"And it happened at the end of three days, after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors who dwelt near them."
Joshua,9,17,"Then the children of Israel journeyed and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjath Jearim."
Joshua,9,18,"But the children of Israel did not attack them, because the rulers of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation complained against the rulers."
Joshua,9,19,"Then all the rulers said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel; now therefore, we may not touch them."
Joshua,9,20,"This we will do to them: We will let them live, lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore to them.”"
Joshua,9,21,"And the rulers said to them, “Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for all the congregation, as the rulers had promised them.”"
Joshua,9,22,"Then Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ when you dwell near us?"
Joshua,9,23,"Now therefore, you are cursed, and none of you shall be freed from being slaves—woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”"
Joshua,9,24,"So they answered Joshua and said, “Because your servants were clearly told that the LORD your God commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were very much afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing."
Joshua,9,25,"And now, here we are, in your hands; do with us as it seems good and right to do to us.”"
Joshua,9,26,"So he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they did not kill them."
Joshua,9,27,"And that day Joshua made them woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, in the place which He would choose, even to this day."
Joshua,10,1,"Now it came to pass when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai and had utterly destroyed it—as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king—and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,"
Joshua,10,2,"that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty."
Joshua,10,3,"Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying,"
Joshua,10,4,"“Come up to me and help me, that we may attack Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.”"
Joshua,10,5,"Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they and all their armies, and camped before Gibeon and made war against it."
Joshua,10,6,"And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Do not forsake your servants; come up to us quickly, save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the mountains have gathered together against us.”"
Joshua,10,7,"So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor."
Joshua,10,8,"And the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not fear them, for I have delivered them into your hand; not a man of them shall stand before you.”"
Joshua,10,9,"Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly, having marched all night from Gilgal."
Joshua,10,10,"So the LORD routed them before Israel, killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, chased them along the road that goes to Beth Horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah."
Joshua,10,11,"And it happened, as they fled before Israel and were on the descent of Beth Horon, that the LORD cast down large hailstones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than the children of Israel killed with the sword."
Joshua,10,12,"Then Joshua spoke to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel: “Sun, stand still over Gibeon; And Moon, in the Valley of Aijalon.”"
Joshua,10,13,"So the sun stood still, And the moon stopped, Till the people had revenge Upon their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day."
Joshua,10,14,"And there has been no day like that, before it or after it, that the LORD heeded the voice of a man; for the LORD fought for Israel."
Joshua,10,15,"Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal."
Joshua,10,16,But these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
Joshua,10,17,"And it was told Joshua, saying, “The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”"
Joshua,10,18,"So Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them."
Joshua,10,19,"And do not stay there yourselves, but pursue your enemies, and attack their rear guard. Do not allow them to enter their cities, for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand.”"
Joshua,10,20,"Then it happened, while Joshua and the children of Israel made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they had finished, that those who escaped entered fortified cities."
Joshua,10,21,"And all the people returned to the camp, to Joshua at Makkedah, in peace. No one moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel."
Joshua,10,22,"Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.”"
Joshua,10,23,"And they did so, and brought out those five kings to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon."
Joshua,10,24,"So it was, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.” And they drew near and put their feet on their necks."
Joshua,10,25,"Then Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage, for thus the LORD will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.”"
Joshua,10,26,"And afterward Joshua struck them and killed them, and hanged them on five trees; and they were hanging on the trees until evening."
Joshua,10,27,"So it was at the time of the going down of the sun that Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, cast them into the cave where they had been hidden, and laid large stones against the cave’s mouth, which remain until this very day."
Joshua,10,28,"On that day Joshua took Makkedah, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them—all the people who were in it. He let none remain. He also did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho."
Joshua,10,29,"Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah; and they fought against Libnah."
Joshua,10,30,"And the LORD also delivered it and its king into the hand of Israel; he struck it and all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword. He let none remain in it, but did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho."
Joshua,10,31,"Then Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish; and they encamped against it and fought against it."
Joshua,10,32,"And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day, and struck it and all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword, according to all that he had done to Libnah."
Joshua,10,33,"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he left him none remaining."
Joshua,10,34,"From Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it and fought against it."
Joshua,10,35,"They took it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; all the people who were in it he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish."
Joshua,10,36,"So Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it."
Joshua,10,37,"And they took it and struck it with the edge of the sword—its king, all its cities, and all the people who were in it; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon, but utterly destroyed it and all the people who were in it."
Joshua,10,38,"Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and they fought against it."
Joshua,10,39,"And he took it and its king and all its cities; they struck them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the people who were in it. He left none remaining; as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, as he had done also to Libnah and its king."
Joshua,10,40,"So Joshua conquered all the land: the mountain country and the South and the lowland and the wilderness slopes, and all their kings; he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded."
Joshua,10,41,"And Joshua conquered them from Kadesh Barnea as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even as far as Gibeon."
Joshua,10,42,"All these kings and their land Joshua took at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel."
Joshua,10,43,"Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal."
Joshua,11,1,"And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard these things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph,"
Joshua,11,2,"and to the kings who were from the north, in the mountains, in the plain south of Chinneroth, in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,"
Joshua,11,3,"to the Canaanites in the east and in the west, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite in the mountains, and the Hivite below Hermon in the land of Mizpah."
Joshua,11,4,"So they went out, they and all their armies with them, as many people as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude, with very many horses and chariots."
Joshua,11,5,"And when all these kings had met together, they came and camped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel."
Joshua,11,6,"But the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid because of them, for tomorrow about this time I will deliver all of them slain before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.”"
Joshua,11,7,"So Joshua and all the people of war with him came against them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and they attacked them."
Joshua,11,8,"And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who defeated them and chased them to Greater Sidon, to the Brook Misrephoth, and to the Valley of Mizpah eastward; they attacked them until they left none of them remaining."
Joshua,11,9,So Joshua did to them as the LORD had told him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
Joshua,11,10,"Joshua turned back at that time and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor was formerly the head of all those kingdoms."
Joshua,11,11,"And they struck all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was none left breathing. Then he burned Hazor with fire."
Joshua,11,12,"So all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua took and struck with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded."
Joshua,11,13,"But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only, which Joshua burned."
Joshua,11,14,"And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock, the children of Israel took as booty for themselves; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, and they left none breathing."
Joshua,11,15,"As the LORD had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses."
Joshua,11,16,"Thus Joshua took all this land: the mountain country, all the South, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, and the Jordan plain—the mountains of Israel and its lowlands,"
Joshua,11,17,"from Mount Halak and the ascent to Seir, even as far as Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings, and struck them down and killed them."
Joshua,11,18,Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
Joshua,11,19,"There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. All the others they took in battle."
Joshua,11,20,"For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that He might utterly destroy them, and that they might receive no mercy, but that He might destroy them, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Joshua,11,21,"And at that time Joshua came and cut off the Anakim from the mountains: from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities."
Joshua,11,22,"None of the Anakim were left in the land of the children of Israel; they remained only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod."
Joshua,11,23,"So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD had said to Moses; and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. Then the land rested from war."
Joshua,12,1,"These are the kings of the land whom the children of Israel defeated, and whose land they possessed on the other side of the Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the River Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the eastern Jordan plain:"
Joshua,12,2,"One king was Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon and ruled half of Gilead, from Aroer, which is on the bank of the River Arnon, from the middle of that river, even as far as the River Jabbok, which is the border of the Ammonites,"
Joshua,12,3,"and the eastern Jordan plain from the Sea of Chinneroth as far as the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea), the road to Beth Jeshimoth, and southward below the slopes of Pisgah."
Joshua,12,4,"The other king was Og king of Bashan and his territory, who was of the remnant of the giants, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,"
Joshua,12,5,"and reigned over Mount Hermon, over Salcah, over all Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and over half of Gilead to the border of Sihon king of Heshbon."
Joshua,12,6,"These Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel had conquered; and Moses the servant of the LORD had given it as a possession to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh."
Joshua,12,7,"And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel conquered on this side of the Jordan, on the west, from Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon as far as Mount Halak and the ascent to Seir, which Joshua gave to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their divisions,"
Joshua,12,8,"in the mountain country, in the lowlands, in the Jordan plain, in the slopes, in the wilderness, and in the South—the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:"
Joshua,12,9,"the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;"
Joshua,12,10,"the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;"
Joshua,12,11,"the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;"
Joshua,12,12,"the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;"
Joshua,12,13,"the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;"
Joshua,12,14,"the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;"
Joshua,12,15,"the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;"
Joshua,12,16,"the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;"
Joshua,12,17,"the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;"
Joshua,12,18,"the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;"
Joshua,12,19,"the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;"
Joshua,12,20,"the king of Shimron Meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;"
Joshua,12,21,"the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;"
Joshua,12,22,"the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;"
Joshua,12,23,"the king of Dor in the heights of Dor, one; the king of the people of Gilgal, one;"
Joshua,12,24,"the king of Tirzah, one—all the kings, thirty-one."
Joshua,13,1,"Now Joshua was old, advanced in years. And the LORD said to him: “You are old, advanced in years, and there remains very much land yet to be possessed."
Joshua,13,2,"This is the land that yet remains: all the territory of the Philistines and all that of the Geshurites,"
Joshua,13,3,"from Sihor, which is east of Egypt, as far as the border of Ekron northward (which is counted as Canaanite); the five lords of the Philistines—the Gazites, the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites;"
Joshua,13,4,"from the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorites;"
Joshua,13,5,"the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon as far as the entrance to Hamath;"
Joshua,13,6,"all the inhabitants of the mountains from Lebanon as far as the Brook Misrephoth, and all the Sidonians—them I will drive out from before the children of Israel; only divide it by lot to Israel as an inheritance, as I have commanded you."
Joshua,13,7,"Now therefore, divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh.”"
Joshua,13,8,"With the other half-tribe the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses had given them, beyond the Jordan eastward, as Moses the servant of the LORD had given them:"
Joshua,13,9,"from Aroer which is on the bank of the River Arnon, and the town that is in the midst of the ravine, and all the plain of Medeba as far as Dibon;"
Joshua,13,10,"all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the children of Ammon;"
Joshua,13,11,"Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salcah;"
Joshua,13,12,"all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants; for Moses had defeated and cast out these."
Joshua,13,13,"Nevertheless the children of Israel did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maachathites, but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day."
Joshua,13,14,"Only to the tribe of Levi he had given no inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as He said to them."
Joshua,13,15,And Moses had given to the tribe of the children of Reuben an inheritance according to their families.
Joshua,13,16,"Their territory was from Aroer, which is on the bank of the River Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the ravine, and all the plain by Medeba;"
Joshua,13,17,"Heshbon and all its cities that are in the plain: Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,"
Joshua,13,18,"Jahaza, Kedemoth, Mephaath,"
Joshua,13,19,"Kirjathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on the mountain of the valley,"
Joshua,13,20,"Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth—"
Joshua,13,21,"all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses had struck with the princes of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, who were princes of Sihon dwelling in the country."
Joshua,13,22,"The children of Israel also killed with the sword Balaam the son of Beor, the soothsayer, among those who were killed by them."
Joshua,13,23,"And the border of the children of Reuben was the bank of the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and their villages."
Joshua,13,24,"Moses also had given an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad according to their families."
Joshua,13,25,"Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites as far as Aroer, which is before Rabbah,"
Joshua,13,26,"and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir,"
Joshua,13,27,"and in the valley Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as its border, as far as the edge of the Sea of Chinnereth, on the other side of the Jordan eastward."
Joshua,13,28,"This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and their villages."
Joshua,13,29,Moses also had given an inheritance to half the tribe of Manasseh; it was for half the tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families:
Joshua,13,30,"Their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair which are in Bashan, sixty cities;"
Joshua,13,31,"half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, for half of the children of Machir according to their families."
Joshua,13,32,"These are the areas which Moses had distributed as an inheritance in the plains of Moab on the other side of the Jordan, by Jericho eastward."
Joshua,13,33,"But to the tribe of Levi Moses had given no inheritance; the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as He had said to them."
Joshua,14,1,"These are the areas which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed as an inheritance to them."
Joshua,14,2,"Their inheritance was by lot, as the LORD had commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe."
Joshua,14,3,For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe on the other side of the Jordan; but to the Levites he had given no inheritance among them.
Joshua,14,4,"For the children of Joseph were two tribes: Manasseh and Ephraim. And they gave no part to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their common-lands for their livestock and their property."
Joshua,14,5,"As the LORD had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did; and they divided the land."
Joshua,14,6,Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him: “You know the word which the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh Barnea.
Joshua,14,7,"I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land, and I brought back word to him as it was in my heart."
Joshua,14,8,"Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt, but I wholly followed the LORD my God."
Joshua,14,9,"So Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land where your foot has trodden shall be your inheritance and your children’s forever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.’"
Joshua,14,10,"And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, as He said, these forty-five years, ever since the LORD spoke this word to Moses while Israel wandered in the wilderness; and now, here I am this day, eighty-five years old."
Joshua,14,11,"As yet I am as strong this day as on the day that Moses sent me; just as my strength was then, so now is my strength for war, both for going out and for coming in."
Joshua,14,12,"Now therefore, give me this mountain of which the LORD spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and that the cities were great and fortified. It may be that the LORD will be with me, and I shall be able to drive them out as the LORD said.”"
Joshua,14,13,"And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance."
Joshua,14,14,"Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel."
Joshua,14,15,And the name of Hebron formerly was Kirjath Arba (Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim). Then the land had rest from war.
Joshua,15,1,So this was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families: The border of Edom at the Wilderness of Zin southward was the extreme southern boundary.
Joshua,15,2,"And their southern border began at the shore of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward."
Joshua,15,3,"Then it went out to the southern side of the Ascent of Akrabbim, passed along to Zin, ascended on the south side of Kadesh Barnea, passed along to Hezron, went up to Adar, and went around to Karkaa."
Joshua,15,4,From there it passed toward Azmon and went out to the Brook of Egypt; and the border ended at the sea. This shall be your southern border.
Joshua,15,5,The east border was the Salt Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan. And the border on the northern quarter began at the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan.
Joshua,15,6,The border went up to Beth Hoglah and passed north of Beth Arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.
Joshua,15,7,"Then the border went up toward Debir from the Valley of Achor, and it turned northward toward Gilgal, which is before the Ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley. The border continued toward the waters of En Shemesh and ended at En Rogel."
Joshua,15,8,"And the border went up by the Valley of the Son of Hinnom to the southern slope of the Jebusite city (which is Jerusalem). The border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the Valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the Valley of Rephaim northward."
Joshua,15,9,"Then the border went around from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and extended to the cities of Mount Ephron. And the border went around to Baalah (which is Kirjath Jearim)."
Joshua,15,10,"Then the border turned westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north (which is Chesalon), went down to Beth Shemesh, and passed on to Timnah."
Joshua,15,11,"And the border went out to the side of Ekron northward. Then the border went around to Shicron, passed along to Mount Baalah, and extended to Jabneel; and the border ended at the sea."
Joshua,15,12,The west border was the coastline of the Great Sea. This is the boundary of the children of Judah all around according to their families.
Joshua,15,13,"Now to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a share among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, namely, Kirjath Arba, which is Hebron (Arba was the father of Anak)."
Joshua,15,14,"Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak from there: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak."
Joshua,15,15,Then he went up from there to the inhabitants of Debir (formerly the name of Debir was Kirjath Sepher).
Joshua,15,16,"And Caleb said, “He who attacks Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give Achsah my daughter as wife.”"
Joshua,15,17,"So Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife."
Joshua,15,18,"Now it was so, when she came to him, that she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. So she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you wish?”"
Joshua,15,19,"She answered, “Give me a blessing; since you have given me land in the South, give me also springs of water.” So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs."
Joshua,15,20,This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families:
Joshua,15,21,"The cities at the limits of the tribe of the children of Judah, toward the border of Edom in the South, were Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,"
Joshua,15,22,"Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,"
Joshua,15,23,"Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,"
Joshua,15,24,"Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,"
Joshua,15,25,"Hazor, Hadattah, Kerioth, Hezron (which is Hazor),"
Joshua,15,26,"Amam, Shema, Moladah,"
Joshua,15,27,"Hazar Gaddah, Heshmon, Beth Pelet,"
Joshua,15,28,"Hazar Shual, Beersheba, Bizjothjah,"
Joshua,15,29,"Baalah, Ijim, Ezem,"

Joshua,15,63,"As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day."
Joshua,16,1,"The lot fell to the children of Joseph from the Jordan, by Jericho, to the waters of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goes up from Jericho through the mountains to Bethel,"
Joshua,16,2,"then went out from Bethel to Luz, passed along to the border of the Archites at Ataroth,"
Joshua,16,3,"and went down westward to the boundary of the Japhletites, as far as the boundary of Lower Beth Horon to Gezer; and it ended at the sea."
Joshua,16,4,"So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance."
Joshua,16,5,"The border of the children of Ephraim, according to their families, was thus: The border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth Addar as far as Upper Beth Horon."
Joshua,16,6,"And the border went out toward the sea on the north side of Michmethath; then the border went around eastward to Taanath Shiloh, and passed by it on the east of Janohah."
Joshua,16,7,"Then it went down from Janohah to Ataroth and Naarah, reached to Jericho, and came out at the Jordan."
Joshua,16,8,"The border went out from Tappuah westward to the Brook Kanah, and it ended at the sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families."
Joshua,16,9,"The separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages."
Joshua,16,10,And they did not drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day and have become forced laborers.
Joshua,17,1,"There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph: namely for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war; therefore he was given Gilead and Bashan."
Joshua,17,2,"And there was a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, the children of Helek, the children of Asriel, the children of Shechem, the children of Hepher, and the children of Shemida; these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families."
Joshua,17,3,"But Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but only daughters. And these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah."
Joshua,17,4,"And they came near before Eleazar the priest, before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the rulers, saying, “The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” Therefore, according to the commandment of the LORD, he gave them an inheritance among their father’s brothers."
Joshua,17,5,"Ten shares fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of the Jordan,"
Joshua,17,6,because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons; and the rest of Manasseh’s sons had the land of Gilead.
Joshua,17,7,"And the territory of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, that lies east of Shechem; and the border went along south to the inhabitants of En Tappuah."
Joshua,17,8,"Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim."
Joshua,17,9,"And the border descended to the Brook Kanah, southward to the brook. These cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook; and it ended at the sea."
Joshua,17,10,"Southward it was Ephraim’s, northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea was its border. Manasseh’s territory was adjoining Asher on the north and Issachar on the east."
Joshua,17,11,"And in Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth Shean and its towns, Ibleam and its towns, the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, the inhabitants of En Dor and its towns, the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns—three hilly regions."
Joshua,17,12,"Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities, but the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land."
Joshua,17,13,"And it happened, when the children of Israel grew strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out."
Joshua,17,14,"Then the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, “Why have you given us only one lot and one share to inherit, since we are a great people, inasmuch as the LORD has blessed us until now?”"
Joshua,17,15,"So Joshua answered them, “If you are a great people, then go up to the forest country and clear a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and the giants, since the mountains of Ephraim are too confined for you.”"
Joshua,17,16,"But the children of Joseph said, “The mountain country is not enough for us; and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are of Beth Shean and its towns and those who are of the Valley of Jezreel.”"
Joshua,17,17,"And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh—saying, “You are a great people and have great power; you shall not have only one lot,"
Joshua,17,18,"but the mountain country shall be yours. Although it is wooded, you shall cut it down, and its farthest extent shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots and are strong.”"
Joshua,18,1,"Now the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of meeting there. And the land was subdued before them."
Joshua,18,2,But there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance.
Joshua,18,3,Then Joshua said to the children of Israel: “How long will you neglect to go and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers has given you?
Joshua,18,4,"Pick out from among you three men for each tribe, and I will send them; they shall rise and go through the land, survey it according to their inheritance, and come back to me."
Joshua,18,5,"And they shall divide it into seven parts. Judah shall remain in their territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain in their territory on the north."
Joshua,18,6,"You shall therefore survey the land in seven parts and bring the survey here to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God."
Joshua,18,7,"But the Levites have no part among you, for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.”"
Joshua,18,8,"Then the men arose to go away; and Joshua charged those who went to survey the land, saying, “Go, walk through the land, survey it, and come back to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh.”"
Joshua,18,9,"So the men went, passed through the land, and wrote the survey in a book in seven parts by cities; and they came to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh."
Joshua,18,10,"Then Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD, and there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions."
Joshua,18,11,"Now the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot came out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph."
Joshua,18,12,"Their border on the north side began at the Jordan, and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the mountains westward; it ended at the Wilderness of Beth Aven."
Joshua,18,13,"The border went over from there toward Luz, to the side of Luz (which is Bethel) southward; and the border descended to Ataroth Addar, near the hill that lies on the south side of Lower Beth Horon."
Joshua,18,14,"Then the border extended around the west side to the south, from the hill that lies before Beth Horon southward; and it ended at Kirjath Baal (which is Kirjath Jearim), a city of the children of Judah. This was the west side."
Joshua,18,15,"The south side began at the end of Kirjath Jearim, and the border extended on the west and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah."
Joshua,18,16,"Then the border came down to the end of the mountain that lies before the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, which is in the Valley of the Rephaim on the north, descended to the Valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite city on the south, and descended to En Rogel."
Joshua,18,17,"And it went around from the north, went out to En Shemesh, and extended toward Geliloth, which is before the Ascent of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben."
Joshua,18,18,"Then it passed along toward the north side of Arabah, and went down to Arabah."
Joshua,18,19,"And the border passed along to the north side of Beth Hoglah; then the border ended at the north bay at the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the southern boundary."
Joshua,18,20,"The Jordan was its border on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, according to its boundaries all around, according to their families."
Joshua,18,21,"Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin, according to their families, were Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz,"
Joshua,18,22,"Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,"

Joshua,19,1,"The second lot came out for Simeon, for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families. And their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah."

Joshua,19,9,"The inheritance of the children of Simeon was included in the share of the children of Judah, for the share of the children of Judah was too much for them. Therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of that people."
Joshua,19,10,"The third lot came out for the children of Zebulun according to their families, and the border of their inheritance was as far as Sarid."
Joshua,19,11,"Their border went toward the west and to Maralah, went to Dabbasheth, and extended along the brook that is east of Jokneam."
Joshua,19,12,"Then from Sarid it went eastward toward the sunrise along the border of Chisloth Tabor, and went out toward Daberath, bypassing Japhia."
Joshua,19,13,"And from there it passed along on the east of Gath Hepher, toward Eth Kazin, and extended to Rimmon, which borders on Neah."
Joshua,19,14,"Then the border went around it on the north side of Hannathon, and it ended in the Valley of Jiphthah El."

Joshua,19,48,"This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages."

Joshua,19,50,"According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked for, Timnath Serah in the mountains of Ephraim; and he built the city and dwelt in it."
Joshua,19,51,"These were the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel divided as an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. So they made an end of dividing the country."
Joshua,20,1,"The LORD also spoke to Joshua, saying,"
Joshua,20,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘Appoint for yourselves cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses,"
Joshua,20,3,that the slayer who kills a person accidentally or unintentionally may flee there; and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
Joshua,20,4,"And when he flees to one of those cities, and stands at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declares his case in the hearing of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city as one of them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them."
Joshua,20,5,"Then if the avenger of blood pursues him, they shall not deliver the slayer into his hand, because he struck his neighbor unintentionally, but did not hate him beforehand."
Joshua,20,6,"And he shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the one who is high priest in those days. Then the slayer may return and come to his own city and his own house, to the city from which he fled.’”"
Joshua,20,7,"So they appointed Kedesh in Galilee, in the mountains of Naphtali, Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim, and Kirjath Arba (which is Hebron) in the mountains of Judah."
Joshua,20,8,"And on the other side of the Jordan, by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness on the plain, from the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, from the tribe of Manasseh."
Joshua,20,9,"These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel and for the stranger who dwelt among them, that whoever killed a person accidentally might flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until he stood before the congregation."
Joshua,21,1,"Then the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites came near to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel."
Joshua,21,2,"And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, “The LORD commanded through Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with their common-lands for our livestock.”"
Joshua,21,3,"So the children of Israel gave to the Levites from their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their common-lands:"
Joshua,21,4,"Now the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. And the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Judah, from the tribe of Simeon, and from the tribe of Benjamin."
Joshua,21,5,"The rest of the children of Kohath had ten cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim, from the tribe of Dan, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh."
Joshua,21,6,"And the children of Gershon had thirteen cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Issachar, from the tribe of Asher, from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan."
Joshua,21,7,"The children of Merari according to their families had twelve cities from the tribe of Reuben, from the tribe of Gad, and from the tribe of Zebulun."
Joshua,21,8,"And the children of Israel gave these cities with their common-lands by lot to the Levites, as the LORD had commanded by the hand of Moses."
Joshua,21,9,"So they gave from the tribe of the children of Judah and from the tribe of the children of Simeon these cities which are designated by name,"
Joshua,21,10,"which were for the children of Aaron, one of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi; for the lot was theirs first."
Joshua,21,11,"And they gave them Kirjath Arba (Arba was the father of Anak), which is Hebron, in the mountains of Judah, with the common-land surrounding it."
Joshua,21,12,But the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession.
Joshua,21,13,"Thus to the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its common-land (a city of refuge for the slayer), Libnah with its common-land,"
Joshua,21,14,"Jattir with its common-land, Eshtemoa with its common-land,"
Joshua,21,15,"Holon with its common-land, Debir with its common-land,"
Joshua,21,16,"Ain with its common-land, Juttah with its common-land, and Beth Shemesh with its common-land: nine cities from those two tribes;"
Joshua,21,17,"and from the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its common-land, Geba with its common-land,"
Joshua,21,18,"Anathoth with its common-land, and Almon with its common-land: four cities."
Joshua,21,19,"All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their common-lands."
Joshua,21,20,"And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites, the rest of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot from the tribe of Ephraim."
Joshua,21,21,"For they gave them Shechem with its common-land in the mountains of Ephraim (a city of refuge for the slayer), Gezer with its common-land,"
Joshua,21,22,"Kibzaim with its common-land, and Beth Horon with its common-land: four cities;"
Joshua,21,23,"and from the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with its common-land, Gibbethon with its common-land,"
Joshua,21,24,"Aijalon with its common-land, and Gath Rimmon with its common-land: four cities;"
Joshua,21,25,"and from the half-tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with its common-land and Gath Rimmon with its common-land: two cities."
Joshua,21,26,All the ten cities with their common-lands were for the rest of the families of the children of Kohath.
Joshua,21,27,"Also to the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, from the other half-tribe of Manasseh, they gave Golan in Bashan with its common-land (a city of refuge for the slayer), and Be Eshterah with its common-land: two cities;"
Joshua,21,28,"and from the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its common-land, Daberath with its common-land,"
Joshua,21,29,"Jarmuth with its common-land, and En Gannim with its common-land: four cities;"
Joshua,21,30,"and from the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its common-land, Abdon with its common-land,"
Joshua,21,31,"Helkath with its common-land, and Rehob with its common-land: four cities;"
Joshua,21,32,"and from the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its common-land (a city of refuge for the slayer), Hammoth Dor with its common-land, and Kartan with its common-land: three cities."
Joshua,21,33,All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their common-lands.
Joshua,21,34,"And to the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, from the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its common-land, Kartah with its common-land,"
Joshua,21,35,"Dimnah with its common-land, and Nahalal with its common-land: four cities;"
Joshua,21,36,"and from the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its common-land, Jahaz with its common-land,"
Joshua,21,37,"Kedemoth with its common-land, and Mephaath with its common-land: four cities;"
Joshua,21,38,"and from the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its common-land (a city of refuge for the slayer), Mahanaim with its common-land,"
Joshua,21,39,"Heshbon with its common-land, and Jazer with its common-land: four cities in all."
Joshua,21,40,"So all the cities for the children of Merari according to their families, the rest of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities."
Joshua,21,41,All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities with their common-lands.
Joshua,21,42,Every one of these cities had its common-land surrounding it; thus were all these cities.
Joshua,21,43,"So the LORD gave to Israel all the land of which He had sworn to give to their fathers, and they took possession of it and dwelt in it."
Joshua,21,44,"The LORD gave them rest all around, according to all that He had sworn to their fathers. And not a man of all their enemies stood against them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand."
Joshua,21,45,Not a word failed of any good thing which the LORD had spoken to the house of Israel. All came to pass.
Joshua,22,1,"Then Joshua called the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh,"
Joshua,22,2,"and said to them: “You have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you."
Joshua,22,3,"You have not left your brethren these many days, up to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God."
Joshua,22,4,"And now the LORD your God has given rest to your brethren, as He promised them; now therefore, return and go to your tents and to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of the Jordan."
Joshua,22,5,"But take careful heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways, to keep His commandments, to hold fast to Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.”"
Joshua,22,6,"So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents."
Joshua,22,7,"Now to half the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half of it Joshua gave a possession among their brethren on this side of the Jordan, westward. And indeed, when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,"
Joshua,22,8,"and spoke to them, saying, “Return with much riches to your tents, with very much livestock, with silver, with gold, with bronze, with iron, and with very much clothing. Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.”"
Joshua,22,9,"So the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they had obtained according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses."
Joshua,22,10,"And when they came to the region of the Jordan which is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan—a great, impressive altar."
Joshua,22,11,"Now the children of Israel heard someone say, “Behold, the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh have built an altar on the frontier of the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan—on the children of Israel’s side.”"
Joshua,22,12,"And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered together at Shiloh to go to war against them."
Joshua,22,13,"Then the children of Israel sent Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the children of Reuben, to the children of Gad, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead,"
Joshua,22,14,"and with him ten rulers, one ruler each from the chief house of every tribe of Israel; and each one was the head of the house of his father among the divisions of Israel."
Joshua,22,15,"Then they came to the children of Reuben, to the children of Gad, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,"
Joshua,22,16,"“Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD: ‘What treachery is this that you have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that you have built for yourselves an altar, that you might rebel this day against the LORD?"
Joshua,22,17,"Is the iniquity of Peor not enough for us, from which we are not cleansed till this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,"
Joshua,22,18,"but that you must turn away this day from following the LORD? And it shall be, if you rebel today against the LORD, that tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel."
Joshua,22,19,"Nevertheless, if the land of your possession is unclean, then cross over to the land of the possession of the LORD, where the LORD’s tabernacle stands, and take possession among us; but do not rebel against the LORD, nor rebel against us, by building yourselves an altar besides the altar of the LORD our God."
Joshua,22,20,"Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? And that man did not perish alone in his iniquity.’”"
Joshua,22,21,"Then the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh answered and said to the heads of the divisions of Israel:"
Joshua,22,22,"“The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, He knows, and let Israel itself know—if it is in rebellion, or if in treachery against the LORD, do not save us this day."
Joshua,22,23,"If we have built ourselves an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer on it burnt offerings or grain offerings, or if to offer peace offerings on it, let the LORD Himself require an account."
Joshua,22,24,"But in fact we have done it for fear, for a reason, saying, ‘In time to come your descendants may speak to our descendants, saying, “What have you to do with the LORD God of Israel?"
Joshua,22,25,"For the LORD has made the Jordan a border between you and us, you children of Reuben and children of Gad. You have no part in the LORD.” So your descendants would make our descendants cease fearing the LORD.’"
Joshua,22,26,"Therefore we said, ‘Let us now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice,"
Joshua,22,27,"but that it may be a witness between you and us and our generations after us, that we may perform the service of the LORD before Him with our burnt offerings, with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your descendants may not say to our descendants in time to come, “You have no part in the LORD.”’"
Joshua,22,28,"Therefore we said that it will be, when they say this to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say, ‘Here is the replica of the altar of the LORD which our fathers made, though not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between you and us.’"
Joshua,22,29,"Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn from following the LORD this day, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for grain offerings, or for sacrifices, besides the altar of the LORD our God which is before His tabernacle.”"
Joshua,22,30,"Now when Phinehas the priest and the rulers of the congregation, the heads of the divisions of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them."
Joshua,22,31,"Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh, “This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this treachery against the LORD. Now you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.”"
Joshua,22,32,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the rulers, returned from the children of Reuben and the children of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought back word to them."
Joshua,22,33,"So the thing pleased the children of Israel, and the children of Israel blessed God; they spoke no more of going against them in battle, to destroy the land where the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt."
Joshua,22,34,"The children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar, Witness, “For it is a witness between us that the LORD is God.”"
Joshua,23,1,"Now it came to pass, a long time after the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua was old, advanced in age."
Joshua,23,2,"And Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders, for their heads, for their judges, and for their officers, and said to them: “I am old, advanced in age."
Joshua,23,3,"You have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these nations because of you, for the LORD your God is He who has fought for you."
Joshua,23,4,"See, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, as far as the Great Sea westward."
Joshua,23,5,"And the LORD your God will expel them from before you and drive them out of your sight. So you shall possess their land, as the LORD your God promised you."
Joshua,23,6,"Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, lest you turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left,"
Joshua,23,7,"and lest you go among these nations, these who remain among you. You shall not make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause anyone to swear by them; you shall not serve them nor bow down to them,"
Joshua,23,8,"but you shall hold fast to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day."
Joshua,23,9,"For the LORD has driven out from before you great and strong nations; but as for you, no one has been able to stand against you to this day."
Joshua,23,10,"One man of you shall chase a thousand, for the LORD your God is He who fights for you, as He promised you."
Joshua,23,11,"Therefore take careful heed to yourselves, that you love the LORD your God."
Joshua,23,12,"Or else, if indeed you do go back, and cling to the remnant of these nations—these that remain among you—and make marriages with them, and go in to them and they to you,"
Joshua,23,13,"know for certain that the LORD your God will no longer drive out these nations from before you. But they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land which the LORD your God has given you."
Joshua,23,14,"“Behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth. And you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you. All have come to pass for you; not one word of them has failed."
Joshua,23,15,"Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all the good things have come upon you which the LORD your God promised you, so the LORD will bring upon you all harmful things, until He has destroyed you from this good land which the LORD your God has given you."
Joshua,23,16,"When you have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed down to them, then the anger of the LORD will burn against you, and you shall perish quickly from the good land which He has given you.”"
Joshua,24,1,"Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and called for the elders of Israel, for their heads, for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God."
Joshua,24,2,"And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘Your fathers, including Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, dwelt on the other side of the River in old times; and they served other gods."
Joshua,24,3,"Then I took your father Abraham from the other side of the River, led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his descendants and gave him Isaac."
Joshua,24,4,"To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave the mountains of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt."
Joshua,24,5,"Also I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to what I did among them. Afterward I brought you out."
Joshua,24,6,"‘Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea."
Joshua,24,7,"So they cried out to the LORD; and He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, brought the sea upon them, and covered them. And your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. Then you dwelt in the wilderness a long time."
Joshua,24,8,"And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of the Jordan, and they fought with you. But I gave them into your hand, that you might possess their land, and I destroyed them from before you."
Joshua,24,9,"Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose to make war against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you."
Joshua,24,10,But I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he continued to bless you. So I delivered you out of his hand.
Joshua,24,11,"Then you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the men of Jericho fought against you—also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I delivered them into your hand."
Joshua,24,12,"I sent the hornet before you which drove them out from before you, also the two kings of the Amorites, but not with your sword or with your bow."
Joshua,24,13,"I have given you a land for which you did not labor, and cities which you did not build, and you dwell in them; you eat of the vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.’"
Joshua,24,14,"“Now therefore, fear the LORD, serve Him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt. Serve the LORD!"
Joshua,24,15,"And if it seems evil to you to serve the LORD, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.”"
Joshua,24,16,So the people answered and said: “Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD to serve other gods;
Joshua,24,17,"for the LORD our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way that we went and among all the people through whom we passed."
Joshua,24,18,"And the LORD drove out from before us all the people, including the Amorites who dwelt in the land. We also will serve the LORD, for He is our God.”"
Joshua,24,19,"But Joshua said to the people, “You cannot serve the LORD, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins."
Joshua,24,20,"If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do you harm and consume you, after He has done you good.”"
Joshua,24,21,"And the people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve the LORD!”"
Joshua,24,22,"So Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the LORD for yourselves, to serve Him.” And they said, “We are witnesses!”"
Joshua,24,23,"“Now therefore,” he said, “put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to the LORD God of Israel.”"
Joshua,24,24,"And the people said to Joshua, “The LORD our God we will serve, and His voice we will obey!”"
Joshua,24,25,"So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem."
Joshua,24,26,"Then Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. And he took a large stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORD."
Joshua,24,27,"And Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us, for it has heard all the words of the LORD which He spoke to us. It shall therefore be a witness to you, lest you deny your God.”"
Joshua,24,28,"So Joshua let the people depart, each to his own inheritance."
Joshua,24,29,"Now it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being one hundred and ten years old."
Joshua,24,30,"And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Serah, which is in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash."
Joshua,24,31,"Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had known all the works of the LORD which He had done for Israel."
Joshua,24,32,"The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried at Shechem, in the plot of ground which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of silver, and which had become an inheritance of the children of Joseph."
Joshua,24,33,"And Eleazar the son of Aaron died. They buried him in a hill belonging to Phinehas his son, which was given to him in the mountains of Ephraim."
Judges,1,1,"Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, “Who shall be first to go up for us against the Canaanites to fight against them?”"
Judges,1,2,"And the LORD said, “Judah shall go up. Indeed I have delivered the land into his hand.”"
Judges,1,3,"So Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Come up with me to my allotted territory, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I will likewise go with you to your allotted territory.” And Simeon went with him."
Judges,1,4,"Then Judah went up, and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they killed ten thousand men at Bezek."
Judges,1,5,"And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him; and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites."
Judges,1,6,"Then Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes."
Judges,1,7,"And Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has repaid me.” Then they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died."
Judges,1,8,Now the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it; they struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.
Judges,1,9,"And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the mountains, in the South, and in the lowland."
Judges,1,10,"Then Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron. (Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kirjath Arba.) And they killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai."
Judges,1,11,From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir was formerly Kirjath Sepher.)
Judges,1,12,"Then Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give my daughter Achsah as wife.”"
Judges,1,13,"And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife."
Judges,1,14,"Now it happened, when she came to him, that she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you wish?”"
Judges,1,15,"So she said to him, “Give me a blessing; since you have given me land in the South, give me also springs of water.” And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs."
Judges,1,16,"Now the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up from the City of Palms with the children of Judah into the Wilderness of Judah, which lies in the South near Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people."
Judges,1,17,"And Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they attacked the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah."
Judges,1,18,"Also Judah took Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory."
Judges,1,19,"So the LORD was with Judah. And they drove out the mountaineers, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the lowland, because they had chariots of iron."
Judges,1,20,"And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said. Then he expelled from there the three sons of Anak."
Judges,1,21,But the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; so the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
Judges,1,22,"And the house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them."
Judges,1,23,So the house of Joseph sent men to spy out Bethel. (The name of the city was formerly Luz.)
Judges,1,24,"And when the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, “Please show us the entrance to the city, and we will show you mercy.”"
Judges,1,25,"So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go."
Judges,1,26,"And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day."
Judges,1,27,"However, Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land."
Judges,1,28,"And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites under tribute, but did not completely drive them out."
Judges,1,29,Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; so the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
Judges,1,30,"Nor did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol; so the Canaanites dwelt among them, and were put under tribute."
Judges,1,31,"Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob."
Judges,1,32,"So the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out."
Judges,1,33,"Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but they dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were put under tribute to them."
Judges,1,34,"And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountains, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;"
Judges,1,35,"and the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; yet when the strength of the house of Joseph became greater, they were put under tribute."
Judges,1,36,"Now the boundary of the Amorites was from the Ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela, and upward."
Judges,2,1,"Then the Angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said: “I led you up from Egypt and brought you to the land of which I swore to your fathers; and I said, ‘I will never break My covenant with you."
Judges,2,2,And you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed My voice. Why have you done this?
Judges,2,3,"Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out before you; but they shall be thorns in your side, and their gods shall be a snare to you.’”"
Judges,2,4,"So it was, when the Angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voices and wept."
Judges,2,5,Then they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there to the LORD.
Judges,2,6,"And when Joshua had dismissed the people, the children of Israel went each to his own inheritance to possess the land."
Judges,2,7,"So the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD which He had done for Israel."
Judges,2,8,"Now Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died when he was one hundred and ten years old."
Judges,2,9,"And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Heres, in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash."
Judges,2,10,"When all that generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who did not know the LORD nor the work which He had done for Israel."
Judges,2,11,"Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served the Baals;"
Judges,2,12,"and they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; and they followed other gods from among the gods of the people who were all around them, and they bowed down to them; and they provoked the LORD to anger."
Judges,2,13,They forsook the LORD and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.
Judges,2,14,"And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel. So He delivered them into the hands of plunderers who despoiled them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies."
Judges,2,15,"Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for calamity, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them. And they were greatly distressed."
Judges,2,16,"Nevertheless, the LORD raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them."
Judges,2,17,"Yet they would not listen to their judges, but they played the harlot with other gods, and bowed down to them. They turned quickly from the way in which their fathers walked, in obeying the commandments of the LORD; they did not do so."
Judges,2,18,"And when the LORD raised up judges for them, the LORD was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed them and harassed them."
Judges,2,19,"And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they reverted and behaved more corruptly than their fathers, by following other gods, to serve them and bow down to them. They did not cease from their own doings nor from their stubborn way."
Judges,2,20,"Then the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and He said, “Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not heeded My voice,"
Judges,2,21,"I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died,"
Judges,2,22,"so that through them I may test Israel, whether they will keep the ways of the LORD, to walk in them as their fathers kept them, or not.”"
Judges,2,23,"Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out immediately; nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua."
Judges,3,1,"Now these are the nations which the LORD left, that He might test Israel by them, that is, all who had not known any of the wars in Canaan"
Judges,3,2,"(this was only so that the generations of the children of Israel might be taught to know war, at least those who had not formerly known it),"
Judges,3,3,"namely, five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who dwelt in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath."
Judges,3,4,"And they were left, that He might test Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commandments of the LORD, which He had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses."
Judges,3,5,"Thus the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites."
Judges,3,6,"And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons; and they served their gods."
Judges,3,7,"So the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD. They forgot the LORD their God, and served the Baals and Asherahs."
Judges,3,8,"Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan-Rishathaim eight years."
Judges,3,9,"When the children of Israel cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the children of Israel, who delivered them: Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother."
Judges,3,10,"The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the LORD delivered Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed over Cushan-Rishathaim."
Judges,3,11,So the land had rest for forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
Judges,3,12,"And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD. So the LORD strengthened Eglon king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD."
Judges,3,13,"Then he gathered to himself the people of Ammon and Amalek, went and defeated Israel, and took possession of the City of Palms."
Judges,3,14,So the children of Israel served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.
Judges,3,15,"But when the children of Israel cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for them: Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. By him the children of Israel sent tribute to Eglon king of Moab."
Judges,3,16,Now Ehud made himself a dagger (it was double-edged and a cubit in length) and fastened it under his clothes on his right thigh.
Judges,3,17,So he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. (Now Eglon was a very fat man.)
Judges,3,18,"And when he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried the tribute."
Judges,3,19,"But he himself turned back from the stone images that were at Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” He said, “Keep silence!” And all who attended him went out from him."
Judges,3,20,"So Ehud came to him (now he was sitting upstairs in his cool private chamber). Then Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” So he arose from his seat."
Judges,3,21,"Then Ehud reached with his left hand, took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly."
Judges,3,22,"Even the hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the dagger out of his belly; and his entrails came out."
Judges,3,23,Then Ehud went out through the porch and shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.
Judges,3,24,"When he had gone out, Eglon’s servants came to look, and to their surprise, the doors of the upper room were locked. So they said, “He is probably attending to his needs in the cool chamber.”"
Judges,3,25,"So they waited till they were embarrassed, and still he had not opened the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened them. And there was their master, fallen dead on the floor."
Judges,3,26,"But Ehud had escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the stone images and escaped to Seirah."
Judges,3,27,"And it happened, when he arrived, that he blew the trumpet in the mountains of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mountains; and he led them."
Judges,3,28,"Then he said to them, “Follow me, for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” So they went down after him, seized the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross over."
Judges,3,29,"And at that time they killed about ten thousand men of Moab, all stout men of valor; not a man escaped."
Judges,3,30,So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.
Judges,3,31,"After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad; and he also delivered Israel."
Judges,4,1,"When Ehud was dead, the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD."
Judges,4,2,"So the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth Hagoyim."
Judges,4,3,"And the children of Israel cried out to the LORD; for Jabin had nine hundred chariots of iron, and for twenty years he had harshly oppressed the children of Israel."
Judges,4,4,"Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, was judging Israel at that time."
Judges,4,5,And she would sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. And the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
Judges,4,6,"Then she sent and called for Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, “Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, ‘Go and deploy troops at Mount Tabor; take with you ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun;"
Judges,4,7,"and against you I will deploy Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude at the River Kishon; and I will deliver him into your hand’?”"
Judges,4,8,"And Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go!”"
Judges,4,9,"So she said, “I will surely go with you; nevertheless there will be no glory for you in the journey you are taking, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.” Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh."
Judges,4,10,"And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; he went up with ten thousand men under his command, and Deborah went up with him."
Judges,4,11,"Now Heber the Kenite, of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent near the terebinth tree at Zaanaim, which is beside Kedesh."
Judges,4,12,And they reported to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.
Judges,4,13,"So Sisera gathered together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth Hagoyim to the River Kishon."
Judges,4,14,"Then Deborah said to Barak, “Up! For this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand. Has not the LORD gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him."
Judges,4,15,And the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot.
Judges,4,16,"But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth Hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left."
Judges,4,17,"However, Sisera had fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite."
Judges,4,18,"And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; do not fear.” And when he had turned aside with her into the tent, she covered him with a blanket."
Judges,4,19,"Then he said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a jug of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him."
Judges,4,20,"And he said to her, “Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, ‘Is there any man here?’ you shall say, ‘No.’”"
Judges,4,21,"Then Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went down into the ground; for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died."
Judges,4,22,"And then, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, I will show you the man whom you seek.” And when he went into her tent, there lay Sisera, dead with the peg in his temple."
Judges,4,23,So on that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan in the presence of the children of Israel.
Judges,4,24,"And the hand of the children of Israel grew stronger and stronger against Jabin king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan."
Judges,5,1,"Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying:"
Judges,5,2,"“When leaders lead in Israel, When the people willingly offer themselves, Bless the LORD!"
Judges,5,3,"“Hear, O kings! Give ear, O princes! I, even I, will sing to the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel."
Judges,5,4,"“LORD, when You went out from Seir, When You marched from the field of Edom, The earth trembled and the heavens poured, The clouds also poured water;"
Judges,5,5,"The mountains gushed before the LORD, This Sinai, before the LORD God of Israel."
Judges,5,6,"“In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, In the days of Jael, The highways were deserted, And the travelers walked along the byways."
Judges,5,7,"Village life ceased, it ceased in Israel, Until I, Deborah, arose, Arose a mother in Israel."
Judges,5,8,They chose new gods; Then there was war in the gates; Not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel.
Judges,5,9,My heart is with the rulers of Israel Who offered themselves willingly with the people. Bless the LORD!
Judges,5,10,"“Speak, you who ride on white donkeys, Who sit in judges’ attire, And who walk along the road."
Judges,5,11,"Far from the noise of the archers, among the watering places, There they shall recount the righteous acts of the LORD, The righteous acts for His villagers in Israel; Then the people of the LORD shall go down to the gates."
Judges,5,12,"“Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, sing a song! Arise, Barak, and lead your captives away, O son of Abinoam!"
Judges,5,13,"“Then the survivors came down, the people against the nobles; The LORD came down for me against the mighty."
Judges,5,14,"From Ephraim were those whose roots were in Amalek. After you, Benjamin, with your peoples, From Machir rulers came down, And from Zebulun those who bear the recruiter’s staff."
Judges,5,15,"And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; As Issachar, so was Barak Sent into the valley under his command; Among the divisions of Reuben There were great resolves of heart."
Judges,5,16,"Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, To hear the pipings for the flocks? The divisions of Reuben have great searchings of heart."
Judges,5,17,"Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan, And why did Dan remain on ships? Asher continued at the seashore, And stayed by his inlets."
Judges,5,18,"Zebulun is a people who jeopardized their lives to the point of death, Naphtali also, on the heights of the battlefield."
Judges,5,19,"“The kings came and fought, Then the kings of Canaan fought In Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; They took no spoils of silver."
Judges,5,20,They fought from the heavens; The stars from their courses fought against Sisera.
Judges,5,21,"The torrent of Kishon swept them away, That ancient torrent, the torrent of Kishon. O my soul, march on in strength!"
Judges,5,22,"Then the horses’ hooves pounded, The galloping, galloping of his steeds."
Judges,5,23,"‘Curse Meroz,’ said the angel of the LORD, ‘Curse its inhabitants bitterly, Because they did not come to the help of the LORD, To the help of the LORD against the mighty.’"
Judges,5,24,"“Most blessed among women is Jael, The wife of Heber the Kenite; Blessed is she among women in tents."
Judges,5,25,"He asked for water, she gave milk; She brought out cream in a lordly bowl."
Judges,5,26,"She stretched her hand to the tent peg, Her right hand to the workmen’s hammer; She pounded Sisera, she pierced his head, She split and struck through his temple."
Judges,5,27,"At her feet he sank, he fell, he lay still; At her feet he sank, he fell; Where he sank, there he fell dead."
Judges,5,28,"“The mother of Sisera looked through the window, And cried out through the lattice, ‘Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarries the clatter of his chariots?’"
Judges,5,29,"Her wisest ladies answered her, Yes, she answered herself,"
Judges,5,30,"‘Are they not finding and dividing the spoil: To every man a girl or two; For Sisera, plunder of dyed garments, Plunder of garments embroidered and dyed, Two pieces of dyed embroidery for the neck of the looter?’"
Judges,5,31,"“Thus let all Your enemies perish, O LORD! But let those who love Him be like the sun When it comes out in full strength.” So the land had rest for forty years."
Judges,6,1,"Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD. So the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian for seven years,"
Judges,6,2,"and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of the Midianites, the children of Israel made for themselves the dens, the caves, and the strongholds which are in the mountains."
Judges,6,3,"So it was, whenever Israel had sown, Midianites would come up; also Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them."
Judges,6,4,"Then they would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep nor ox nor donkey."
Judges,6,5,"For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, coming in as numerous as locusts; both they and their camels were without number; and they would enter the land to destroy it."
Judges,6,6,"So Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites, and the children of Israel cried out to the LORD."
Judges,6,7,"And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried out to the LORD because of the Midianites,"
Judges,6,8,"that the LORD sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘I brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage;"
Judges,6,9,"and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land."
Judges,6,10,"Also I said to you, “I am the LORD your God; do not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.” But you have not obeyed My voice.’”"
Judges,6,11,"Now the Angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, in order to hide it from the Midianites."
Judges,6,12,"And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him, and said to him, “The LORD is with you, you mighty man of valor!”"
Judges,6,13,"Gideon said to Him, “O my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, ‘Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the LORD has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.”"
Judges,6,14,"Then the LORD turned to him and said, “Go in this might of yours, and you shall save Israel from the hand of the Midianites. Have I not sent you?”"
Judges,6,15,"So he said to Him, “O my Lord, how can I save Israel? Indeed my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.”"
Judges,6,16,"And the LORD said to him, “Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat the Midianites as one man.”"
Judges,6,17,"Then he said to Him, “If now I have found favor in Your sight, then show me a sign that it is You who talk with me."
Judges,6,18,"Do not depart from here, I pray, until I come to You and bring out my offering and set it before You.” And He said, “I will wait until you come back.”"
Judges,6,19,"So Gideon went in and prepared a young goat, and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot; and he brought them out to Him under the terebinth tree and presented them."
Judges,6,20,"The Angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And he did so."
Judges,6,21,"Then the Angel of the LORD put out the end of the staff that was in His hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened bread; and fire rose out of the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. And the Angel of the LORD departed out of his sight."
Judges,6,22,"Now Gideon perceived that He was the Angel of the LORD. So Gideon said, “Alas, O Lord GOD! For I have seen the Angel of the LORD face to face.”"
Judges,6,23,"Then the LORD said to him, “Peace be with you; do not fear, you shall not die.”"
Judges,6,24,"So Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it The-LORD-Is-Peace. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites."
Judges,6,25,"Now it came to pass the same night that the LORD said to him, “Take your father’s young bull, the second bull of seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the wooden image that is beside it;"
Judges,6,26,"and build an altar to the LORD your God on top of this rock in the proper arrangement, and take the second bull and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the image which you shall cut down.”"
Judges,6,27,"So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as the LORD had said to him. But because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city too much to do it by day, he did it by night."
Judges,6,28,"And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, there was the altar of Baal, torn down; and the wooden image that was beside it was cut down, and the second bull was being offered on the altar which had been built."
Judges,6,29,"So they said to one another, “Who has done this thing?” And when they had inquired and asked, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.”"
Judges,6,30,"Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has torn down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the wooden image that was beside it.”"
Judges,6,31,"But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Would you plead for Baal? Would you save him? Let the one who would plead for him be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him plead for himself, because his altar has been torn down!”"
Judges,6,32,"Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, “Let Baal plead against him, because he has torn down his altar.”"
Judges,6,33,"Then all the Midianites and Amalekites, the people of the East, gathered together; and they crossed over and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel."
Judges,6,34,"But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon; then he blew the trumpet, and the Abiezrites gathered behind him."
Judges,6,35,"And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, who also gathered behind him. He also sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali; and they came up to meet them."
Judges,6,36,"So Gideon said to God, “If You will save Israel by my hand as You have said—"
Judges,6,37,"look, I shall put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that You will save Israel by my hand, as You have said.”"
Judges,6,38,"And it was so. When he rose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece together, he wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water."
Judges,6,39,"Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry with me, but let me speak just once more: Let me test, I pray, just once more with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, but on all the ground let there be dew.”"
Judges,6,40,"And God did so that night. It was dry on the fleece only, but there was dew on all the ground."
Judges,7,1,"Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the well of Harod, so that the camp of the Midianites was on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley."
Judges,7,2,"And the LORD said to Gideon, “The people who are with you are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel claim glory for itself against Me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’"
Judges,7,3,"Now therefore, proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him turn and depart at once from Mount Gilead.’” And twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained."
Judges,7,4,"But the LORD said to Gideon, “The people are still too many; bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. Then it will be, that of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’ the same shall go with you; and of whomever I say to you, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ the same shall not go.”"
Judges,7,5,"So he brought the people down to the water. And the LORD said to Gideon, “Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set apart by himself; likewise everyone who gets down on his knees to drink.”"
Judges,7,6,"And the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people got down on their knees to drink water."
Judges,7,7,"Then the LORD said to Gideon, “By the three hundred men who lapped I will save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the other people go, every man to his place.”"
Judges,7,8,"So the people took provisions and their trumpets in their hands. And he sent away all the rest of Israel, every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men. Now the camp of Midian was below him in the valley."
Judges,7,9,"It happened on the same night that the LORD said to him, “Arise, go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand."
Judges,7,10,"But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant,"
Judges,7,11,and you shall hear what they say; and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp.” Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outpost of the armed men who were in the camp.
Judges,7,12,"Now the Midianites and Amalekites, all the people of the East, were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the seashore in multitude."
Judges,7,13,"And when Gideon had come, there was a man telling a dream to his companion. He said, “I have had a dream: To my surprise, a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian; it came to a tent and struck it so that it fell and overturned, and the tent collapsed.”"
Judges,7,14,"Then his companion answered and said, “This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel! Into his hand God has delivered Midian and the whole camp.”"
Judges,7,15,"And so it was, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, that he worshiped. He returned to the camp of Israel, and said, “Arise, for the LORD has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand.”"
Judges,7,16,"Then he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet into every man’s hand, with empty pitchers, and torches inside the pitchers."
Judges,7,17,"And he said to them, “Look at me and do likewise; watch, and when I come to the edge of the camp you shall do as I do:"
Judges,7,18,"When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then you also blow the trumpets on every side of the whole camp, and say, ‘The sword of the LORD and of Gideon!’”"
Judges,7,19,"So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outpost of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just as they had posted the watch; and they blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers that were in their hands."
Judges,7,20,"Then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers—they held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands for blowing—and they cried, “The sword of the LORD and of Gideon!”"
Judges,7,21,And every man stood in his place all around the camp; and the whole army ran and cried out and fled.
Judges,7,22,"When the three hundred blew the trumpets, the LORD set every man’s sword against his companion throughout the whole camp; and the army fled to Beth Acacia, toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath."
Judges,7,23,"And the men of Israel gathered together from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, and pursued the Midianites."
Judges,7,24,"Then Gideon sent messengers throughout all the mountains of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against the Midianites, and seize from them the watering places as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan.” Then all the men of Ephraim gathered together and seized the watering places as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan."
Judges,7,25,"And they captured two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued Midian and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan."
Judges,8,1,"Now the men of Ephraim said to him, “Why have you done this to us by not calling us when you went to fight with the Midianites?” And they reprimanded him sharply."
Judges,8,2,"So he said to them, “What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?"
Judges,8,3,"God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. And what was I able to do in comparison with you?” Then their anger toward him subsided when he said that."
Judges,8,4,"When Gideon came to the Jordan, he and the three hundred men who were with him crossed over, exhausted but still in pursuit."
Judges,8,5,"Then he said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.”"
Judges,8,6,"And the leaders of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?”"
Judges,8,7,"So Gideon said, “For this cause, when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers!”"
Judges,8,8,Then he went up from there to Penuel and spoke to them in the same way. And the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.
Judges,8,9,"So he also spoke to the men of Penuel, saying, “When I come back in peace, I will tear down this tower!”"
Judges,8,10,"Now Zebah and Zalmunna were at Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East; for one hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword had fallen."
Judges,8,11,Then Gideon went up by the road of those who dwell in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah; and he attacked the army while the camp felt secure.
Judges,8,12,"When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army."
Judges,8,13,"Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle, from the Ascent of Heres."
Judges,8,14,"And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth and interrogated him; and he wrote down for him the leaders of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men."
Judges,8,15,"Then he came to the men of Succoth and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you ridiculed me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your weary men?’”"
Judges,8,16,"And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth."
Judges,8,17,Then he tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.
Judges,8,18,"And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?” So they answered, “As you are, so were they; each one resembled the son of a king.”"
Judges,8,19,"Then he said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if you had let them live, I would not kill you.”"
Judges,8,20,"And he said to Jether his firstborn, “Rise, kill them!” But the youth would not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was still a youth."
Judges,8,21,"So Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise yourself, and kill us; for as a man is, so is his strength.” So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels’ necks."
Judges,8,22,"Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, both you and your son, and your grandson also; for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.”"
Judges,8,23,"But Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, nor shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you.”"
Judges,8,24,"Then Gideon said to them, “I would like to make a request of you, that each of you would give me the earrings from his plunder.” For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites."
Judges,8,25,"So they answered, “We will gladly give them.” And they spread out a garment, and each man threw into it the earrings from his plunder."
Judges,8,26,"Now the weight of the gold earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments, pendants, and purple robes which were on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were around their camels’ necks."
Judges,8,27,"Then Gideon made it into an ephod and set it up in his city, Ophrah. And all Israel played the harlot with it there. It became a snare to Gideon and to his house."
Judges,8,28,"Thus Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted their heads no more. And the country was quiet for forty years in the days of Gideon."
Judges,8,29,Then Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
Judges,8,30,"Gideon had seventy sons who were his own offspring, for he had many wives."
Judges,8,31,"And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech."
Judges,8,32,"Now Gideon the son of Joash died at a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites."
Judges,8,33,"So it was, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel again played the harlot with the Baals, and made Baal-Berith their god."
Judges,8,34,"Thus the children of Israel did not remember the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side;"
Judges,8,35,nor did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal (Gideon) in accordance with the good he had done for Israel.
Judges,9,1,"Then Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem, to his mother’s brothers, and spoke with them and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,"
Judges,9,2,"“Please speak in the hearing of all the men of Shechem: ‘Which is better for you, that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal reign over you, or that one reign over you?’ Remember that I am your own flesh and bone.”"
Judges,9,3,"And his mother’s brothers spoke all these words concerning him in the hearing of all the men of Shechem; and their heart was inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our brother.”"
Judges,9,4,"So they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless men; and they followed him."
Judges,9,5,"Then he went to his father’s house at Ophrah and killed his brothers, the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, because he hid himself."
Judges,9,6,"And all the men of Shechem gathered together, all of Beth Millo, and they went and made Abimelech king beside the terebinth tree at the pillar that was in Shechem."
Judges,9,7,"Now when they told Jotham, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted his voice and cried out. And he said to them: “Listen to me, you men of Shechem, That God may listen to you!"
Judges,9,8,"“The trees once went forth to anoint a king over them. And they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us!’"
Judges,9,9,"But the olive tree said to them, ‘Should I cease giving my oil, With which they honor God and men, And go to sway over trees?’"
Judges,9,10,"“Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and reign over us!’"
Judges,9,11,"But the fig tree said to them, ‘Should I cease my sweetness and my good fruit, And go to sway over trees?’"
Judges,9,12,"“Then the trees said to the vine, ‘You come and reign over us!’"
Judges,9,13,"But the vine said to them, ‘Should I cease my new wine, Which cheers both God and men, And go to sway over trees?’"
Judges,9,14,"“Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘You come and reign over us!’"
Judges,9,15,"And the bramble said to the trees, ‘If in truth you anoint me as king over you, Then come and take shelter in my shade; But if not, let fire come out of the bramble And devour the cedars of Lebanon!’"
Judges,9,16,"“Now therefore, if you have acted in truth and sincerity in making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him as he deserves—"
Judges,9,17,"for my father fought for you, risked his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian;"
Judges,9,18,"but you have risen up against my father’s house this day, and killed his seventy sons on one stone, and made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother—"
Judges,9,19,"if then you have acted in truth and sincerity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you."
Judges,9,20,"“But if not, let fire come from Abimelech and devour the men of Shechem and Beth Millo; and let fire come from the men of Shechem and from Beth Millo and devour Abimelech!”"
Judges,9,21,"And Jotham ran away and fled; and he went to Beer and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother."
Judges,9,22,"After Abimelech had reigned over Israel three years,"
Judges,9,23,"God sent a spirit of ill will between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,"
Judges,9,24,"that the crime done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be settled and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who aided him in the killing of his brothers."
Judges,9,25,"And the men of Shechem set men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who passed by them along that way; and it was told Abimelech."
Judges,9,26,Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
Judges,9,27,"So they went out into the fields, and gathered grapes from their vineyards and trod them, and made merry. And they went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech."
Judges,9,28,"Then Gaal the son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him?"
Judges,9,29,"If only this people were under my authority! Then I would remove Abimelech.” So he said to Abimelech, “Increase your army and come out!”"
Judges,9,30,"When Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was aroused."
Judges,9,31,"And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, “Take note! Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem; and here they are, fortifying the city against you."
Judges,9,32,"Now therefore, get up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field."
Judges,9,33,"And it shall be, as soon as the sun is up in the morning, that you shall rise early and rush upon the city; and when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you may then do to them as you find opportunity.”"
Judges,9,34,"So Abimelech and all the people who were with him rose by night, and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies."
Judges,9,35,"When Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance to the city gate, Abimelech and the people who were with him rose from lying in wait."
Judges,9,36,"And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!” But Zebul said to him, “You see the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.”"
Judges,9,37,"So Gaal spoke again and said, “See, people are coming down from the center of the land, and another company is coming from the Diviners’ Terebinth Tree.”"
Judges,9,38,"Then Zebul said to him, “Where indeed is your mouth now, with which you said, ‘Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?’ Are not these the people whom you despised? Go out, if you will, and fight with them now.”"
Judges,9,39,"So Gaal went out, leading the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech."
Judges,9,40,"And Abimelech chased him, and he fled from him; and many fell wounded, to the very entrance of the gate."
Judges,9,41,"Then Abimelech dwelt at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, so that they would not dwell in Shechem."
Judges,9,42,"And it came about on the next day that the people went out into the field, and they told Abimelech."
Judges,9,43,"So he took his people, divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field. And he looked, and there were the people, coming out of the city; and he rose against them and attacked them."
Judges,9,44,Then Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city; and the other two companies rushed upon all who were in the fields and killed them.
Judges,9,45,So Abimelech fought against the city all that day; he took the city and killed the people who were in it; and he demolished the city and sowed it with salt.
Judges,9,46,"Now when all the men of the tower of Shechem had heard that, they entered the stronghold of the temple of the god Berith."
Judges,9,47,And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
Judges,9,48,"Then Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him. And Abimelech took an ax in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it and laid it on his shoulder; then he said to the people who were with him, “What you have seen me do, make haste and do as I have done.”"
Judges,9,49,"So each of the people likewise cut down his own bough and followed Abimelech, put them against the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire above them, so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died, about a thousand men and women."
Judges,9,50,"Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he encamped against Thebez and took it."
Judges,9,51,"But there was a strong tower in the city, and all the men and women—all the people of the city—fled there and shut themselves in; then they went up to the top of the tower."
Judges,9,52,So Abimelech came as far as the tower and fought against it; and he drew near the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
Judges,9,53,But a certain woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull.
Judges,9,54,"Then he called quickly to the young man, his armorbearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, lest men say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’” So his young man thrust him through, and he died."
Judges,9,55,"And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed, every man to his place."
Judges,9,56,"Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers."
Judges,9,57,"And all the evil of the men of Shechem God returned on their own heads, and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal."
Judges,10,1,"After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in the mountains of Ephraim."
Judges,10,2,He judged Israel twenty-three years; and he died and was buried in Shamir.
Judges,10,3,"After him arose Jair, a Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty-two years."
Judges,10,4,"Now he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys; they also had thirty towns, which are called “Havoth Jair” to this day, which are in the land of Gilead."
Judges,10,5,And Jair died and was buried in Camon.
Judges,10,6,"Then the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the people of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook the LORD and did not serve Him."
Judges,10,7,So the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the people of Ammon.
Judges,10,8,"From that year they harassed and oppressed the children of Israel for eighteen years—all the children of Israel who were on the other side of the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, in Gilead."
Judges,10,9,"Moreover the people of Ammon crossed over the Jordan to fight against Judah also, against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was severely distressed."
Judges,10,10,"And the children of Israel cried out to the LORD, saying, “We have sinned against You, because we have both forsaken our God and served the Baals!”"
Judges,10,11,"So the LORD said to the children of Israel, “Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians and from the Amorites and from the people of Ammon and from the Philistines?"
Judges,10,12,"Also the Sidonians and Amalekites and Maonites oppressed you; and you cried out to Me, and I delivered you from their hand."
Judges,10,13,Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods. Therefore I will deliver you no more.
Judges,10,14,“Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in your time of distress.”
Judges,10,15,"And the children of Israel said to the LORD, “We have sinned! Do to us whatever seems best to You; only deliver us this day, we pray.”"
Judges,10,16,So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD. And His soul could no longer endure the misery of Israel.
Judges,10,17,Then the people of Ammon gathered together and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled together and encamped in Mizpah.
Judges,10,18,"And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said to one another, “Who is the man who will begin the fight against the people of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”"
Judges,11,1,"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, but he was the son of a harlot; and Gilead begot Jephthah."
Judges,11,2,"Gilead’s wife bore sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out, and said to him, “You shall have no inheritance in our father’s house, for you are the son of another woman.”"
Judges,11,3,Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and dwelt in the land of Tob; and worthless men banded together with Jephthah and went out raiding with him.
Judges,11,4,It came to pass after a time that the people of Ammon made war against Israel.
Judges,11,5,"And so it was, when the people of Ammon made war against Israel, that the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob."
Judges,11,6,"Then they said to Jephthah, “Come and be our commander, that we may fight against the people of Ammon.”"
Judges,11,7,"So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Did you not hate me, and expel me from my father’s house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?”"
Judges,11,8,"And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “That is why we have turned again to you now, that you may go with us and fight against the people of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”"
Judges,11,9,"So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you take me back home to fight against the people of Ammon, and the LORD delivers them to me, shall I be your head?”"
Judges,11,10,"And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The LORD will be a witness between us, if we do not do according to your words.”"
Judges,11,11,"Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the LORD in Mizpah."
Judges,11,12,"Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon, saying, “What do you have against me, that you have come to fight against me in my land?”"
Judges,11,13,"And the king of the people of Ammon answered the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel took away my land when they came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and to the Jordan. Now therefore, restore those lands peaceably.”"
Judges,11,14,"So Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon,"
Judges,11,15,"and said to him, “Thus says Jephthah: ‘Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the people of Ammon;"
Judges,11,16,"for when Israel came up from Egypt, they walked through the wilderness as far as the Red Sea and came to Kadesh."
Judges,11,17,"Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, “Please let me pass through your land.” But the king of Edom would not heed. And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained in Kadesh."
Judges,11,18,"And they went along through the wilderness and bypassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab, came to the east side of the land of Moab, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab."
Judges,11,19,"Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, “Please let us pass through your land into our place.”"
Judges,11,20,"But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people together, encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel."
Judges,11,21,"And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them. Thus Israel gained possession of all the land of the Amorites, who inhabited that country."
Judges,11,22,"They took possession of all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan."
Judges,11,23,‘And now the LORD God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites from before His people Israel; should you then possess it?
Judges,11,24,"Will you not possess whatever Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whatever the LORD our God takes possession of before us, we will possess."
Judges,11,25,"And now, are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel? Did he ever fight against them?"
Judges,11,26,"While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its villages, in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities along the banks of the Arnon, for three hundred years, why did you not recover them within that time?"
Judges,11,27,"Therefore I have not sinned against you, but you wronged me by fighting against me. May the LORD, the Judge, render judgment this day between the children of Israel and the people of Ammon.’”"
Judges,11,28,"However, the king of the people of Ammon did not heed the words which Jephthah sent him."
Judges,11,29,"Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and passed through Mizpah of Gilead; and from Mizpah of Gilead he advanced toward the people of Ammon."
Judges,11,30,"And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD, and said, “If You will indeed deliver the people of Ammon into my hands,"
Judges,11,31,"then it will be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the people of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD’s, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.”"
Judges,11,32,"So Jephthah advanced toward the people of Ammon to fight against them, and the LORD delivered them into his hands."
Judges,11,33,"And he defeated them from Aroer as far as Minnith—twenty cities—and to Abel Keramim, with a very great slaughter. Thus the people of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel."
Judges,11,34,"When Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, there was his daughter, coming out to meet him with timbrels and dancing; and she was his only child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter."
Judges,11,35,"And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low! You are among those who trouble me! For I have given my word to the LORD, and I cannot go back on it.”"
Judges,11,36,"So she said to him, “My father, if you have given your word to the LORD, do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, because the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the people of Ammon.”"
Judges,11,37,"Then she said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me: let me alone for two months, that I may go and wander on the mountains and bewail my virginity, my friends and I.”"
Judges,11,38,"So he said, “Go.” And he sent her away for two months; and she went with her friends, and bewailed her virginity on the mountains."
Judges,11,39,"And it was so at the end of two months that she returned to her father, and he carried out his vow with her which he had vowed. She knew no man. And it became a custom in Israel"
Judges,11,40,that the daughters of Israel went four days each year to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
Judges,12,1,"Then the men of Ephraim gathered together, crossed over toward Zaphon, and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over to fight against the people of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house down on you with fire!”"
Judges,12,2,"And Jephthah said to them, “My people and I were in a great struggle with the people of Ammon; and when I called you, you did not deliver me out of their hands."
Judges,12,3,"So when I saw that you would not deliver me, I took my life in my hands and crossed over against the people of Ammon; and the LORD delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?”"
Judges,12,4,"Now Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. And the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, “You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites and among the Manassites.”"
Judges,12,5,"The Gileadites seized the fords of the Jordan before the Ephraimites arrived. And when any Ephraimite who escaped said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead would say to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,”"
Judges,12,6,"then they would say to him, “Then say, ‘Shibboleth’!” And he would say, “Sibboleth,” for he could not pronounce it right. Then they would take him and kill him at the fords of the Jordan. There fell at that time forty-two thousand Ephraimites."
Judges,12,7,And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in among the cities of Gilead.
Judges,12,8,"After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel."
Judges,12,9,"He had thirty sons. And he gave away thirty daughters in marriage, and brought in thirty daughters from elsewhere for his sons. He judged Israel seven years."
Judges,12,10,Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.
Judges,12,11,"After him, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel. He judged Israel ten years."
Judges,12,12,And Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.
Judges,12,13,"After him, Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel."
Judges,12,14,"He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy young donkeys. He judged Israel eight years."
Judges,12,15,"Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mountains of the Amalekites."
Judges,13,1,"Again the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years."
Judges,13,2,"Now there was a certain man from Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren and had no children."
Judges,13,3,"And the Angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, “Indeed now, you are barren and have borne no children, but you shall conceive and bear a son."
Judges,13,4,"Now therefore, please be careful not to drink wine or similar drink, and not to eat anything unclean."
Judges,13,5,"For behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. And no razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.”"
Judges,13,6,"So the woman came and told her husband, saying, “A Man of God came to me, and His countenance was like the countenance of the Angel of God, very awesome; but I did not ask Him where He was from, and He did not tell me His name."
Judges,13,7,"And He said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. Now drink no wine or similar drink, nor eat anything unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.’”"
Judges,13,8,"Then Manoah prayed to the LORD, and said, “O my Lord, please let the Man of God whom You sent come to us again and teach us what we shall do for the child who will be born.”"
Judges,13,9,"And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the Angel of God came to the woman again as she was sitting in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her."
Judges,13,10,"Then the woman ran in haste and told her husband, and said to him, “Look, the Man who came to me the other day has just now appeared to me!”"
Judges,13,11,"So Manoah arose and followed his wife. When he came to the Man, he said to Him, “Are You the Man who spoke to this woman?” And He said, “I am.”"
Judges,13,12,"Manoah said, “Now let Your words come to pass! What will be the boy’s rule of life, and his work?”"
Judges,13,13,"So the Angel of the LORD said to Manoah, “Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful."
Judges,13,14,"She may not eat anything that comes from the vine, nor may she drink wine or similar drink, nor eat anything unclean. All that I commanded her let her observe.”"
Judges,13,15,"Then Manoah said to the Angel of the LORD, “Please let us detain You, and we will prepare a young goat for You.”"
Judges,13,16,"And the Angel of the LORD said to Manoah, “Though you detain Me, I will not eat your food. But if you offer a burnt offering, you must offer it to the LORD.” (For Manoah did not know He was the Angel of the LORD.)"
Judges,13,17,"Then Manoah said to the Angel of the LORD, “What is Your name, that when Your words come to pass we may honor You?”"
Judges,13,18,"And the Angel of the LORD said to him, “Why do you ask My name, seeing it is wonderful?”"
Judges,13,19,"So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it upon the rock to the LORD. And He did a wondrous thing while Manoah and his wife looked on—"
Judges,13,20,"it happened as the flame went up toward heaven from the altar—the Angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar! When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell on their faces to the ground."
Judges,13,21,"When the Angel of the LORD appeared no more to Manoah and his wife, then Manoah knew that He was the Angel of the LORD."
Judges,13,22,"And Manoah said to his wife, “We shall surely die, because we have seen God!”"
Judges,13,23,"But his wife said to him, “If the LORD had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things, nor would He have told us such things as these at this time.”"
Judges,13,24,"So the woman bore a son and called his name Samson; and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him."
Judges,13,25,And the Spirit of the LORD began to move upon him at Mahaneh Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.
Judges,14,1,"Now Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines."
Judges,14,2,"So he went up and told his father and mother, saying, “I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore, get her for me as a wife.”"
Judges,14,3,"Then his father and mother said to him, “Is there no woman among the daughters of your brethren, or among all my people, that you must go and get a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?” And Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she pleases me well.”"
Judges,14,4,But his father and mother did not know that it was of the LORD—that He was seeking an occasion to move against the Philistines. For at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.
Judges,14,5,"So Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came to the vineyards of Timnah. Now to his surprise, a young lion came roaring against him."
Judges,14,6,"And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he tore the lion apart as one would have torn apart a young goat, though he had nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done."
Judges,14,7,Then he went down and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.
Judges,14,8,"After some time, when he returned to get her, he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion. And behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the carcass of the lion."
Judges,14,9,"He took some of it in his hands and went along, eating. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them, and they also ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion."
Judges,14,10,"So his father went down to the woman. And Samson gave a feast there, for young men used to do so."
Judges,14,11,"And it happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him."
Judges,14,12,"Then Samson said to them, “Let me pose a riddle to you. If you can correctly solve and explain it to me within the seven days of the feast, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing."
Judges,14,13,"But if you cannot explain it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.” And they said to him, “Pose your riddle, that we may hear it.”"
Judges,14,14,"So he said to them: “Out of the eater came something to eat, And out of the strong came something sweet.” Now for three days they could not explain the riddle."
Judges,14,15,"But it came to pass on the seventh day that they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband, that he may explain the riddle to us, or else we will burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you invited us in order to take what is ours? Is that not so?”"
Judges,14,16,"Then Samson’s wife wept on him, and said, “You only hate me! You do not love me! You have posed a riddle to the sons of my people, but you have not explained it to me.” And he said to her, “Look, I have not explained it to my father or my mother; so should I explain it to you?”"
Judges,14,17,"Now she had wept on him the seven days while their feast lasted. And it happened on the seventh day that he told her, because she pressed him so much. Then she explained the riddle to the sons of her people."
Judges,14,18,"So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down: “What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?” And he said to them: “If you had not plowed with my heifer, You would not have solved my riddle!”"
Judges,14,19,"Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of their men, took their apparel, and gave the changes of clothing to those who had explained the riddle. So his anger was aroused, and he went back up to his father’s house."
Judges,14,20,"And Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man."
Judges,15,1,"After a while, in the time of wheat harvest, it happened that Samson visited his wife with a young goat. And he said, “Let me go in to my wife, into her room.” But her father would not permit him to go in."
Judges,15,2,"Her father said, “I really thought that you thoroughly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister better than she? Please, take her instead.”"
Judges,15,3,"And Samson said to them, “This time I shall be blameless regarding the Philistines if I harm them!”"
Judges,15,4,"Then Samson went and caught three hundred foxes; and he took torches, turned the foxes tail to tail, and put a torch between each pair of tails."
Judges,15,5,"When he had set the torches on fire, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both the shocks and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves."
Judges,15,6,"Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?” And they answered, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.” So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire."
Judges,15,7,"Samson said to them, “Since you would do a thing like this, I will surely take revenge on you, and after that I will cease.”"
Judges,15,8,So he attacked them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; then he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
Judges,15,9,"Now the Philistines went up, encamped in Judah, and deployed themselves against Lehi."
Judges,15,10,"And the men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” So they answered, “We have come up to arrest Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.”"
Judges,15,11,"Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines rule over us? What is this you have done to us?” And he said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.”"
Judges,15,12,"But they said to him, “We have come down to arrest you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.” Then Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.”"
Judges,15,13,"So they spoke to him, saying, “No, but we will tie you securely and deliver you into their hand; but we will surely not kill you.” And they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock."
Judges,15,14,"When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting against him. Then the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him; and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that is burned with fire, and his bonds broke loose from his hands."
Judges,15,15,"He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and killed a thousand men with it."
Judges,15,16,"Then Samson said: “With the jawbone of a donkey, Heaps upon heaps, With the jawbone of a donkey I have slain a thousand men!”"
Judges,15,17,"And so it was, when he had finished speaking, that he threw the jawbone from his hand, and called that place Ramath Lehi."
Judges,15,18,"Then he became very thirsty; so he cried out to the LORD and said, “You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant; and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?”"
Judges,15,19,"So God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out, and he drank; and his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore he called its name En Hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day."
Judges,15,20,And he judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
Judges,16,1,"Now Samson went to Gaza and saw a harlot there, and went in to her."
Judges,16,2,"When the Gazites were told, “Samson has come here!” they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city. They were quiet all night, saying, “In the morning, when it is daylight, we will kill him.”"
Judges,16,3,"And Samson lay low till midnight; then he arose at midnight, took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two gateposts, pulled them up, bar and all, put them on his shoulders, and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron."
Judges,16,4,"Afterward it happened that he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah."
Judges,16,5,"And the lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, “Entice him, and find out where his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and every one of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”"
Judges,16,6,"So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength lies, and with what you may be bound to afflict you.”"
Judges,16,7,"And Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings, not yet dried, then I shall become weak, and be like any other man.”"
Judges,16,8,"So the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings, not yet dried, and she bound him with them."
Judges,16,9,"Now men were lying in wait, staying with her in the room. And she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he broke the bowstrings as a strand of yarn breaks when it touches fire. So the secret of his strength was not known."
Judges,16,10,"Then Delilah said to Samson, “Look, you have mocked me and told me lies. Now, please tell me what you may be bound with.”"
Judges,16,11,"So he said to her, “If they bind me securely with new ropes that have never been used, then I shall become weak, and be like any other man.”"
Judges,16,12,"Therefore Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them, and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And men were lying in wait, staying in the room. But he broke them off his arms like a thread."
Judges,16,13,"Delilah said to Samson, “Until now you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me what you may be bound with.” And he said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head into the web of the loom”—"
Judges,16,14,"So she wove it tightly with the batten of the loom, and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he awoke from his sleep, and pulled out the batten and the web from the loom."
Judges,16,15,"Then she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great strength lies.”"
Judges,16,16,"And it came to pass, when she pestered him daily with her words and pressed him, so that his soul was vexed to death,"
Judges,16,17,"that he told her all his heart, and said to her, “No razor has ever come upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaven, then my strength will leave me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.”"
Judges,16,18,"When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, “Come up once more, for he has told me all his heart.” So the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hand."
Judges,16,19,"Then she lulled him to sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him."
Judges,16,20,"And she said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” So he awoke from his sleep, and said, “I will go out as before, at other times, and shake myself free!” But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him."
Judges,16,21,"Then the Philistines took him and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza. They bound him with bronze fetters, and he became a grinder in the prison."
Judges,16,22,"However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaven."
Judges,16,23,"Now the lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice. And they said: “Our god has delivered into our hands Samson our enemy!”"
Judges,16,24,"When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said: “Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy, The destroyer of our land, And the one who multiplied our dead.”"
Judges,16,25,"So it happened, when their hearts were merry, that they said, “Call for Samson, that he may perform for us.” So they called for Samson from the prison, and he performed for them. And they stationed him between the pillars."
Judges,16,26,"Then Samson said to the lad who held him by the hand, “Let me feel the pillars which support the temple, so that I can lean on them.”"
Judges,16,27,Now the temple was full of men and women. All the lords of the Philistines were there—about three thousand men and women on the roof watching while Samson performed.
Judges,16,28,"Then Samson called to the LORD, saying, “O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray! Strengthen me, I pray, just this once, O God, that I may with one blow take vengeance on the Philistines for my two eyes!”"
Judges,16,29,"And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars which supported the temple, and he braced himself against them, one on his right and the other on his left."
Judges,16,30,"Then Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” And he pushed with all his might, and the temple fell on the lords and all the people who were in it. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than he had killed in his life."
Judges,16,31,"And his brothers and all his father’s household came down and took him, and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. He had judged Israel twenty years."
Judges,17,1,"Now there was a man from the mountains of Ephraim, whose name was Micah."
Judges,17,2,"And he said to his mother, “The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you, and on which you put a curse, even saying it in my ears—here is the silver with me; I took it.” And his mother said, “May you be blessed by the LORD, my son!”"
Judges,17,3,"So when he had returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, “I had wholly dedicated the silver from my hand to the LORD for my son, to make a carved image and a molded image; now therefore, I will return it to you.”"
Judges,17,4,"Thus he returned the silver to his mother. Then his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the silversmith, and he made it into a carved image and a molded image; and they were in the house of Micah."
Judges,17,5,"The man Micah had a shrine, and made an ephod and household idols; and he consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest."
Judges,17,6,In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
Judges,17,7,"Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah; he was a Levite, and was staying there."
Judges,17,8,"The man departed from the city of Bethlehem in Judah to stay wherever he could find a place. Then he came to the mountains of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he journeyed."
Judges,17,9,"And Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” So he said to him, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am on my way to find a place to stay.”"
Judges,17,10,"Micah said to him, “Dwell with me, and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten shekels of silver per year, a suit of clothes, and your sustenance.” So the Levite went in."
Judges,17,11,Then the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man became like one of his sons to him.
Judges,17,12,"So Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and lived in the house of Micah."
Judges,17,13,"Then Micah said, “Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, since I have a Levite as priest!”"
Judges,18,1,In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking an inheritance for itself to dwell in; for until that day their inheritance among the tribes of Israel had not fallen to them.
Judges,18,2,"So the children of Dan sent five men of their family from their territory, men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and search it. They said to them, “Go, search the land.” So they went to the mountains of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there."
Judges,18,3,"While they were at the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite. They turned aside and said to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What do you have here?”"
Judges,18,4,"He said to them, “Thus and so Micah did for me. He has hired me, and I have become his priest.”"
Judges,18,5,"So they said to him, “Please inquire of God, that we may know whether the journey on which we go will be prosperous.”"
Judges,18,6,"And the priest said to them, “Go in peace. The presence of the LORD be with you on your way.”"
Judges,18,7,"So the five men departed and went to Laish. They saw the people who were there, how they dwelt safely, in the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure. There were no rulers in the land who might put them to shame for anything. They were far from the Sidonians, and they had no ties with anyone."
Judges,18,8,"Then the spies came back to their brethren at Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brethren said to them, “What is your report?”"
Judges,18,9,"So they said, “Arise, let us go up against them. For we have seen the land, and indeed it is very good. Would you do nothing? Do not hesitate to go, and enter to possess the land."
Judges,18,10,"When you go, you will come to a secure people and a large land. For God has given it into your hands, a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth.”"
Judges,18,11,"And six hundred men of the family of the Danites went from there, from Zorah and Eshtaol, armed with weapons of war."
Judges,18,12,"Then they went up and encamped in Kirjath Jearim in Judah. (Therefore they call that place Mahaneh Dan to this day. There it is, west of Kirjath Jearim.)"
Judges,18,13,"And they passed from there to the mountains of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah."
Judges,18,14,"Then the five men who had gone to spy out the country of Laish answered and said to their brethren, “Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod, household idols, a carved image, and a molded image? Now therefore, consider what you should do.”"
Judges,18,15,"So they turned aside there, and came to the house of the young Levite man—to the house of Micah—and greeted him."
Judges,18,16,"The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate."
Judges,18,17,"Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land went up. Entering there, they took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molded image. The priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men who were armed with weapons of war."
Judges,18,18,"When these went into Micah’s house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molded image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”"
Judges,18,19,"And they said to him, “Be quiet, put your hand over your mouth, and come with us; be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest to the household of one man, or that you be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?”"
Judges,18,20,"So the priest’s heart was glad; and he took the ephod, the household idols, and the carved image, and took his place among the people."
Judges,18,21,"Then they turned and departed, and put the little ones, the livestock, and the goods in front of them."
Judges,18,22,"When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house gathered together and overtook the children of Dan."
Judges,18,23,"And they called out to the children of Dan. So they turned around and said to Micah, “What ails you, that you have gathered such a company?”"
Judges,18,24,"So he said, “You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and you have gone away. Now what more do I have? How can you say to me, ‘What ails you?’”"
Judges,18,25,"And the children of Dan said to him, “Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry men fall upon you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household!”"
Judges,18,26,"Then the children of Dan went their way. And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house."
Judges,18,27,"So they took the things Micah had made, and the priest who had belonged to him, and went to Laish, to a people quiet and secure; and they struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire."
Judges,18,28,"There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no ties with anyone. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth Rehob. So they rebuilt the city and dwelt there."
Judges,18,29,"And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel. However, the name of the city formerly was Laish."
Judges,18,30,"Then the children of Dan set up for themselves the carved image; and Jonathan the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land."
Judges,18,31,"So they set up for themselves Micah’s carved image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh."
Judges,19,1,"And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite staying in the remote mountains of Ephraim. He took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah."
Judges,19,2,"But his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her father’s house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there four whole months."
Judges,19,3,"Then her husband arose and went after her, to speak kindly to her and bring her back, having his servant and a couple of donkeys with him. So she brought him into her father’s house; and when the father of the young woman saw him, he was glad to meet him."
Judges,19,4,"Now his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, detained him; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank and lodged there."
Judges,19,5,"Then it came to pass on the fourth day that they arose early in the morning, and he stood to depart; but the young woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Refresh your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.”"
Judges,19,6,"So they sat down, and the two of them ate and drank together. Then the young woman’s father said to the man, “Please be content to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.”"
Judges,19,7,"And when the man stood to depart, his father-in-law urged him; so he lodged there again."
Judges,19,8,"Then he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart, but the young woman’s father said, “Please refresh your heart.” So they delayed until afternoon; and both of them ate."
Judges,19,9,"And when the man stood to depart—he and his concubine and his servant—his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, said to him, “Look, the day is now drawing toward evening; please spend the night. See, the day is coming to an end; lodge here, that your heart may be merry. Tomorrow go your way early, so that you may get home.”"
Judges,19,10,"However, the man was not willing to spend that night; so he rose and departed, and came opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). With him were the two saddled donkeys; his concubine was also with him."
Judges,19,11,"They were near Jebus, and the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, “Come, please, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it.”"
Judges,19,12,"But his master said to him, “We will not turn aside here into a city of foreigners, who are not of the children of Israel; we will go on to Gibeah.”"
Judges,19,13,"So he said to his servant, “Come, let us draw near to one of these places, and spend the night in Gibeah or in Ramah.”"
Judges,19,14,"And they passed by and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin."
Judges,19,15,"They turned aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah. And when he went in, he sat down in the open square of the city, for no one would take them into his house to spend the night."
Judges,19,16,"Just then an old man came in from his work in the field at evening, who also was from the mountains of Ephraim; he was staying in Gibeah, whereas the men of the place were Benjamites."
Judges,19,17,"And when he raised his eyes, he saw the traveler in the open square of the city; and the old man said, “Where are you going, and where do you come from?”"
Judges,19,18,"So he said to him, “We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah toward the remote mountains of Ephraim; I am from there. I went to Bethlehem in Judah; now I am going to the house of the LORD. But there is no one who will take me into his house,"
Judges,19,19,"although we have both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for myself, for your female servant, and for the young man who is with your servant; there is no lack of anything.”"
Judges,19,20,"And the old man said, “Peace be with you! However, let all your needs be my responsibility; only do not spend the night in the open square.”"
Judges,19,21,"So he brought him into his house, and gave fodder to the donkeys. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank."
Judges,19,22,"As they were enjoying themselves, suddenly certain men of the city, perverted men, surrounded the house and beat on the door. They spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, “Bring out the man who came to your house, that we may know him carnally!”"
Judges,19,23,"But the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, “No, my brethren! I beg you, do not act so wickedly! Seeing this man has come into my house, do not commit this outrage."
Judges,19,24,"Look, here is my virgin daughter and the man’s concubine; let me bring them out now. Humble them, and do with them as you please; but to this man do not do such a vile thing!”"
Judges,19,25,"But the men would not heed him. So the man took his concubine and brought her out to them. And they knew her and abused her all night until morning; and when the day began to break, they let her go."
Judges,19,26,"Then the woman came as the day was dawning, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her master was, till it was light."
Judges,19,27,"When her master arose in the morning, and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way, there was his concubine, fallen at the door of the house with her hands on the threshold."
Judges,19,28,"And he said to her, “Get up and let us be going.” But there was no answer. So the man lifted her onto the donkey; and the man got up and went to his place."
Judges,19,29,"When he entered his house he took a knife, laid hold of his concubine, and divided her into twelve pieces, limb by limb, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel."
Judges,19,30,"And so it was that all who saw it said, “No such deed has been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up from the land of Egypt until this day. Consider it, confer, and speak up!”"
Judges,20,1,"So all the children of Israel came out, from Dan to Beersheba, as well as from the land of Gilead, and the congregation gathered together as one man before the LORD at Mizpah."
Judges,20,2,"And the leaders of all the people, all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand foot soldiers who drew the sword."
Judges,20,3,"(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) Then the children of Israel said, “Tell us, how did this wicked deed happen?”"
Judges,20,4,"So the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, “My concubine and I went into Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, to spend the night."
Judges,20,5,"And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house at night because of me. They intended to kill me, but instead they ravished my concubine so that she died."
Judges,20,6,"So I took hold of my concubine, cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of the inheritance of Israel, because they committed lewdness and outrage in Israel."
Judges,20,7,Look! All of you are children of Israel; give your advice and counsel here and now!”
Judges,20,8,"So all the people arose as one man, saying, “None of us will go to his tent, nor will any turn back to his house;"
Judges,20,9,but now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: We will go up against it by lot.
Judges,20,10,"We will take ten men out of every hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to make provisions for the people, that when they come to Gibeah in Benjamin, they may repay all the vileness that they have done in Israel.”"
Judges,20,11,"So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united together as one man."
Judges,20,12,"Then the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this wickedness that has occurred among you?"
Judges,20,13,"Now therefore, deliver up the men, the perverted men who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and remove the evil from Israel!” But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brethren, the children of Israel."
Judges,20,14,"Instead, the children of Benjamin gathered together from their cities to Gibeah, to go to battle against the children of Israel."
Judges,20,15,"And from their cities at that time the children of Benjamin numbered twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered seven hundred select men."
Judges,20,16,Among all this people were seven hundred select men who were left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair’s breadth and not miss.
Judges,20,17,"Now besides Benjamin, the men of Israel numbered four hundred thousand men who drew the sword; all of these were men of war."
Judges,20,18,"Then the children of Israel arose and went up to the house of God to inquire of God. They said, “Which of us shall go up first to battle against the children of Benjamin?” The LORD said, “Judah first!”"
Judges,20,19,So the children of Israel rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.
Judges,20,20,"And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel put themselves in battle array to fight against them at Gibeah."
Judges,20,21,"Then the children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and on that day cut down to the ground twenty-two thousand men of the Israelites."
Judges,20,22,"And the people, that is, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and again formed the battle line at the place where they had put themselves in array on the first day."
Judges,20,23,"Then the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, “Shall I again draw near for battle against the children of my brother Benjamin?” And the LORD said, “Go up against him.”"
Judges,20,24,So the children of Israel approached the children of Benjamin on the second day.
Judges,20,25,"And Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah on the second day, and cut down to the ground eighteen thousand more of the children of Israel; all these drew the sword."
Judges,20,26,"Then all the children of Israel, that is, all the people, went up and came to the house of God and wept. They sat there before the LORD and fasted that day until evening; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD."
Judges,20,27,"So the children of Israel inquired of the LORD (the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,"
Judges,20,28,"and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, “Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of my brother Benjamin, or shall I cease?” And the LORD said, “Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.”"
Judges,20,29,Then Israel set men in ambush all around Gibeah.
Judges,20,30,"And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in battle array against Gibeah as at the other times."
Judges,20,31,"So the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city. They began to strike down and kill some of the people, as at the other times, in the highways (one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah) and in the field, about thirty men of Israel."
Judges,20,32,"And the children of Benjamin said, “They are defeated before us, as at first.” But the children of Israel said, “Let us flee and draw them away from the city to the highways.”"
Judges,20,33,So all the men of Israel rose from their place and put themselves in battle array at Baal Tamar. Then Israel’s men in ambush burst forth from their position in the plain of Geba.
Judges,20,34,"And ten thousand select men from all Israel came against Gibeah, and the battle was fierce. But the Benjamites did not know that disaster was upon them."
Judges,20,35,The LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel. And the children of Israel destroyed that day twenty-five thousand one hundred Benjamites; all these drew the sword.
Judges,20,36,"So the children of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. The men of Israel had given ground to the Benjamites, because they relied on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah."
Judges,20,37,And the men in ambush quickly rushed upon Gibeah; the men in ambush spread out and struck the whole city with the edge of the sword.
Judges,20,38,"Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise up from the city,"
Judges,20,39,"whereupon the men of Israel would turn in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty of the men of Israel. For they said, “Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle.”"
Judges,20,40,"But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and there was the whole city going up in smoke to heaven."
Judges,20,41,"And when the men of Israel turned back, the men of Benjamin panicked, for they saw that disaster had come upon them."
Judges,20,42,"Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them, and whoever came out of the cities they destroyed in their midst."
Judges,20,43,"They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, and easily trampled them down as far as the front of Gibeah toward the east."
Judges,20,44,And eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all these were men of valor.
Judges,20,45,"Then they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon; and they cut down five thousand of them on the highways. Then they pursued them relentlessly up to Gidom, and killed two thousand of them."
Judges,20,46,So all who fell of Benjamin that day were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these were men of valor.
Judges,20,47,"But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they stayed at the rock of Rimmon for four months."
Judges,20,48,"And the men of Israel turned back against the children of Benjamin, and struck them down with the edge of the sword—from every city, men and beasts, all who were found. They also set fire to all the cities they came to."
Judges,21,1,"Now the men of Israel had sworn an oath at Mizpah, saying, “None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife.”"
Judges,21,2,"Then the people came to the house of God, and remained there before God till evening. They lifted up their voices and wept bitterly,"
Judges,21,3,"and said, “O LORD God of Israel, why has this come to pass in Israel, that today there should be one tribe missing in Israel?”"
Judges,21,4,"So it was, on the next morning, that the people rose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings."
Judges,21,5,"The children of Israel said, “Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up with the assembly to the LORD?” For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who had not come up to the LORD at Mizpah, saying, “He shall surely be put to death.”"
Judges,21,6,"And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, “One tribe is cut off from Israel today."
Judges,21,7,"What shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them our daughters as wives?”"
Judges,21,8,"And they said, “What one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to the LORD?” And, in fact, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly."
Judges,21,9,"For when the people were counted, indeed, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead was there."
Judges,21,10,"So the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children."
Judges,21,11,"And this is the thing that you shall do: You shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has known a man intimately.”"
Judges,21,12,"So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan."
Judges,21,13,"Then the whole congregation sent word to the children of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and announced peace to them."
Judges,21,14,"So Benjamin came back at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead; and yet they had not found enough for them."
Judges,21,15,"And the people grieved for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a void in the tribes of Israel."
Judges,21,16,"Then the elders of the congregation said, “What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?”"
Judges,21,17,"And they said, “There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel."
Judges,21,18,"However, we cannot give them wives from our daughters, for the children of Israel have sworn an oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.’”"
Judges,21,19,"Then they said, “In fact, there is a yearly feast of the LORD in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.”"
Judges,21,20,"Therefore they instructed the children of Benjamin, saying, “Go, lie in wait in the vineyards,"
Judges,21,21,"and watch; and just when the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then come out from the vineyards, and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh; then go to the land of Benjamin."
Judges,21,22,"Then it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, ‘Be kind to them for our sakes, because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war; for it is not as though you have given the women to them at this time, making yourselves guilty of your oath.’”"
Judges,21,23,"And the children of Benjamin did so; they took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they caught. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them."
Judges,21,24,"So the children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family; they went out from there, every man to his inheritance."
Judges,21,25,In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
Ruth,1,1,"Now it came to pass, in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem, Judah, went to dwell in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons."
Ruth,1,2,"The name of the man was Elimelech, the name of his wife was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion—Ephrathites of Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to the country of Moab and remained there."
Ruth,1,3,"Then Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons."
Ruth,1,4,"Now they took wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years."
Ruth,1,5,Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died; so the woman survived her two sons and her husband.
Ruth,1,6,"Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the LORD had visited His people by giving them bread."
Ruth,1,7,"Therefore she went out from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah."
Ruth,1,8,"And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each to her mother’s house. The LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me."
Ruth,1,9,"The LORD grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband.” So she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept."
Ruth,1,10,"And they said to her, “Surely we will return with you to your people.”"
Ruth,1,11,"But Naomi said, “Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? Are there still sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?"
Ruth,1,12,"Turn back, my daughters, go—for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, if I should have a husband tonight and should also bear sons,"
Ruth,1,13,"would you wait for them till they were grown? Would you restrain yourselves from having husbands? No, my daughters; for it grieves me very much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me!”"
Ruth,1,14,"Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her."
Ruth,1,15,"And she said, “Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.”"
Ruth,1,16,"But Ruth said: “Entreat me not to leave you, Or to turn back from following after you; For wherever you go, I will go; And wherever you lodge, I will lodge; Your people shall be my people, And your God, my God."
Ruth,1,17,"Where you die, I will die, And there will I be buried. The LORD do so to me, and more also, If anything but death parts you and me.”"
Ruth,1,18,"When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped speaking to her."
Ruth,1,19,"Now the two of them went until they came to Bethlehem. And it happened, when they had come to Bethlehem, that all the city was excited because of them; and the women said, “Is this Naomi?”"
Ruth,1,20,"But she said to them, “Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me."
Ruth,1,21,"I went out full, and the LORD has brought me home again empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the LORD has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?”"
Ruth,1,22,"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab. Now they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest."
Ruth,2,1,"There was a relative of Naomi’s husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech. His name was Boaz."
Ruth,2,2,"So Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field, and glean heads of grain after him in whose sight I may find favor.” And she said to her, “Go, my daughter.”"
Ruth,2,3,"Then she left, and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech."
Ruth,2,4,"Now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, “The LORD be with you!” And they answered him, “The LORD bless you!”"
Ruth,2,5,"Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, “Whose young woman is this?”"
Ruth,2,6,"So the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered and said, “It is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab."
Ruth,2,7,"And she said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came and has continued from morning until now, though she rested a little in the house.”"
Ruth,2,8,"Then Boaz said to Ruth, “You will listen, my daughter, will you not? Do not go to glean in another field, nor go from here, but stay close by my young women."
Ruth,2,9,"Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them. Have I not commanded the young men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink from what the young men have drawn.”"
Ruth,2,10,"So she fell on her face, bowed down to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?”"
Ruth,2,11,"And Boaz answered and said to her, “It has been fully reported to me, all that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and have come to a people whom you did not know before."
Ruth,2,12,"The LORD repay your work, and a full reward be given you by the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge.”"
Ruth,2,13,"Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord; for you have comforted me, and have spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not like one of your maidservants.”"
Ruth,2,14,"Now Boaz said to her at mealtime, “Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed parched grain to her; and she ate and was satisfied, and kept some back."
Ruth,2,15,"And when she rose up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her."
Ruth,2,16,"Also let grain from the bundles fall purposely for her; leave it that she may glean, and do not rebuke her.”"
Ruth,2,17,"So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley."
Ruth,2,18,"Then she took it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. So she brought out and gave to her what she had kept back after she had been satisfied."
Ruth,2,19,"And her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? And where did you work? Blessed be the one who took notice of you.” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, “The man’s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.”"
Ruth,2,20,"Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “Blessed be he of the LORD, who has not forsaken His kindness to the living and the dead!” And Naomi said to her, “This man is a relation of ours, one of our close relatives.”"
Ruth,2,21,"Ruth the Moabitess said, “He also said to me, ‘You shall stay close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’”"
Ruth,2,22,"And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, and that people do not meet you in any other field.”"
Ruth,2,23,"So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz, to glean until the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law."
Ruth,3,1,"Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, shall I not seek security for you, that it may be well with you?"
Ruth,3,2,"Now Boaz, whose young women you were with, is he not our relative? In fact, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor."
Ruth,3,3,"Therefore wash yourself and anoint yourself, put on your best garment and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking."
Ruth,3,4,"Then it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies; and you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lie down; and he will tell you what you should do.”"
Ruth,3,5,"And she said to her, “All that you say to me I will do.”"
Ruth,3,6,So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law instructed her.
Ruth,3,7,"And after Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was cheerful, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came softly, uncovered his feet, and lay down."
Ruth,3,8,"Now it happened at midnight that the man was startled, and turned himself; and there, a woman was lying at his feet."
Ruth,3,9,"And he said, “Who are you?” So she answered, “I am Ruth, your maidservant. Take your maidservant under your wing, for you are a close relative.”"
Ruth,3,10,"Then he said, “Blessed are you of the LORD, my daughter! For you have shown more kindness at the end than at the beginning, in that you did not go after young men, whether poor or rich."
Ruth,3,11,"And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you request, for all the people of my town know that you are a virtuous woman."
Ruth,3,12,"Now it is true that I am a close relative; however, there is a relative closer than I."
Ruth,3,13,"Stay this night, and in the morning it shall be that if he will perform the duty of a close relative for you—good; let him do it. But if he does not want to perform the duty for you, then I will perform the duty for you, as the LORD lives! Lie down until morning.”"
Ruth,3,14,"So she lay at his feet until morning, and she arose before one could recognize another. Then he said, “Do not let it be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.”"
Ruth,3,15,"Also he said, “Bring the shawl that is on you and hold it.” And when she held it, he measured six ephahs of barley, and laid it on her. Then she went into the city."
Ruth,3,16,"When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “Is that you, my daughter?” Then she told her all that the man had done for her."
Ruth,3,17,"And she said, “These six ephahs of barley he gave me; for he said to me, ‘Do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law.’”"
Ruth,3,18,"Then she said, “Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will turn out; for the man will not rest until he has concluded the matter this day.”"
Ruth,4,1,"Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there; and behold, the close relative of whom Boaz had spoken came by. So Boaz said, “Come aside, friend, sit down here.” So he came aside and sat down."
Ruth,4,2,"And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down."
Ruth,4,3,"Then he said to the close relative, “Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, sold the piece of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech."
Ruth,4,4,"And I thought to inform you, saying, ‘Buy it back in the presence of the inhabitants and the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you.’” And he said, “I will redeem it.”"
Ruth,4,5,"Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also buy it from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance.”"
Ruth,4,6,"And the close relative said, “I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I ruin my own inheritance. You redeem my right of redemption for yourself, for I cannot redeem it.”"
Ruth,4,7,"Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging, to confirm anything: one man took off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was a confirmation in Israel."
Ruth,4,8,"Therefore the close relative said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself.” So he took off his sandal."
Ruth,4,9,"And Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, from the hand of Naomi."
Ruth,4,10,"Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have acquired as my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from his position at the gate. You are witnesses this day.”"
Ruth,4,11,"And all the people who were at the gate, and the elders, said, “We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman who is coming to your house like Rachel and Leah, the two who built the house of Israel; and may you prosper in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem."
Ruth,4,12,"May your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring which the LORD will give you from this young woman.”"
Ruth,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife; and when he went in to her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son."
Ruth,4,14,"Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without a close relative; and may his name be famous in Israel!"
Ruth,4,15,"And may he be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.”"
Ruth,4,16,"Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her bosom, and became a nurse to him."
Ruth,4,17,"Also the neighbor women gave him a name, saying, “There is a son born to Naomi.” And they called his name Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David."
Ruth,4,18,Now this is the genealogy of Perez: Perez begot Hezron;
Ruth,4,19,"Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab;"
Ruth,4,20,"Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon;"
Ruth,4,21,"Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed;"
Ruth,4,22,"Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David."
1 Samuel,1,1,"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the mountains of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite."
1 Samuel,1,2,"And he had two wives: the name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children."
1 Samuel,1,3,"This man went up from his city yearly to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. Also the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there."
1 Samuel,1,4,"And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters."
1 Samuel,1,5,"But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah, although the LORD had closed her womb."
1 Samuel,1,6,"And her rival also provoked her severely, to make her miserable, because the LORD had closed her womb."
1 Samuel,1,7,"So it was, year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, that she provoked her; therefore she wept and did not eat."
1 Samuel,1,8,"Then Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? And why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”"
1 Samuel,1,9,So Hannah arose after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the tabernacle of the LORD.
1 Samuel,1,10,"And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD and wept in anguish."
1 Samuel,1,11,"Then she made a vow and said, “O LORD of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maidservant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.”"
1 Samuel,1,12,"And it happened, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli watched her mouth."
1 Samuel,1,13,"Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk."
1 Samuel,1,14,"So Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away from you!”"
1 Samuel,1,15,"But Hannah answered and said, “No, my lord, I am a woman of sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD."
1 Samuel,1,16,"“Do not consider your maidservant a wicked woman, for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief I have spoken until now.”"
1 Samuel,1,17,"Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition which you have asked of Him.”"
1 Samuel,1,18,"And she said, “Let your maidservant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad."
1 Samuel,1,19,"Then they rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her."
1 Samuel,1,20,"So it came to pass in the process of time that Hannah conceived and bore a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, “Because I have asked for him from the LORD.”"
1 Samuel,1,21,Now the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and his vow.
1 Samuel,1,22,"But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “Not until the child is weaned; then I will take him, that he may appear before the LORD and remain there forever.”"
1 Samuel,1,23,"So Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him. Only let the LORD establish His word.” Then the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him."
1 Samuel,1,24,"Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh. And the child was young."
1 Samuel,1,25,"Then they slaughtered a bull, and brought the child to Eli."
1 Samuel,1,26,"And she said, “O my lord! As your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to the LORD."
1 Samuel,1,27,"For this child I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my petition which I asked of Him."
1 Samuel,1,28,Therefore I also have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the LORD.” So they worshiped the LORD there.
1 Samuel,2,1,"And Hannah prayed and said: “My heart rejoices in the LORD; My horn is exalted in the LORD. I smile at my enemies, Because I rejoice in Your salvation."
1 Samuel,2,2,"“No one is holy like the LORD, For there is none besides You, Nor is there any rock like our God."
1 Samuel,2,3,"“Talk no more so very proudly; Let no arrogance come from your mouth, For the LORD is the God of knowledge; And by Him actions are weighed."
1 Samuel,2,4,"“The bows of the mighty men are broken, And those who stumbled are girded with strength."
1 Samuel,2,5,"Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, And the hungry have ceased to hunger. Even the barren has borne seven, And she who has many children has become feeble."
1 Samuel,2,6,“The LORD kills and makes alive; He brings down to the grave and brings up.
1 Samuel,2,7,The LORD makes poor and makes rich; He brings low and lifts up.
1 Samuel,2,8,"He raises the poor from the dust And lifts the beggar from the ash heap, To set them among princes And make them inherit the throne of glory. “For the pillars of the earth are the LORD’s, And He has set the world upon them."
1 Samuel,2,9,"He will guard the feet of His saints, But the wicked shall be silent in darkness. “For by strength no man shall prevail."
1 Samuel,2,10,"The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken in pieces; From heaven He will thunder against them. The LORD will judge the ends of the earth. “He will give strength to His king, And exalt the horn of His anointed.”"
1 Samuel,2,11,Then Elkanah went to his house at Ramah. But the child ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest.
1 Samuel,2,12,Now the sons of Eli were corrupt; they did not know the LORD.
1 Samuel,2,13,"And the priests’ custom with the people was that when any man offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged fleshhook in his hand while the meat was boiling."
1 Samuel,2,14,"Then he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; and the priest would take for himself all that the fleshhook brought up. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there."
1 Samuel,2,15,"Also, before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant would come and say to the man who sacrificed, “Give meat for roasting to the priest, for he will not take boiled meat from you, but raw.”"
1 Samuel,2,16,"And if the man said to him, “They should really burn the fat first; then you may take as much as your heart desires,” he would then answer him, “No, but you must give it now; and if not, I will take it by force.”"
1 Samuel,2,17,"Therefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD, for men abhorred the offering of the LORD."
1 Samuel,2,18,"But Samuel ministered before the LORD, even as a child, wearing a linen ephod."
1 Samuel,2,19,"Moreover his mother used to make him a little robe, and bring it to him year by year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice."
1 Samuel,2,20,"And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, “The LORD give you descendants from this woman for the loan that was given to the LORD.” Then they would go to their own home."
1 Samuel,2,21,"And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile the child Samuel grew before the LORD."
1 Samuel,2,22,"Now Eli was very old; and he heard everything his sons did to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who assembled at the door of the tabernacle of meeting."
1 Samuel,2,23,"So he said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people."
1 Samuel,2,24,"No, my sons! For it is not a good report that I hear. You make the LORD’s people transgress."
1 Samuel,2,25,"If one man sins against another, God will judge him. But if a man sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?” Nevertheless they did not heed the voice of their father, because the LORD desired to kill them."
1 Samuel,2,26,"And the child Samuel grew in stature, and in favor both with the LORD and men."
1 Samuel,2,27,"Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Did I not clearly reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?"
1 Samuel,2,28,"Did I not choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to offer upon My altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod before Me? And did I not give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?"
1 Samuel,2,29,"Why do you kick at My sacrifice and My offering which I have commanded in My dwelling place, and honor your sons more than Me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people?’"
1 Samuel,2,30,"Therefore the LORD God of Israel says: ‘I said indeed that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever.’ But now the LORD says: ‘Far be it from Me; for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me shall be lightly esteemed."
1 Samuel,2,31,"Behold, the days are coming that I will cut off your arm and the arm of your father’s house, so that there will not be an old man in your house."
1 Samuel,2,32,"And you will see an enemy in My dwelling place, despite all the good which God does for Israel. And there shall not be an old man in your house forever."
1 Samuel,2,33,But any of your men whom I do not cut off from My altar shall consume your eyes and grieve your heart. And all the descendants of your house shall die in the flower of their age.
1 Samuel,2,34,"Now this shall be a sign to you that will come upon your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die, both of them."
1 Samuel,2,35,"Then I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who shall do according to what is in My heart and in My mind. I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before My anointed forever."
1 Samuel,2,36,"And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and say, “Please, put me in one of the priestly positions, that I may eat a piece of bread.”’”"
1 Samuel,3,1,Now the boy Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was rare in those days; there was no widespread revelation.
1 Samuel,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time, while Eli was lying down in his place, and when his eyes had begun to grow so dim that he could not see,"
1 Samuel,3,3,"and before the lamp of God went out in the tabernacle of the LORD where the ark of God was, and while Samuel was lying down,"
1 Samuel,3,4,"that the LORD called Samuel. And he answered, “Here I am!”"
1 Samuel,3,5,"So he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” And he said, “I did not call; lie down again.” And he went and lay down."
1 Samuel,3,6,"Then the LORD called yet again, “Samuel!” So Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” He answered, “I did not call, my son; lie down again.”"
1 Samuel,3,7,"(Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, nor was the word of the LORD yet revealed to him.)"
1 Samuel,3,8,"And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. So he arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you did call me.” Then Eli perceived that the LORD had called the boy."
1 Samuel,3,9,"Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down; and it shall be, if He calls you, that you must say, ‘Speak, LORD, for Your servant hears.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place."
1 Samuel,3,10,"Now the LORD came and stood and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel answered, “Speak, for Your servant hears.”"
1 Samuel,3,11,"Then the LORD said to Samuel: “Behold, I will do something in Israel at which both ears of everyone who hears it will tingle."
1 Samuel,3,12,"In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end."
1 Samuel,3,13,"For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knows, because his sons made themselves vile, and he did not restrain them."
1 Samuel,3,14,And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.”
1 Samuel,3,15,"So Samuel lay down until morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel was afraid to tell Eli the vision."
1 Samuel,3,16,"Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!” He answered, “Here I am.”"
1 Samuel,3,17,"And he said, “What is the word that the LORD spoke to you? Please do not hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that He said to you.”"
1 Samuel,3,18,"Then Samuel told him everything, and hid nothing from him. And he said, “It is the LORD. Let Him do what seems good to Him.”"
1 Samuel,3,19,"So Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground."
1 Samuel,3,20,And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel had been established as a prophet of the LORD.
1 Samuel,3,21,Then the LORD appeared again in Shiloh. For the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
1 Samuel,4,1,"Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines, and encamped beside Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek."
1 Samuel,4,2,"Then the Philistines put themselves in battle array against Israel. And when they joined battle, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men of the army in the field."
1 Samuel,4,3,"And when the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Shiloh to us, that when it comes among us it may save us from the hand of our enemies.”"
1 Samuel,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who dwells between the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God."
1 Samuel,4,5,"And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted so loudly that the earth shook."
1 Samuel,4,6,"Now when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does the sound of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” Then they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp."
1 Samuel,4,7,"So the Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp!” And they said, “Woe to us! For such a thing has never happened before."
1 Samuel,4,8,Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
1 Samuel,4,9,"Be strong and conduct yourselves like men, you Philistines, that you do not become servants of the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Conduct yourselves like men, and fight!”"
1 Samuel,4,10,"So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent. There was a very great slaughter, and there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers."
1 Samuel,4,11,"Also the ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died."
1 Samuel,4,12,"Then a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line the same day, and came to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dirt on his head."
1 Samuel,4,13,"Now when he came, there was Eli, sitting on a seat by the wayside watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told it, all the city cried out."
1 Samuel,4,14,"When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, “What does the sound of this tumult mean?” And the man came quickly and told Eli."
1 Samuel,4,15,"Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were so dim that he could not see."
1 Samuel,4,16,"Then the man said to Eli, “I am he who came from the battle. And I fled today from the battle line.” And he said, “What happened, my son?”"
1 Samuel,4,17,"So the messenger answered and said, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead; and the ark of God has been captured.”"
1 Samuel,4,18,"Then it happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell off the seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for the man was old and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years."
1 Samuel,4,19,"Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’s wife, was with child, due to be delivered; and when she heard the news that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth, for her labor pains came upon her."
1 Samuel,4,20,"And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, “Do not fear, for you have borne a son.” But she did not answer, nor did she regard it."
1 Samuel,4,21,"Then she named the child Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel!” because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband."
1 Samuel,4,22,"And she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.”"
1 Samuel,5,1,Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
1 Samuel,5,2,"When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon and set it by Dagon."
1 Samuel,5,3,"And when the people of Ashdod arose early in the morning, there was Dagon, fallen on its face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and set it in its place again."
1 Samuel,5,4,"And when they arose early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen on its face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. The head of Dagon and both the palms of its hands were broken off on the threshold; only Dagon’s torso was left of it."
1 Samuel,5,5,Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any who come into Dagon’s house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
1 Samuel,5,6,"But the hand of the LORD was heavy on the people of Ashdod, and He ravaged them and struck them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territory."
1 Samuel,5,7,"And when the men of Ashdod saw how it was, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for His hand is harsh toward us and Dagon our god.”"
1 Samuel,5,8,"Therefore they sent and gathered to themselves all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” And they answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried away to Gath.” So they carried the ark of the God of Israel away."
1 Samuel,5,9,"So it was, after they had carried it away, that the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction; and He struck the men of the city, both small and great, and tumors broke out on them."
1 Samuel,5,10,"Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. So it was, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people!”"
1 Samuel,5,11,"So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go back to its own place, so that it does not kill us and our people.” For there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there."
1 Samuel,5,12,"And the men who did not die were stricken with the tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven."
1 Samuel,6,1,Now the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
1 Samuel,6,2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, “What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how we should send it to its place.”"
1 Samuel,6,3,"So they said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty; but by all means return it to Him with a trespass offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.”"
1 Samuel,6,4,"Then they said, “What is the trespass offering which we shall return to Him?” They answered, “Five golden tumors and five golden rats, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines. For the same plague was on all of you and on your lords."
1 Samuel,6,5,"Therefore you shall make images of your tumors and images of your rats that ravage the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will lighten His hand from you, from your gods, and from your land."
1 Samuel,6,6,"Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He did mighty things among them, did they not let the people go, that they might depart?"
1 Samuel,6,7,"Now therefore, make a new cart, take two milk cows which have never been yoked, and hitch the cows to the cart; and take their calves home, away from them."
1 Samuel,6,8,"Then take the ark of the LORD and set it on the cart; and put the articles of gold which you are returning to Him as a trespass offering in a chest by its side. Then send it away, and let it go."
1 Samuel,6,9,"And watch: if it goes up the road to its own territory, to Beth Shemesh, then He has done us this great evil. But if not, then we shall know that it is not His hand that struck us—it happened to us by chance.”"
1 Samuel,6,10,"Then the men did so; they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home."
1 Samuel,6,11,"And they set the ark of the LORD on the cart, and the chest with the gold rats and the images of their tumors."
1 Samuel,6,12,"Then the cows headed straight for the road to Beth Shemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn aside to the right hand or the left. And the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh."
1 Samuel,6,13,"Now the people of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it."
1 Samuel,6,14,"Then the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there; a large stone was there. So they split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD."
1 Samuel,6,15,"The Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the chest that was with it, in which were the articles of gold, and put them on the large stone. Then the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices the same day to the LORD."
1 Samuel,6,16,"So when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day."
1 Samuel,6,17,"These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned as a trespass offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron;"
1 Samuel,6,18,"and the golden rats, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both fortified cities and country villages, even as far as the large stone of Abel on which they set the ark of the LORD, which stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh."
1 Samuel,6,19,"Then He struck the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD. He struck fifty thousand and seventy men of the people, and the people lamented because the LORD had struck the people with a great slaughter."
1 Samuel,6,20,"And the men of Beth Shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? And to whom shall it go up from us?”"
1 Samuel,6,21,"So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back the ark of the LORD; come down and take it up with you.”"
1 Samuel,7,1,"Then the men of Kirjath Jearim came and took the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD."
1 Samuel,7,2,So it was that the ark remained in Kirjath Jearim a long time; it was there twenty years. And all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.
1 Samuel,7,3,"Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If you return to the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths from among you, and prepare your hearts for the LORD, and serve Him only; and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.”"
1 Samuel,7,4,"So the children of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtoreths, and served the LORD only."
1 Samuel,7,5,"And Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for you.”"
1 Samuel,7,6,"So they gathered together at Mizpah, drew water, and poured it out before the LORD. And they fasted that day, and said there, “We have sinned against the LORD.” And Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpah."
1 Samuel,7,7,"Now when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel had gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines."
1 Samuel,7,8,"So the children of Israel said to Samuel, “Do not cease to cry out to the LORD our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines.”"
1 Samuel,7,9,"And Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. Then Samuel cried out to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him."
1 Samuel,7,10,"Now as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But the LORD thundered with a loud thunder upon the Philistines that day, and so confused them that they were overcome before Israel."
1 Samuel,7,11,"And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and drove them back as far as below Beth Car."
1 Samuel,7,12,"Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer, saying, “Thus far the LORD has helped us.”"
1 Samuel,7,13,"So the Philistines were subdued, and they did not come anymore into the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel."
1 Samuel,7,14,"Then the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel recovered its territory from the hands of the Philistines. Also there was peace between Israel and the Amorites."
1 Samuel,7,15,And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
1 Samuel,7,16,"He went from year to year on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and judged Israel in all those places."
1 Samuel,7,17,"But he always returned to Ramah, for his home was there. There he judged Israel, and there he built an altar to the LORD."
1 Samuel,8,1,Now it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons judges over Israel.
1 Samuel,8,2,"The name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba."
1 Samuel,8,3,"But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice."
1 Samuel,8,4,"Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah,"
1 Samuel,8,5,"and said to him, “Look, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.”"
1 Samuel,8,6,"But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” So Samuel prayed to the LORD."
1 Samuel,8,7,"And the LORD said to Samuel, “Heed the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them."
1 Samuel,8,8,"According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even to this day—with which they have forsaken Me and served other gods—so they are doing to you also."
1 Samuel,8,9,"Now therefore, heed their voice. However, you shall solemnly forewarn them, and show them the behavior of the king who will reign over them.”"
1 Samuel,8,10,So Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who asked him for a king.
1 Samuel,8,11,"And he said, “This will be the behavior of the king who will reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint them for his own chariots and to be his horsemen, and some will run before his chariots."
1 Samuel,8,12,"He will appoint captains over his thousands and captains over his fifties, will set some to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and some to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots."
1 Samuel,8,13,"He will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers."
1 Samuel,8,14,"And he will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give them to his servants."
1 Samuel,8,15,"He will take a tenth of your grain and your vintage, and give it to his officers and servants."
1 Samuel,8,16,"And he will take your male servants, your female servants, your finest young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his work."
1 Samuel,8,17,He will take a tenth of your sheep. And you will be his servants.
1 Samuel,8,18,"And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, and the LORD will not hear you in that day.”"
1 Samuel,8,19,"Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, “No, but we will have a king over us,"
1 Samuel,8,20,"that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.”"
1 Samuel,8,21,"And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he repeated them in the hearing of the LORD."
1 Samuel,8,22,"So the LORD said to Samuel, “Heed their voice, and make them a king.” And Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Every man go to his city.”"
1 Samuel,9,1,"There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power."
1 Samuel,9,2,And he had a choice and handsome son whose name was Saul. There was not a more handsome person than he among the children of Israel. From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.
1 Samuel,9,3,"Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. And Kish said to his son Saul, “Please take one of the servants with you, and arise, go and look for the donkeys.”"
1 Samuel,9,4,"So he passed through the mountains of Ephraim and through the land of Shalisha, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there. Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them."
1 Samuel,9,5,"When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us return, lest my father cease caring about the donkeys and become worried about us.”"
1 Samuel,9,6,"And he said to him, “Look now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he says surely comes to pass. So let us go there; perhaps he can show us the way that we should go.”"
1 Samuel,9,7,"Then Saul said to his servant, “But look, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread in our vessels is all gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?”"
1 Samuel,9,8,"And the servant answered Saul again and said, “Look, I have here at hand one-fourth of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way.”"
1 Samuel,9,9,"(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he spoke thus: “Come, let us go to the seer”; for he who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.)"
1 Samuel,9,10,"Then Saul said to his servant, “Well said; come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was."
1 Samuel,9,11,"As they went up the hill to the city, they met some young women going out to draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer here?”"
1 Samuel,9,12,"And they answered them and said, “Yes, there he is, just ahead of you. Hurry now; for today he came to this city, because there is a sacrifice of the people today on the high place."
1 Samuel,9,13,"As soon as you come into the city, you will surely find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now therefore, go up, for about this time you will find him.”"
1 Samuel,9,14,"So they went up to the city. As they were coming into the city, there was Samuel, coming out toward them on his way up to the high place."
1 Samuel,9,15,"Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear the day before Saul came, saying,"
1 Samuel,9,16,"“Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him commander over My people Israel, that he may save My people from the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon My people, because their cry has come to Me.”"
1 Samuel,9,17,"So when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, “There he is, the man of whom I spoke to you. This one shall reign over My people.”"
1 Samuel,9,18,"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, “Please tell me, where is the seer’s house?”"
1 Samuel,9,19,"Samuel answered Saul and said, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and tomorrow I will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart."
1 Samuel,9,20,"But as for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not be anxious about them, for they have been found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on you and on all your father’s house?”"
1 Samuel,9,21,"And Saul answered and said, “Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak like this to me?”"
1 Samuel,9,22,"Now Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and had them sit in the place of honor among those who were invited; there were about thirty persons."
1 Samuel,9,23,"And Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, ‘Set it apart.’”"
1 Samuel,9,24,"So the cook took up the thigh with its upper part and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, “Here it is, what was kept back. It was set apart for you. Eat; for until this time it has been kept for you, since I said I invited the people.” So Saul ate with Samuel that day."
1 Samuel,9,25,"When they had come down from the high place into the city, Samuel spoke with Saul on the top of the house."
1 Samuel,9,26,"They arose early; and it was about the dawning of the day that Samuel called to Saul on the top of the house, saying, “Get up, that I may send you on your way.” And Saul arose, and both of them went outside, he and Samuel."
1 Samuel,9,27,"As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us.” And he went on. “But you stand here awhile, that I may announce to you the word of God.”"
1 Samuel,10,1,"Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said: “Is it not because the LORD has anointed you commander over His inheritance?"
1 Samuel,10,2,"When you have departed from me today, you will find two men by Rachel’s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, ‘The donkeys which you went to look for have been found. And now your father has ceased caring about the donkeys and is worrying about you, saying, “What shall I do about my son?”’"
1 Samuel,10,3,"Then you shall go on forward from there and come to the terebinth tree of Tabor. There three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine."
1 Samuel,10,4,"And they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive from their hands."
1 Samuel,10,5,"After that you shall come to the hill of God where the Philistine garrison is. And it will happen, when you have come there to the city, that you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with a stringed instrument, a tambourine, a flute, and a harp before them; and they will be prophesying."
1 Samuel,10,6,"Then the Spirit of the LORD will come upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man."
1 Samuel,10,7,"And let it be, when these signs come to you, that you do as the occasion demands; for God is with you."
1 Samuel,10,8,"You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and surely I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and make sacrifices of peace offerings. Seven days you shall wait, till I come to you and show you what you should do.”"
1 Samuel,10,9,"So it was, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, that God gave him another heart; and all those signs came to pass that day."
1 Samuel,10,10,"When they came there to the hill, there was a group of prophets to meet him; then the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them."
1 Samuel,10,11,"And it happened, when all who knew him formerly saw that he indeed prophesied among the prophets, that the people said to one another, “What is this that has come upon the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”"
1 Samuel,10,12,"Then a man from there answered and said, “But who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb: “Is Saul also among the prophets?”"
1 Samuel,10,13,"And when he had finished prophesying, he went to the high place."
1 Samuel,10,14,"Then Saul’s uncle said to him and his servant, “Where did you go?” So he said, “To look for the donkeys. When we saw that they were nowhere to be found, we went to Samuel.”"
1 Samuel,10,15,"And Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me, please, what Samuel said to you.”"
1 Samuel,10,16,"So Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found.” But about the matter of the kingdom, he did not tell him what Samuel had said."
1 Samuel,10,17,"Then Samuel called the people together to the LORD at Mizpah,"
1 Samuel,10,18,"and said to the children of Israel, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all kingdoms and from those who oppressed you.’"
1 Samuel,10,19,"But you have today rejected your God, who Himself saved you from all your adversities and your tribulations; and you have said to Him, ‘No, set a king over us!’ Now therefore, present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your clans.”"
1 Samuel,10,20,"And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen."
1 Samuel,10,21,"When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was chosen. And Saul the son of Kish was chosen. But when they sought him, he could not be found."
1 Samuel,10,22,"Therefore they inquired of the LORD further, “Has the man come here yet?” And the LORD answered, “There he is, hidden among the equipment.”"
1 Samuel,10,23,"So they ran and brought him from there; and when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward."
1 Samuel,10,24,"And Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen, that there is no one like him among all the people?” So all the people shouted and said, “Long live the king!”"
1 Samuel,10,25,"Then Samuel explained to the people the behavior of royalty, and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house."
1 Samuel,10,26,"And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and valiant men went with him, whose hearts God had touched."
1 Samuel,10,27,"But some rebels said, “How can this man save us?” So they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace."
1 Samuel,11,1,"Then Nahash the Ammonite came up and encamped against Jabesh Gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.”"
1 Samuel,11,2,"And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, “On this condition I will make a covenant with you, that I may put out all your right eyes, and bring reproach on all Israel.”"
1 Samuel,11,3,"Then the elders of Jabesh said to him, “Hold off for seven days, that we may send messengers to all the territory of Israel. And then, if there is no one to save us, we will come out to you.”"
1 Samuel,11,4,So the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and told the news in the hearing of the people. And all the people lifted up their voices and wept.
1 Samuel,11,5,"Now there was Saul, coming behind the herd from the field; and Saul said, “What troubles the people, that they weep?” And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh."
1 Samuel,11,6,"Then the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard this news, and his anger was greatly aroused."
1 Samuel,11,7,"So he took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, “Whoever does not go out with Saul and Samuel to battle, so it shall be done to his oxen.” And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent."
1 Samuel,11,8,"When he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand."
1 Samuel,11,9,"And they said to the messengers who came, “Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have help.’” Then the messengers came and reported it to the men of Jabesh, and they were glad."
1 Samuel,11,10,"Therefore the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do with us whatever seems good to you.”"
1 Samuel,11,11,"So it was, on the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and killed Ammonites until the heat of the day. And it happened that those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together."
1 Samuel,11,12,"Then the people said to Samuel, “Who is he who said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Bring the men, that we may put them to death.”"
1 Samuel,11,13,"But Saul said, “Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has accomplished salvation in Israel.”"
1 Samuel,11,14,"Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there.”"
1 Samuel,11,15,"So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. There they made sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD, and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly."
1 Samuel,12,1,"Now Samuel said to all Israel: “Indeed I have heeded your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you."
1 Samuel,12,2,"And now here is the king, walking before you; and I am old and grayheaded, and look, my sons are with you. I have walked before you from my childhood to this day."
1 Samuel,12,3,"Here I am. Witness against me before the LORD and before His anointed: Whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken, or whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed, or from whose hand have I received any bribe with which to blind my eyes? I will restore it to you.”"
1 Samuel,12,4,"And they said, “You have not cheated us or oppressed us, nor have you taken anything from any man’s hand.”"
1 Samuel,12,5,"Then he said to them, “The LORD is witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” And they answered, “He is witness.”"
1 Samuel,12,6,"Then Samuel said to the people, “It is the LORD who raised up Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt."
1 Samuel,12,7,"Now therefore, stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous acts of the LORD which He did to you and your fathers:"
1 Samuel,12,8,"When Jacob had gone into Egypt, and your fathers cried out to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place."
1 Samuel,12,9,"And when they forgot the LORD their God, He sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them."
1 Samuel,12,10,"Then they cried out to the LORD, and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD and served the Baals and Ashtoreths; but now deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve You.’"
1 Samuel,12,11,"And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and you dwelt in safety."
1 Samuel,12,12,"And when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us,’ when the LORD your God was your king."
1 Samuel,12,13,"“Now therefore, here is the king whom you have chosen and whom you have desired. And take note, the LORD has set a king over you."
1 Samuel,12,14,"If you fear the LORD and serve Him and obey His voice, and do not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then both you and the king who reigns over you will continue following the LORD your God."
1 Samuel,12,15,"However, if you do not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then the hand of the LORD will be against you, as it was against your fathers."
1 Samuel,12,16,"“Now therefore, stand and see this great thing which the LORD will do before your eyes:"
1 Samuel,12,17,"Is today not the wheat harvest? I will call to the LORD, and He will send thunder and rain, that you may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking a king for yourselves.”"
1 Samuel,12,18,"So Samuel called to the LORD, and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel."
1 Samuel,12,19,"And all the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, that we may not die; for we have added to all our sins the evil of asking a king for ourselves.”"
1 Samuel,12,20,"Then Samuel said to the people, “Do not fear. You have done all this wickedness; yet do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart."
1 Samuel,12,21,"And do not turn aside; for then you would go after empty things which cannot profit or deliver, for they are nothing."
1 Samuel,12,22,"For the LORD will not forsake His people, for His great name’s sake, because it has pleased the LORD to make you His people."
1 Samuel,12,23,"Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you; but I will teach you the good and the right way."
1 Samuel,12,24,"Only fear the LORD, and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things He has done for you."
1 Samuel,12,25,"But if you still do wickedly, you shall be swept away, both you and your king.”"
1 Samuel,13,1,"Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,"
1 Samuel,13,2,"Saul chose for himself three thousand men of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mountains of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent away, every man to his tent."
1 Samuel,13,3,"And Jonathan attacked the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”"
1 Samuel,13,4,"Now all Israel heard it said that Saul had attacked a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel had also become an abomination to the Philistines. And the people were called together to Saul at Gilgal."
1 Samuel,13,5,"Then the Philistines gathered together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude. And they came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of Beth Aven."
1 Samuel,13,6,"When the men of Israel saw that they were in danger (for the people were distressed), then the people hid in caves, in thickets, in rocks, in holes, and in pits."
1 Samuel,13,7,"And some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling."
1 Samuel,13,8,"Then he waited seven days, according to the time set by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him."
1 Samuel,13,9,"So Saul said, “Bring a burnt offering and peace offerings here to me.” And he offered the burnt offering."
1 Samuel,13,10,"Now it happened, as soon as he had finished presenting the burnt offering, that Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him."
1 Samuel,13,11,"And Samuel said, “What have you done?” Saul said, “When I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered together at Michmash,"
1 Samuel,13,12,"then I said, ‘The Philistines will now come down on me at Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the LORD.’ Therefore I felt compelled, and offered a burnt offering.”"
1 Samuel,13,13,"And Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which He commanded you. For now the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever."
1 Samuel,13,14,"But now your kingdom shall not continue. The LORD has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be commander over His people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you.”"
1 Samuel,13,15,"Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people present with him, about six hundred men."
1 Samuel,13,16,"Saul, Jonathan his son, and the people present with them remained in Gibeah of Benjamin. But the Philistines encamped in Michmash."
1 Samuel,13,17,"Then raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned onto the road to Ophrah, to the land of Shual,"
1 Samuel,13,18,"another company turned to the road to Beth Horon, and another company turned to the road of the border that overlooks the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness."
1 Samuel,13,19,"Now there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears.”"
1 Samuel,13,20,"But all the Israelites would go down to the Philistines to sharpen each man’s plowshare, his mattock, his ax, and his sickle;"
1 Samuel,13,21,"and the charge for a sharpening was a pim for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to set the points of the goads."
1 Samuel,13,22,"So it came about, on the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan. But they were found with Saul and Jonathan his son."
1 Samuel,13,23,And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
1 Samuel,14,1,"Now it happened one day that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison that is on the other side.” But he did not tell his father."
1 Samuel,14,2,And Saul was sitting in the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron. The people who were with him were about six hundred men.
1 Samuel,14,3,"Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD’s priest in Shiloh, was wearing an ephod. But the people did not know that Jonathan had gone."
1 Samuel,14,4,"Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a sharp rock on one side and a sharp rock on the other side. And the name of one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh."
1 Samuel,14,5,"The front of one faced northward opposite Michmash, and the other southward opposite Gibeah."
1 Samuel,14,6,"Then Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that the LORD will work for us. For nothing restrains the LORD from saving by many or by few.”"
1 Samuel,14,7,"So his armorbearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Go then; here I am with you, according to your heart.”"
1 Samuel,14,8,"Then Jonathan said, “Very well, let us cross over to these men, and we will show ourselves to them."
1 Samuel,14,9,"If they say thus to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand still in our place and not go up to them."
1 Samuel,14,10,"But if they say thus, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up. For the LORD has delivered them into our hand, and this will be a sign to us.”"
1 Samuel,14,11,"So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, “Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden.”"
1 Samuel,14,12,"Then the men of the garrison called to Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you something.” Jonathan said to his armorbearer, “Come up after me, for the LORD has delivered them into the hand of Israel.”"
1 Samuel,14,13,"And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and knees with his armorbearer after him; and they fell before Jonathan. And as he came after him, his armorbearer killed them."
1 Samuel,14,14,That first slaughter which Jonathan and his armorbearer made was about twenty men within about half an acre of land.
1 Samuel,14,15,"And there was trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and the raiders also trembled; and the earth quaked, so that it was a very great trembling."
1 Samuel,14,16,"Now the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and there was the multitude, melting away; and they went here and there."
1 Samuel,14,17,"Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Now call the roll and see who has gone from us.” And when they had called the roll, surprisingly, Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there."
1 Samuel,14,18,"And Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here” (for at that time the ark of God was with the children of Israel)."
1 Samuel,14,19,"Now it happened, while Saul talked to the priest, that the noise which was in the camp of the Philistines continued to increase; so Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”"
1 Samuel,14,20,"Then Saul and all the people who were with him assembled, and they went to the battle; and indeed every man’s sword was against his neighbor, and there was very great confusion."
1 Samuel,14,21,"Moreover the Hebrews who were with the Philistines before that time, who went up with them into the camp from the surrounding country, they also joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan."
1 Samuel,14,22,"Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden in the mountains of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, they also followed hard after them in the battle."
1 Samuel,14,23,"So the LORD saved Israel that day, and the battle shifted to Beth Aven."
1 Samuel,14,24,"And the men of Israel were distressed that day, for Saul had placed the people under oath, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats any food until evening, before I have taken vengeance on my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food."
1 Samuel,14,25,Now all the people of the land came to a forest; and there was honey on the ground.
1 Samuel,14,26,"And when the people had come into the woods, there was the honey, dripping; but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath."
1 Samuel,14,27,"But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath; therefore he stretched out the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his countenance brightened."
1 Samuel,14,28,"Then one of the people said, “Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food this day.’” And the people were faint."
1 Samuel,14,29,"But Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. Look now, how my countenance has brightened because I tasted a little of this honey."
1 Samuel,14,30,How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found! For now would there not have been a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?”
1 Samuel,14,31,Now they had driven back the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. So the people were very faint.
1 Samuel,14,32,"And the people rushed on the spoil, and took sheep, oxen, and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood."
1 Samuel,14,33,"Then they told Saul, saying, “Look, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood!” So he said, “You have dealt treacherously; roll a large stone to me this day.”"
1 Samuel,14,34,"Then Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, ‘Bring me here every man’s ox and every man’s sheep, slaughter them here, and eat; and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.’” So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night, and slaughtered it there."
1 Samuel,14,35,Then Saul built an altar to the LORD. This was the first altar that he built to the LORD.
1 Samuel,14,36,"Now Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and plunder them until the morning light; and let us not leave a man of them.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” Then the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.”"
1 Samuel,14,37,"So Saul asked counsel of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But He did not answer him that day."
1 Samuel,14,38,"And Saul said, “Come over here, all you chiefs of the people, and know and see what this sin was today."
1 Samuel,14,39,"For as the LORD lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But not a man among all the people answered him."
1 Samuel,14,40,"Then he said to all Israel, “You be on one side, and my son Jonathan and I will be on the other side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”"
1 Samuel,14,41,"Therefore Saul said to the LORD God of Israel, “Give a perfect lot.” So Saul and Jonathan were taken, but the people escaped."
1 Samuel,14,42,"And Saul said, “Cast lots between my son Jonathan and me.” So Jonathan was taken."
1 Samuel,14,43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan told him, and said, “I only tasted a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand. So now I must die!”"
1 Samuel,14,44,"Saul answered, “God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.”"
1 Samuel,14,45,"But the people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has accomplished this great deliverance in Israel? Certainly not! As the LORD lives, not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die."
1 Samuel,14,46,"Then Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place."
1 Samuel,14,47,"So Saul established his sovereignty over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the people of Ammon, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he harassed them."
1 Samuel,14,48,"And he gathered an army and attacked the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of those who plundered them."
1 Samuel,14,49,"The sons of Saul were Jonathan, Jishui, and Malchishua. And the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal."
1 Samuel,14,50,"The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle."
1 Samuel,14,51,"Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel."
1 Samuel,14,52,"Now there was fierce war with the Philistines all the days of Saul. And when Saul saw any strong man or any valiant man, he took him for himself."
1 Samuel,15,1,"Samuel also said to Saul, “The LORD sent me to anoint you king over His people, over Israel. Now therefore, heed the voice of the words of the LORD."
1 Samuel,15,2,"Thus says the LORD of hosts: ‘I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel, how he ambushed him on the way when he came up from Egypt."
1 Samuel,15,3,"Now go and attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them. But kill both man and woman, infant and nursing child, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’”"
1 Samuel,15,4,"So Saul gathered the people together and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah."
1 Samuel,15,5,"And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley."
1 Samuel,15,6,"Then Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, get down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. For you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites."
1 Samuel,15,7,"And Saul attacked the Amalekites, from Havilah all the way to Shur, which is east of Egypt."
1 Samuel,15,8,"He also took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword."
1 Samuel,15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was good, and were unwilling to utterly destroy them. But everything despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed."
1 Samuel,15,10,"Now the word of the LORD came to Samuel, saying,"
1 Samuel,15,11,"“I greatly regret that I have set up Saul as king, for he has turned back from following Me, and has not performed My commandments.” And it grieved Samuel, and he cried out to the LORD all night."
1 Samuel,15,12,"So when Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul, it was told Samuel, saying, “Saul went to Carmel, and indeed, he set up a monument for himself; and he has gone on around, passed by, and gone down to Gilgal.”"
1 Samuel,15,13,"Then Samuel went to Saul, and Saul said to him, “Blessed are you of the LORD! I have performed the commandment of the LORD.”"
1 Samuel,15,14,"But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?”"
1 Samuel,15,15,"And Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and the oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.”"
1 Samuel,15,16,"Then Samuel said to Saul, “Be quiet! And I will tell you what the LORD said to me last night.” And he said to him, “Speak on.”"
1 Samuel,15,17,"So Samuel said, “When you were little in your own eyes, were you not head of the tribes of Israel? And did not the LORD anoint you king over Israel?"
1 Samuel,15,18,"Now the LORD sent you on a mission, and said, ‘Go, and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.’"
1 Samuel,15,19,"Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD? Why did you swoop down on the spoil, and do evil in the sight of the LORD?”"
1 Samuel,15,20,"And Saul said to Samuel, “But I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and gone on the mission on which the LORD sent me, and brought back Agag king of Amalek; I have utterly destroyed the Amalekites."
1 Samuel,15,21,"But the people took of the plunder, sheep and oxen, the best of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.”"
1 Samuel,15,22,"So Samuel said: “Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, As in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, And to heed than the fat of rams."
1 Samuel,15,23,"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, And stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He also has rejected you from being king.”"
1 Samuel,15,24,"Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice."
1 Samuel,15,25,"Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD.”"
1 Samuel,15,26,"But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you, for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.”"
1 Samuel,15,27,"And as Samuel turned around to go away, Saul seized the edge of his robe, and it tore."
1 Samuel,15,28,"So Samuel said to him, “The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you."
1 Samuel,15,29,"And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor relent. For He is not a man, that He should relent.”"
1 Samuel,15,30,"Then he said, “I have sinned; yet honor me now, please, before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD your God.”"
1 Samuel,15,31,"So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD."
1 Samuel,15,32,"Then Samuel said, “Bring Agag king of the Amalekites here to me.” So Agag came to him cautiously. And Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”"
1 Samuel,15,33,"But Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.” And Samuel hacked Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,34,"Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul."
1 Samuel,15,35,"And Samuel went no more to see Saul until the day of his death. Nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul, and the LORD regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel."
1 Samuel,16,1,"Now the LORD said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go; I am sending you to Jesse the Bethlehemite. For I have provided Myself a king among his sons.”"
1 Samuel,16,2,"And Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.” But the LORD said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’"
1 Samuel,16,3,"Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; you shall anoint for Me the one I name to you.”"
1 Samuel,16,4,"So Samuel did what the LORD said, and went to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, “Do you come peaceably?”"
1 Samuel,16,5,"And he said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.” Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice."
1 Samuel,16,6,"So it was, when they came, that he looked at Eliab and said, “Surely the LORD’s anointed is before Him!”"
1 Samuel,16,7,"But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look at his appearance or at his physical stature, because I have refused him. For the LORD does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.”"
1 Samuel,16,8,"So Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, “Neither has the LORD chosen this one.”"
1 Samuel,16,9,"Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “Neither has the LORD chosen this one.”"
1 Samuel,16,10,"Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, “The LORD has not chosen these.”"
1 Samuel,16,11,"And Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all the young men here?” Then he said, “There remains yet the youngest, and there he is, keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him. For we will not sit down till he comes here.”"
1 Samuel,16,12,"So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with bright eyes, and good-looking. And the LORD said, “Arise, anoint him; for this is the one!”"
1 Samuel,16,13,Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose and went to Ramah.
1 Samuel,16,14,"But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and a distressing spirit from the LORD troubled him."
1 Samuel,16,15,"And Saul’s servants said to him, “Surely, a distressing spirit from God is troubling you."
1 Samuel,16,16,"Let our master now command your servants, who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. And it shall be that he will play it with his hand when the distressing spirit from God is upon you, and you shall be well.”"
1 Samuel,16,17,"So Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.”"
1 Samuel,16,18,"Then one of the servants answered and said, “Look, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and the LORD is with him.”"
1 Samuel,16,19,"Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.”"
1 Samuel,16,20,"And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by his son David to Saul."
1 Samuel,16,21,"So David came to Saul and stood before him. And he loved him greatly, and he became his armorbearer."
1 Samuel,16,22,"Then Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Please let David stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight.”"
1 Samuel,16,23,"And so it was, whenever the spirit from God was upon Saul, that David would take a harp and play it with his hand. Then Saul would become refreshed and well, and the distressing spirit would depart from him."
1 Samuel,17,1,"Now the Philistines gathered their armies together to battle, and were gathered at Sochoh, which belongs to Judah; they encamped between Sochoh and Azekah, in Ephes Dammim."
1 Samuel,17,2,"And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and they encamped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in battle array against the Philistines."
1 Samuel,17,3,"The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side, with a valley between them."
1 Samuel,17,4,"And a champion went out from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, from Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span."
1 Samuel,17,5,"He had a bronze helmet on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze."
1 Samuel,17,6,And he had bronze armor on his legs and a bronze javelin between his shoulders.
1 Samuel,17,7,"Now the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and his iron spearhead weighed six hundred shekels; and a shield-bearer went before him."
1 Samuel,17,8,"Then he stood and cried out to the armies of Israel, and said to them, “Why have you come out to line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me."
1 Samuel,17,9,"If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.”"
1 Samuel,17,10,"And the Philistine said, “I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.”"
1 Samuel,17,11,"When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid."
1 Samuel,17,12,"Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name was Jesse, and who had eight sons. And the man was old, advanced in years, in the days of Saul."
1 Samuel,17,13,"The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone to follow Saul to the battle. The names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah."
1 Samuel,17,14,David was the youngest. And the three oldest followed Saul.
1 Samuel,17,15,But David occasionally went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.
1 Samuel,17,16,"And the Philistine drew near and presented himself forty days, morning and evening."
1 Samuel,17,17,"Then Jesse said to his son David, “Take now for your brothers an ephah of this dried grain and these ten loaves, and run to your brothers at the camp."
1 Samuel,17,18,"And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and see how your brothers fare, and bring back news of them.”"
1 Samuel,17,19,"Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines."
1 Samuel,17,20,"So David rose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, and took the things and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the camp as the army was going out to the fight and shouting for the battle."
1 Samuel,17,21,"For Israel and the Philistines had drawn up in battle array, army against army."
1 Samuel,17,22,"And David left his supplies in the hand of the supply keeper, ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers."
1 Samuel,17,23,"Then as he talked with them, there was the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, coming up from the armies of the Philistines; and he spoke according to the same words. So David heard them."
1 Samuel,17,24,"And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were dreadfully afraid."
1 Samuel,17,25,"So the men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel; and it shall be that the man who kills him the king will enrich with great riches, will give him his daughter, and give his father’s house exemption from taxes in Israel.”"
1 Samuel,17,26,"Then David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, “What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?”"
1 Samuel,17,27,"And the people answered him in this manner, saying, “So shall it be done for the man who kills him.”"
1 Samuel,17,28,"Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger was aroused against David, and he said, “Why did you come down here? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the insolence of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle.”"
1 Samuel,17,29,"And David said, “What have I done now? Is there not a cause?”"
1 Samuel,17,30,Then he turned from him toward another and said the same thing; and these people answered him as the first ones did.
1 Samuel,17,31,"Now when the words which David spoke were heard, they reported them to Saul; and he sent for him."
1 Samuel,17,32,"Then David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.”"
1 Samuel,17,33,"And Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.”"
1 Samuel,17,34,"But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep his father’s sheep, and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock,"
1 Samuel,17,35,"I went out after it and struck it, and delivered the lamb from its mouth; and when it arose against me, I caught it by its beard, and struck and killed it."
1 Samuel,17,36,"Your servant has killed both lion and bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.”"
1 Samuel,17,37,"Moreover David said, “The LORD, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” And Saul said to David, “Go, and the LORD be with you!”"
1 Samuel,17,38,"So Saul clothed David with his armor, and he put a bronze helmet on his head; he also clothed him with a coat of mail."
1 Samuel,17,39,"David fastened his sword to his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested them. And David said to Saul, “I cannot walk with these, for I have not tested them.” So David took them off."
1 Samuel,17,40,"Then he took his staff in his hand; and he chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag, in a pouch which he had, and his sling was in his hand. And he drew near to the Philistine."
1 Samuel,17,41,"So the Philistine came, and began drawing near to David, and the man who bore the shield went before him."
1 Samuel,17,42,"And when the Philistine looked about and saw David, he disdained him; for he was only a youth, ruddy and good-looking."
1 Samuel,17,43,"So the Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods."
1 Samuel,17,44,"And the Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!”"
1 Samuel,17,45,"Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied."
1 Samuel,17,46,"This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you. And this day I will give the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel."
1 Samuel,17,47,"Then all this assembly shall know that the LORD does not save with sword and spear; for the battle is the LORD’s, and He will give you into our hands.”"
1 Samuel,17,48,"So it was, when the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, that David hurried and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine."
1 Samuel,17,49,"Then David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone; and he slung it and struck the Philistine in his forehead, so that the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth."
1 Samuel,17,50,"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. But there was no sword in the hand of David."
1 Samuel,17,51,"Therefore David ran and stood over the Philistine, took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled."
1 Samuel,17,52,"Now the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as the entrance of the valley and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell along the road to Shaaraim, even as far as Gath and Ekron."
1 Samuel,17,53,"Then the children of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their tents."
1 Samuel,17,54,"And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent."
1 Samuel,17,55,"When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this youth?” And Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.”"
1 Samuel,17,56,"So the king said, “Inquire whose son this young man is.”"
1 Samuel,17,57,"Then, as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand."
1 Samuel,17,58,"And Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” So David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”"
1 Samuel,18,1,"Now when he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul."
1 Samuel,18,2,"Saul took him that day, and would not let him go home to his father’s house anymore."
1 Samuel,18,3,"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul."
1 Samuel,18,4,"And Jonathan took off the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his armor, even to his sword and his bow and his belt."
1 Samuel,18,5,"So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved wisely. And Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul’s servants."
1 Samuel,18,6,"Now it had happened as they were coming home, when David was returning from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women had come out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with musical instruments."
1 Samuel,18,7,"So the women sang as they danced, and said: “Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.”"
1 Samuel,18,8,"Then Saul was very angry, and the saying displeased him; and he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed only thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?”"
1 Samuel,18,9,So Saul eyed David from that day forward.
1 Samuel,18,10,"And it happened on the next day that the distressing spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house. So David played music with his hand, as at other times; but there was a spear in Saul’s hand."
1 Samuel,18,11,"And Saul cast the spear, for he said, “I will pin David to the wall!” But David escaped his presence twice."
1 Samuel,18,12,"Now Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, but had departed from Saul."
1 Samuel,18,13,"Therefore Saul removed him from his presence, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people."
1 Samuel,18,14,"And David behaved wisely in all his ways, and the LORD was with him."
1 Samuel,18,15,"Therefore, when Saul saw that he behaved very wisely, he was afraid of him."
1 Samuel,18,16,"But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them."
1 Samuel,18,17,"Then Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife. Only be valiant for me, and fight the LORD’s battles.” For Saul thought, “Let my hand not be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.”"
1 Samuel,18,18,"So David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my life or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?”"
1 Samuel,18,19,"But it happened at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife."
1 Samuel,18,20,"Now Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David. And they told Saul, and the thing pleased him."
1 Samuel,18,21,"So Saul said, “I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” Therefore Saul said to David a second time, “You shall be my son-in-law today.”"
1 Samuel,18,22,"And Saul commanded his servants, “Communicate with David secretly, and say, ‘Look, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore, become the king’s son-in-law.’”"
1 Samuel,18,23,"So Saul’s servants spoke those words in the hearing of David. And David said, “Does it seem to you a light thing to be a king’s son-in-law, seeing I am a poor and lightly esteemed man?”"
1 Samuel,18,24,"And the servants of Saul told him, saying, “In this manner David spoke.”"
1 Samuel,18,25,"Then Saul said, “Thus you shall say to David: ‘The king does not desire any dowry but one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the king’s enemies.’” But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines."
1 Samuel,18,26,"So when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to become the king’s son-in-law. Now the days had not expired;"
1 Samuel,18,27,"therefore David arose and went, he and his men, and killed two hundred men of the Philistines. And David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full count to the king, that he might become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as a wife."
1 Samuel,18,28,"Thus Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him;"
1 Samuel,18,29,and Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul became David’s enemy continually.
1 Samuel,18,30,"Then the princes of the Philistines went out to war. And so it was, whenever they went out, that David behaved more wisely than all the servants of Saul, so that his name became highly esteemed."
1 Samuel,19,1,"Now Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David; but Jonathan, Saul’s son, delighted greatly in David."
1 Samuel,19,2,"So Jonathan told David, saying, “My father Saul seeks to kill you. Therefore please be on your guard until morning, and stay in a secret place and hide."
1 Samuel,19,3,"And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak with my father about you. Then what I observe, I will tell you.”"
1 Samuel,19,4,"Thus Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to him, “Let not the king sin against his servant, against David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been very good toward you."
1 Samuel,19,5,"For he took his life in his hands and killed the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great deliverance for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?”"
1 Samuel,19,6,"So Saul heeded the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, “As the LORD lives, he shall not be killed.”"
1 Samuel,19,7,"Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these things. So Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as in times past."
1 Samuel,19,8,"And there was war again; and David went out and fought with the Philistines, and struck them with a mighty blow, and they fled from him."
1 Samuel,19,9,Now the distressing spirit from the LORD came upon Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand. And David was playing music with his hand.
1 Samuel,19,10,"Then Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away from Saul’s presence; and he drove the spear into the wall. So David fled and escaped that night."
1 Samuel,19,11,"Saul also sent messengers to David’s house to watch him and to kill him in the morning. And Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.”"
1 Samuel,19,12,So Michal let David down through a window. And he went and fled and escaped.
1 Samuel,19,13,"And Michal took an image and laid it in the bed, put a cover of goats’ hair for his head, and covered it with clothes."
1 Samuel,19,14,"So when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.”"
1 Samuel,19,15,"Then Saul sent the messengers back to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.”"
1 Samuel,19,16,"And when the messengers had come in, there was the image in the bed, with a cover of goats’ hair for his head."
1 Samuel,19,17,"Then Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this, and sent my enemy away, so that he has escaped?” And Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill you?’”"
1 Samuel,19,18,"So David fled and escaped, and went to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth."
1 Samuel,19,19,"Now it was told Saul, saying, “Take note, David is at Naioth in Ramah!”"
1 Samuel,19,20,"Then Saul sent messengers to take David. And when they saw the group of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as leader over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied."
1 Samuel,19,21,"And when Saul was told, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. Then Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also."
1 Samuel,19,22,"Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is at Sechu. So he asked, and said, “Where are Samuel and David?” And someone said, “Indeed they are at Naioth in Ramah.”"
1 Samuel,19,23,"So he went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on and prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah."
1 Samuel,19,24,"And he also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”"
1 Samuel,20,1,"Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and went and said to Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my iniquity, and what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?”"
1 Samuel,20,2,"So Jonathan said to him, “By no means! You shall not die! Indeed, my father will do nothing either great or small without first telling me. And why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so!”"
1 Samuel,20,3,"Then David took an oath again, and said, “Your father certainly knows that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.’ But truly, as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.”"
1 Samuel,20,4,"So Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you yourself desire, I will do it for you.”"
1 Samuel,20,5,"And David said to Jonathan, “Indeed tomorrow is the New Moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king to eat. But let me go, that I may hide in the field until the third day at evening."
1 Samuel,20,6,"If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked permission of me that he might run over to Bethlehem, his city, for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.’"
1 Samuel,20,7,"If he says thus: ‘It is well,’ your servant will be safe. But if he is very angry, be sure that evil is determined by him."
1 Samuel,20,8,"Therefore you shall deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. Nevertheless, if there is iniquity in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?”"
1 Samuel,20,9,"But Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! For if I knew certainly that evil was determined by my father to come upon you, then would I not tell you?”"
1 Samuel,20,10,"Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me, or what if your father answers you roughly?”"
1 Samuel,20,11,"And Jonathan said to David, “Come, let us go out into the field.” So both of them went out into the field."
1 Samuel,20,12,"Then Jonathan said to David: “The LORD God of Israel is witness! When I have sounded out my father sometime tomorrow, or the third day, and indeed there is good toward David, and I do not send to you and tell you,"
1 Samuel,20,13,"may the LORD do so and much more to Jonathan. But if it pleases my father to do you evil, then I will report it to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. And the LORD be with you as He has been with my father."
1 Samuel,20,14,"And you shall not only show me the kindness of the LORD while I still live, that I may not die;"
1 Samuel,20,15,"but you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever, no, not when the LORD has cut off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.”"
1 Samuel,20,16,"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “Let the LORD require it at the hand of David’s enemies.”"
1 Samuel,20,17,"Now Jonathan again caused David to vow, because he loved him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul."
1 Samuel,20,18,"Then Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the New Moon; and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty."
1 Samuel,20,19,"And when you have stayed three days, go down quickly and come to the place where you hid on the day of the deed; and remain by the stone Ezel."
1 Samuel,20,20,"Then I will shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a target;"
1 Samuel,20,21,"and there I will send a lad, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I expressly say to the lad, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; get them and come’—then, as the LORD lives, there is safety for you and no harm."
1 Samuel,20,22,"But if I say thus to the young man, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you’—go your way, for the LORD has sent you away."
1 Samuel,20,23,"And as for the matter which you and I have spoken of, indeed the LORD be between you and me forever.”"
1 Samuel,20,24,"Then David hid in the field. And when the New Moon had come, the king sat down to eat the feast."
1 Samuel,20,25,"Now the king sat on his seat, as at other times, on a seat by the wall. And Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty."
1 Samuel,20,26,"Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, “Something has happened to him; he is unclean, surely he is unclean.”"
1 Samuel,20,27,"And it happened the next day, the second day of the month, that David’s place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why has the son of Jesse not come to eat, either yesterday or today?”"
1 Samuel,20,28,"So Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked permission of me to go to Bethlehem."
1 Samuel,20,29,"And he said, ‘Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. And now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me get away and see my brothers.’ Therefore he has not come to the king’s table.”"
1 Samuel,20,30,"Then Saul’s anger was aroused against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?"
1 Samuel,20,31,"For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Now therefore, send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.”"
1 Samuel,20,32,"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, “Why should he be killed? What has he done?”"
1 Samuel,20,33,"Then Saul cast a spear at him to kill him, by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to kill David."
1 Samuel,20,34,"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had treated him shamefully."
1 Samuel,20,35,"And so it was, in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad was with him."
1 Samuel,20,36,"Then he said to his lad, “Now run, find the arrows which I shoot.” As the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him."
1 Samuel,20,37,"When the lad had come to the place where the arrow was which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried out after the lad and said, “Is not the arrow beyond you?”"
1 Samuel,20,38,"And Jonathan cried out after the lad, “Make haste, hurry, do not delay!” So Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows and came back to his master."
1 Samuel,20,39,But the lad did not know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew of the matter.
1 Samuel,20,40,"Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, “Go, carry them to the city.”"
1 Samuel,20,41,"As soon as the lad had gone, David arose from a place toward the south, fell on his face to the ground, and bowed down three times. And they kissed one another; and they wept together, but David more so."
1 Samuel,20,42,"Then Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, since we have both sworn in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘May the LORD be between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants, forever.’” So he arose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city."
1 Samuel,21,1,"Now David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech was afraid when he met David, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no one is with you?”"
1 Samuel,21,2,"So David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has ordered me on some business, and said to me, ‘Do not let anyone know anything about the business on which I send you, or what I have commanded you.’ And I have directed my young men to such and such a place."
1 Samuel,21,3,"Now therefore, what have you on hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever can be found.”"
1 Samuel,21,4,"And the priest answered David and said, “There is no common bread on hand; but there is holy bread, if the young men have at least kept themselves from women.”"
1 Samuel,21,5,"Then David answered the priest, and said to him, “Truly, women have been kept from us about three days since I came out. And the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in effect common, even though it was consecrated in the vessel this day.”"
1 Samuel,21,6,"So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the showbread which had been taken from before the LORD, in order to put hot bread in its place on the day when it was taken away."
1 Samuel,21,7,"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD. And his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul."
1 Samuel,21,8,"And David said to Ahimelech, “Is there not here on hand a spear or a sword? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.”"
1 Samuel,21,9,"So the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, there it is, wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it. For there is no other except that one here.” And David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”"
1 Samuel,21,10,"Then David arose and fled that day from before Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath."
1 Samuel,21,11,"And the servants of Achish said to him, “Is this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing of him to one another in dances, saying: ‘Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands’?”"
1 Samuel,21,12,"Now David took these words to heart, and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath."
1 Samuel,21,13,"So he changed his behavior before them, pretended madness in their hands, scratched on the doors of the gate, and let his saliva fall down on his beard."
1 Samuel,21,14,"Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is insane. Why have you brought him to me?"
1 Samuel,21,15,"Have I need of madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?”"
1 Samuel,22,1,"David therefore departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. So when his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down there to him."
1 Samuel,22,2,"And everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him. So he became captain over them. And there were about four hundred men with him."
1 Samuel,22,3,"Then David went from there to Mizpah of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and mother come here with you, till I know what God will do for me.”"
1 Samuel,22,4,"So he brought them before the king of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the time that David was in the stronghold."
1 Samuel,22,5,"Now the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold; depart, and go to the land of Judah.” So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth."
1 Samuel,22,6,"When Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been discovered—now Saul was staying in Gibeah under a tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants standing about him—"
1 Samuel,22,7,"then Saul said to his servants who stood about him, “Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds?"
1 Samuel,22,8,"All of you have conspired against me, and there is no one who reveals to me that my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse; and there is not one of you who is sorry for me or reveals to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as it is this day.”"
1 Samuel,22,9,"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, “I saw the son of Jesse going to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub."
1 Samuel,22,10,"And he inquired of the LORD for him, gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”"
1 Samuel,22,11,"So the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who were in Nob. And they all came to the king."
1 Samuel,22,12,"And Saul said, “Hear now, son of Ahitub!” He answered, “Here I am, my lord.”"
1 Samuel,22,13,"Then Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as it is this day?”"
1 Samuel,22,14,"So Ahimelech answered the king and said, “And who among all your servants is as faithful as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, who goes at your bidding, and is honorable in your house?"
1 Samuel,22,15,"Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? Far be it from me! Let not the king impute anything to his servant, or to any in the house of my father. For your servant knew nothing of all this, little or much.”"
1 Samuel,22,16,"And the king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s house!”"
1 Samuel,22,17,"Then the king said to the guards who stood about him, “Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled and did not tell it to me.” But the servants of the king would not lift their hands to strike the priests of the LORD."
1 Samuel,22,18,"And the king said to Doeg, “You turn and kill the priests!” So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck the priests, and killed on that day eighty-five men who wore a linen ephod."
1 Samuel,22,19,"Also Nob, the city of the priests, he struck with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing infants, oxen and donkeys and sheep—with the edge of the sword."
1 Samuel,22,20,"Now one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David."
1 Samuel,22,21,And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the LORD’s priests.
1 Samuel,22,22,"So David said to Abiathar, “I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have caused the death of all the persons of your father’s house."
1 Samuel,22,23,"Stay with me; do not fear. For he who seeks my life seeks your life, but with me you shall be safe.”"
1 Samuel,23,1,"Then they told David, saying, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and they are robbing the threshing floors.”"
1 Samuel,23,2,"Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?” And the LORD said to David, “Go and attack the Philistines, and save Keilah.”"
1 Samuel,23,3,"But David’s men said to him, “Look, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?”"
1 Samuel,23,4,"Then David inquired of the LORD once again. And the LORD answered him and said, “Arise, go down to Keilah. For I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.”"
1 Samuel,23,5,"And David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines, struck them with a mighty blow, and took away their livestock. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah."
1 Samuel,23,6,"Now it happened, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, that he went down with an ephod in his hand."
1 Samuel,23,7,"And Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah. So Saul said, “God has delivered him into my hand, for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.”"
1 Samuel,23,8,"Then Saul called all the people together for war, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men."
1 Samuel,23,9,"When David knew that Saul plotted evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.”"
1 Samuel,23,10,"Then David said, “O LORD God of Israel, Your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah to destroy the city for my sake."
1 Samuel,23,11,"Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I pray, tell Your servant.” And the LORD said, “He will come down.”"
1 Samuel,23,12,"Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?” And the LORD said, “They will deliver you.”"
1 Samuel,23,13,"So David and his men, about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah and went wherever they could go. Then it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah; so he halted the expedition."
1 Samuel,23,14,"And David stayed in strongholds in the wilderness, and remained in the mountains in the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand."
1 Samuel,23,15,So David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. And David was in the Wilderness of Ziph in a forest.
1 Samuel,23,16,"Then Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose and went to David in the woods and strengthened his hand in God."
1 Samuel,23,17,"And he said to him, “Do not fear, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you. Even my father Saul knows that.”"
1 Samuel,23,18,"So the two of them made a covenant before the LORD. And David stayed in the woods, and Jonathan went to his own house."
1 Samuel,23,19,"Then the Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is David not hiding with us in strongholds in the woods, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?"
1 Samuel,23,20,"Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king’s hand.”"
1 Samuel,23,21,"And Saul said, “Blessed are you of the LORD, for you have compassion on me."
1 Samuel,23,22,"Please go and find out for sure, and see the place where his hideout is, and who has seen him there. For I am told he is very crafty."
1 Samuel,23,23,"See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides; and come back to me with certainty, and I will go with you. And it shall be, if he is in the land, that I will search for him throughout all the clans of Judah.”"
1 Samuel,23,24,"So they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. But David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon."
1 Samuel,23,25,"When Saul and his men went to seek him, they told David. Therefore he went down to the rock, and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued David in the Wilderness of Maon."
1 Samuel,23,26,"Then Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. So David made haste to get away from Saul, for Saul and his men were encircling David and his men to take them."
1 Samuel,23,27,"But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land!”"
1 Samuel,23,28,"Therefore Saul returned from pursuing David, and went against the Philistines; so they called that place the Rock of Escape."
1 Samuel,23,29,Then David went up from there and dwelt in strongholds at En Gedi.
1 Samuel,24,1,"Now it happened, when Saul had returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, “Take note! David is in the Wilderness of En Gedi.”"
1 Samuel,24,2,"Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the Rocks of the Wild Goats."
1 Samuel,24,3,"So he came to the sheepfolds by the road, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to attend to his needs. (David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave.)"
1 Samuel,24,4,"Then the men of David said to him, “This is the day of which the LORD said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do to him as it seems good to you.’” And David arose and secretly cut off a corner of Saul’s robe."
1 Samuel,24,5,Now it happened afterward that David’s heart troubled him because he had cut Saul’s robe.
1 Samuel,24,6,"And he said to his men, “The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the LORD’s anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.”"
1 Samuel,24,7,"So David restrained his servants with these words, and did not allow them to rise against Saul. And Saul got up from the cave and went on his way."
1 Samuel,24,8,"David also arose afterward, went out of the cave, and called out to Saul, saying, “My lord the king!” And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed down."
1 Samuel,24,9,"And David said to Saul: “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘Indeed David seeks your harm’?"
1 Samuel,24,10,"Look, this day your eyes have seen that the LORD delivered you today into my hand in the cave, and someone urged me to kill you. But my eye spared you, and I said, ‘I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD’s anointed.’"
1 Samuel,24,11,"Moreover, my father, see! Yes, see the corner of your robe in my hand! For in that I cut off the corner of your robe, and did not kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor rebellion in my hand, and I have not sinned against you. Yet you hunt my life to take it."
1 Samuel,24,12,"Let the LORD judge between you and me, and let the LORD avenge me on you. But my hand shall not be against you."
1 Samuel,24,13,"As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.’ But my hand shall not be against you."
1 Samuel,24,14,After whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea?
1 Samuel,24,15,"Therefore let the LORD be judge, and judge between you and me, and see and plead my case, and deliver me out of your hand.”"
1 Samuel,24,16,"So it was, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And Saul lifted up his voice and wept."
1 Samuel,24,17,"Then he said to David: “You are more righteous than I; for you have rewarded me with good, whereas I have rewarded you with evil."
1 Samuel,24,18,"And you have shown this day how you have dealt well with me; for when the LORD delivered me into your hand, you did not kill me."
1 Samuel,24,19,"For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him get away safely? Therefore may the LORD reward you with good for what you have done to me this day."
1 Samuel,24,20,"And now I know indeed that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand."
1 Samuel,24,21,"Therefore swear now to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants after me, and that you will not destroy my name from my father’s house.”"
1 Samuel,24,22,"So David swore to Saul. And Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold."
1 Samuel,25,1,"Then Samuel died; and the Israelites gathered together and lamented for him, and buried him at his home in Ramah. And David arose and went down to the Wilderness of Paran."
1 Samuel,25,2,"Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel, and the man was very rich. He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. And he was shearing his sheep in Carmel."
1 Samuel,25,3,"The name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail. And she was a woman of good understanding and beautiful appearance; but the man was harsh and evil in his doings. He was of the house of Caleb."
1 Samuel,25,4,"When David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep,"
1 Samuel,25,5,"David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, go to Nabal, and greet him in my name."
1 Samuel,25,6,"And thus you shall say to him who lives in prosperity: ‘Peace be to you, peace to your house, and peace to all that you have!"
1 Samuel,25,7,"Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds were with us, and we did not hurt them, nor was there anything missing from them all the while they were in Carmel."
1 Samuel,25,8,"Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes, for we come on a feast day. Please give whatever comes to your hand to your servants and to your son David.’”"
1 Samuel,25,9,"So when David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in the name of David, and waited."
1 Samuel,25,10,"Then Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, “Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants nowadays who break away each one from his master."
1 Samuel,25,11,"Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men when I do not know where they are from?”"
1 Samuel,25,12,So David’s young men turned on their heels and went back; and they came and told him all these words.
1 Samuel,25,13,"Then David said to his men, “Every man gird on his sword.” So every man girded on his sword, and David also girded on his sword. And about four hundred men went with David, and two hundred stayed with the supplies."
1 Samuel,25,14,"Now one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Look, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master; and he reviled them."
1 Samuel,25,15,"But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, nor did we miss anything as long as we accompanied them, when we were in the fields."
1 Samuel,25,16,"They were a wall to us both by night and day, all the time we were with them keeping the sheep."
1 Samuel,25,17,"Now therefore, know and consider what you will do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his household. For he is such a scoundrel that one cannot speak to him.”"
1 Samuel,25,18,"Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five sheep already dressed, five seahs of roasted grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and loaded them on donkeys."
1 Samuel,25,19,"And she said to her servants, “Go on before me; see, I am coming after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal."
1 Samuel,25,20,"So it was, as she rode on the donkey, that she went down under cover of the hill; and there were David and his men, coming down toward her, and she met them."
1 Samuel,25,21,"Now David had said, “Surely in vain I have protected all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belongs to him. And he has repaid me evil for good."
1 Samuel,25,22,"May God do so, and more also, to the enemies of David, if I leave one male of all who belong to him by morning light.”"
1 Samuel,25,23,"Now when Abigail saw David, she dismounted quickly from the donkey, fell on her face before David, and bowed down to the ground."
1 Samuel,25,24,"So she fell at his feet and said: “On me, my lord, on me let this iniquity be! And please let your maidservant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your maidservant."
1 Samuel,25,25,"Please, let not my lord regard this scoundrel Nabal. For as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and folly is with him! But I, your maidservant, did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent."
1 Samuel,25,26,"Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, since the LORD has held you back from coming to bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now then, let your enemies and those who seek harm for my lord be as Nabal."
1 Samuel,25,27,"And now this present which your maidservant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord."
1 Samuel,25,28,"Please forgive the trespass of your maidservant. For the LORD will certainly make for my lord an enduring house, because my lord fights the battles of the LORD, and evil is not found in you throughout your days."
1 Samuel,25,29,"Yet a man has risen to pursue you and seek your life, but the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God; and the lives of your enemies He shall sling out, as from the pocket of a sling."
1 Samuel,25,30,"And it shall come to pass, when the LORD has done for my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you ruler over Israel,"
1 Samuel,25,31,"that this will be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. But when the LORD has dealt well with my lord, then remember your maidservant.”"
1 Samuel,25,32,"Then David said to Abigail: “Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!"
1 Samuel,25,33,"And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand."
1 Samuel,25,34,"For indeed, as the LORD God of Israel lives, who has kept me back from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, surely by morning light no males would have been left to Nabal!”"
1 Samuel,25,35,"So David received from her hand what she had brought him, and said to her, “Go up in peace to your house. See, I have heeded your voice and respected your person.”"
1 Samuel,25,36,"Now Abigail went to Nabal, and there he was, holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk; therefore she told him nothing, little or much, until morning light."
1 Samuel,25,37,"So it was, in the morning, when the wine had gone from Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became like a stone."
1 Samuel,25,38,"Then it happened, after about ten days, that the LORD struck Nabal, and he died."
1 Samuel,25,39,"So when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the LORD, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept His servant from evil! For the LORD has returned the wickedness of Nabal on his own head.” And David sent and proposed to Abigail, to take her as his wife."
1 Samuel,25,40,"When the servants of David had come to Abigail at Carmel, they spoke to her saying, “David sent us to you, to ask you to become his wife.”"
1 Samuel,25,41,"Then she arose, bowed her face to the earth, and said, “Here is your maidservant, a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”"
1 Samuel,25,42,"So Abigail rose in haste and rode on a donkey, attended by five of her maidens; and she followed the messengers of David, and became his wife."
1 Samuel,25,43,"David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and so both of them were his wives."
1 Samuel,25,44,"But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim."
1 Samuel,26,1,"Now the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is David not hiding in the hill of Hachilah, opposite Jeshimon?”"
1 Samuel,26,2,"Then Saul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph."
1 Samuel,26,3,"And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon, by the road. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness."
1 Samuel,26,4,"David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had indeed come."
1 Samuel,26,5,"So David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. Now Saul lay within the camp, with the people encamped all around him."
1 Samuel,26,6,"Then David answered, and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”"
1 Samuel,26,7,"So David and Abishai came to the people by night; and there Saul lay sleeping within the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. And Abner and the people lay all around him."
1 Samuel,26,8,"Then Abishai said to David, “God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day. Now therefore, please, let me strike him at once with the spear, right to the earth; and I will not have to strike him a second time!”"
1 Samuel,26,9,"But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him; for who can stretch out his hand against the LORD’s anointed, and be guiltless?”"
1 Samuel,26,10,"David said furthermore, “As the LORD lives, the LORD shall strike him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall go out to battle and perish."
1 Samuel,26,11,"The LORD forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed. But please, take now the spear and the jug of water that are by his head, and let us go.”"
1 Samuel,26,12,"So David took the spear and the jug of water by Saul’s head, and they got away; and no man saw or knew it or awoke. For they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen on them."
1 Samuel,26,13,"Now David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off, a great distance being between them."
1 Samuel,26,14,"And David called out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Do you not answer, Abner?” Then Abner answered and said, “Who are you, calling out to the king?”"
1 Samuel,26,15,"So David said to Abner, “Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy your lord the king."
1 Samuel,26,16,"This thing that you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, you deserve to die, because you have not guarded your master, the LORD’s anointed. And now see where the king’s spear is, and the jug of water that was by his head.”"
1 Samuel,26,17,"Then Saul knew David’s voice, and said, “Is that your voice, my son David?” David said, “It is my voice, my lord, O king.”"
1 Samuel,26,18,"And he said, “Why does my lord thus pursue his servant? For what have I done, or what evil is in my hand?"
1 Samuel,26,19,"Now therefore, please, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant: If the LORD has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering. But if it is the children of men, may they be cursed before the LORD, for they have driven me out this day from sharing in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods.’"
1 Samuel,26,20,"So now, do not let my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD. For the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains.”"
1 Samuel,26,21,"Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Return, my son David. For I will harm you no more, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Indeed I have played the fool and erred exceedingly.”"
1 Samuel,26,22,"And David answered and said, “Here is the king’s spear. Let one of the young men come over and get it."
1 Samuel,26,23,"May the LORD repay every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered you into my hand today, but I would not stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed."
1 Samuel,26,24,"And indeed, as your life was valued much this day in my eyes, so let my life be valued much in the eyes of the LORD, and let Him deliver me out of all tribulation.”"
1 Samuel,26,25,"Then Saul said to David, “May you be blessed, my son David! You shall both do great things and also still prevail.” So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place."
1 Samuel,27,1,"And David said in his heart, “Now I shall perish someday by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape to the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me anymore in any part of Israel. So I shall escape out of his hand.”"
1 Samuel,27,2,"Then David arose and went over with the six hundred men who were with him to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath."
1 Samuel,27,3,"So David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each man with his household, and David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s widow."
1 Samuel,27,4,And it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath; so he sought him no more.
1 Samuel,27,5,"Then David said to Achish, “If I have now found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?”"
1 Samuel,27,6,So Achish gave him Ziklag that day. Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day.
1 Samuel,27,7,Now the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was one full year and four months.
1 Samuel,27,8,"And David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. For those nations were the inhabitants of the land from of old, as you go to Shur, even as far as the land of Egypt."
1 Samuel,27,9,"Whenever David attacked the land, he left neither man nor woman alive, but took away the sheep, the oxen, the donkeys, the camels, and the apparel, and returned and came to Achish."
1 Samuel,27,10,"Then Achish would say, “Where have you made a raid today?” And David would say, “Against the southern area of Judah, or against the southern area of the Jerahmeelites, or against the southern area of the Kenites.”"
1 Samuel,27,11,"David would save neither man nor woman alive, to bring news to Gath, saying, “Lest they should inform on us, saying, ‘Thus David did.’” And thus was his behavior all the time he dwelt in the country of the Philistines."
1 Samuel,27,12,"So Achish believed David, saying, “He has made his people Israel utterly abhor him; therefore he will be my servant forever.”"
1 Samuel,28,1,"Now it happened in those days that the Philistines gathered their armies together for war, to fight with Israel. And Achish said to David, “You assuredly know that you will go out with me to battle, you and your men.”"
1 Samuel,28,2,"So David said to Achish, “Surely you know what your servant can do.” And Achish said to David, “Therefore I will make you one of my chief guardians forever.”"
1 Samuel,28,3,"Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had lamented for him and buried him in Ramah, in his own city. And Saul had put the mediums and the spiritists out of the land."
1 Samuel,28,4,"Then the Philistines gathered together, and came and encamped at Shunem. So Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped at Gilboa."
1 Samuel,28,5,"When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly."
1 Samuel,28,6,"And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by the prophets."
1 Samuel,28,7,"Then Saul said to his servants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.” And his servants said to him, “In fact, there is a woman who is a medium at En Dor.”"
1 Samuel,28,8,"So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes, and he went, and two men with him; and they came to the woman by night. And he said, “Please conduct a séance for me, and bring up for me the one I shall name to you.”"
1 Samuel,28,9,"Then the woman said to him, “Look, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and the spiritists from the land. Why then do you lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?”"
1 Samuel,28,10,"And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, “As the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.”"
1 Samuel,28,11,"Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” And he said, “Bring up Samuel for me.”"
1 Samuel,28,12,"When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman spoke to Saul, saying, “Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!”"
1 Samuel,28,13,"And the king said to her, “Do not be afraid. What did you see?” And the woman said to Saul, “I saw a spirit ascending out of the earth.”"
1 Samuel,28,14,"So he said to her, “What is his form?” And she said, “An old man is coming up, and he is covered with a mantle.” And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground and bowed down."
1 Samuel,28,15,"Now Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” And Saul answered, “I am deeply distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me and does not answer me anymore, neither by prophets nor by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may reveal to me what I should do.”"
1 Samuel,28,16,"Then Samuel said: “So why do you ask me, seeing the LORD has departed from you and has become your enemy?"
1 Samuel,28,17,"And the LORD has done for Himself as He spoke by me. For the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David."
1 Samuel,28,18,"Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD nor execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore the LORD has done this thing to you this day."
1 Samuel,28,19,Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines. And tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The LORD will also deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.”
1 Samuel,28,20,"Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, and was dreadfully afraid because of the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no food all day or all night."
1 Samuel,28,21,"And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was severely troubled, and said to him, “Look, your maidservant has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hands and heeded the words which you spoke to me."
1 Samuel,28,22,"Now therefore, please, heed also the voice of your maidservant, and let me set a piece of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way.”"
1 Samuel,28,23,"But he refused and said, “I will not eat.” So his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he heeded their voice. Then he arose from the ground and sat on the bed."
1 Samuel,28,24,"Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she hastened to kill it. And she took flour and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread from it."
1 Samuel,28,25,"So she brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night."
1 Samuel,29,1,"Then the Philistines gathered together all their armies at Aphek, and the Israelites encamped by a fountain which is in Jezreel."
1 Samuel,29,2,"And the lords of the Philistines passed in review by hundreds and by thousands, but David and his men passed in review at the rear with Achish."
1 Samuel,29,3,"Then the princes of the Philistines said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, “Is this not David, the servant of Saul king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or these years? And to this day I have found no fault in him since he defected to me.”"
1 Samuel,29,4,"But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; so the princes of the Philistines said to him, “Make this fellow return, that he may go back to the place which you have appointed for him, and do not let him go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become our adversary. For with what could he reconcile himself to his master, if not with the heads of these men?"
1 Samuel,29,5,"Is this not David, of whom they sang to one another in dances, saying: ‘Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands’?”"
1 Samuel,29,6,"Then Achish called David and said to him, “Surely, as the LORD lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight. For to this day I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me. Nevertheless the lords do not favor you."
1 Samuel,29,7,"Therefore return now, and go in peace, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines.”"
1 Samuel,29,8,"So David said to Achish, “But what have I done? And to this day what have you found in your servant as long as I have been with you, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”"
1 Samuel,29,9,"Then Achish answered and said to David, “I know that you are as good in my sight as an angel of God; nevertheless the princes of the Philistines have said, ‘He shall not go up with us to the battle.’"
1 Samuel,29,10,"Now therefore, rise early in the morning with your master’s servants who have come with you. And as soon as you are up early in the morning and have light, depart.”"
1 Samuel,29,11,"So David and his men rose early to depart in the morning, to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel."
1 Samuel,30,1,"Now it happened, when David and his men came to Ziklag, on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the South and Ziklag, attacked Ziklag and burned it with fire,"
1 Samuel,30,2,"and had taken captive the women and those who were there, from small to great; they did not kill anyone, but carried them away and went their way."
1 Samuel,30,3,"So David and his men came to the city, and there it was, burned with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive."
1 Samuel,30,4,"Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voices and wept, until they had no more power to weep."
1 Samuel,30,5,"And David’s two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite, had been taken captive."
1 Samuel,30,6,"Now David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God."
1 Samuel,30,7,"Then David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, “Please bring the ephod here to me.” And Abiathar brought the ephod to David."
1 Samuel,30,8,"So David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I pursue this troop? Shall I overtake them?” And He answered him, “Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all.”"
1 Samuel,30,9,"So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the Brook Besor, where those stayed who were left behind."
1 Samuel,30,10,"But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so weary that they could not cross the Brook Besor."
1 Samuel,30,11,"Then they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David; and they gave him bread and he ate, and they let him drink water."
1 Samuel,30,12,"And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. So when he had eaten, his strength came back to him; for he had eaten no bread nor drunk water for three days and three nights."
1 Samuel,30,13,"Then David said to him, “To whom do you belong, and where are you from?” And he said, “I am a young man from Egypt, servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me behind, because three days ago I fell sick."
1 Samuel,30,14,"We made an invasion of the southern area of the Cherethites, in the territory which belongs to Judah, and of the southern area of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.”"
1 Samuel,30,15,"And David said to him, “Can you take me down to this troop?” So he said, “Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will take you down to this troop.”"
1 Samuel,30,16,"And when he had brought him down, there they were, spread out over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the great spoil which they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah."
1 Samuel,30,17,"Then David attacked them from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled."
1 Samuel,30,18,"So David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away, and David rescued his two wives."
1 Samuel,30,19,"And nothing of theirs was lacking, either small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything which they had taken from them; David recovered all."
1 Samuel,30,20,"Then David took all the flocks and herds they had driven before those other livestock, and said, “This is David’s spoil.”"
1 Samuel,30,21,"Now David came to the two hundred men who had been so weary that they could not follow David, whom they also had made to stay at the Brook Besor. So they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. And when David came near the people, he greeted them."
1 Samuel,30,22,"Then all the wicked and worthless men of those who went with David answered and said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except for every man’s wife and children, that they may lead them away and depart.”"
1 Samuel,30,23,"But David said, “My brethren, you shall not do so with what the LORD has given us, who has preserved us and delivered into our hand the troop that came against us."
1 Samuel,30,24,"For who will heed you in this matter? But as his part is who goes down to the battle, so shall his part be who stays by the supplies; they shall share alike.”"
1 Samuel,30,25,"So it was, from that day forward; he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day."
1 Samuel,30,26,"Now when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, “Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD”—"
1 Samuel,30,27,"to those who were in Bethel, those who were in Ramoth of the South, those who were in Jattir,"
1 Samuel,30,28,"those who were in Aroer, those who were in Siphmoth, those who were in Eshtemoa,"
1 Samuel,30,29,"those who were in Rachal, those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, those who were in the cities of the Kenites,"
1 Samuel,30,30,"those who were in Hormah, those who were in Chorashan, those who were in Athach,"
1 Samuel,30,31,"those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were accustomed to rove."
1 Samuel,31,1,"Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboa."
1 Samuel,31,2,"Then the Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons. And the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul’s sons."
1 Samuel,31,3,"The battle became fierce against Saul. The archers hit him, and he was severely wounded by the archers."
1 Samuel,31,4,"Then Saul said to his armorbearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised men come and thrust me through and abuse me.” But his armorbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword and fell on it."
1 Samuel,31,5,"And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword, and died with him."
1 Samuel,31,6,"So Saul, his three sons, his armorbearer, and all his men died together that same day."
1 Samuel,31,7,"And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were on the other side of the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them."
1 Samuel,31,8,"So it happened the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa."
1 Samuel,31,9,"And they cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines, to proclaim it in the temple of their idols and among the people."
1 Samuel,31,10,"Then they put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan."
1 Samuel,31,11,"Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,"
1 Samuel,31,12,"all the valiant men arose and traveled all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh and burned them there."
1 Samuel,31,13,"Then they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days."
2 Samuel,1,1,"Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag,"
2 Samuel,1,2,"on the third day, behold, it happened that a man came from Saul’s camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head. So it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself."
2 Samuel,1,3,"And David said to him, “Where have you come from?” So he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”"
2 Samuel,1,4,"Then David said to him, “How did the matter go? Please tell me.” And he answered, “The people have fled from the battle, many of the people are fallen and dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.”"
2 Samuel,1,5,"So David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?”"
2 Samuel,1,6,"Then the young man who told him said, “As I happened by chance to be on Mount Gilboa, there was Saul, leaning on his spear; and indeed the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him."
2 Samuel,1,7,"Now when he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I answered, ‘Here I am.’"
2 Samuel,1,8,"And he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ So I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’"
2 Samuel,1,9,"He said to me again, ‘Please stand over me and kill me, for anguish has come upon me, but my life still remains in me.’"
2 Samuel,1,10,"So I stood over him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.”"
2 Samuel,1,11,"Therefore David took hold of his own clothes and tore them, and so did all the men who were with him."
2 Samuel,1,12,"And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son, for the people of the LORD and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword."
2 Samuel,1,13,"Then David said to the young man who told him, “Where are you from?” And he answered, “I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite.”"
2 Samuel,1,14,"So David said to him, “How was it you were not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the LORD’s anointed?”"
2 Samuel,1,15,"Then David called one of the young men and said, “Go near, and execute him!” And he struck him so that he died."
2 Samuel,1,16,"So David said to him, “Your blood is on your own head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed the LORD’s anointed.’”"
2 Samuel,1,17,"Then David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son,"
2 Samuel,1,18,and he told them to teach the children of Judah the Song of the Bow; indeed it is written in the Book of Jasher:
2 Samuel,1,19,“The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!
2 Samuel,1,20,"Tell it not in Gath, Proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon— Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph."
2 Samuel,1,21,"“O mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, Nor fields of offerings. For the shield of the mighty is cast away there! The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil."
2 Samuel,1,22,"From the blood of the slain, From the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan did not turn back, And the sword of Saul did not return empty."
2 Samuel,1,23,"“Saul and Jonathan were beloved and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided; They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions."
2 Samuel,1,24,"“O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet, with luxury; Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel."
2 Samuel,1,25,“How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan was slain in your high places.
2 Samuel,1,26,"I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; You have been very pleasant to me; Your love to me was wonderful, Surpassing the love of women."
2 Samuel,1,27,"“How the mighty have fallen, And the weapons of war perished!”"
2 Samuel,2,1,"It happened after this that David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go up to any of the cities of Judah?” And the LORD said to him, “Go up.” David said, “Where shall I go up?” And He said, “To Hebron.”"
2 Samuel,2,2,"So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite."
2 Samuel,2,3,"And David brought up the men who were with him, every man with his household. So they dwelt in the cities of Hebron."
2 Samuel,2,4,"Then the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, “The men of Jabesh Gilead were the ones who buried Saul.”"
2 Samuel,2,5,"So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, “You are blessed of the LORD, for you have shown this kindness to your lord, to Saul, and have buried him."
2 Samuel,2,6,"And now may the LORD show kindness and truth to you. I also will repay you this kindness, because you have done this thing."
2 Samuel,2,7,"Now therefore, let your hands be strengthened, and be valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”"
2 Samuel,2,8,"But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim;"
2 Samuel,2,9,"and he made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, and over all Israel."
2 Samuel,2,10,"Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. Only the house of Judah followed David."
2 Samuel,2,11,And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2 Samuel,2,12,"Now Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon."
2 Samuel,2,13,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. So they sat down, one on one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool."
2 Samuel,2,14,"Then Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men now arise and compete before us.” And Joab said, “Let them arise.”"
2 Samuel,2,15,"So they arose and went over by number, twelve from Benjamin, followers of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David."
2 Samuel,2,16,"And each one grasped his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent’s side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called the Field of Sharp Swords, which is in Gibeon."
2 Samuel,2,17,"So there was a very fierce battle that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David."
2 Samuel,2,18,Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab and Abishai and Asahel. And Asahel was as fleet of foot as a wild gazelle.
2 Samuel,2,19,"So Asahel pursued Abner, and in going he did not turn to the right hand or to the left from following Abner."
2 Samuel,2,20,"Then Abner looked behind him and said, “Are you Asahel?” He answered, “I am.”"
2 Samuel,2,21,"And Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay hold on one of the young men and take his armor for yourself.” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him."
2 Samuel,2,22,"So Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I face your brother Joab?”"
2 Samuel,2,23,"However, he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the blunt end of the spear, so that the spear came out of his back; and he fell down there and died on the spot. So it was that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still."
2 Samuel,2,24,"Joab and Abishai also pursued Abner. And the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is before Giah by the road to the Wilderness of Gibeon."
2 Samuel,2,25,"Now the children of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became a unit, and took their stand on top of a hill."
2 Samuel,2,26,"Then Abner called to Joab and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the latter end? How long will it be then until you tell the people to return from pursuing their brethren?”"
2 Samuel,2,27,"And Joab said, “As God lives, unless you had spoken, surely then by morning all the people would have given up pursuing their brethren.”"
2 Samuel,2,28,"So Joab blew a trumpet; and all the people stood still and did not pursue Israel anymore, nor did they fight anymore."
2 Samuel,2,29,"Then Abner and his men went on all that night through the plain, crossed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron; and they came to Mahanaim."
2 Samuel,2,30,"So Joab returned from pursuing Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel."
2 Samuel,2,31,"But the servants of David had struck down, of Benjamin and Abner’s men, three hundred and sixty men who died."
2 Samuel,2,32,"Then they took up Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at daybreak."
2 Samuel,3,1,"Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. But David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker."
2 Samuel,3,2,Sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
2 Samuel,3,3,"his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;"
2 Samuel,3,4,"the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;"
2 Samuel,3,5,"and the sixth, Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron."
2 Samuel,3,6,"Now it was so, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner was strengthening his hold on the house of Saul."
2 Samuel,3,7,"And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. So Ishbosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”"
2 Samuel,3,8,"Then Abner became very angry at the words of Ishbosheth, and said, “Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show loyalty to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman?"
2 Samuel,3,9,"May God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David as the LORD has sworn to him—"
2 Samuel,3,10,"to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.”"
2 Samuel,3,11,"And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him."
2 Samuel,3,12,"Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to David, saying, “Whose is the land?” saying also, “Make your covenant with me, and indeed my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel to you.”"
2 Samuel,3,13,"And David said, “Good, I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you: you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see my face.”"
2 Samuel,3,14,"So David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”"
2 Samuel,3,15,"And Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish."
2 Samuel,3,16,"Then her husband went along with her to Bahurim, weeping behind her. So Abner said to him, “Go, return!” And he returned."
2 Samuel,3,17,"Now Abner had communicated with the elders of Israel, saying, “In time past you were seeking for David to be king over you."
2 Samuel,3,18,"Now then, do it! For the LORD has spoken of David, saying, ‘By the hand of My servant David, I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and the hand of all their enemies.’”"
2 Samuel,3,19,And Abner also spoke in the hearing of Benjamin. Then Abner also went to speak in the hearing of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and the whole house of Benjamin.
2 Samuel,3,20,So Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.
2 Samuel,3,21,"Then Abner said to David, “I will arise and go, and gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace."
2 Samuel,3,22,"At that moment the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace."
2 Samuel,3,23,"When Joab and all the troops that were with him had come, they told Joab, saying, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he sent him away, and he has gone in peace.”"
2 Samuel,3,24,"Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Look, Abner came to you; why is it that you sent him away, and he has already gone?"
2 Samuel,3,25,"Surely you realize that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you, to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.”"
2 Samuel,3,26,"And when Joab had gone from David’s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know it."
2 Samuel,3,27,"Now when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him privately, and there stabbed him in the stomach, so that he died for the blood of Asahel his brother."
2 Samuel,3,28,"Afterward, when David heard it, he said, “My kingdom and I are guiltless before the LORD forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner."
2 Samuel,3,29,"Let it rest on the head of Joab and on all his father’s house; and let there never fail to be in the house of Joab one who has a discharge or is a leper, who leans on a staff or falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.”"
2 Samuel,3,30,"So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle."
2 Samuel,3,31,"Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes, gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn for Abner.” And King David followed the coffin."
2 Samuel,3,32,"So they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept."
2 Samuel,3,33,And the king sang a lament over Abner and said: “Should Abner die as a fool dies?
2 Samuel,3,34,"Your hands were not bound Nor your feet put into fetters; As a man falls before wicked men, so you fell.” Then all the people wept over him again."
2 Samuel,3,35,"And when all the people came to persuade David to eat food while it was still day, David took an oath, saying, “God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down!”"
2 Samuel,3,36,"Now all the people took note of it, and it pleased them, since whatever the king did pleased all the people."
2 Samuel,3,37,For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king’s intent to kill Abner the son of Ner.
2 Samuel,3,38,"Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?"
2 Samuel,3,39,"And I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too harsh for me. The LORD shall repay the evildoer according to his wickedness.”"
2 Samuel,4,1,"When Saul’s son heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost heart, and all Israel was troubled."
2 Samuel,4,2,"Now Saul’s son had two men who were captains of troops. The name of one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin. (For Beeroth also was part of Benjamin,"
2 Samuel,4,3,because the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been sojourners there until this day.)
2 Samuel,4,4,"Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel; and his nurse took him up and fled. And it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth."
2 Samuel,4,5,"Then the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out and came at about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who was lying on his bed at noon."
2 Samuel,4,6,"And they came there, all the way into the house, as though to get wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped."
2 Samuel,4,7,"For when they came into the house, he was lying on his bed in his bedroom; then they struck him and killed him, beheaded him and took his head, and were all night escaping through the plain."
2 Samuel,4,8,"And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron, and said to the king, “Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul your enemy, who sought your life; and the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and his descendants.”"
2 Samuel,4,9,"But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all adversity,"
2 Samuel,4,10,"when someone told me, saying, ‘Look, Saul is dead,’ thinking to have brought good news, I arrested him and had him executed in Ziklag—the one who thought I would give him a reward for his news."
2 Samuel,4,11,"How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous person in his own house on his bed? Therefore, shall I not now require his blood at your hand and remove you from the earth?”"
2 Samuel,4,12,"So David commanded his young men, and they executed them, cut off their hands and feet, and hanged them by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner in Hebron."
2 Samuel,5,1,"Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and spoke, saying, “Indeed we are your bone and your flesh."
2 Samuel,5,2,"Also, in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them in; and the LORD said to you, ‘You shall shepherd My people Israel, and be ruler over Israel.’”"
2 Samuel,5,3,"Therefore all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD. And they anointed David king over Israel."
2 Samuel,5,4,"David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years."
2 Samuel,5,5,"In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah."
2 Samuel,5,6,"And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, “You shall not come in here; but the blind and the lame will repel you,” thinking, “David cannot come in here.”"
2 Samuel,5,7,"Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion (that is, the City of David)."
2 Samuel,5,8,"Now David said on that day, “Whoever climbs up by way of the water shaft and defeats the Jebusites (the lame and the blind, who are hated by David’s soul), he shall be chief and captain.” Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.”"
2 Samuel,5,9,"Then David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the City of David. And David built all around from the Millo and inward."
2 Samuel,5,10,"So David went on and became great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him."
2 Samuel,5,11,"Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters and masons. And they built David a house."
2 Samuel,5,12,"So David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted His kingdom for the sake of His people Israel."
2 Samuel,5,13,"And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron. Also more sons and daughters were born to David."
2 Samuel,5,14,"Now these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,"
2 Samuel,5,15,"Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,"
2 Samuel,5,16,"Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet."
2 Samuel,5,17,"Now when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. And David heard of it and went down to the stronghold."
2 Samuel,5,18,The Philistines also went and deployed themselves in the Valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel,5,19,"So David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?” And the LORD said to David, “Go up, for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into your hand.”"
2 Samuel,5,20,"So David went to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there; and he said, “The LORD has broken through my enemies before me, like a breakthrough of water.” Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim."
2 Samuel,5,21,"And they left their images there, and David and his men carried them away."
2 Samuel,5,22,Then the Philistines went up once again and deployed themselves in the Valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel,5,23,"Therefore David inquired of the LORD, and He said, “You shall not go up; circle around behind them, and come upon them in front of the mulberry trees."
2 Samuel,5,24,"And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then you shall advance quickly. For then the LORD will go out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.”"
2 Samuel,5,25,"And David did so, as the LORD commanded him; and he drove back the Philistines from Geba as far as Gezer."
2 Samuel,6,1,"Again David gathered all the choice men of Israel, thirty thousand."
2 Samuel,6,2,"And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called by the Name, the LORD of Hosts, who dwells between the cherubim."
2 Samuel,6,3,"So they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart."
2 Samuel,6,4,"And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill, accompanying the ark of God; and Ahio went before the ark."
2 Samuel,6,5,"Then David and all the house of Israel played music before the LORD on all kinds of instruments of fir wood, on harps, on stringed instruments, on tambourines, on sistrums, and on cymbals."
2 Samuel,6,6,"And when they came to Nachon’s threshing floor, Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled."
2 Samuel,6,7,"Then the anger of the LORD was aroused against Uzzah, and God struck him there for his error; and he died there by the ark of God."
2 Samuel,6,8,And David became angry because of the LORD’s outbreak against Uzzah; and he called the name of the place Perez Uzzah to this day.
2 Samuel,6,9,"David was afraid of the LORD that day; and he said, “How can the ark of the LORD come to me?”"
2 Samuel,6,10,So David would not move the ark of the LORD with him into the City of David; but David took it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
2 Samuel,6,11,The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months. And the LORD blessed Obed-Edom and all his household.
2 Samuel,6,12,"Now it was told King David, saying, “The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.” So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with gladness."
2 Samuel,6,13,"And so it was, when those bearing the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, that he sacrificed oxen and fatted sheep."
2 Samuel,6,14,Then David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was wearing a linen ephod.
2 Samuel,6,15,So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet.
2 Samuel,6,16,"Now as the ark of the LORD came into the City of David, Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked through a window and saw King David leaping and whirling before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart."
2 Samuel,6,17,"So they brought the ark of the LORD, and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle that David had erected for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD."
2 Samuel,6,18,"And when David had finished offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts."
2 Samuel,6,19,"Then he distributed among all the people, among the whole multitude of Israel, both the women and the men, to everyone a loaf of bread, a piece of meat, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed, everyone to his house."
2 Samuel,6,20,"Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, “How glorious was the king of Israel today, uncovering himself today in the eyes of the maids of his servants, as one of the base fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!”"
2 Samuel,6,21,"So David said to Michal, “It was before the LORD, who chose me instead of your father and all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel. Therefore I will play music before the LORD."
2 Samuel,6,22,"And I will be even more undignified than this, and will be humble in my own sight. But as for the maidservants of whom you have spoken, by them I will be held in honor.”"
2 Samuel,6,23,Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.
2 Samuel,7,1,"Now it came to pass when the king was dwelling in his house, and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies all around,"
2 Samuel,7,2,"that the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells inside tent curtains.”"
2 Samuel,7,3,"Then Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you.”"
2 Samuel,7,4,"But it happened that night that the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,"
2 Samuel,7,5,"“Go and tell My servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Would you build a house for Me to dwell in?"
2 Samuel,7,6,"For I have not dwelt in a house since the time that I brought the children of Israel up from Egypt, even to this day, but have moved about in a tent and in a tabernacle."
2 Samuel,7,7,"Wherever I have moved about with all the children of Israel, have I ever spoken a word to anyone from the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’”’"
2 Samuel,7,8,"Now therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts: “I took you from the sheepfold, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people, over Israel."
2 Samuel,7,9,"And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made you a great name, like the name of the great men who are on the earth."
2 Samuel,7,10,"Moreover I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more; nor shall the sons of wickedness oppress them anymore, as previously,"
2 Samuel,7,11,"since the time that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel, and have caused you to rest from all your enemies. Also the LORD tells you that He will make you a house."
2 Samuel,7,12,"“When your days are fulfilled and you rest with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom."
2 Samuel,7,13,"He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever."
2 Samuel,7,14,"I will be his Father, and he shall be My son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the blows of the sons of men."
2 Samuel,7,15,"But My mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from before you."
2 Samuel,7,16,And your house and your kingdom shall be established forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever.”’”
2 Samuel,7,17,"According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David."
2 Samuel,7,18,"Then King David went in and sat before the LORD; and he said: “Who am I, O Lord GOD? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far?"
2 Samuel,7,19,"And yet this was a small thing in Your sight, O Lord GOD; and You have also spoken of Your servant’s house for a great while to come. Is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?"
2 Samuel,7,20,"Now what more can David say to You? For You, Lord GOD, know Your servant."
2 Samuel,7,21,"For Your word’s sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all these great things, to make Your servant know them."
2 Samuel,7,22,"Therefore You are great, O Lord GOD. For there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears."
2 Samuel,7,23,"And who is like Your people, like Israel, the one nation on the earth whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people, to make for Himself a name—and to do for Yourself great and awesome deeds for Your land—before Your people whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, the nations, and their gods?"
2 Samuel,7,24,"For You have made Your people Israel Your very own people forever; and You, LORD, have become their God."
2 Samuel,7,25,"“Now, O LORD God, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, establish it forever and do as You have said."
2 Samuel,7,26,"So let Your name be magnified forever, saying, ‘The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel.’ And let the house of Your servant David be established before You."
2 Samuel,7,27,"For You, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed this to Your servant, saying, ‘I will build you a house.’ Therefore Your servant has found it in his heart to pray this prayer to You."
2 Samuel,7,28,"“And now, O Lord GOD, You are God, and Your words are true, and You have promised this goodness to Your servant."
2 Samuel,7,29,"Now therefore, let it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue before You forever; for You, O Lord GOD, have spoken it, and with Your blessing let the house of Your servant be blessed forever.”"
2 Samuel,8,1,After this it came to pass that David attacked the Philistines and subdued them. And David took Metheg Ammah from the hand of the Philistines.
2 Samuel,8,2,"Then he defeated Moab. Forcing them down to the ground, he measured them off with a line. With two lines he measured off those to be put to death, and with one full line those to be kept alive. So the Moabites became David’s servants, and brought tribute."
2 Samuel,8,3,"David also defeated Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his territory at the River Euphrates."
2 Samuel,8,4,"David took from him one thousand chariots, seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. Also David hamstrung all the chariot horses, except that he spared enough of them for one hundred chariots."
2 Samuel,8,5,"When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand of the Syrians."
2 Samuel,8,6,"Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became David’s servants, and brought tribute. So the LORD preserved David wherever he went."
2 Samuel,8,7,"And David took the shields of gold that had belonged to the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,8,8,"Also from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a large amount of bronze."
2 Samuel,8,9,"When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer,"
2 Samuel,8,10,"then Toi sent Joram his son to King David, to greet him and bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him (for Hadadezer had been at war with Toi); and Joram brought with him articles of silver, articles of gold, and articles of bronze."
2 Samuel,8,11,"King David also dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold that he had dedicated from all the nations which he had subdued—"
2 Samuel,8,12,"from Syria, from Moab, from the people of Ammon, from the Philistines, from Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah."
2 Samuel,8,13,And David made himself a name when he returned from killing eighteen thousand Syrians in the Valley of Salt.
2 Samuel,8,14,"He also put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became David’s servants. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went."
2 Samuel,8,15,So David reigned over all Israel; and David administered judgment and justice to all his people.
2 Samuel,8,16,Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
2 Samuel,8,17,Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests; Seraiah was the scribe;
2 Samuel,8,18,Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief ministers.
2 Samuel,9,1,"Now David said, “Is there still anyone who is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?”"
2 Samuel,9,2,"And there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba. So when they had called him to David, the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” He said, “At your service!”"
2 Samuel,9,3,"Then the king said, “Is there not still someone of the house of Saul, to whom I may show the kindness of God?” And Ziba said to the king, “There is still a son of Jonathan who is lame in his feet.”"
2 Samuel,9,4,"So the king said to him, “Where is he?” And Ziba said to the king, “Indeed he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.”"
2 Samuel,9,5,"Then King David sent and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar."
2 Samuel,9,6,"Now when Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, had come to David, he fell on his face and prostrated himself. Then David said, “Mephibosheth?” And he answered, “Here is your servant!”"
2 Samuel,9,7,"So David said to him, “Do not fear, for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your grandfather; and you shall eat bread at my table continually.”"
2 Samuel,9,8,"Then he bowed himself, and said, “What is your servant, that you should look upon such a dead dog as I?”"
2 Samuel,9,9,"And the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “I have given to your master’s son all that belonged to Saul and to all his house."
2 Samuel,9,10,"You therefore, and your sons and your servants, shall work the land for him, and you shall bring in the harvest, that your master’s son may have food to eat. But Mephibosheth your master’s son shall eat bread at my table always.” Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants."
2 Samuel,9,11,"Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant, so will your servant do.” “As for Mephibosheth,” said the king, “he shall eat at my table like one of the king’s sons.”"
2 Samuel,9,12,Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Micha. And all who dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants of Mephibosheth.
2 Samuel,9,13,"So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem, for he ate continually at the king’s table. And he was lame in both his feet."
2 Samuel,10,1,"It happened after this that the king of the people of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place."
2 Samuel,10,2,"Then David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent by the hand of his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the people of Ammon."
2 Samuel,10,3,"And the princes of the people of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David really honors your father because he has sent comforters to you? Has David not rather sent his servants to you to search the city, to spy it out, and to overthrow it?”"
2 Samuel,10,4,"Therefore Hanun took David’s servants, shaved off half of their beards, cut off their garments in the middle, at their buttocks, and sent them away."
2 Samuel,10,5,"When they told David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”"
2 Samuel,10,6,"When the people of Ammon saw that they had made themselves repulsive to David, the people of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand foot soldiers; and from the king of Maacah one thousand men, and from Ish-Tob twelve thousand men."
2 Samuel,10,7,"Now when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men."
2 Samuel,10,8,"Then the people of Ammon came out and put themselves in battle array at the entrance of the gate. And the Syrians of Zoba, Beth Rehob, Ish-Tob, and Maacah were by themselves in the field."
2 Samuel,10,9,"When Joab saw that the battle line was against him before and behind, he chose some of Israel’s best and put them in battle array against the Syrians."
2 Samuel,10,10,"And the rest of the people he put under the command of Abishai his brother, that he might set them in battle array against the people of Ammon."
2 Samuel,10,11,"Then he said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the people of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you."
2 Samuel,10,12,"Be of good courage, and let us be strong for our people and for the cities of our God. And may the LORD do what is good in His sight.”"
2 Samuel,10,13,"So Joab and the people who were with him drew near for the battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him."
2 Samuel,10,14,"When the people of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fleeing, they also fled before Abishai, and entered the city. So Joab returned from the people of Ammon and went to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,10,15,"When the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered together."
2 Samuel,10,16,"Then Hadadezer sent and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River, and they came to Helam. And Shobach the commander of Hadadezer’s army went before them."
2 Samuel,10,17,"When it was told David, he gathered all Israel, crossed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in battle array against David and fought with him."
2 Samuel,10,18,"Then the Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed seven hundred charioteers and forty thousand horsemen of the Syrians, and struck Shobach the commander of their army, who died there."
2 Samuel,10,19,"And when all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them. So the Syrians were afraid to help the people of Ammon anymore."
2 Samuel,11,1,"It happened in the spring of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the people of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,11,2,"Then it happened one evening that David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king’s house. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to behold."
2 Samuel,11,3,"So David sent and inquired about the woman. And someone said, “Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?”"
2 Samuel,11,4,"Then David sent messengers, and took her; and she came to him, and he lay with her, for she was cleansed from her impurity; and she returned to her house."
2 Samuel,11,5,"And the woman conceived; so she sent and told David, and said, “I am with child.”"
2 Samuel,11,6,"Then David sent to Joab, saying, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” And Joab sent Uriah to David."
2 Samuel,11,7,"When Uriah had come to him, David asked how Joab was doing, and how the people were doing, and how the war prospered."
2 Samuel,11,8,"And David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” So Uriah departed from the king’s house, and a gift of food from the king followed him."
2 Samuel,11,9,"But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house."
2 Samuel,11,10,"So when they told David, saying, “Uriah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Did you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?”"
2 Samuel,11,11,"And Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields. Shall I then go to my house to eat and drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.”"
2 Samuel,11,12,"Then David said to Uriah, “Wait here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next."
2 Samuel,11,13,"Now when David called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. And at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house."
2 Samuel,11,14,In the morning it happened that David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
2 Samuel,11,15,"And he wrote in the letter, saying, “Set Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck down and die.”"
2 Samuel,11,16,"So it was, while Joab besieged the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew there were valiant men."
2 Samuel,11,17,Then the men of the city came out and fought with Joab. And some of the people of the servants of David fell; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
2 Samuel,11,18,"Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war,"
2 Samuel,11,19,"and charged the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling the matters of the war to the king,"
2 Samuel,11,20,"if it happens that the king’s wrath rises, and he says to you: ‘Why did you approach so near to the city when you fought? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?"
2 Samuel,11,21,"Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Was it not a woman who cast a piece of a millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you go near the wall?’—then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.’”"
2 Samuel,11,22,"So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Joab had sent by him."
2 Samuel,11,23,"And the messenger said to David, “Surely the men prevailed against us and came out to us in the field; then we drove them back as far as the entrance of the gate."
2 Samuel,11,24,"The archers shot from the wall at your servants; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.”"
2 Samuel,11,25,"Then David said to the messenger, “Thus you shall say to Joab: ‘Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your attack against the city, and overthrow it.’ So encourage him.”"
2 Samuel,11,26,"When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband."
2 Samuel,11,27,"And when her mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD."
2 Samuel,12,1,"Then the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him: “There were two men in one city, one rich and the other poor."
2 Samuel,12,2,The rich man had exceedingly many flocks and herds.
2 Samuel,12,3,"But the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished; and it grew up together with him and with his children. It ate of his own food and drank from his own cup and lay in his bosom; and it was like a daughter to him."
2 Samuel,12,4,"And a traveler came to the rich man, who refused to take from his own flock and from his own herd to prepare one for the wayfaring man who had come to him; but he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”"
2 Samuel,12,5,"So David’s anger was greatly aroused against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As the LORD lives, the man who has done this shall surely die!"
2 Samuel,12,6,"And he shall restore fourfold for the lamb, because he did this thing and because he had no pity.”"
2 Samuel,12,7,"Then Nathan said to David, “You are the man! Thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul."
2 Samuel,12,8,"I gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives into your keeping, and gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if that had been too little, I also would have given you much more!"
2 Samuel,12,9,"Why have you despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in His sight? You have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword; you have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the people of Ammon."
2 Samuel,12,10,"Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’"
2 Samuel,12,11,"Thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will raise up adversity against you from your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun."
2 Samuel,12,12,"For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, before the sun.’”"
2 Samuel,12,13,"So David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.” And Nathan said to David, “The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die."
2 Samuel,12,14,"However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you shall surely die.”"
2 Samuel,12,15,"And the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and it became ill."
2 Samuel,12,16,"David therefore pleaded with God for the child, and David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground."
2 Samuel,12,17,"So the elders of his house arose and went to him, to raise him up from the ground. But he would not, nor did he eat food with them."
2 Samuel,12,18,"Then on the seventh day it came to pass that the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead. For they said, “Indeed, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not heed our voice. How can we tell him that the child is dead? He may do some harm!”"
2 Samuel,12,19,"When David saw that his servants were whispering, David perceived that the child was dead. Therefore David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” And they said, “He is dead.”"
2 Samuel,12,20,"So David arose from the ground, washed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house; and when he requested, they set food before him, and he ate."
2 Samuel,12,21,"Then his servants said to him, “What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child died, you arose and ate food.”"
2 Samuel,12,22,"And he said, “While the child was alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who can tell whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?’"
2 Samuel,12,23,"But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.”"
2 Samuel,12,24,"Then David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her and lay with her. So she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. Now the LORD loved him,"
2 Samuel,12,25,"and He sent word by the hand of Nathan the prophet: So he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD."
2 Samuel,12,26,"Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the people of Ammon, and took the royal city."
2 Samuel,12,27,"And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah, and I have taken the city’s water supply."
2 Samuel,12,28,"Now therefore, gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called after my name.”"
2 Samuel,12,29,"So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, fought against it, and took it."
2 Samuel,12,30,"Then he took their king’s crown from his head. Its weight was a talent of gold, with precious stones. And it was set on David’s head. Also he brought out the spoil of the city in great abundance."
2 Samuel,12,31,"And he brought out the people who were in it, and put them to work with saws and iron picks and iron axes, and made them cross over to the brick works. So he did to all the cities of the people of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,13,1,"After this Absalom the son of David had a lovely sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her."
2 Samuel,13,2,Amnon was so distressed over his sister Tamar that he became sick; for she was a virgin. And it was improper for Amnon to do anything to her.
2 Samuel,13,3,"But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother. Now Jonadab was a very crafty man."
2 Samuel,13,4,"And he said to him, “Why are you, the king’s son, becoming thinner day after day? Will you not tell me?” Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”"
2 Samuel,13,5,"So Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me food, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.’”"
2 Samuel,13,6,"Then Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let Tamar my sister come and make a couple of cakes for me in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”"
2 Samuel,13,7,"And David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Now go to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.”"
2 Samuel,13,8,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was lying down. Then she took flour and kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes."
2 Samuel,13,9,"And she took the pan and placed them out before him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said, “Have everyone go out from me.” And they all went out from him."
2 Samuel,13,10,"Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom, that I may eat from your hand.” And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them to Amnon her brother in the bedroom."
2 Samuel,13,11,"Now when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister.”"
2 Samuel,13,12,"But she answered him, “No, my brother, do not force me, for no such thing should be done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing!"
2 Samuel,13,13,"And I, where could I take my shame? And as for you, you would be like one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.”"
2 Samuel,13,14,"However, he would not heed her voice; and being stronger than she, he forced her and lay with her."
2 Samuel,13,15,"Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, “Arise, be gone!”"
2 Samuel,13,16,"So she said to him, “No, indeed! This evil of sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me.” But he would not listen to her."
2 Samuel,13,17,"Then he called his servant who attended him, and said, “Here! Put this woman out, away from me, and bolt the door behind her.”"
2 Samuel,13,18,"Now she had on a robe of many colors, for the king’s virgin daughters wore such apparel. And his servant put her out and bolted the door behind her."
2 Samuel,13,19,"Then Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her robe of many colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head and went away crying bitterly."
2 Samuel,13,20,"And Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this thing to heart.” So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house."
2 Samuel,13,21,"But when King David heard of all these things, he was very angry."
2 Samuel,13,22,"And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad. For Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar."
2 Samuel,13,23,"And it came to pass, after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is near Ephraim; so Absalom invited all the king’s sons."
2 Samuel,13,24,"Then Absalom came to the king and said, “Kindly note, your servant has sheepshearers; please, let the king and his servants go with your servant.”"
2 Samuel,13,25,"But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, let us not all go now, lest we be a burden to you.” Then he urged him, but he would not go; and he blessed him."
2 Samuel,13,26,"Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.” And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”"
2 Samuel,13,27,But Absalom urged him; so he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.
2 Samuel,13,28,"Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, “Watch now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon!’ then kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and valiant.”"
2 Samuel,13,29,"So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and each one got on his mule and fled."
2 Samuel,13,30,"And it came to pass, while they were on the way, that news came to David, saying, “Absalom has killed all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left!”"
2 Samuel,13,31,"So the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the ground, and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn."
2 Samuel,13,32,"Then Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered and said, “Let not my lord suppose they have killed all the young men, the king’s sons, for only Amnon is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar."
2 Samuel,13,33,"Now therefore, let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead. For only Amnon is dead.”"
2 Samuel,13,34,"Then Absalom fled. And the young man who was keeping watch lifted his eyes and looked, and there, many people were coming from the road on the hillside behind him."
2 Samuel,13,35,"And Jonadab said to the king, “Look, the king’s sons are coming; as your servant said, so it is.”"
2 Samuel,13,36,"So it was, as soon as he had finished speaking, that the king’s sons indeed came, and they lifted up their voice and wept. Also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly."
2 Samuel,13,37,"But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day."
2 Samuel,13,38,"So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there three years."
2 Samuel,13,39,"And King David longed to go to Absalom. For he had been comforted concerning Amnon, because he was dead."
2 Samuel,14,1,So Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was concerned about Absalom.
2 Samuel,14,2,"And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman, and said to her, “Please pretend to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel; do not anoint yourself with oil, but act like a woman who has been mourning a long time for the dead."
2 Samuel,14,3,Go to the king and speak to him in this manner.” So Joab put the words in her mouth.
2 Samuel,14,4,"And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself, and said, “Help, O king!”"
2 Samuel,14,5,"Then the king said to her, “What troubles you?” And she answered, “Indeed I am a widow, my husband is dead."
2 Samuel,14,6,"Now your maidservant had two sons; and the two fought with each other in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one struck the other and killed him."
2 Samuel,14,7,"And now the whole family has risen up against your maidservant, and they said, ‘Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may execute him for the life of his brother whom he killed; and we will destroy the heir also.’ So they would extinguish my ember that is left, and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the earth.”"
2 Samuel,14,8,"Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.”"
2 Samuel,14,9,"And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, O king, let the iniquity be on me and on my father’s house, and the king and his throne be guiltless.”"
2 Samuel,14,10,"So the king said, “Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you anymore.”"
2 Samuel,14,11,"Then she said, “Please let the king remember the LORD your God, and do not permit the avenger of blood to destroy anymore, lest they destroy my son.” And he said, “As the LORD lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.”"
2 Samuel,14,12,"Therefore the woman said, “Please, let your maidservant speak another word to my lord the king.” And he said, “Say on.”"
2 Samuel,14,13,"So the woman said: “Why then have you schemed such a thing against the people of God? For the king speaks this thing as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring his banished one home again."
2 Samuel,14,14,"For we will surely die and become like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not take away a life; but He devises means, so that His banished ones are not expelled from Him."
2 Samuel,14,15,"Now therefore, I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. And your maidservant said, ‘I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his maidservant."
2 Samuel,14,16,For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God.’
2 Samuel,14,17,"Your maidservant said, ‘The word of my lord the king will now be comforting; for as the angel of God, so is my lord the king in discerning good and evil. And may the LORD your God be with you.’”"
2 Samuel,14,18,"Then the king answered and said to the woman, “Please do not hide from me anything that I ask you.” And the woman said, “Please, let my lord the king speak.”"
2 Samuel,14,19,"So the king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” And the woman answered and said, “As you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. For your servant Joab commanded me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant."
2 Samuel,14,20,"To bring about this change of affairs your servant Joab has done this thing; but my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of the angel of God, to know everything that is in the earth.”"
2 Samuel,14,21,"And the king said to Joab, “All right, I have granted this thing. Go therefore, bring back the young man Absalom.”"
2 Samuel,14,22,"Then Joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself, and thanked the king. And Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has fulfilled the request of his servant.”"
2 Samuel,14,23,"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,14,24,"And the king said, “Let him return to his own house, but do not let him see my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house, but did not see the king’s face."
2 Samuel,14,25,Now in all Israel there was no one who was praised as much as Absalom for his good looks. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
2 Samuel,14,26,"And when he cut the hair of his head—at the end of every year he cut it because it was heavy on him—when he cut it, he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels according to the king’s standard."
2 Samuel,14,27,"To Absalom were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a woman of beautiful appearance."
2 Samuel,14,28,"And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, but did not see the king’s face."
2 Samuel,14,29,"Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. And when he sent again the second time, he would not come."
2 Samuel,14,30,"So he said to his servants, “See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.” And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire."
2 Samuel,14,31,"Then Joab arose and came to Absalom’s house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?”"
2 Samuel,14,32,"And Absalom answered Joab, “Look, I sent to you, saying, ‘Come here, so that I may send you to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still.”’ Now therefore, let me see the king’s face; but if there is iniquity in me, let him execute me.”"
2 Samuel,14,33,"So Joab went to the king and told him. And when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king. Then the king kissed Absalom."
2 Samuel,15,1,"After this it happened that Absalom provided himself with chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him."
2 Samuel,15,2,"Now Absalom would rise early and stand beside the way to the gate. So it was, whenever anyone who had a lawsuit came to the king for a decision, that Absalom would call to him and say, “What city are you from?” And he would say, “Your servant is from such and such a tribe of Israel.”"
2 Samuel,15,3,"Then Absalom would say to him, “Look, your case is good and right; but there is no deputy of the king to hear you.”"
2 Samuel,15,4,"Moreover Absalom would say, “Oh, that I were made judge in the land, and everyone who has any suit or cause would come to me; then I would give him justice.”"
2 Samuel,15,5,"And so it was, whenever anyone came near to bow down to him, that he would put out his hand and take him and kiss him."
2 Samuel,15,6,In this manner Absalom acted toward all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
2 Samuel,15,7,"Now it came to pass after forty years that Absalom said to the king, “Please, let me go to Hebron and pay the vow which I made to the LORD."
2 Samuel,15,8,"For your servant took a vow while I dwelt at Geshur in Syria, saying, ‘If the LORD indeed brings me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.’”"
2 Samuel,15,9,"And the king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he arose and went to Hebron."
2 Samuel,15,10,"Then Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom reigns in Hebron!’”"
2 Samuel,15,11,"And with Absalom went two hundred men invited from Jerusalem, and they went along innocently and did not know anything."
2 Samuel,15,12,"Then Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city—from Giloh—while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy grew strong, for the people with Absalom continually increased in number."
2 Samuel,15,13,"Now a messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.”"
2 Samuel,15,14,"So David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise, and let us flee, or we shall not escape from Absalom. Make haste to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly and bring disaster upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.”"
2 Samuel,15,15,"And the king’s servants said to the king, “We are your servants, ready to do whatever my lord the king commands.”"
2 Samuel,15,16,"Then the king went out with all his household after him. But the king left ten women, concubines, to keep the house."
2 Samuel,15,17,"And the king went out with all the people after him, and stopped at the outskirts."
2 Samuel,15,18,"Then all his servants passed before him; and all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had followed him from Gath, passed before the king."
2 Samuel,15,19,"Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why are you also going with us? Return and remain with the king. For you are a foreigner and also an exile from your own place."
2 Samuel,15,20,"In fact, you came only yesterday. Should I make you wander up and down with us today, since I go I know not where? Return, and take your brethren back. Mercy and truth be with you.”"
2 Samuel,15,21,"But Ittai answered the king and said, “As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in whatever place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also your servant will be.”"
2 Samuel,15,22,"So David said to Ittai, “Go, and cross over.” Then Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the little ones who were with him crossed over."
2 Samuel,15,23,"And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people crossed over. The king himself also crossed over the Brook Kidron, and all the people crossed over toward the way of the wilderness."
2 Samuel,15,24,"There was Zadok also, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar went up until all the people had finished crossing over from the city."
2 Samuel,15,25,"Then the king said to Zadok, “Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, He will bring me back and show me both it and His dwelling place."
2 Samuel,15,26,"But if He says thus: ‘I have no delight in you,’ here I am, let Him do to me as seems good to Him.”"
2 Samuel,15,27,"The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar."
2 Samuel,15,28,"See, I will wait in the plains of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.”"
2 Samuel,15,29,Therefore Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem. And they remained there.
2 Samuel,15,30,"So David went up by the Ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered and went barefoot. And all the people who were with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went up."
2 Samuel,15,31,"Then someone told David, saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” And David said, “O LORD, I pray, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!”"
2 Samuel,15,32,"Now it happened when David had come to the top of the mountain, where he worshiped God—there was Hushai the Archite coming to meet him with his robe torn and dust on his head."
2 Samuel,15,33,"David said to him, “If you go on with me, then you will become a burden to me."
2 Samuel,15,34,"But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king; as I was your father’s servant previously, so I will now also be your servant,’ then you may defeat the counsel of Ahithophel for me."
2 Samuel,15,35,"And do you not have Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? Therefore it will be that whatever you hear from the king’s house, you shall tell to Zadok and Abiathar the priests."
2 Samuel,15,36,"Indeed they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by them you shall send me everything you hear.”"
2 Samuel,15,37,"So Hushai, David’s friend, went into the city. And Absalom came into Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,16,1,"When David was a little past the top of the mountain, there was Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth, who met him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred clusters of raisins, one hundred summer fruits, and a skin of wine."
2 Samuel,16,2,"And the king said to Ziba, “What do you mean to do with these?” So Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for those who are faint in the wilderness to drink.”"
2 Samuel,16,3,"Then the king said, “And where is your master’s son?” And Ziba said to the king, “Indeed he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.’”"
2 Samuel,16,4,"So the king said to Ziba, “Here, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.” And Ziba said, “I humbly bow before you, that I may find favor in your sight, my lord, O king!”"
2 Samuel,16,5,"Now when King David came to Bahurim, there was a man from the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei the son of Gera, coming from there. He came out, cursing continuously as he came."
2 Samuel,16,6,And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David. And all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
2 Samuel,16,7,"Also Shimei said thus when he cursed: “Come out! Come out! You bloodthirsty man, you rogue!"
2 Samuel,16,8,"The LORD has brought upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son. So now you are caught in your own evil, because you are a bloodthirsty man!”"
2 Samuel,16,9,"Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please, let me go over and take off his head!”"
2 Samuel,16,10,"But the king said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the LORD has said to him, ‘Curse David.’ Who then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’”"
2 Samuel,16,11,"And David said to Abishai and all his servants, “See how my son who came from my own body seeks my life. How much more now may this Benjamite? Let him alone, and let him curse; for so the LORD has ordered him."
2 Samuel,16,12,"It may be that the LORD will look on my affliction, and that the LORD will repay me with good for his cursing this day.”"
2 Samuel,16,13,"And as David and his men went along the road, Shimei went along the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went, threw stones at him and kicked up dust."
2 Samuel,16,14,Now the king and all the people who were with him became weary; so they refreshed themselves there.
2 Samuel,16,15,"Meanwhile Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem; and Ahithophel was with him."
2 Samuel,16,16,"And so it was, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”"
2 Samuel,16,17,"So Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?”"
2 Samuel,16,18,"And Hushai said to Absalom, “No, but whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel choose, his I will be, and with him I will remain."
2 Samuel,16,19,"Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father’s presence, so will I be in your presence.”"
2 Samuel,16,20,"Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give advice as to what we should do.”"
2 Samuel,16,21,"And Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.”"
2 Samuel,16,22,"So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel."
2 Samuel,16,23,"Now the advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if one had inquired at the oracle of God. So was all the advice of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom."
2 Samuel,17,1,"Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Now let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue David tonight."
2 Samuel,17,2,"I will come upon him while he is weary and weak, and make him afraid. And all the people who are with him will flee, and I will strike only the king."
2 Samuel,17,3,"Then I will bring back all the people to you. When all return except the man whom you seek, all the people will be at peace.”"
2 Samuel,17,4,And the saying pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
2 Samuel,17,5,"Then Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he says too.”"
2 Samuel,17,6,"And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, “Ahithophel has spoken in this manner. Shall we do as he says? If not, speak up.”"
2 Samuel,17,7,So Hushai said to Absalom: “The advice that Ahithophel has given is not good at this time.
2 Samuel,17,8,"For,” said Hushai, “you know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are enraged in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field; and your father is a man of war, and will not camp with the people."
2 Samuel,17,9,"Surely by now he is hidden in some pit, or in some other place. And it will be, when some of them are overthrown at the first, that whoever hears it will say, ‘There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.’"
2 Samuel,17,10,"And even he who is valiant, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will melt completely. For all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men."
2 Samuel,17,11,"Therefore I advise that all Israel be fully gathered to you, from Dan to Beersheba, like the sand that is by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person."
2 Samuel,17,12,"So we will come upon him in some place where he may be found, and we will fall on him as the dew falls on the ground. And of him and all the men who are with him there shall not be left so much as one."
2 Samuel,17,13,"Moreover, if he has withdrawn into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city; and we will pull it into the river, until there is not one small stone found there.”"
2 Samuel,17,14,"So Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than the advice of Ahithophel.” For the LORD had purposed to defeat the good advice of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring disaster on Absalom."
2 Samuel,17,15,"Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, “Thus and so Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and so I have advised."
2 Samuel,17,16,"Now therefore, send quickly and tell David, saying, ‘Do not spend this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily cross over, lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.’”"
2 Samuel,17,17,"Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed at En Rogel, for they dared not be seen coming into the city; so a female servant would come and tell them, and they would go and tell King David."
2 Samuel,17,18,"Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom. But both of them went away quickly and came to a man’s house in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down into it."
2 Samuel,17,19,"Then the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth, and spread ground grain on it; and the thing was not known."
2 Samuel,17,20,"And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house, they said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” So the woman said to them, “They have gone over the water brook.” And when they had searched and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,17,21,"Now it came to pass, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well and went and told King David, and said to David, “Arise and cross over the water quickly. For thus has Ahithophel advised against you.”"
2 Samuel,17,22,So David and all the people who were with him arose and crossed over the Jordan. By morning light not one of them was left who had not gone over the Jordan.
2 Samuel,17,23,"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father’s tomb."
2 Samuel,17,24,"Then David went to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him."
2 Samuel,17,25,"And Absalom made Amasa captain of the army instead of Joab. This Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Jithra, an Israelite, who had gone in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother."
2 Samuel,17,26,So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
2 Samuel,17,27,"Now it happened, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the people of Ammon, Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim,"
2 Samuel,17,28,"brought beds and basins, earthen vessels and wheat, barley and flour, parched grain and beans, lentils and parched seeds,"
2 Samuel,17,29,"honey and curds, sheep and cheese of the herd, for David and the people who were with him to eat. For they said, “The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.”"
2 Samuel,18,1,"And David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them."
2 Samuel,18,2,"Then David sent out one third of the people under the hand of Joab, one third under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and one third under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, “I also will surely go out with you myself.”"
2 Samuel,18,3,"But the people answered, “You shall not go out! For if we flee away, they will not care about us; nor if half of us die, will they care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us now. For you are now more help to us in the city.”"
2 Samuel,18,4,"Then the king said to them, “Whatever seems best to you I will do.” So the king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands."
2 Samuel,18,5,"Now the king had commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom.” And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains orders concerning Absalom."
2 Samuel,18,6,So the people went out into the field of battle against Israel. And the battle was in the woods of Ephraim.
2 Samuel,18,7,"The people of Israel were overthrown there before the servants of David, and a great slaughter of twenty thousand took place there that day."
2 Samuel,18,8,"For the battle there was scattered over the face of the whole countryside, and the woods devoured more people that day than the sword devoured."
2 Samuel,18,9,"Then Absalom met the servants of David. Absalom rode on a mule. The mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth tree, and his head caught in the terebinth; so he was left hanging between heaven and earth. And the mule which was under him went on."
2 Samuel,18,10,"Now a certain man saw it and told Joab, and said, “I just saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth tree!”"
2 Samuel,18,11,"So Joab said to the man who told him, “You just saw him! And why did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a belt.”"
2 Samuel,18,12,"But the man said to Joab, “Though I were to receive a thousand shekels of silver in my hand, I would not raise my hand against the king’s son. For in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Beware lest anyone touch the young man Absalom!’"
2 Samuel,18,13,"Otherwise I would have dealt falsely against my own life. For there is nothing hidden from the king, and you yourself would have set yourself against me.”"
2 Samuel,18,14,"Then Joab said, “I cannot linger with you.” And he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through Absalom’s heart, while he was still alive in the midst of the terebinth tree."
2 Samuel,18,15,"And ten young men who bore Joab’s armor surrounded Absalom, and struck and killed him."
2 Samuel,18,16,"So Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel. For Joab held back the people."
2 Samuel,18,17,"And they took Absalom and cast him into a large pit in the woods, and laid a very large heap of stones over him. Then all Israel fled, everyone to his tent."
2 Samuel,18,18,"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up a pillar for himself, which is in the King’s Valley. For he said, “I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.” He called the pillar after his own name. And to this day it is called Absalom’s Monument."
2 Samuel,18,19,"Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Let me run now and take the news to the king, how the LORD has avenged him of his enemies.”"
2 Samuel,18,20,"And Joab said to him, “You shall not take the news this day, for you shall take the news another day. But today you shall take no news, because the king’s son is dead.”"
2 Samuel,18,21,"Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” So the Cushite bowed himself to Joab and ran."
2 Samuel,18,22,"And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, “But whatever happens, please let me also run after the Cushite.” So Joab said, “Why will you run, my son, since you have no news ready?”"
2 Samuel,18,23,"“But whatever happens,” he said, “let me run.” So he said to him, “Run.” Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain, and outran the Cushite."
2 Samuel,18,24,"Now David was sitting between the two gates. And the watchman went up to the roof over the gate, to the wall, lifted his eyes and looked, and there was a man, running alone."
2 Samuel,18,25,"Then the watchman cried out and told the king. And the king said, “If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.” And he came rapidly and drew near."
2 Samuel,18,26,"Then the watchman saw another man running, and the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said, “There is another man, running alone!” And the king said, “He also brings news.”"
2 Samuel,18,27,"So the watchman said, “I think the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” And the king said, “He is a good man, and comes with good news.”"
2 Samuel,18,28,"So Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, “All is well!” Then he bowed down with his face to the earth before the king, and said, “Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king!”"
2 Samuel,18,29,"The king said, “Is the young man Absalom safe?” Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant and me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I did not know what it was about.”"
2 Samuel,18,30,"And the king said, “Turn aside and stand here.” So he turned aside and stood still."
2 Samuel,18,31,"Just then the Cushite came, and the Cushite said, “There is good news, my lord the king! For the LORD has avenged you this day of all those who rose against you.”"
2 Samuel,18,32,"And the king said to the Cushite, “Is the young man Absalom safe?” So the Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise against you to do harm, be like that young man!”"
2 Samuel,18,33,"Then the king was deeply moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went, he said thus: “O my son Absalom—my son, my son Absalom—if only I had died in your place! O Absalom my son, my son!”"
2 Samuel,19,1,"And Joab was told, “Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.”"
2 Samuel,19,2,"So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the people. For the people heard it said that day, “The king is grieved for his son.”"
2 Samuel,19,3,"And the people stole back into the city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle."
2 Samuel,19,4,"But the king covered his face, and the king cried out with a loud voice, “O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!”"
2 Samuel,19,5,"Then Joab came into the house to the king, and said, “Today you have disgraced all your servants who today have saved your life, the lives of your sons and daughters, the lives of your wives and the lives of your concubines,"
2 Samuel,19,6,"in that you love your enemies and hate your friends. For you have declared today that you regard neither princes nor servants; for today I perceive that if Absalom had lived and all of us had died today, then it would have pleased you well."
2 Samuel,19,7,"Now therefore, arise, go out and speak comfort to your servants. For I swear by the LORD, if you do not go out, not one will stay with you this night. And that will be worse for you than all the evil that has befallen you from your youth until now.”"
2 Samuel,19,8,"Then the king arose and sat in the gate. And they told all the people, saying, “There is the king, sitting in the gate.” So all the people came before the king. For everyone of Israel had fled to his tent."
2 Samuel,19,9,"Now all the people were in a dispute throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king saved us from the hand of our enemies, he delivered us from the hand of the Philistines, and now he has fled from the land because of Absalom."
2 Samuel,19,10,"But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. Now therefore, why do you say nothing about bringing back the king?”"
2 Samuel,19,11,"So King David sent to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house, since the words of all Israel have come to the king, to his very house?"
2 Samuel,19,12,"You are my brethren, you are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?’"
2 Samuel,19,13,"And say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you are not commander of the army before me continually in place of Joab.’”"
2 Samuel,19,14,"So he swayed the hearts of all the men of Judah, just as the heart of one man, so that they sent this word to the king: “Return, you and all your servants!”"
2 Samuel,19,15,"Then the king returned and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to escort the king across the Jordan."
2 Samuel,19,16,"And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, who was from Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David."
2 Samuel,19,17,"There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over the Jordan before the king."
2 Samuel,19,18,Now Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king when he had crossed the Jordan.
2 Samuel,19,19,"Then he said to the king, “Do not let my lord impute iniquity to me, or remember what wrong your servant did on the day that my lord the king left Jerusalem, that the king should take it to heart."
2 Samuel,19,20,"For I, your servant, know that I have sinned. Therefore here I am, the first to come today of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.”"
2 Samuel,19,21,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, “Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’s anointed?”"
2 Samuel,19,22,"And David said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should be adversaries to me today? Shall any man be put to death today in Israel? For do I not know that today I am king over Israel?”"
2 Samuel,19,23,"Therefore the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king swore to him."
2 Samuel,19,24,"Now Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king. And he had not cared for his feet, nor trimmed his mustache, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he returned in peace."
2 Samuel,19,25,"So it was, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, “Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?”"
2 Samuel,19,26,"And he answered, “My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, ‘I will saddle a donkey for myself, that I may ride on it and go to the king,’ because your servant is lame."
2 Samuel,19,27,"And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king, but my lord the king is like the angel of God. Therefore do what is good in your eyes."
2 Samuel,19,28,For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king. Yet you set your servant among those who eat at your own table. Therefore what right have I still to cry out anymore to the king?”
2 Samuel,19,29,"So the king said to him, “Why do you speak anymore of your matters? I have said, ‘You and Ziba divide the land.’”"
2 Samuel,19,30,"Then Mephibosheth said to the king, “Rather, let him take it all, inasmuch as my lord the king has come back in peace to his own house.”"
2 Samuel,19,31,"And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and went across the Jordan with the king, to escort him across the Jordan."
2 Samuel,19,32,"Now Barzillai was a very aged man, eighty years old. And he had provided the king with supplies while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very rich man."
2 Samuel,19,33,"And the king said to Barzillai, “Come across with me, and I will provide for you while you are with me in Jerusalem.”"
2 Samuel,19,34,"But Barzillai said to the king, “How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?"
2 Samuel,19,35,I am today eighty years old. Can I discern between the good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any longer the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be a further burden to my lord the king?
2 Samuel,19,36,Your servant will go a little way across the Jordan with the king. And why should the king repay me with such a reward?
2 Samuel,19,37,"Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, near the grave of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what seems good to you.”"
2 Samuel,19,38,"And the king answered, “Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him what seems good to you. Now whatever you request of me, I will do for you.”"
2 Samuel,19,39,"Then all the people went over the Jordan. And when the king had crossed over, the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own place."
2 Samuel,19,40,"Now the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him. And all the people of Judah escorted the king, and also half the people of Israel."
2 Samuel,19,41,"Just then all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, “Why have our brethren, the men of Judah, stolen you away and brought the king, his household, and all David’s men with him across the Jordan?”"
2 Samuel,19,42,"So all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is a close relative of ours. Why then are you angry over this matter? Have we ever eaten at the king’s expense? Or has he given us any gift?”"
2 Samuel,19,43,"And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, “We have ten shares in the king; therefore we also have more right to David than you. Why then do you despise us—were we not the first to advise bringing back our king?” Yet the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel."
2 Samuel,20,1,"And there happened to be there a rebel, whose name was Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjamite. And he blew a trumpet, and said: “We have no share in David, Nor do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse; Every man to his tents, O Israel!”"
2 Samuel,20,2,"So every man of Israel deserted David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah, from the Jordan as far as Jerusalem, remained loyal to their king."
2 Samuel,20,3,"Now David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten women, his concubines whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in seclusion and supported them, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood."
2 Samuel,20,4,"And the king said to Amasa, “Assemble the men of Judah for me within three days, and be present here yourself.”"
2 Samuel,20,5,So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah. But he delayed longer than the set time which David had appointed him.
2 Samuel,20,6,"And David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom. Take your lord’s servants and pursue him, lest he find for himself fortified cities, and escape us.”"
2 Samuel,20,7,"So Joab’s men, with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty men, went out after him. And they went out of Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri."
2 Samuel,20,8,"When they were at the large stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came before them. Now Joab was dressed in battle armor; on it was a belt with a sword fastened in its sheath at his hips; and as he was going forward, it fell out."
2 Samuel,20,9,"Then Joab said to Amasa, “Are you in health, my brother?” And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him."
2 Samuel,20,10,"But Amasa did not notice the sword that was in Joab’s hand. And he struck him with it in the stomach, and his entrails poured out on the ground; and he did not strike him again. Thus he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri."
2 Samuel,20,11,"Meanwhile one of Joab’s men stood near Amasa, and said, “Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David—follow Joab!”"
2 Samuel,20,12,"But Amasa wallowed in his blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he moved Amasa from the highway to the field and threw a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came upon him halted."
2 Samuel,20,13,"When he was removed from the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri."
2 Samuel,20,14,And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel and Beth Maachah and all the Berites. So they were gathered together and also went after Sheba.
2 Samuel,20,15,"Then they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maachah; and they cast up a siege mound against the city, and it stood by the rampart. And all the people who were with Joab battered the wall to throw it down."
2 Samuel,20,16,"Then a wise woman cried out from the city, “Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, ‘Come nearby, that I may speak with you.’”"
2 Samuel,20,17,"When he had come near to her, the woman said, “Are you Joab?” He answered, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Hear the words of your maidservant.” And he answered, “I am listening.”"
2 Samuel,20,18,"So she spoke, saying, “They used to talk in former times, saying, ‘They shall surely seek guidance at Abel,’ and so they would end disputes."
2 Samuel,20,19,I am among the peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?”
2 Samuel,20,20,"And Joab answered and said, “Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy!"
2 Samuel,20,21,"That is not so. But a man from the mountains of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has raised his hand against the king, against David. Deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.” So the woman said to Joab, “Watch, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.”"
2 Samuel,20,22,"Then the woman in her wisdom went to all the people. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. Then he blew a trumpet, and they withdrew from the city, every man to his tent. So Joab returned to the king at Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,20,23,And Joab was over all the army of Israel; Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites;
2 Samuel,20,24,Adoram was in charge of revenue; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
2 Samuel,20,25,Sheva was scribe; Zadok and Abiathar were the priests;
2 Samuel,20,26,and Ira the Jairite was a chief minister under David.
2 Samuel,21,1,"Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, “It is because of Saul and his bloodthirsty house, because he killed the Gibeonites.”"
2 Samuel,21,2,"So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; the children of Israel had sworn protection to them, but Saul had sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah."
2 Samuel,21,3,"Therefore David said to the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?”"
2 Samuel,21,4,"And the Gibeonites said to him, “We will have no silver or gold from Saul or from his house, nor shall you kill any man in Israel for us.” So he said, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.”"
2 Samuel,21,5,"Then they answered the king, “As for the man who consumed us and plotted against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the territories of Israel,"
2 Samuel,21,6,"let seven men of his descendants be delivered to us, and we will hang them before the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD chose.” And the king said, “I will give them.”"
2 Samuel,21,7,"But the king spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the LORD’s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul."
2 Samuel,21,8,"So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite;"
2 Samuel,21,9,"and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before the LORD. So they fell, all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest."
2 Samuel,21,10,"Now Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until the late rains poured on them from heaven. And she did not allow the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night."
2 Samuel,21,11,"And David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done."
2 Samuel,21,12,"Then David went and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, from the men of Jabesh Gilead who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hung them up, after the Philistines had struck down Saul in Gilboa."
2 Samuel,21,13,So he brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there; and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged.
2 Samuel,21,14,"They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the tomb of Kish his father. So they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God heeded the prayer for the land."
2 Samuel,21,15,"When the Philistines were at war again with Israel, David and his servants with him went down and fought against the Philistines; and David grew faint."
2 Samuel,21,16,"Then Ishbi-Benob, who was one of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose bronze spear was three hundred shekels, who was bearing a new sword, thought he could kill David."
2 Samuel,21,17,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid, and struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “You shall go out no more with us to battle, lest you quench the lamp of Israel.”"
2 Samuel,21,18,"Now it happened afterward that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was one of the sons of the giant."
2 Samuel,21,19,"Again there was war at Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam."
2 Samuel,21,20,"Yet again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also was born to the giant."
2 Samuel,21,21,"So when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him."
2 Samuel,21,22,"These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants."
2 Samuel,22,1,"Then David spoke to the LORD the words of this song, on the day when the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul."
2 Samuel,22,2,And he said: “The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer;
2 Samuel,22,3,"The God of my strength, in whom I will trust; My shield and the horn of my salvation, My stronghold and my refuge; My Savior, You save me from violence."
2 Samuel,22,4,"I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised; So shall I be saved from my enemies."
2 Samuel,22,5,"“When the waves of death surrounded me, The floods of ungodliness made me afraid."
2 Samuel,22,6,The sorrows of Sheol surrounded me; The snares of death confronted me.
2 Samuel,22,7,"In my distress I called upon the LORD, And cried out to my God; He heard my voice from His temple, And my cry entered His ears."
2 Samuel,22,8,"“Then the earth shook and trembled; The foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken, Because He was angry."
2 Samuel,22,9,"Smoke went up from His nostrils, And devouring fire from His mouth; Coals were kindled by it."
2 Samuel,22,10,"He bowed the heavens also, and came down With darkness under His feet."
2 Samuel,22,11,"He rode upon a cherub, and flew; And He was seen upon the wings of the wind."
2 Samuel,22,12,"He made darkness canopies around Him, Dark waters and thick clouds of the skies."
2 Samuel,22,13,From the brightness before Him Coals of fire were kindled.
2 Samuel,22,14,"“The LORD thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered His voice."
2 Samuel,22,15,"He sent out arrows and scattered them; Lightning bolts, and He vanquished them."
2 Samuel,22,16,"Then the channels of the sea were seen, The foundations of the world were uncovered, At the rebuke of the LORD, At the blast of the breath of His nostrils."
2 Samuel,22,17,"“He sent from above, He took me, He drew me out of many waters."
2 Samuel,22,18,"He delivered me from my strong enemy, From those who hated me; For they were too strong for me."
2 Samuel,22,19,"They confronted me in the day of my calamity, But the LORD was my support."
2 Samuel,22,20,He also brought me out into a broad place; He delivered me because He delighted in me.
2 Samuel,22,21,“The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me.
2 Samuel,22,22,"For I have kept the ways of the LORD, And have not wickedly departed from my God."
2 Samuel,22,23,"For all His judgments were before me; And as for His statutes, I did not depart from them."
2 Samuel,22,24,"I was also blameless before Him, And I kept myself from my iniquity."
2 Samuel,22,25,"Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in His eyes."
2 Samuel,22,26,“With the merciful You will show Yourself merciful; With a blameless man You will show Yourself blameless;
2 Samuel,22,27,With the pure You will show Yourself pure; And with the devious You will show Yourself shrewd.
2 Samuel,22,28,"You will save the humble people; But Your eyes are on the haughty, that You may bring them down."
2 Samuel,22,29,"“For You are my lamp, O LORD; The LORD shall enlighten my darkness."
2 Samuel,22,30,For by You I can run against a troop; By my God I can leap over a wall.
2 Samuel,22,31,"As for God, His way is perfect; The word of the LORD is proven; He is a shield to all who trust in Him."
2 Samuel,22,32,"“For who is God, except the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?"
2 Samuel,22,33,"God is my strength and power, And He makes my way perfect."
2 Samuel,22,34,"He makes my feet like the feet of deer, And sets me on my high places."
2 Samuel,22,35,"He teaches my hands to make war, So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze."
2 Samuel,22,36,“You have also given me the shield of Your salvation; Your gentleness has made me great.
2 Samuel,22,37,You enlarged my path under me; So my feet did not slip.
2 Samuel,22,38,“I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them; Neither did I turn back again till they were destroyed.
2 Samuel,22,39,"And I have destroyed them and wounded them, So that they could not rise; They have fallen under my feet."
2 Samuel,22,40,For You have armed me with strength for the battle; You have subdued under me those who rose against me.
2 Samuel,22,41,"You have also given me the necks of my enemies, So that I destroyed those who hated me."
2 Samuel,22,42,"They looked, but there was none to save; Even to the LORD, but He did not answer them."
2 Samuel,22,43,"Then I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth; I trod them like dirt in the streets, And I spread them out."
2 Samuel,22,44,“You have also delivered me from the strivings of my people; You have kept me as the head of the nations. A people I have not known shall serve me.
2 Samuel,22,45,"The foreigners submit to me; As soon as they hear, they obey me."
2 Samuel,22,46,"The foreigners fade away, And come frightened from their hideouts."
2 Samuel,22,47,"“The LORD lives! Blessed be my Rock! Let God be exalted, The Rock of my salvation!"
2 Samuel,22,48,"It is God who avenges me, And subdues the peoples under me;"
2 Samuel,22,49,He delivers me from my enemies. You also lift me up above those who rise against me; You have delivered me from the violent man.
2 Samuel,22,50,"Therefore I will give thanks to You, O LORD, among the Gentiles, And sing praises to Your name."
2 Samuel,22,51,"“He is the tower of salvation to His king, And shows mercy to His anointed, To David and his descendants forevermore.”"
2 Samuel,23,1,"Now these are the last words of David. Thus says David the son of Jesse; Thus says the man raised up on high, The anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet psalmist of Israel:"
2 Samuel,23,2,"“The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, And His word was on my tongue."
2 Samuel,23,3,"The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me: ‘He who rules over men must be just, Ruling in the fear of God."
2 Samuel,23,4,"And he shall be like the light of the morning when the sun rises, A morning without clouds, Like the tender grass springing out of the earth, By clear shining after rain.’"
2 Samuel,23,5,"“Although my house is not so with God, Yet He has made with me an everlasting covenant, Ordered in all things and secure. For this is all my salvation and all my desire; Will He not make it increase?"
2 Samuel,23,6,"But the sons of rebellion shall all be as thorns thrust away, Because they cannot be taken with hands."
2 Samuel,23,7,"But the man who touches them Must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear, And they shall be utterly burned with fire in their place.”"
2 Samuel,23,8,"These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-Basshebeth the Tachmonite, chief among the captains. He was called Adino the Eznite, because he had killed eight hundred men at one time."
2 Samuel,23,9,"And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel had retreated."
2 Samuel,23,10,"He arose and attacked the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand stuck to the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to plunder."
2 Samuel,23,11,And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines had gathered together into a troop where there was a piece of ground full of lentils. So the people fled from the Philistines.
2 Samuel,23,12,"But he stationed himself in the middle of the field, defended it, and killed the Philistines. So the LORD brought about a great victory."
2 Samuel,23,13,Then three of the thirty chief men went down at harvest time and came to David at the cave of Adullam. And the troop of Philistines encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel,23,14,"David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem."
2 Samuel,23,15,"And David said with longing, “Oh, that someone would give me a drink of the water from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!”"
2 Samuel,23,16,"So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and took it and brought it to David. Nevertheless he would not drink it, but poured it out to the LORD."
2 Samuel,23,17,"And he said, “Far be it from me, O LORD, that I should do this! Is this not the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives?” Therefore he would not drink it. These things were done by the three mighty men."
2 Samuel,23,18,"Now Abishai the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of another three. He lifted his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and won a name among these three."
2 Samuel,23,19,"Was he not the most honored of three? Therefore he became their captain. However, he did not attain to the first three."
2 Samuel,23,20,"Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who had done many deeds. He had killed two lion-like heroes of Moab. He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day."
2 Samuel,23,21,"And he killed an Egyptian, a spectacular man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand; so he went down to him with a staff, wrested the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear."
2 Samuel,23,22,"These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and won a name among three mighty men."
2 Samuel,23,23,"He was more honored than the thirty, but he did not attain to the first three. And David appointed him over his guard."
2 Samuel,23,24,"Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,"
2 Samuel,23,25,"Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,"
2 Samuel,23,26,"Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,"
2 Samuel,23,27,"Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,"
2 Samuel,23,28,"Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,"
2 Samuel,23,29,"Heleb the son of Baanah (the Netophathite), Ittai the son of Ribai from Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,"
2 Samuel,23,30,"Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai from the brooks of Gaash,"
2 Samuel,23,31,"Abi-Albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,"
2 Samuel,23,32,"Eliahba the Shaalbonite (of the sons of Jashen), Jonathan,"
2 Samuel,23,33,"Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,"
2 Samuel,23,34,"Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,"
2 Samuel,23,35,"Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,"
2 Samuel,23,36,"Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,"
2 Samuel,23,37,"Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite (armorbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah),"
2 Samuel,23,38,"Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,"
2 Samuel,23,39,and Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.
2 Samuel,24,1,"Again the anger of the LORD was aroused against Israel, and He moved David against them to say, “Go, number Israel and Judah.”"
2 Samuel,24,2,"So the king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him, “Now go throughout all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and count the people, that I may know the number of the people.”"
2 Samuel,24,3,"And Joab said to the king, “Now may the LORD your God add to the people a hundred times more than there are, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king desire this thing?”"
2 Samuel,24,4,Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the army. Therefore Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to count the people of Israel.
2 Samuel,24,5,"And they crossed over the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the right side of the town which is in the midst of the ravine of Gad, and toward Jazer."
2 Samuel,24,6,Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; they came to Dan Jaan and around to Sidon;
2 Samuel,24,7,and they came to the stronghold of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Then they went out to South Judah as far as Beersheba.
2 Samuel,24,8,"So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days."
2 Samuel,24,9,"Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the king. And there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men."
2 Samuel,24,10,"And David’s heart condemned him after he had numbered the people. So David said to the LORD, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done; but now, I pray, O LORD, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.”"
2 Samuel,24,11,"Now when David arose in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,"
2 Samuel,24,12,"“Go and tell David, ‘Thus says the LORD: “I offer you three things; choose one of them for yourself, that I may do it to you.”’”"
2 Samuel,24,13,"So Gad came to David and told him; and he said to him, “Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or shall you flee three months before your enemies, while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days’ plague in your land? Now consider and see what answer I should take back to Him who sent me.”"
2 Samuel,24,14,"And David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Please let us fall into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”"
2 Samuel,24,15,So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel from the morning till the appointed time. From Dan to Beersheba seventy thousand men of the people died.
2 Samuel,24,16,"And when the angel stretched out His hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented from the destruction, and said to the angel who was destroying the people, “It is enough; now restrain your hand.” And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
2 Samuel,24,17,"Then David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who was striking the people, and said, “Surely I have sinned, and I have done wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, be against me and against my father’s house.”"
2 Samuel,24,18,"And Gad came that day to David and said to him, “Go up, erect an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”"
2 Samuel,24,19,"So David, according to the word of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded."
2 Samuel,24,20,"Now Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming toward him. So Araunah went out and bowed before the king with his face to the ground."
2 Samuel,24,21,"Then Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” And David said, “To buy the threshing floor from you, to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be withdrawn from the people.”"
2 Samuel,24,22,"Now Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up whatever seems good to him. Look, here are oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing implements and the yokes of the oxen for wood."
2 Samuel,24,23,"All these, O king, Araunah has given to the king.” And Araunah said to the king, “May the LORD your God accept you.”"
2 Samuel,24,24,"Then the king said to Araunah, “No, but I will surely buy it from you for a price; nor will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God with that which costs me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver."
2 Samuel,24,25,"And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD heeded the prayers for the land, and the plague was withdrawn from Israel."
1 Kings,1,1,"Now King David was old, advanced in years; and they put covers on him, but he could not get warm."
1 Kings,1,2,"Therefore his servants said to him, “Let a young woman, a virgin, be sought for our lord the king, and let her stand before the king, and let her care for him; and let her lie in your bosom, that our lord the king may be warm.”"
1 Kings,1,3,"So they sought for a lovely young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king."
1 Kings,1,4,"The young woman was very lovely; and she cared for the king, and served him; but the king did not know her."
1 Kings,1,5,"Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king”; and he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him."
1 Kings,1,6,"(And his father had not rebuked him at any time by saying, “Why have you done so?” He was also very good-looking. His mother had borne him after Absalom.)"
1 Kings,1,7,"Then he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they followed and helped Adonijah."
1 Kings,1,8,"But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David were not with Adonijah."
1 Kings,1,9,"And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fattened cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En Rogel; he also invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants."
1 Kings,1,10,"But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or Solomon his brother."
1 Kings,1,11,"So Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, “Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know it?"
1 Kings,1,12,"Come, please, let me now give you advice, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon."
1 Kings,1,13,"Go immediately to King David and say to him, ‘Did you not, my lord, O king, swear to your maidservant, saying, “Assuredly your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne“? Why then has Adonijah become king?’"
1 Kings,1,14,"Then, while you are still talking there with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words.”"
1 Kings,1,15,"So Bathsheba went into the chamber to the king. (Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king.)"
1 Kings,1,16,"And Bathsheba bowed and did homage to the king. Then the king said, “What is your wish?”"
1 Kings,1,17,"Then she said to him, “My lord, you swore by the LORD your God to your maidservant, saying, ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.’"
1 Kings,1,18,"So now, look! Adonijah has become king; and now, my lord the king, you do not know about it."
1 Kings,1,19,"He has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army; but Solomon your servant he has not invited."
1 Kings,1,20,"And as for you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him."
1 Kings,1,21,"Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king rests with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted as offenders.”"
1 Kings,1,22,"And just then, while she was still talking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in."
1 Kings,1,23,"So they told the king, saying, “Here is Nathan the prophet.” And when he came in before the king, he bowed down before the king with his face to the ground."
1 Kings,1,24,"And Nathan said, “My lord, O king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne’?"
1 Kings,1,25,"For he has gone down today, and has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons, and the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and look! They are eating and drinking before him; and they say, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’"
1 Kings,1,26,"But he has not invited me—me your servant—nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon."
1 Kings,1,27,"Has this thing been done by my lord the king, and you have not told your servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”"
1 Kings,1,28,"Then King David answered and said, “Call Bathsheba to me.” So she came into the king’s presence and stood before the king."
1 Kings,1,29,"And the king took an oath and said, “As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from every distress,"
1 Kings,1,30,"just as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,’ so I certainly will do this day.”"
1 Kings,1,31,"Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and paid homage to the king, and said, “Let my lord King David live forever!”"
1 Kings,1,32,"And King David said, “Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” So they came before the king."
1 Kings,1,33,"The king also said to them, “Take with you the servants of your lord, and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and take him down to Gihon."
1 Kings,1,34,"There let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel; and blow the horn, and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’"
1 Kings,1,35,"Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, and he shall be king in my place. For I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.”"
1 Kings,1,36,"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, “Amen! May the LORD God of my lord the king say so too."
1 Kings,1,37,"As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so may He be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.”"
1 Kings,1,38,"So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David’s mule, and took him to Gihon."
1 Kings,1,39,"Then Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. And they blew the horn, and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!”"
1 Kings,1,40,"And all the people went up after him; and the people played the flutes and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth seemed to split with their sound."
1 Kings,1,41,"Now Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the horn, he said, “Why is the city in such a noisy uproar?”"
1 Kings,1,42,"While he was still speaking, there came Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest. And Adonijah said to him, “Come in, for you are a prominent man, and bring good news.”"
1 Kings,1,43,"Then Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, “No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king."
1 Kings,1,44,"The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have made him ride on the king’s mule."
1 Kings,1,45,"So Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon; and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that you have heard."
1 Kings,1,46,Also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.
1 Kings,1,47,"And moreover the king’s servants have gone to bless our lord King David, saying, ‘May God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and may He make his throne greater than your throne.’ Then the king bowed himself on the bed."
1 Kings,1,48,"Also the king said thus, ‘Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, while my eyes see it!’”"
1 Kings,1,49,"So all the guests who were with Adonijah were afraid, and arose, and each one went his way."
1 Kings,1,50,"Now Adonijah was afraid of Solomon; so he arose, and went and took hold of the horns of the altar."
1 Kings,1,51,"And it was told Solomon, saying, “Indeed Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon; for look, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’”"
1 Kings,1,52,"Then Solomon said, “If he proves himself a worthy man, not one hair of him shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die.”"
1 Kings,1,53,"So King Solomon sent them to bring him down from the altar. And he came and fell down before King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”"
1 Kings,2,1,"Now the days of David drew near that he should die, and he charged Solomon his son, saying:"
1 Kings,2,2,"“I go the way of all the earth; be strong, therefore, and prove yourself a man."
1 Kings,2,3,"And keep the charge of the LORD your God: to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commandments, His judgments, and His testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn;"
1 Kings,2,4,"that the LORD may fulfill His word which He spoke concerning me, saying, ‘If your sons take heed to their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul,’ He said, ‘you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’"
1 Kings,2,5,"“Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner and Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed. And he shed the blood of war in peacetime, and put the blood of war on his belt that was around his waist, and on his sandals that were on his feet."
1 Kings,2,6,"Therefore do according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray hair go down to the grave in peace."
1 Kings,2,7,"“But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table, for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother."
1 Kings,2,8,"“And see, you have with you Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite from Bahurim, who cursed me with a malicious curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, ‘I will not put you to death with the sword.’"
1 Kings,2,9,"Now therefore, do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man and know what you ought to do to him; but bring his gray hair down to the grave with blood.”"
1 Kings,2,10,"So David rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David."
1 Kings,2,11,"The period that David reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years."
1 Kings,2,12,Then Solomon sat on the throne of his father David; and his kingdom was firmly established.
1 Kings,2,13,"Now Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. So she said, “Do you come peaceably?” And he said, “Peaceably.”"
1 Kings,2,14,"Moreover he said, “I have something to say to you.” And she said, “Say it.”"
1 Kings,2,15,"Then he said, “You know that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had set their expectations on me, that I should reign. However, the kingdom has been turned over, and has become my brother’s; for it was his from the LORD."
1 Kings,2,16,"Now I ask one petition of you; do not deny me.” And she said to him, “Say it.”"
1 Kings,2,17,"Then he said, “Please speak to King Solomon, for he will not refuse you, that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.”"
1 Kings,2,18,"So Bathsheba said, “Very well, I will speak for you to the king.”"
1 Kings,2,19,"Bathsheba therefore went to King Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her and bowed down to her, and sat down on his throne and had a throne set for the king’s mother; so she sat at his right hand."
1 Kings,2,20,"Then she said, “I desire one small petition of you; do not refuse me.” And the king said to her, “Ask it, my mother, for I will not refuse you.”"
1 Kings,2,21,"So she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.”"
1 Kings,2,22,"And King Solomon answered and said to his mother, “Now why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also—for he is my older brother—for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.”"
1 Kings,2,23,"Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, “May God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life!"
1 Kings,2,24,"Now therefore, as the LORD lives, who has confirmed me and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has established a house for me, as He promised, Adonijah shall be put to death today!”"
1 Kings,2,25,"So King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he struck him down, and he died."
1 Kings,2,26,"And to Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go to Anathoth, to your own fields, for you are deserving of death; but I will not put you to death at this time, because you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before my father David, and because you were afflicted every time my father was afflicted.”"
1 Kings,2,27,"So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the LORD, that he might fulfill the word of the LORD which He spoke concerning the house of Eli at Shiloh."
1 Kings,2,28,"Then news came to Joab, for Joab had defected to Adonijah, though he had not defected to Absalom. So Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and took hold of the horns of the altar."
1 Kings,2,29,"And King Solomon was told, “Joab has fled to the tabernacle of the LORD; there he is, by the altar.” Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, strike him down.”"
1 Kings,2,30,"So Benaiah went to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said to him, “Thus says the king, ‘Come out!’” And he said, “No, but I will die here.” And Benaiah brought back word to the king, saying, “Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.”"
1 Kings,2,31,"Then the king said to him, “Do as he has said, and strike him down and bury him, that you may take away from me and from the house of my father the innocent blood which Joab shed."
1 Kings,2,32,"So the LORD will return his blood on his head, because he struck down two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword—Abner the son of Ner, the commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, the commander of the army of Judah—though my father David did not know it."
1 Kings,2,33,"Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his descendants forever. But upon David and his descendants, upon his house and his throne, there shall be peace forever from the LORD.”"
1 Kings,2,34,So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
1 Kings,2,35,"The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army, and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar."
1 Kings,2,36,"Then the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and do not go out from there anywhere."
1 Kings,2,37,"For it shall be, on the day you go out and cross the Brook Kidron, know for certain you shall surely die; your blood shall be on your own head.”"
1 Kings,2,38,"And Shimei said to the king, “The saying is good. As my lord the king has said, so your servant will do.” So Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days."
1 Kings,2,39,"Now it happened at the end of three years, that two slaves of Shimei ran away to Achish the son of Maachah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, “Look, your slaves are in Gath!”"
1 Kings,2,40,"So Shimei arose, saddled his donkey, and went to Achish at Gath to seek his slaves. And Shimei went and brought his slaves from Gath."
1 Kings,2,41,And Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had come back.
1 Kings,2,42,"Then the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the LORD, and warn you, saying, ‘Know for certain that on the day you go out and travel anywhere, you shall surely die’? And you said to me, ‘The word I have heard is good.’"
1 Kings,2,43,Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD and the commandment that I gave you?”
1 Kings,2,44,"The king said moreover to Shimei, “You know, as your heart acknowledges, all the wickedness that you did to my father David; therefore the LORD will return your wickedness on your own head."
1 Kings,2,45,"But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever.”"
1 Kings,2,46,"So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out and struck him down, and he died. Thus the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon."
1 Kings,3,1,"Now Solomon made a treaty with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and married Pharaoh’s daughter; then he brought her to the City of David until he had finished building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall all around Jerusalem."
1 Kings,3,2,"Meanwhile the people sacrificed at the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the LORD until those days."
1 Kings,3,3,"And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of his father David, except that he sacrificed and burned incense at the high places."
1 Kings,3,4,"Now the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place: Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar."
1 Kings,3,5,"At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, “Ask! What shall I give you?”"
1 Kings,3,6,"And Solomon said: “You have shown great mercy to Your servant David my father, because he walked before You in truth, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with You; You have continued this great kindness for him, and You have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day."
1 Kings,3,7,"Now, O LORD my God, You have made Your servant king instead of my father David, but I am a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in."
1 Kings,3,8,"And Your servant is in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen, a great people, too numerous to be numbered or counted."
1 Kings,3,9,"Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?”"
1 Kings,3,10,"The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing."
1 Kings,3,11,"Then God said to him: “Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked long life for yourself, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice,"
1 Kings,3,12,"behold, I have done according to your words; see, I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has not been anyone like you before you, nor shall any like you arise after you."
1 Kings,3,13,"And I have also given you what you have not asked: both riches and honor, so that there shall not be anyone like you among the kings all your days."
1 Kings,3,14,"So if you walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.”"
1 Kings,3,15,"Then Solomon awoke; and indeed it had been a dream. And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, offered up burnt offerings, offered peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants."
1 Kings,3,16,"Now two women who were harlots came to the king, and stood before him."
1 Kings,3,17,"And one woman said, “O my lord, this woman and I dwell in the same house; and I gave birth while she was in the house."
1 Kings,3,18,"Then it happened, the third day after I had given birth, that this woman also gave birth. And we were together; no one was with us in the house, except the two of us in the house."
1 Kings,3,19,"And this woman’s son died in the night, because she lay on him."
1 Kings,3,20,"So she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from my side, while your maidservant slept, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom."
1 Kings,3,21,"And when I rose in the morning to nurse my son, there he was, dead. But when I had examined him in the morning, indeed, he was not my son whom I had borne.”"
1 Kings,3,22,"Then the other woman said, “No! But the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son.” And the first woman said, “No! But the dead one is your son, and the living one is my son.” Thus they spoke before the king."
1 Kings,3,23,"And the king said, “The one says, ‘This is my son, who lives, and your son is the dead one’; and the other says, ‘No! But your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.’”"
1 Kings,3,24,"Then the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought a sword before the king."
1 Kings,3,25,"And the king said, “Divide the living child in two, and give half to one, and half to the other.”"
1 Kings,3,26,"Then the woman whose son was living spoke to the king, for she yearned with compassion for her son; and she said, “O my lord, give her the living child, and by no means kill him!” But the other said, “Let him be neither mine nor yours, but divide him.”"
1 Kings,3,27,"So the king answered and said, “Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him; she is his mother.”"
1 Kings,3,28,"And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had rendered; and they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice."
1 Kings,4,1,So King Solomon was king over all Israel.
1 Kings,4,2,"And these were his officials: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;"
1 Kings,4,3,"Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;"
1 Kings,4,4,"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, over the army; Zadok and Abiathar, the priests;"
1 Kings,4,5,"Azariah the son of Nathan, over the officers; Zabud the son of Nathan, a priest and the king’s friend;"
1 Kings,4,6,"Ahishar, over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda, over the labor force."
1 Kings,4,7,"And Solomon had twelve governors over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household; each one made provision for one month of the year."
1 Kings,4,8,"These are their names: Ben-Hur, in the mountains of Ephraim;"
1 Kings,4,9,"Ben-Deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan;"
1 Kings,4,10,"Ben-Hesed, in Arubboth; to him belonged Sochoh and all the land of Hepher;"
1 Kings,4,11,"Ben-Abinadab, in all the regions of Dor; he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as wife;"
1 Kings,4,12,"Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach, Megiddo, and all Beth Shean, which is beside Zaretan below Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as the other side of Jokneam;"
1 Kings,4,13,"Ben-Geber, in Ramoth Gilead; to him belonged the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, in Gilead; to him also belonged the region of Argob in Bashan—sixty large cities with walls and bronze gate-bars;"
1 Kings,4,14,"Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;"
1 Kings,4,15,"Ahimaaz, in Naphtali; he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife;"
1 Kings,4,16,"Baanah the son of Hushai, in Asher and Aloth;"
1 Kings,4,17,"Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;"
1 Kings,4,18,"Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin;"
1 Kings,4,19,"Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan. He was the only governor who was in the land."
1 Kings,4,20,"Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and rejoicing."
1 Kings,4,21,"So Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life."
1 Kings,4,22,"Now Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty kors of fine flour, sixty kors of meal,"
1 Kings,4,23,"ten fatted oxen, twenty oxen from the pastures, and one hundred sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fatted fowl."
1 Kings,4,24,"For he had dominion over all the region on this side of the River from Tiphsah even to Gaza, namely over all the kings on this side of the River; and he had peace on every side all around him."
1 Kings,4,25,"And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, each man under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan as far as Beersheba, all the days of Solomon."
1 Kings,4,26,"Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen."
1 Kings,4,27,"And these governors, each man in his month, provided food for King Solomon and for all who came to King Solomon’s table. There was no lack in their supply."
1 Kings,4,28,"They also brought barley and straw to the proper place, for the horses and steeds, each man according to his charge."
1 Kings,4,29,"And God gave Solomon wisdom and exceedingly great understanding, and largeness of heart like the sand on the seashore."
1 Kings,4,30,Thus Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the men of the East and all the wisdom of Egypt.
1 Kings,4,31,"For he was wiser than all men—than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the surrounding nations."
1 Kings,4,32,"He spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were one thousand and five."
1 Kings,4,33,"Also he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree of Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall; he spoke also of animals, of birds, of creeping things, and of fish."
1 Kings,4,34,"And men of all nations, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom, came to hear the wisdom of Solomon."
1 Kings,5,1,"Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, because he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram had always loved David."
1 Kings,5,2,"Then Solomon sent to Hiram, saying:"
1 Kings,5,3,"You know how my father David could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the wars which were fought against him on every side, until the LORD put his foes under the soles of his feet."
1 Kings,5,4,But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence.
1 Kings,5,5,"And behold, I propose to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to my father David, saying, “Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he shall build the house for My name.”"
1 Kings,5,6,"Now therefore, command that they cut down cedars for me from Lebanon; and my servants will be with your servants, and I will pay you wages for your servants according to whatever you say. For you know there is none among us who has skill to cut timber like the Sidonians."
1 Kings,5,7,"So it was, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, for He has given David a wise son over this great people!"
1 Kings,5,8,"Then Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: I have considered the message which you sent me, and I will do all you desire concerning the cedar and cypress logs."
1 Kings,5,9,"My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea; I will float them in rafts by sea to the place you indicate to me, and will have them broken apart there; then you can take them away. And you shall fulfill my desire by giving food for my household."
1 Kings,5,10,Then Hiram gave Solomon cedar and cypress logs according to all his desire.
1 Kings,5,11,"And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand kors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty kors of pressed oil. Thus Solomon gave to Hiram year by year."
1 Kings,5,12,"So the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as He had promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty together."
1 Kings,5,13,Then King Solomon raised up a labor force out of all Israel; and the labor force was thirty thousand men.
1 Kings,5,14,"And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month in shifts: they were one month in Lebanon and two months at home; Adoniram was in charge of the labor force."
1 Kings,5,15,"Solomon had seventy thousand who carried burdens, and eighty thousand who quarried stone in the mountains,"
1 Kings,5,16,"besides three thousand three hundred from the chiefs of Solomon’s deputies, who supervised the people who labored in the work."
1 Kings,5,17,"And the king commanded them to quarry large stones, costly stones, and hewn stones, to lay the foundation of the temple."
1 Kings,5,18,"So Solomon’s builders, Hiram’s builders, and the Gebalites quarried them; and they prepared timber and stones to build the temple."
1 Kings,6,1,"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD."
1 Kings,6,2,"Now the house which King Solomon built for the LORD, its length was sixty cubits, its width twenty, and its height thirty cubits."
1 Kings,6,3,"The vestibule in front of the sanctuary of the house was twenty cubits long across the width of the house, and the width of the vestibule extended ten cubits from the front of the house."
1 Kings,6,4,And he made for the house windows with beveled frames.
1 Kings,6,5,"Against the wall of the temple he built chambers all around, against the walls of the temple, all around the sanctuary and the inner sanctuary. Thus he made side chambers all around it."
1 Kings,6,6,"The lowest chamber was five cubits wide, the middle was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for he made narrow ledges around the outside of the temple, so that the support beams would not be fastened into the walls of the temple."
1 Kings,6,7,"And the temple, when it was being built, was built with stone finished at the quarry, so that no hammer or chisel or any iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built."
1 Kings,6,8,"The doorway for the middle story was on the right side of the temple. They went up by stairs to the middle story, and from the middle to the third."
1 Kings,6,9,"So he built the temple and finished it, and he paneled the temple with beams and boards of cedar."
1 Kings,6,10,"And he built side chambers against the entire temple, each five cubits high; they were attached to the temple with cedar beams."
1 Kings,6,11,"Then the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying:"
1 Kings,6,12,"“Concerning this temple which you are building, if you walk in My statutes, execute My judgments, keep all My commandments, and walk in them, then I will perform My word with you, which I spoke to your father David."
1 Kings,6,13,"And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel.”"
1 Kings,6,14,So Solomon built the temple and finished it.
1 Kings,6,15,And he built the inside walls of the temple with cedar boards; from the floor of the temple to the ceiling he paneled the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the temple with planks of cypress.
1 Kings,6,16,"Then he built the twenty-cubit room at the rear of the temple, from floor to ceiling, with cedar boards; he built it inside as the inner sanctuary, as the Most Holy Place."
1 Kings,6,17,And in front of it the temple sanctuary was forty cubits long.
1 Kings,6,18,"The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with ornamental buds and open flowers. All was cedar; there was no stone to be seen."
1 Kings,6,19,"And he prepared the inner sanctuary inside the temple, to set the ark of the covenant of the LORD there."
1 Kings,6,20,"The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. He overlaid it with pure gold, and overlaid the altar of cedar."
1 Kings,6,21,"So Solomon overlaid the inside of the temple with pure gold. He stretched gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold."
1 Kings,6,22,"The whole temple he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the temple; also he overlaid with gold the entire altar that was by the inner sanctuary."
1 Kings,6,23,"Inside the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high."
1 Kings,6,24,"One wing of the cherub was five cubits, and the other wing of the cherub five cubits: ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other."
1 Kings,6,25,And the other cherub was ten cubits; both cherubim were of the same size and shape.
1 Kings,6,26,"The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was the other cherub."
1 Kings,6,27,"Then he set the cherubim inside the inner room; and they stretched out the wings of the cherubim so that the wing of the one touched one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall. And their wings touched each other in the middle of the room."
1 Kings,6,28,Also he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1 Kings,6,29,"Then he carved all the walls of the temple all around, both the inner and outer sanctuaries, with carved figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers."
1 Kings,6,30,"And the floor of the temple he overlaid with gold, both the inner and outer sanctuaries."
1 Kings,6,31,For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood; the lintel and doorposts were one-fifth of the wall.
1 Kings,6,32,"The two doors were of olive wood; and he carved on them figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees."
1 Kings,6,33,"So for the door of the sanctuary he also made doorposts of olive wood, one-fourth of the wall."
1 Kings,6,34,"And the two doors were of cypress wood; two panels comprised one folding door, and two panels comprised the other folding door."
1 Kings,6,35,"Then he carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers on them, and overlaid them with gold applied evenly on the carved work."
1 Kings,6,36,And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams.
1 Kings,6,37,"In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid, in the month of Ziv."
1 Kings,6,38,"And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its details and according to all its plans. So he was seven years in building it."
1 Kings,7,1,But Solomon took thirteen years to build his own house; so he finished all his house.
1 Kings,7,2,"He also built the House of the Forest of Lebanon; its length was one hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, with four rows of cedar pillars, and cedar beams on the pillars."
1 Kings,7,3,"And it was paneled with cedar above the beams that were on forty-five pillars, fifteen to a row."
1 Kings,7,4,"There were windows with beveled frames in three rows, and window was opposite window in three tiers."
1 Kings,7,5,And all the doorways and doorposts had rectangular frames; and window was opposite window in three tiers.
1 Kings,7,6,"He also made the Hall of Pillars: its length was fifty cubits, and its width thirty cubits; and in front of them was a portico with pillars, and a canopy was in front of them."
1 Kings,7,7,"Then he made a hall for the throne, the Hall of Judgment, where he might judge; and it was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling."
1 Kings,7,8,"And the house where he dwelt had another court inside the hall, of like workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken as wife."
1 Kings,7,9,"All these were of costly stones cut to size, trimmed with saws, inside and out, from the foundation to the eaves, and also on the outside to the great court."
1 Kings,7,10,"The foundation was of costly stones, large stones, some ten cubits and some eight cubits."
1 Kings,7,11,"And above were costly stones, hewn to size, and cedar wood."
1 Kings,7,12,The great court was enclosed with three rows of hewn stones and a row of cedar beams. So were the inner court of the house of the LORD and the vestibule of the temple.
1 Kings,7,13,Now King Solomon sent and brought Huram from Tyre.
1 Kings,7,14,"He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a bronze worker; he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill in working with all kinds of bronze work. So he came to King Solomon and did all his work."
1 Kings,7,15,"And he cast two pillars of bronze, each one eighteen cubits high, and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of each."
1 Kings,7,16,"Then he made two capitals of cast bronze, to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits."
1 Kings,7,17,"He made a lattice network, with wreaths of chainwork, for the capitals which were on top of the pillars: seven chains for one capital and seven for the other capital."
1 Kings,7,18,"So he made the pillars, and two rows of pomegranates above the network all around to cover the capitals that were on top; and thus he did for the other capital."
1 Kings,7,19,"The capitals which were on top of the pillars in the hall were in the shape of lilies, four cubits."
1 Kings,7,20,"The capitals on the two pillars also had pomegranates above, by the convex surface which was next to the network; and there were two hundred such pomegranates in rows on each of the capitals all around."
1 Kings,7,21,"Then he set up the pillars by the vestibule of the temple; he set up the pillar on the right and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the left and called its name Boaz."
1 Kings,7,22,The tops of the pillars were in the shape of lilies. So the work of the pillars was finished.
1 Kings,7,23,"And he made the Sea of cast bronze, ten cubits from one brim to the other; it was completely round. Its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference."
1 Kings,7,24,"Below its brim were ornamental buds encircling it all around, ten to a cubit, all the way around the Sea. The ornamental buds were cast in two rows when it was cast."
1 Kings,7,25,"It stood on twelve oxen: three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; the Sea was set upon them, and all their back parts pointed inward."
1 Kings,7,26,"It was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It contained two thousand baths."
1 Kings,7,27,"He also made ten carts of bronze; four cubits was the length of each cart, four cubits its width, and three cubits its height."
1 Kings,7,28,"And this was the design of the carts: They had panels, and the panels were between frames;"
1 Kings,7,29,"on the panels that were between the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. And on the frames was a pedestal on top. Below the lions and oxen were wreaths of plaited work."
1 Kings,7,30,"Every cart had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze, and its four feet had supports. Under the laver were supports of cast bronze beside each wreath."
1 Kings,7,31,"Its opening inside the crown at the top was one cubit in diameter; and the opening was round, shaped like a pedestal, one and a half cubits in outside diameter; and also on the opening were engravings, but the panels were square, not round."
1 Kings,7,32,"Under the panels were the four wheels, and the axles of the wheels were joined to the cart. The height of a wheel was one and a half cubits."
1 Kings,7,33,"The workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel; their axle pins, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all of cast bronze."
1 Kings,7,34,And there were four supports at the four corners of each cart; its supports were part of the cart itself.
1 Kings,7,35,"On the top of the cart, at the height of half a cubit, it was perfectly round. And on the top of the cart, its flanges and its panels were of the same casting."
1 Kings,7,36,"On the plates of its flanges and on its panels he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, wherever there was a clear space on each, with wreaths all around."
1 Kings,7,37,"Thus he made the ten carts. All of them were of the same mold, one measure, and one shape."
1 Kings,7,38,"Then he made ten lavers of bronze; each laver contained forty baths, and each laver was four cubits. On each of the ten carts was a laver."
1 Kings,7,39,"And he put five carts on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. He set the Sea on the right side of the house, toward the southeast."
1 Kings,7,40,Huram made the lavers and the shovels and the bowls. So Huram finished doing all the work that he was to do for King Solomon for the house of the LORD:
1 Kings,7,41,"the two pillars, the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the two pillars; the two networks covering the two bowl-shaped capitals which were on top of the pillars;"
1 Kings,7,42,"four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the pillars);"
1 Kings,7,43,"the ten carts, and ten lavers on the carts;"
1 Kings,7,44,"one Sea, and twelve oxen under the Sea;"
1 Kings,7,45,"the pots, the shovels, and the bowls. All these articles which Huram made for King Solomon for the house of the LORD were of burnished bronze."
1 Kings,7,46,"In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in clay molds, between Succoth and Zaretan."
1 Kings,7,47,"And Solomon did not weigh all the articles, because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined."
1 Kings,7,48,"Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold on which was the showbread;"
1 Kings,7,49,"the lampstands of pure gold, five on the right side and five on the left in front of the inner sanctuary, with the flowers and the lamps and the wick-trimmers of gold;"
1 Kings,7,50,"the basins, the trimmers, the bowls, the ladles, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner room (the Most Holy Place) and for the doors of the main hall of the temple."
1 Kings,7,51,So all the work that King Solomon had done for the house of the LORD was finished; and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had dedicated: the silver and the gold and the furnishings. He put them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.
1 Kings,8,1,"Now Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel, to King Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the City of David, which is Zion."
1 Kings,8,2,"Therefore all the men of Israel assembled with King Solomon at the feast in the month of Ethanim, which is the seventh month."
1 Kings,8,3,"So all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark."
1 Kings,8,4,"Then they brought up the ark of the LORD, the tabernacle of meeting, and all the holy furnishings that were in the tabernacle. The priests and the Levites brought them up."
1 Kings,8,5,"Also King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude."
1 Kings,8,6,"Then the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the temple, to the Most Holy Place, under the wings of the cherubim."
1 Kings,8,7,"For the cherubim spread their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles."
1 Kings,8,8,"The poles extended so that the ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place, in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day."
1 Kings,8,9,"Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt."
1 Kings,8,10,"And it came to pass, when the priests came out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,"
1 Kings,8,11,so that the priests could not continue ministering because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.
1 Kings,8,12,Then Solomon spoke: “The LORD said He would dwell in the dark cloud.
1 Kings,8,13,"I have surely built You an exalted house, And a place for You to dwell in forever.”"
1 Kings,8,14,"Then the king turned around and blessed the whole assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing."
1 Kings,8,15,"And he said: “Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth to my father David, and with His hand has fulfilled it, saying,"
1 Kings,8,16,"‘Since the day that I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house, that My name might be there; but I chose David to be over My people Israel.’"
1 Kings,8,17,Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a temple for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
1 Kings,8,18,"But the LORD said to my father David, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build a temple for My name, you did well that it was in your heart."
1 Kings,8,19,"Nevertheless you shall not build the temple, but your son who will come from your body, he shall build the temple for My name.’"
1 Kings,8,20,"So the LORD has fulfilled His word which He spoke; and I have filled the position of my father David, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised; and I have built a temple for the name of the LORD God of Israel."
1 Kings,8,21,"And there I have made a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD which He made with our fathers, when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.”"
1 Kings,8,22,"Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven;"
1 Kings,8,23,"and he said: “LORD God of Israel, there is no God in heaven above or on earth below like You, who keep Your covenant and mercy with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts."
1 Kings,8,24,"You have kept what You promised Your servant David my father; You have both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day."
1 Kings,8,25,"Therefore, LORD God of Israel, now keep what You promised Your servant David my father, saying, ‘You shall not fail to have a man sit before Me on the throne of Israel, only if your sons take heed to their way, that they walk before Me as you have walked before Me.’"
1 Kings,8,26,"And now I pray, O God of Israel, let Your word come true, which You have spoken to Your servant David my father."
1 Kings,8,27,"“But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You. How much less this temple which I have built!"
1 Kings,8,28,"Yet regard the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O LORD my God, and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before You today:"
1 Kings,8,29,"that Your eyes may be open toward this temple night and day, toward the place of which You said, ‘My name shall be there,’ that You may hear the prayer which Your servant makes toward this place."
1 Kings,8,30,"And may You hear the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. Hear in heaven Your dwelling place; and when You hear, forgive."
1 Kings,8,31,"“When anyone sins against his neighbor, and is forced to take an oath, and comes and takes an oath before Your altar in this temple,"
1 Kings,8,32,"then hear in heaven, and act, and judge Your servants, condemning the wicked, bringing his way on his head, and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness."
1 Kings,8,33,"“When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and when they turn back to You and confess Your name, and pray and make supplication to You in this temple,"
1 Kings,8,34,"then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You gave to their fathers."
1 Kings,8,35,"“When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, when they pray toward this place and confess Your name, and turn from their sin because You afflict them,"
1 Kings,8,36,"then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance."
1 Kings,8,37,"“When there is famine in the land, pestilence or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers; when their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is;"
1 Kings,8,38,"whatever prayer, whatever supplication is made by anyone, or by all Your people Israel, when each one knows the plague of his own heart, and spreads out his hands toward this temple:"
1 Kings,8,39,"then hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive, and act, and give to everyone according to all his ways, whose heart You know (for You alone know the hearts of all the sons of men),"
1 Kings,8,40,that they may fear You all the days that they live in the land which You gave to our fathers.
1 Kings,8,41,"“Moreover, concerning a foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel, but has come from a far country for Your name’s sake"
1 Kings,8,42,"(for they will hear of Your great name and Your strong hand and Your outstretched arm), when he comes and prays toward this temple,"
1 Kings,8,43,"hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, that all peoples of the earth may know Your name and fear You, as do Your people Israel, and that they may know that this temple which I have built is called by Your name."
1 Kings,8,44,"“When Your people go out to battle against their enemy, wherever You send them, and when they pray to the LORD toward the city which You have chosen and the temple which I have built for Your name,"
1 Kings,8,45,"then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause."
1 Kings,8,46,"“When they sin against You (for there is no one who does not sin), and You become angry with them and deliver them to the enemy, and they take them captive to the land of the enemy, far or near;"
1 Kings,8,47,"yet when they come to themselves in the land where they were carried captive, and repent, and make supplication to You in the land of those who took them captive, saying, ‘We have sinned and done wrong, we have committed wickedness’;"
1 Kings,8,48,"and when they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who led them away captive, and pray to You toward their land which You gave to their fathers, the city which You have chosen and the temple which I have built for Your name:"
1 Kings,8,49,"then hear in heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause,"
1 Kings,8,50,"and forgive Your people who have sinned against You, and all their transgressions which they have transgressed against You; and grant them compassion before those who took them captive, that they may have compassion on them"
1 Kings,8,51,"(for they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You brought out of Egypt, out of the iron furnace),"
1 Kings,8,52,"that Your eyes may be open to the supplication of Your servant and the supplication of Your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they call to You."
1 Kings,8,53,"For You separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be Your inheritance, as You spoke by Your servant Moses, when You brought our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.”"
1 Kings,8,54,"And so it was, when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and supplication to the LORD, that he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven."
1 Kings,8,55,"Then he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying:"
1 Kings,8,56,"“Blessed be the LORD, who has given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He promised. There has not failed one word of all His good promise, which He promised through His servant Moses."
1 Kings,8,57,"May the LORD our God be with us, as He was with our fathers. May He not leave us nor forsake us,"
1 Kings,8,58,"that He may incline our hearts to Himself, to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments, which He commanded our fathers."
1 Kings,8,59,"And may these words of mine, with which I have made supplication before the LORD, be near the LORD our God day and night, that He may maintain the cause of His servant and the cause of His people Israel, as each day may require,"
1 Kings,8,60,that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God; there is no other.
1 Kings,8,61,"Let your heart therefore be loyal to the LORD our God, to walk in His statutes and keep His commandments, as at this day.”"
1 Kings,8,62,Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the LORD.
1 Kings,8,63,"And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD."
1 Kings,8,64,"On the same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of the LORD; for there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before the LORD was too small to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings."
1 Kings,8,65,"At that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven more days—fourteen days."
1 Kings,8,66,"On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the good that the LORD had done for His servant David, and for Israel His people."
1 Kings,9,1,"And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire which he wanted to do,"
1 Kings,9,2,"that the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as He had appeared to him at Gibeon."
1 Kings,9,3,"And the LORD said to him: “I have heard your prayer and your supplication that you have made before Me; I have consecrated this house which you have built to put My name there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually."
1 Kings,9,4,"Now if you walk before Me as your father David walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and My judgments,"
1 Kings,9,5,"then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, ‘You shall not fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.’"
1 Kings,9,6,"But if you or your sons at all turn from following Me, and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them,"
1 Kings,9,7,then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out of My sight. Israel will be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
1 Kings,9,8,"And as for this house, which is exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss, and say, ‘Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?’"
1 Kings,9,9,"Then they will answer, ‘Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore the LORD has brought all this calamity on them.’”"
1 Kings,9,10,"Now it happened at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king’s house"
1 Kings,9,11,"(Hiram the king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress and gold, as much as he desired), that King Solomon then gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee."
1 Kings,9,12,"Then Hiram went from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, but they did not please him."
1 Kings,9,13,"So he said, “What kind of cities are these which you have given me, my brother?” And he called them the land of Cabul, as they are to this day."
1 Kings,9,14,Then Hiram sent the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.
1 Kings,9,15,"And this is the reason for the labor force which King Solomon raised: to build the house of the LORD, his own house, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer."
1 Kings,9,16,"(Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer and burned it with fire, had killed the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and had given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.)"
1 Kings,9,17,"And Solomon built Gezer, Lower Beth Horon,"
1 Kings,9,18,"Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land of Judah,"
1 Kings,9,19,"all the storage cities that Solomon had, cities for his chariots and cities for his cavalry, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion."
1 Kings,9,20,"All the people who were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel—"
1 Kings,9,21,"that is, their descendants who were left in the land after them, whom the children of Israel had not been able to destroy completely—from these Solomon raised forced labor, as it is to this day."
1 Kings,9,22,"But of the children of Israel Solomon made no forced laborers, because they were men of war and his servants: his officers, his captains, commanders of his chariots, and his cavalry."
1 Kings,9,23,"Others were chiefs of the officials who were over Solomon’s work: five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people who did the work."
1 Kings,9,24,But Pharaoh’s daughter came up from the City of David to her house which Solomon had built for her. Then he built the Millo.
1 Kings,9,25,"Now three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built for the LORD, and he burned incense with them on the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the temple."
1 Kings,9,26,"King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom."
1 Kings,9,27,"Then Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, seamen who knew the sea, to work with the servants of Solomon."
1 Kings,9,28,"And they went to Ophir, and acquired four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon."
1 Kings,10,1,"Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to test him with hard questions."
1 Kings,10,2,"She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels that bore spices, very much gold, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart."
1 Kings,10,3,So Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing so difficult for the king that he could not explain it to her.
1 Kings,10,4,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,"
1 Kings,10,5,"the food on his table, the seating of his servants, the service of his waiters and their apparel, his cupbearers, and his entryway by which he went up to the house of the LORD, there was no more spirit in her."
1 Kings,10,6,Then she said to the king: “It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom.
1 Kings,10,7,However I did not believe the words until I came and saw with my own eyes; and indeed the half was not told me. Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame of which I heard.
1 Kings,10,8,"Happy are your men and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom!"
1 Kings,10,9,"Blessed be the LORD your God, who delighted in you, setting you on the throne of Israel! Because the LORD has loved Israel forever, therefore He made you king, to do justice and righteousness.”"
1 Kings,10,10,"Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great quantity, and precious stones. There never again came such abundance of spices as the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon."
1 Kings,10,11,"Also, the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought great quantities of almug wood and precious stones from Ophir."
1 Kings,10,12,"And the king made steps of the almug wood for the house of the LORD and for the king’s house, also harps and stringed instruments for singers. There never again came such almug wood, nor has the like been seen to this day."
1 Kings,10,13,"Now King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, besides what Solomon had given her according to the royal generosity. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants."
1 Kings,10,14,"The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,"
1 Kings,10,15,"besides that from the traveling merchants, from the income of traders, from all the kings of Arabia, and from the governors of the country."
1 Kings,10,16,And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield.
1 Kings,10,17,He also made three hundred shields of hammered gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
1 Kings,10,18,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold."
1 Kings,10,19,"The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round at the back; there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the armrests."
1 Kings,10,20,"Twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom."
1 Kings,10,21,"All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Not one was silver, for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon."
1 Kings,10,22,"For the king had merchant ships at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the merchant ships came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys."
1 Kings,10,23,So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
1 Kings,10,24,"Now all the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart."
1 Kings,10,25,"Each man brought his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, armor, spices, horses, and mules, at a set rate year by year."
1 Kings,10,26,"And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem."
1 Kings,10,27,"The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland."
1 Kings,10,28,Also Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh; the king’s merchants bought them in Keveh at the current price.
1 Kings,10,29,"Now a chariot that was imported from Egypt cost six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse one hundred and fifty; and thus, through their agents, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria."
1 Kings,11,1,"But King Solomon loved many foreign women, as well as the daughter of Pharaoh: women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites—"
1 Kings,11,2,"from the nations of whom the LORD had said to the children of Israel, “You shall not intermarry with them, nor they with you. Surely they will turn away your hearts after their gods.” Solomon clung to these in love."
1 Kings,11,3,"And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart."
1 Kings,11,4,"For it was so, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned his heart after other gods; and his heart was not loyal to the LORD his God, as was the heart of his father David."
1 Kings,11,5,"For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites."
1 Kings,11,6,"Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and did not fully follow the LORD, as did his father David."
1 Kings,11,7,"Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the hill that is east of Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the people of Ammon."
1 Kings,11,8,"And he did likewise for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods."
1 Kings,11,9,"So the LORD became angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned from the LORD God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,"
1 Kings,11,10,"and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he did not keep what the LORD had commanded."
1 Kings,11,11,"Therefore the LORD said to Solomon, “Because you have done this, and have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant."
1 Kings,11,12,"Nevertheless I will not do it in your days, for the sake of your father David; I will tear it out of the hand of your son."
1 Kings,11,13,"However I will not tear away the whole kingdom; I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.”"
1 Kings,11,14,"Now the LORD raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was a descendant of the king in Edom."
1 Kings,11,15,"For it happened, when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, after he had killed every male in Edom"
1 Kings,11,16,"(because for six months Joab remained there with all Israel, until he had cut down every male in Edom),"
1 Kings,11,17,"that Hadad fled to go to Egypt, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him. Hadad was still a little child."
1 Kings,11,18,"Then they arose from Midian and came to Paran; and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, apportioned food for him, and gave him land."
1 Kings,11,19,"And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, that is, the sister of Queen Tahpenes."
1 Kings,11,20,"Then the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the sons of Pharaoh."
1 Kings,11,21,"So when Hadad heard in Egypt that David rested with his fathers, and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.”"
1 Kings,11,22,"Then Pharaoh said to him, “But what have you lacked with me, that suddenly you seek to go to your own country?” So he answered, “Nothing, but do let me go anyway.”"
1 Kings,11,23,"And God raised up another adversary against him, Rezon the son of Eliadah, who had fled from his lord, Hadadezer king of Zobah."
1 Kings,11,24,"So he gathered men to him and became captain over a band of raiders, when David killed those of Zobah. And they went to Damascus and dwelt there, and reigned in Damascus."
1 Kings,11,25,"He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon (besides the trouble that Hadad caused); and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria."
1 Kings,11,26,"Then Solomon’s servant, Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zereda, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, also rebelled against the king."
1 Kings,11,27,And this is what caused him to rebel against the king: Solomon had built the Millo and repaired the damages to the City of David his father.
1 Kings,11,28,"The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon, seeing that the young man was industrious, made him the officer over all the labor force of the house of Joseph."
1 Kings,11,29,"Now it happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the way; and he had clothed himself with a new garment, and the two were alone in the field."
1 Kings,11,30,"Then Ahijah took hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces."
1 Kings,11,31,"And he said to Jeroboam, “Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes to you"
1 Kings,11,32,"(but he shall have one tribe for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel),"
1 Kings,11,33,"because they have forsaken Me, and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the people of Ammon, and have not walked in My ways to do what is right in My eyes and keep My statutes and My judgments, as did his father David."
1 Kings,11,34,"However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of My servant David, whom I chose because he kept My commandments and My statutes."
1 Kings,11,35,But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand and give it to you—ten tribes.
1 Kings,11,36,"And to his son I will give one tribe, that My servant David may always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for Myself, to put My name there."
1 Kings,11,37,"So I will take you, and you shall reign over all your heart desires, and you shall be king over Israel."
1 Kings,11,38,"Then it shall be, if you heed all that I command you, walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as My servant David did, then I will be with you and build for you an enduring house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you."
1 Kings,11,39,"And I will afflict the descendants of David because of this, but not forever.’”"
1 Kings,11,40,"Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon."
1 Kings,11,41,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?"
1 Kings,11,42,And the period that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
1 Kings,11,43,"Then Solomon rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place."
1 Kings,12,1,"And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king."
1 Kings,12,2,"So it happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it (he was still in Egypt, for he had fled from the presence of King Solomon and had been dwelling in Egypt ),"
1 Kings,12,3,"that they sent and called him. Then Jeroboam and the whole assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,"
1 Kings,12,4,"“Your father made our yoke heavy; now therefore, lighten the burdensome service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you.”"
1 Kings,12,5,"So he said to them, “Depart for three days, then come back to me.” And the people departed."
1 Kings,12,6,"Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived, and he said, “How do you advise me to answer these people?”"
1 Kings,12,7,"And they spoke to him, saying, “If you will be a servant to these people today, and serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.”"
1 Kings,12,8,"But he rejected the advice which the elders had given him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him."
1 Kings,12,9,"And he said to them, “What advice do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke which your father put on us’?”"
1 Kings,12,10,"Then the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you should speak to this people who have spoken to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter on us’—thus you shall say to them: ‘My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s waist!"
1 Kings,12,11,"And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scourges!’”"
1 Kings,12,12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had directed, saying, “Come back to me the third day.”"
1 Kings,12,13,"Then the king answered the people roughly, and rejected the advice which the elders had given him;"
1 Kings,12,14,"and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scourges!”"
1 Kings,12,15,"So the king did not listen to the people; for the turn of events was from the LORD, that He might fulfill His word, which the LORD had spoken by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat."
1 Kings,12,16,"Now when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying: “What share have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Now, see to your own house, O David!” So Israel departed to their tents."
1 Kings,12,17,But Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah.
1 Kings,12,18,"Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was in charge of the revenue; but all Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. Therefore King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem."
1 Kings,12,19,So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
1 Kings,12,20,"Now it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come back, they sent for him and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel. There was none who followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only."
1 Kings,12,21,"And when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah with the tribe of Benjamin, one hundred and eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, that he might restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon."
1 Kings,12,22,"But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,"
1 Kings,12,23,"“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,"
1 Kings,12,24,"‘Thus says the LORD: “You shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel. Let every man return to his house, for this thing is from Me.”’” Therefore they obeyed the word of the LORD, and turned back, according to the word of the LORD."
1 Kings,12,25,"Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim, and dwelt there. Also he went out from there and built Penuel."
1 Kings,12,26,"And Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom may return to the house of David:"
1 Kings,12,27,"If these people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn back to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will kill me and go back to Rehoboam king of Judah.”"
1 Kings,12,28,"Therefore the king asked advice, made two calves of gold, and said to the people, “It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, O Israel, which brought you up from the land of Egypt!”"
1 Kings,12,29,"And he set up one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan."
1 Kings,12,30,"Now this thing became a sin, for the people went to worship before the one as far as Dan."
1 Kings,12,31,"He made shrines on the high places, and made priests from every class of people, who were not of the sons of Levi."
1 Kings,12,32,"Jeroboam ordained a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the feast that was in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar. So he did at Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made. And at Bethel he installed the priests of the high places which he had made."
1 Kings,12,33,"So he made offerings on the altar which he had made at Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month which he had devised in his own heart. And he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and offered sacrifices on the altar and burned incense."
1 Kings,13,1,"And behold, a man of God went from Judah to Bethel by the word of the LORD, and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense."
1 Kings,13,2,"Then he cried out against the altar by the word of the LORD, and said, “O altar, altar! Thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, a child, Josiah by name, shall be born to the house of David; and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and men’s bones shall be burned on you.’”"
1 Kings,13,3,"And he gave a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign which the LORD has spoken: Surely the altar shall split apart, and the ashes on it shall be poured out.”"
1 Kings,13,4,"So it came to pass when King Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, who cried out against the altar in Bethel, that he stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Arrest him!” Then his hand, which he stretched out toward him, withered, so that he could not pull it back to himself."
1 Kings,13,5,"The altar also was split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD."
1 Kings,13,6,"Then the king answered and said to the man of God, “Please entreat the favor of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me.” So the man of God entreated the LORD, and the king’s hand was restored to him, and became as before."
1 Kings,13,7,"Then the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.”"
1 Kings,13,8,"But the man of God said to the king, “If you were to give me half your house, I would not go in with you; nor would I eat bread nor drink water in this place."
1 Kings,13,9,"For so it was commanded me by the word of the LORD, saying, ‘You shall not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way you came.’”"
1 Kings,13,10,So he went another way and did not return by the way he came to Bethel.
1 Kings,13,11,"Now an old prophet dwelt in Bethel, and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king."
1 Kings,13,12,"And their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” For his sons had seen which way the man of God went who came from Judah."
1 Kings,13,13,"Then he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on it,"
1 Kings,13,14,"and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. Then he said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” And he said, “I am.”"
1 Kings,13,15,"Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat bread.”"
1 Kings,13,16,"And he said, “I cannot return with you nor go in with you; neither can I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place."
1 Kings,13,17,"For I have been told by the word of the LORD, ‘You shall not eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by going the way you came.’”"
1 Kings,13,18,"He said to him, “I too am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, ‘Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.’” (He was lying to him.)"
1 Kings,13,19,"So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water."
1 Kings,13,20,"Now it happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back;"
1 Kings,13,21,"and he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Because you have disobeyed the word of the LORD, and have not kept the commandment which the LORD your God commanded you,"
1 Kings,13,22,"but you came back, ate bread, and drank water in the place of which the LORD said to you, “Eat no bread and drink no water,” your corpse shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.’”"
1 Kings,13,23,"So it was, after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, the prophet whom he had brought back."
1 Kings,13,24,"When he was gone, a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his corpse was thrown on the road, and the donkey stood by it. The lion also stood by the corpse."
1 Kings,13,25,"And there, men passed by and saw the corpse thrown on the road, and the lion standing by the corpse. Then they went and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt."
1 Kings,13,26,"Now when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard it, he said, “It is the man of God who was disobedient to the word of the LORD. Therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke to him.”"
1 Kings,13,27,"And he spoke to his sons, saying, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled it."
1 Kings,13,28,"Then he went and found his corpse thrown on the road, and the donkey and the lion standing by the corpse. The lion had not eaten the corpse nor torn the donkey."
1 Kings,13,29,"And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. So the old prophet came to the city to mourn, and to bury him."
1 Kings,13,30,"Then he laid the corpse in his own tomb; and they mourned over him, saying, “Alas, my brother!”"
1 Kings,13,31,"So it was, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, “When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones."
1 Kings,13,32,"For the saying which he cried out by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the shrines on the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, will surely come to pass.”"
1 Kings,13,33,"After this event Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but again he made priests from every class of people for the high places; whoever wished, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places."
1 Kings,13,34,"And this thing was the sin of the house of Jeroboam, so as to exterminate and destroy it from the face of the earth."
1 Kings,14,1,At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick.
1 Kings,14,2,"And Jeroboam said to his wife, “Please arise, and disguise yourself, that they may not recognize you as the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Indeed, Ahijah the prophet is there, who told me that I would be king over this people."
1 Kings,14,3,"Also take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him; he will tell you what will become of the child.”"
1 Kings,14,4,"And Jeroboam’s wife did so; she arose and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were glazed by reason of his age."
1 Kings,14,5,"Now the LORD had said to Ahijah, “Here is the wife of Jeroboam, coming to ask you something about her son, for he is sick. Thus and thus you shall say to her; for it will be, when she comes in, that she will pretend to be another woman.”"
1 Kings,14,6,"And so it was, when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another person? For I have been sent to you with bad news."
1 Kings,14,7,"Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Thus says the LORD God of Israel: “Because I exalted you from among the people, and made you ruler over My people Israel,"
1 Kings,14,8,"and tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to you; and yet you have not been as My servant David, who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart, to do only what was right in My eyes;"
1 Kings,14,9,"but you have done more evil than all who were before you, for you have gone and made for yourself other gods and molded images to provoke Me to anger, and have cast Me behind your back—"
1 Kings,14,10,"therefore behold! I will bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every male in Israel, bond and free; I will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as one takes away refuse until it is all gone."
1 Kings,14,11,"The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Jeroboam and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field; for the LORD has spoken!”’"
1 Kings,14,12,"Arise therefore, go to your own house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die."
1 Kings,14,13,"And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he is the only one of Jeroboam who shall come to the grave, because in him there is found something good toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam."
1 Kings,14,14,“Moreover the LORD will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam; this is the day. What? Even now!
1 Kings,14,15,"For the LORD will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land which He gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their wooden images, provoking the LORD to anger."
1 Kings,14,16,"And He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned and who made Israel sin.”"
1 Kings,14,17,"Then Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed, and came to Tirzah. When she came to the threshold of the house, the child died."
1 Kings,14,18,"And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke through His servant Ahijah the prophet."
1 Kings,14,19,"Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he reigned, indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel."
1 Kings,14,20,The period that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years. So he rested with his fathers. Then Nadab his son reigned in his place.
1 Kings,14,21,"And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king. He reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mother’s name was Naamah, an Ammonitess."
1 Kings,14,22,"Now Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked Him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, more than all that their fathers had done."
1 Kings,14,23,"For they also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and wooden images on every high hill and under every green tree."
1 Kings,14,24,And there were also perverted persons in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
1 Kings,14,25,It happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.
1 Kings,14,26,And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king’s house; he took away everything. He also took away all the gold shields which Solomon had made.
1 Kings,14,27,"Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who guarded the doorway of the king’s house."
1 Kings,14,28,"And whenever the king entered the house of the LORD, the guards carried them, then brought them back into the guardroom."
1 Kings,14,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
1 Kings,14,30,And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
1 Kings,14,31,"So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. His mother’s name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. Then Abijam his son reigned in his place."
1 Kings,15,1,"In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah."
1 Kings,15,2,He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maachah the granddaughter of Abishalom.
1 Kings,15,3,"And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; his heart was not loyal to the LORD his God, as was the heart of his father David."
1 Kings,15,4,"Nevertheless for David’s sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, by setting up his son after him and by establishing Jerusalem;"
1 Kings,15,5,"because David did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, and had not turned aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite."
1 Kings,15,6,And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
1 Kings,15,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam."
1 Kings,15,8,"So Abijam rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. Then Asa his son reigned in his place."
1 Kings,15,9,"In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa became king over Judah."
1 Kings,15,10,And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His grandmother’s name was Maachah the granddaughter of Abishalom.
1 Kings,15,11,"Asa did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did his father David."
1 Kings,15,12,"And he banished the perverted persons from the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made."
1 Kings,15,13,"Also he removed Maachah his grandmother from being queen mother, because she had made an obscene image of Asherah. And Asa cut down her obscene image and burned it by the Brook Kidron."
1 Kings,15,14,But the high places were not removed. Nevertheless Asa’s heart was loyal to the LORD all his days.
1 Kings,15,15,"He also brought into the house of the LORD the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which he himself had dedicated: silver and gold and utensils."
1 Kings,15,16,Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1 Kings,15,17,"And Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah."
1 Kings,15,18,"Then Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the treasuries of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-Hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,"
1 Kings,15,19,"“Let there be a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. See, I have sent you a present of silver and gold. Come and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.”"
1 Kings,15,20,"So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel. He attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maachah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali."
1 Kings,15,21,"Now it happened, when Baasha heard it, that he stopped building Ramah, and remained in Tirzah."
1 Kings,15,22,"Then King Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted. And they took away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah."
1 Kings,15,23,"The rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet."
1 Kings,15,24,"So Asa rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. Then Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place."
1 Kings,15,25,"Now Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years."
1 Kings,15,26,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin."
1 Kings,15,27,"Then Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him. And Baasha killed him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon."
1 Kings,15,28,"Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place."
1 Kings,15,29,"And it was so, when he became king, that he killed all the house of Jeroboam. He did not leave to Jeroboam anyone that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of the LORD which He had spoken by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite,"
1 Kings,15,30,"because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he had sinned and by which he had made Israel sin, because of his provocation with which he had provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger."
1 Kings,15,31,"Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
1 Kings,15,32,And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1 Kings,15,33,"In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel in Tirzah, and reigned twenty-four years."
1 Kings,15,34,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin."
1 Kings,16,1,"Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani, against Baasha, saying:"
1 Kings,16,2,"“Inasmuch as I lifted you out of the dust and made you ruler over My people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made My people Israel sin, to provoke Me to anger with their sins,"
1 Kings,16,3,"surely I will take away the posterity of Baasha and the posterity of his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat."
1 Kings,16,4,"The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Baasha and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the fields.”"
1 Kings,16,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
1 Kings,16,6,So Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah. Then Elah his son reigned in his place.
1 Kings,16,7,"And also the word of the LORD came by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD in provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he killed them."
1 Kings,16,8,"In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel, and reigned two years in Tirzah."
1 Kings,16,9,"Now his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him as he was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, steward of his house in Tirzah."
1 Kings,16,10,"And Zimri went in and struck him and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place."
1 Kings,16,11,"Then it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he was seated on his throne, that he killed all the household of Baasha; he did not leave him one male, neither of his relatives nor of his friends."
1 Kings,16,12,"Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,"
1 Kings,16,13,"for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, by which they had sinned and by which they had made Israel sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols."
1 Kings,16,14,"Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
1 Kings,16,15,"In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri had reigned in Tirzah seven days. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines."
1 Kings,16,16,"Now the people who were encamped heard it said, “Zimri has conspired and also has killed the king.” So all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp."
1 Kings,16,17,"Then Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon, and they besieged Tirzah."
1 Kings,16,18,"And it happened, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the citadel of the king’s house and burned the king’s house down upon himself with fire, and died,"
1 Kings,16,19,"because of the sins which he had committed in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he had committed to make Israel sin."
1 Kings,16,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the treason he committed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
1 Kings,16,21,"Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri."
1 Kings,16,22,But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri reigned.
1 Kings,16,23,"In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel, and reigned twelve years. Six years he reigned in Tirzah."
1 Kings,16,24,"And he bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; then he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, Samaria, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill."
1 Kings,16,25,"Omri did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all who were before him."
1 Kings,16,26,"For he walked in all the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin, provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols."
1 Kings,16,27,"Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and the might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
1 Kings,16,28,So Omri rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. Then Ahab his son reigned in his place.
1 Kings,16,29,"In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel; and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years."
1 Kings,16,30,"Now Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, more than all who were before him."
1 Kings,16,31,"And it came to pass, as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians; and he went and served Baal and worshiped him."
1 Kings,16,32,"Then he set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal, which he had built in Samaria."
1 Kings,16,33,And Ahab made a wooden image. Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.
1 Kings,16,34,"In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho. He laid its foundation with Abiram his firstborn, and with his youngest son Segub he set up its gates, according to the word of the LORD, which He had spoken through Joshua the son of Nun."
1 Kings,17,1,"And Elijah the Tishbite, of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, except at my word.”"
1 Kings,17,2,"Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying,"
1 Kings,17,3,"“Get away from here and turn eastward, and hide by the Brook Cherith, which flows into the Jordan."
1 Kings,17,4,"And it will be that you shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.”"
1 Kings,17,5,"So he went and did according to the word of the LORD, for he went and stayed by the Brook Cherith, which flows into the Jordan."
1 Kings,17,6,"The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the brook."
1 Kings,17,7,"And it happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land."
1 Kings,17,8,"Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying,"
1 Kings,17,9,"“Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. See, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.”"
1 Kings,17,10,"So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, indeed a widow was there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, “Please bring me a little water in a cup, that I may drink.”"
1 Kings,17,11,"And as she was going to get it, he called to her and said, “Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.”"
1 Kings,17,12,"So she said, “As the LORD your God lives, I do not have bread, only a handful of flour in a bin, and a little oil in a jar; and see, I am gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it, and die.”"
1 Kings,17,13,"And Elijah said to her, “Do not fear; go and do as you have said, but make me a small cake from it first, and bring it to me; and afterward make some for yourself and your son."
1 Kings,17,14,"For thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘The bin of flour shall not be used up, nor shall the jar of oil run dry, until the day the LORD sends rain on the earth.’”"
1 Kings,17,15,So she went away and did according to the word of Elijah; and she and he and her household ate for many days.
1 Kings,17,16,"The bin of flour was not used up, nor did the jar of oil run dry, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke by Elijah."
1 Kings,17,17,Now it happened after these things that the son of the woman who owned the house became sick. And his sickness was so serious that there was no breath left in him.
1 Kings,17,18,"So she said to Elijah, “What have I to do with you, O man of God? Have you come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to kill my son?”"
1 Kings,17,19,"And he said to her, “Give me your son.” So he took him out of her arms and carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed."
1 Kings,17,20,"Then he cried out to the LORD and said, “O LORD my God, have You also brought tragedy on the widow with whom I lodge, by killing her son?”"
1 Kings,17,21,"And he stretched himself out on the child three times, and cried out to the LORD and said, “O LORD my God, I pray, let this child’s soul come back to him.”"
1 Kings,17,22,"Then the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came back to him, and he revived."
1 Kings,17,23,"And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house, and gave him to his mother. And Elijah said, “See, your son lives!”"
1 Kings,17,24,"Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now by this I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is the truth.”"
1 Kings,18,1,"And it came to pass after many days that the word of the LORD came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, “Go, present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the earth.”"
1 Kings,18,2,So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab; and there was a severe famine in Samaria.
1 Kings,18,3,"And Ahab had called Obadiah, who was in charge of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly."
1 Kings,18,4,"For so it was, while Jezebel massacred the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah had taken one hundred prophets and hidden them, fifty to a cave, and had fed them with bread and water.)"
1 Kings,18,5,"And Ahab had said to Obadiah, “Go into the land to all the springs of water and to all the brooks; perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive, so that we will not have to kill any livestock.”"
1 Kings,18,6,"So they divided the land between them to explore it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself."
1 Kings,18,7,"Now as Obadiah was on his way, suddenly Elijah met him; and he recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, “Is that you, my lord Elijah?”"
1 Kings,18,8,"And he answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your master, ‘Elijah is here.’”"
1 Kings,18,9,"So he said, “How have I sinned, that you are delivering your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?"
1 Kings,18,10,"As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to hunt for you; and when they said, ‘He is not here,’ he took an oath from the kingdom or nation that they could not find you."
1 Kings,18,11,"And now you say, ‘Go, tell your master, “Elijah is here”’!"
1 Kings,18,12,"And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of the LORD will carry you to a place I do not know; so when I go and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he will kill me. But I your servant have feared the LORD from my youth."
1 Kings,18,13,"Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, how I hid one hundred men of the LORD’s prophets, fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water?"
1 Kings,18,14,"And now you say, ‘Go, tell your master, “Elijah is here.”’ He will kill me!”"
1 Kings,18,15,"Then Elijah said, “As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely present myself to him today.”"
1 Kings,18,16,"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah."
1 Kings,18,17,"Then it happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, “Is that you, O troubler of Israel?”"
1 Kings,18,18,"And he answered, “I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s house have, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD and have followed the Baals."
1 Kings,18,19,"Now therefore, send and gather all Israel to me on Mount Carmel, the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”"
1 Kings,18,20,"So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel."
1 Kings,18,21,"And Elijah came to all the people, and said, “How long will you falter between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.” But the people answered him not a word."
1 Kings,18,22,"Then Elijah said to the people, “I alone am left a prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men."
1 Kings,18,23,"Therefore let them give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it; and I will prepare the other bull, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it."
1 Kings,18,24,"Then you call on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD; and the God who answers by fire, He is God.” So all the people answered and said, “It is well spoken.”"
1 Kings,18,25,"Now Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first, for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.”"
1 Kings,18,26,"So they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even till noon, saying, “O Baal, hear us!” But there was no voice; no one answered. Then they leaped about the altar which they had made."
1 Kings,18,27,"And so it was, at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, “Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is meditating, or he is busy, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened.”"
1 Kings,18,28,"So they cried aloud, and cut themselves, as was their custom, with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them."
1 Kings,18,29,"And when midday was past, they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice. But there was no voice; no one answered, no one paid attention."
1 Kings,18,30,"Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down."
1 Kings,18,31,"And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, “Israel shall be your name.”"
1 Kings,18,32,Then with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD; and he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed.
1 Kings,18,33,"And he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood, and said, “Fill four waterpots with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood.”"
1 Kings,18,34,"Then he said, “Do it a second time,” and they did it a second time; and he said, “Do it a third time,” and they did it a third time."
1 Kings,18,35,So the water ran all around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water.
1 Kings,18,36,"And it came to pass, at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, “LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word."
1 Kings,18,37,"Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that You are the LORD God, and that You have turned their hearts back to You again.”"
1 Kings,18,38,"Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench."
1 Kings,18,39,"Now when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, “The LORD, He is God! The LORD, He is God!”"
1 Kings,18,40,"And Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let one of them escape!” So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon and executed them there."
1 Kings,18,41,"Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.”"
1 Kings,18,42,"So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; then he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees,"
1 Kings,18,43,"and said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” So he went up and looked, and said, “There is nothing.” And seven times he said, “Go again.”"
1 Kings,18,44,"Then it came to pass the seventh time, that he said, “There is a cloud, as small as a man’s hand, rising out of the sea!” So he said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Prepare your chariot, and go down before the rain stops you.’”"
1 Kings,18,45,"Now it happened in the meantime that the sky became black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain. So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel."
1 Kings,18,46,Then the hand of the LORD came upon Elijah; and he girded up his loins and ran ahead of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
1 Kings,19,1,"And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, also how he had executed all the prophets with the sword."
1 Kings,19,2,"Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.”"
1 Kings,19,3,"And when he saw that, he arose and ran for his life, and went to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there."
1 Kings,19,4,"But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he prayed that he might die, and said, “It is enough! Now, LORD, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers!”"
1 Kings,19,5,"Then as he lay and slept under a broom tree, suddenly an angel touched him, and said to him, “Arise and eat.”"
1 Kings,19,6,"Then he looked, and there by his head was a cake baked on coals, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank, and lay down again."
1 Kings,19,7,"And the angel of the LORD came back the second time, and touched him, and said, “Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you.”"
1 Kings,19,8,"So he arose, and ate and drank; and he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights as far as Horeb, the mountain of God."
1 Kings,19,9,"And there he went into a cave, and spent the night in that place; and behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and He said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”"
1 Kings,19,10,"So he said, “I have been very zealous for the LORD God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek to take my life.”"
1 Kings,19,11,"Then He said, “Go out, and stand on the mountain before the LORD.” And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake;"
1 Kings,19,12,"and after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice."
1 Kings,19,13,"So it was, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. Suddenly a voice came to him, and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”"
1 Kings,19,14,"And he said, “I have been very zealous for the LORD God of hosts; because the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek to take my life.”"
1 Kings,19,15,"Then the LORD said to him: “Go, return on your way to the Wilderness of Damascus; and when you arrive, anoint Hazael as king over Syria."
1 Kings,19,16,Also you shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi as king over Israel. And Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place.
1 Kings,19,17,"It shall be that whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; and whoever escapes the sword of Jehu, Elisha will kill."
1 Kings,19,18,"Yet I have reserved seven thousand in Israel, all whose knees have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.”"
1 Kings,19,19,"So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he was with the twelfth. Then Elijah passed by him and threw his mantle on him."
1 Kings,19,20,"And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah, and said, “Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.” And he said to him, “Go back again, for what have I done to you?”"
1 Kings,19,21,"So Elisha turned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them and boiled their flesh, using the oxen’s equipment, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and followed Elijah, and became his servant."
1 Kings,20,1,"Now Ben-Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his forces together; thirty-two kings were with him, with horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Samaria, and made war against it."
1 Kings,20,2,"Then he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, and said to him, “Thus says Ben-Hadad:"
1 Kings,20,3,‘Your silver and your gold are mine; your loveliest wives and children are mine.’”
1 Kings,20,4,"And the king of Israel answered and said, “My lord, O king, just as you say, I and all that I have are yours.”"
1 Kings,20,5,"Then the messengers came back and said, “Thus speaks Ben-Hadad, saying, ‘Indeed I have sent to you, saying, “You shall deliver to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children”;"
1 Kings,20,6,"but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants. And it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they will put it in their hands and take it.’”"
1 Kings,20,7,"So the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, “Notice, please, and see how this man seeks trouble, for he sent to me for my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold; and I did not deny him.”"
1 Kings,20,8,"And all the elders and all the people said to him, “Do not listen or consent.”"
1 Kings,20,9,"Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you sent for to your servant the first time I will do, but this thing I cannot do.’” And the messengers departed and brought back word to him."
1 Kings,20,10,"Then Ben-Hadad sent to him and said, “The gods do so to me, and more also, if enough dust is left of Samaria for a handful for each of the people who follow me.”"
1 Kings,20,11,"So the king of Israel answered and said, “Tell him, ‘Let not the one who puts on his armor boast like the one who takes it off.’”"
1 Kings,20,12,"And it happened when Ben-Hadad heard this message, as he and the kings were drinking at the command post, that he said to his servants, “Get ready.” And they got ready to attack the city."
1 Kings,20,13,"Suddenly a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel, saying, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver it into your hand today, and you shall know that I am the LORD.’”"
1 Kings,20,14,"So Ahab said, “By whom?” And he said, “Thus says the LORD: ‘By the young leaders of the provinces.’” Then he said, “Who will set the battle in order?” And he answered, “You.”"
1 Kings,20,15,"Then he mustered the young leaders of the provinces, and there were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he mustered all the people, all the children of Israel—seven thousand."
1 Kings,20,16,So they went out at noon. Meanwhile Ben-Hadad and the thirty-two kings helping him were getting drunk at the command post.
1 Kings,20,17,"The young leaders of the provinces went out first. And Ben-Hadad sent out a patrol, and they told him, saying, “Men are coming out of Samaria!”"
1 Kings,20,18,"So he said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; and if they have come out for war, take them alive.”"
1 Kings,20,19,Then these young leaders of the provinces went out of the city with the army which followed them.
1 Kings,20,20,"And each one killed his man; so the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the cavalry."
1 Kings,20,21,"Then the king of Israel went out and attacked the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter."
1 Kings,20,22,"And the prophet came to the king of Israel and said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself; take note, and see what you should do, for in the spring of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.”"
1 Kings,20,23,"Then the servants of the king of Syria said to him, “Their gods are gods of the hills. Therefore they were stronger than we; but if we fight against them in the plain, surely we will be stronger than they."
1 Kings,20,24,"So do this thing: Dismiss the kings, each from his position, and put captains in their places;"
1 Kings,20,25,"and you shall muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot. Then we will fight against them in the plain; surely we will be stronger than they.” And he listened to their voice and did so."
1 Kings,20,26,"So it was, in the spring of the year, that Ben-Hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel."
1 Kings,20,27,"And the children of Israel were mustered and given provisions, and they went against them. Now the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, while the Syrians filled the countryside."
1 Kings,20,28,"Then a man of God came and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Because the Syrians have said, “The LORD is God of the hills, but He is not God of the valleys,” therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.’”"
1 Kings,20,29,And they encamped opposite each other for seven days. So it was that on the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand foot soldiers of the Syrians in one day.
1 Kings,20,30,"But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; then a wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the men who were left. And Ben-Hadad fled and went into the city, into an inner chamber."
1 Kings,20,31,"Then his servants said to him, “Look now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please, let us put sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will spare your life.”"
1 Kings,20,32,"So they wore sackcloth around their waists and put ropes around their heads, and came to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-Hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’” And he said, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”"
1 Kings,20,33,"Now the men were watching closely to see whether any sign of mercy would come from him; and they quickly grasped at this word and said, “Your brother Ben-Hadad.” So he said, “Go, bring him.” Then Ben-Hadad came out to him; and he had him come up into the chariot."
1 Kings,20,34,"So Ben-Hadad said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you may set up marketplaces for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.” Then Ahab said, “I will send you away with this treaty.” So he made a treaty with him and sent him away."
1 Kings,20,35,"Now a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor by the word of the LORD, “Strike me, please.” And the man refused to strike him."
1 Kings,20,36,"Then he said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, surely, as soon as you depart from me, a lion shall kill you.” And as soon as he left him, a lion found him and killed him."
1 Kings,20,37,"And he found another man, and said, “Strike me, please.” So the man struck him, inflicting a wound."
1 Kings,20,38,"Then the prophet departed and waited for the king by the road, and disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes."
1 Kings,20,39,"Now as the king passed by, he cried out to the king and said, “Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and there, a man came over and brought a man to me, and said, ‘Guard this man; if by any means he is missing, your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.’"
1 Kings,20,40,"While your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.” Then the king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it.”"
1 Kings,20,41,And he hastened to take the bandage away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.
1 Kings,20,42,"Then he said to him, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Because you have let slip out of your hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.’”"
1 Kings,20,43,"So the king of Israel went to his house sullen and displeased, and came to Samaria."
1 Kings,21,1,"And it came to pass after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel, next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria."
1 Kings,21,2,"So Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near, next to my house; and for it I will give you a vineyard better than it. Or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its worth in money.”"
1 Kings,21,3,"But Naboth said to Ahab, “The LORD forbid that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you!”"
1 Kings,21,4,"So Ahab went into his house sullen and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no food."
1 Kings,21,5,"But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, “Why is your spirit so sullen that you eat no food?”"
1 Kings,21,6,"He said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for it.’ And he answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’”"
1 Kings,21,7,"Then Jezebel his wife said to him, “You now exercise authority over Israel! Arise, eat food, and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”"
1 Kings,21,8,"And she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who were dwelling in the city with Naboth."
1 Kings,21,9,"She wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth with high honor among the people;"
1 Kings,21,10,"and seat two men, scoundrels, before him to bear witness against him, saying, “You have blasphemed God and the king.” Then take him out, and stone him, that he may die."
1 Kings,21,11,"So the men of his city, the elders and nobles who were inhabitants of his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them."
1 Kings,21,12,"They proclaimed a fast, and seated Naboth with high honor among the people."
1 Kings,21,13,"And two men, scoundrels, came in and sat before him; and the scoundrels witnessed against him, against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth has blasphemed God and the king!” Then they took him outside the city and stoned him with stones, so that he died."
1 Kings,21,14,"Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned and is dead.”"
1 Kings,21,15,"And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.”"
1 Kings,21,16,"So it was, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."
1 Kings,21,17,"Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,"
1 Kings,21,18,"“Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who lives in Samaria. There he is, in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to take possession of it."
1 Kings,21,19,"You shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Have you murdered and also taken possession?”’ And you shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD: “In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs shall lick your blood, even yours.”’”"
1 Kings,21,20,"So Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, O my enemy?” And he answered, “I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the LORD:"
1 Kings,21,21,"‘Behold, I will bring calamity on you. I will take away your posterity, and will cut off from Ahab every male in Israel, both bond and free."
1 Kings,21,22,"I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, because of the provocation with which you have provoked Me to anger, and made Israel sin.’"
1 Kings,21,23,"And concerning Jezebel the LORD also spoke, saying, ‘The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.’"
1 Kings,21,24,"The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Ahab and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field.”"
1 Kings,21,25,"But there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do wickedness in the sight of the LORD, because Jezebel his wife stirred him up."
1 Kings,21,26,"And he behaved very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites had done, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel."
1 Kings,21,27,"So it was, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his body, and fasted and lay in sackcloth, and went about mourning."
1 Kings,21,28,"And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,"
1 Kings,21,29,"“See how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself before Me, I will not bring the calamity in his days. In the days of his son I will bring the calamity on his house.”"
1 Kings,22,1,Now three years passed without war between Syria and Israel.
1 Kings,22,2,"Then it came to pass, in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went down to visit the king of Israel."
1 Kings,22,3,"And the king of Israel said to his servants, “Do you know that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, but we hesitate to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?”"
1 Kings,22,4,"So he said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to fight at Ramoth Gilead?” Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”"
1 Kings,22,5,"Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire for the word of the LORD today.”"
1 Kings,22,6,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to fight, or shall I refrain?” So they said, “Go up, for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.”"
1 Kings,22,7,"And Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not still a prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of Him?”"
1 Kings,22,8,"So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD; but I hate him, because he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.” And Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say such things!”"
1 Kings,22,9,"Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, “Bring Micaiah the son of Imlah quickly!”"
1 Kings,22,10,"The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, having put on their robes, sat each on his throne, at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them."
1 Kings,22,11,"Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made horns of iron for himself; and he said, “Thus says the LORD: ‘With these you shall gore the Syrians until they are destroyed.’”"
1 Kings,22,12,"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for the LORD will deliver it into the king’s hand.”"
1 Kings,22,13,"Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “Now listen, the words of the prophets with one accord encourage the king. Please, let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak encouragement.”"
1 Kings,22,14,"And Micaiah said, “As the LORD lives, whatever the LORD says to me, that I will speak.”"
1 Kings,22,15,"Then he came to the king; and the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall we refrain?” And he answered him, “Go and prosper, for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king!”"
1 Kings,22,16,"So the king said to him, “How many times shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?”"
1 Kings,22,17,"Then he said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And the LORD said, ‘These have no master. Let each return to his house in peace.’”"
1 Kings,22,18,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”"
1 Kings,22,19,"Then Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by, on His right hand and on His left."
1 Kings,22,20,"And the LORD said, ‘Who will persuade Ahab to go up, that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ So one spoke in this manner, and another spoke in that manner."
1 Kings,22,21,"Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, and said, ‘I will persuade him.’"
1 Kings,22,22,"The LORD said to him, ‘In what way?’ So he said, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And the LORD said, ‘You shall persuade him, and also prevail. Go out and do so.’"
1 Kings,22,23,"Therefore look! The LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these prophets of yours, and the LORD has declared disaster against you.”"
1 Kings,22,24,"Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did the spirit from the LORD go from me to speak to you?”"
1 Kings,22,25,"And Micaiah said, “Indeed, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide!”"
1 Kings,22,26,"So the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son;"
1 Kings,22,27,"and say, ‘Thus says the king: “Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction, until I come in peace.”’”"
1 Kings,22,28,"But Micaiah said, “If you ever return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me.” And he said, “Take heed, all you people!”"
1 Kings,22,29,So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.
1 Kings,22,30,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle; but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle."
1 Kings,22,31,"Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, “Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel.”"
1 Kings,22,32,"So it was, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, “Surely it is the king of Israel!” Therefore they turned aside to fight against him, and Jehoshaphat cried out."
1 Kings,22,33,"And it happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him."
1 Kings,22,34,"Now a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am wounded.”"
1 Kings,22,35,"The battle increased that day; and the king was propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians, and died at evening. The blood ran out from the wound onto the floor of the chariot."
1 Kings,22,36,"Then, as the sun was going down, a shout went throughout the army, saying, “Every man to his city, and every man to his own country!”"
1 Kings,22,37,"So the king died, and was brought to Samaria. And they buried the king in Samaria."
1 Kings,22,38,"Then someone washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood while the harlots bathed, according to the word of the LORD which He had spoken."
1 Kings,22,39,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, the ivory house which he built and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
1 Kings,22,40,So Ahab rested with his fathers. Then Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.
1 Kings,22,41,Jehoshaphat the son of Asa had become king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
1 Kings,22,42,"Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi."
1 Kings,22,43,"And he walked in all the ways of his father Asa. He did not turn aside from them, doing what was right in the eyes of the LORD. Nevertheless the high places were not taken away, for the people offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places."
1 Kings,22,44,Also Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
1 Kings,22,45,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the might that he showed, and how he made war, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
1 Kings,22,46,"And the rest of the perverted persons, who remained in the days of his father Asa, he banished from the land."
1 Kings,22,47,"There was then no king in Edom, only a deputy of the king."
1 Kings,22,48,"Jehoshaphat made merchant ships to go to Ophir for gold; but they never sailed, for the ships were wrecked at Ezion Geber."
1 Kings,22,49,"Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat would not."
1 Kings,22,50,"And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. Then Jehoram his son reigned in his place."
1 Kings,22,51,"Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel."
1 Kings,22,52,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin;"
1 Kings,22,53,"for he served Baal and worshiped him, and provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger, according to all that his father had done."
2 Kings,1,1,Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
2 Kings,1,2,"Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria, and was injured; so he sent messengers and said to them, “Go, inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this injury.”"
2 Kings,1,3,"But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?’"
2 Kings,1,4,"Now therefore, thus says the LORD: ‘You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’” So Elijah departed."
2 Kings,1,5,"And when the messengers returned to him, he said to them, “Why have you come back?”"
2 Kings,1,6,"So they said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you, and say to him, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’”’”"
2 Kings,1,7,"Then he said to them, “What kind of man was it who came up to meet you and told you these words?”"
2 Kings,1,8,"So they answered him, “A hairy man wearing a leather belt around his waist.” And he said, “It is Elijah the Tishbite.”"
2 Kings,1,9,"Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men. So he went up to him; and there he was, sitting on the top of a hill. And he spoke to him: “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down!’”"
2 Kings,1,10,"So Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.” And fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty."
2 Kings,1,11,"Then he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty men. And he answered and said to him: “Man of God, thus has the king said, ‘Come down quickly!’”"
2 Kings,1,12,"So Elijah answered and said to them, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.” And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty."
2 Kings,1,13,"Again, he sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty men. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and pleaded with him, and said to him: “Man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight."
2 Kings,1,14,"Look, fire has come down from heaven and burned up the first two captains of fifties with their fifties. But let my life now be precious in your sight.”"
2 Kings,1,15,"And the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, “Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.” So he arose and went down with him to the king."
2 Kings,1,16,"Then he said to him, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’”"
2 Kings,1,17,"So Ahaziah died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. Because he had no son, Jehoram became king in his place, in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah."
2 Kings,1,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,2,1,"And it came to pass, when the LORD was about to take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal."
2 Kings,2,2,"Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, please, for the LORD has sent me on to Bethel.” But Elisha said, “As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you!” So they went down to Bethel."
2 Kings,2,3,"Now the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from over you today?” And he said, “Yes, I know; keep silent!”"
2 Kings,2,4,"Then Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here, please, for the LORD has sent me on to Jericho.” But he said, “As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you!” So they came to Jericho."
2 Kings,2,5,"Now the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from over you today?” So he answered, “Yes, I know; keep silent!”"
2 Kings,2,6,"Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here, please, for the LORD has sent me on to the Jordan.” But he said, “As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you!” So the two of them went on."
2 Kings,2,7,"And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood facing them at a distance, while the two of them stood by the Jordan."
2 Kings,2,8,"Now Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the water; and it was divided this way and that, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground."
2 Kings,2,9,"And so it was, when they had crossed over, that Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask! What may I do for you, before I am taken away from you?” Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.”"
2 Kings,2,10,"So he said, “You have asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so.”"
2 Kings,2,11,"Then it happened, as they continued on and talked, that suddenly a chariot of fire appeared with horses of fire, and separated the two of them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven."
2 Kings,2,12,"And Elisha saw it, and he cried out, “My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!” So he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces."
2 Kings,2,13,"He also took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan."
2 Kings,2,14,"Then he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and said, “Where is the LORD God of Elijah?” And when he also had struck the water, it was divided this way and that; and Elisha crossed over."
2 Kings,2,15,"Now when the sons of the prophets who were from Jericho saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him."
2 Kings,2,16,"Then they said to him, “Look now, there are fifty strong men with your servants. Please let them go and search for your master, lest perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley.” And he said, “You shall not send anyone.”"
2 Kings,2,17,"But when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, “Send them!” Therefore they sent fifty men, and they searched for three days but did not find him."
2 Kings,2,18,"And when they came back to him, for he had stayed in Jericho, he said to them, “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not go’?”"
2 Kings,2,19,"Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Please notice, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the ground barren.”"
2 Kings,2,20,"And he said, “Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him."
2 Kings,2,21,"Then he went out to the source of the water, and cast in the salt there, and said, “Thus says the LORD: ‘I have healed this water; from it there shall be no more death or barrenness.’”"
2 Kings,2,22,"So the water remains healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke."
2 Kings,2,23,"Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up the road, some youths came from the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”"
2 Kings,2,24,"So he turned around and looked at them, and pronounced a curse on them in the name of the LORD. And two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths."
2 Kings,2,25,"Then he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria."
2 Kings,3,1,"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years."
2 Kings,3,2,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, but not like his father and mother; for he put away the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made."
2 Kings,3,3,"Nevertheless he persisted in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin; he did not depart from them."
2 Kings,3,4,"Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheepbreeder, and he regularly paid the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams."
2 Kings,3,5,"But it happened, when Ahab died, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel."
2 Kings,3,6,So King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel.
2 Kings,3,7,"Then he went and sent to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?” And he said, “I will go up; I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”"
2 Kings,3,8,"Then he said, “Which way shall we go up?” And he answered, “By way of the Wilderness of Edom.”"
2 Kings,3,9,"So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they marched on that roundabout route seven days; and there was no water for the army, nor for the animals that followed them."
2 Kings,3,10,"And the king of Israel said, “Alas! For the LORD has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”"
2 Kings,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of the LORD by him?” So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, “Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.”"
2 Kings,3,12,"And Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the LORD is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him."
2 Kings,3,13,"Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother.” But the king of Israel said to him, “No, for the LORD has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”"
2 Kings,3,14,"And Elisha said, “As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you, nor see you."
2 Kings,3,15,"But now bring me a musician.” Then it happened, when the musician played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him."
2 Kings,3,16,"And he said, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Make this valley full of ditches.’"
2 Kings,3,17,"For thus says the LORD: ‘You shall not see wind, nor shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, so that you, your cattle, and your animals may drink.’"
2 Kings,3,18,And this is a simple matter in the sight of the LORD; He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.
2 Kings,3,19,"Also you shall attack every fortified city and every choice city, and shall cut down every good tree, and stop up every spring of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.”"
2 Kings,3,20,"Now it happened in the morning, when the grain offering was offered, that suddenly water came by way of Edom, and the land was filled with water."
2 Kings,3,21,"And when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to bear arms and older were gathered; and they stood at the border."
2 Kings,3,22,"Then they rose up early in the morning, and the sun was shining on the water; and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood."
2 Kings,3,23,"And they said, “This is blood; the kings have surely struck swords and have killed one another; now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!”"
2 Kings,3,24,"So when they came to the camp of Israel, Israel rose up and attacked the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they entered their land, killing the Moabites."
2 Kings,3,25,"Then they destroyed the cities, and each man threw a stone on every good piece of land and filled it; and they stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees. But they left the stones of Kir Haraseth intact. However the slingers surrounded and attacked it."
2 Kings,3,26,"And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not."
2 Kings,3,27,"Then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering upon the wall; and there was great indignation against Israel. So they departed from him and returned to their own land."
2 Kings,4,1,"A certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, “Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared the LORD. And the creditor is coming to take my two sons to be his slaves.”"
2 Kings,4,2,"So Elisha said to her, “What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?” And she said, “Your maidservant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil.”"
2 Kings,4,3,"Then he said, “Go, borrow vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors—empty vessels; do not gather just a few."
2 Kings,4,4,"And when you have come in, you shall shut the door behind you and your sons; then pour it into all those vessels, and set aside the full ones.”"
2 Kings,4,5,"So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured it out."
2 Kings,4,6,"Now it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, “Bring me another vessel.” And he said to her, “There is not another vessel.” So the oil ceased."
2 Kings,4,7,"Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.”"
2 Kings,4,8,"Now it happened one day that Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a notable woman, and she persuaded him to eat some food. So it was, as often as he passed by, he would turn in there to eat some food."
2 Kings,4,9,"And she said to her husband, “Look now, I know that this is a holy man of God, who passes by us regularly."
2 Kings,4,10,"Please, let us make a small upper room on the wall; and let us put a bed for him there, and a table and a chair and a lampstand; so it will be, whenever he comes to us, he can turn in there.”"
2 Kings,4,11,"And it happened one day that he came there, and he turned in to the upper room and lay down there."
2 Kings,4,12,"Then he said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite woman.” When he had called her, she stood before him."
2 Kings,4,13,"And he said to him, “Say now to her, ‘Look, you have been concerned for us with all this care. What can I do for you? Do you want me to speak on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?’” She answered, “I dwell among my own people.”"
2 Kings,4,14,"So he said, “What then is to be done for her?” And Gehazi answered, “Actually, she has no son, and her husband is old.”"
2 Kings,4,15,"So he said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the doorway."
2 Kings,4,16,"Then he said, “About this time next year you shall embrace a son.” And she said, “No, my lord. Man of God, do not lie to your maidservant!”"
2 Kings,4,17,"But the woman conceived, and bore a son when the appointed time had come, of which Elisha had told her."
2 Kings,4,18,"And the child grew. Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers."
2 Kings,4,19,"And he said to his father, “My head, my head!” So he said to a servant, “Carry him to his mother.”"
2 Kings,4,20,"When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died."
2 Kings,4,21,"And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door upon him, and went out."
2 Kings,4,22,"Then she called to her husband, and said, “Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.”"
2 Kings,4,23,"So he said, “Why are you going to him today? It is neither the New Moon nor the Sabbath.” And she said, “It is well.”"
2 Kings,4,24,"Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, “Drive, and go forward; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you.”"
2 Kings,4,25,"And so she departed, and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. So it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look, the Shunammite woman!"
2 Kings,4,26,"Please run now to meet her, and say to her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?’” And she answered, “It is well.”"
2 Kings,4,27,"Now when she came to the man of God at the hill, she caught him by the feet, but Gehazi came near to push her away. But the man of God said, “Let her alone; for her soul is in deep distress, and the LORD has hidden it from me, and has not told me.”"
2 Kings,4,28,"So she said, “Did I ask a son of my lord? Did I not say, ‘Do not deceive me’?”"
2 Kings,4,29,"Then he said to Gehazi, “Get yourself ready, and take my staff in your hand, and be on your way. If you meet anyone, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not answer him; but lay my staff on the face of the child.”"
2 Kings,4,30,"And the mother of the child said, “As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So he arose and followed her."
2 Kings,4,31,"Now Gehazi went on ahead of them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice nor hearing. Therefore he went back to meet him, and told him, saying, “The child has not awakened.”"
2 Kings,4,32,"When Elisha came into the house, there was the child, lying dead on his bed."
2 Kings,4,33,"He went in therefore, shut the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the LORD."
2 Kings,4,34,"And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands; and he stretched himself out on the child, and the flesh of the child became warm."
2 Kings,4,35,"He returned and walked back and forth in the house, and again went up and stretched himself out on him; then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes."
2 Kings,4,36,"And he called Gehazi and said, “Call this Shunammite woman.” So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, “Pick up your son.”"
2 Kings,4,37,"So she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground; then she picked up her son and went out."
2 Kings,4,38,"And Elisha returned to Gilgal, and there was a famine in the land. Now the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, “Put on the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.”"
2 Kings,4,39,"So one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and sliced them into the pot of stew, though they did not know what they were."
2 Kings,4,40,"Then they served it to the men to eat. Now it happened, as they were eating the stew, that they cried out and said, “Man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they could not eat it."
2 Kings,4,41,"So he said, “Then bring some flour.” And he put it into the pot, and said, “Serve it to the people, that they may eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot."
2 Kings,4,42,"Then a man came from Baal Shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley bread, and newly ripened grain in his knapsack. And he said, “Give it to the people, that they may eat.”"
2 Kings,4,43,"But his servant said, “What? Shall I set this before one hundred men?” He said again, “Give it to the people, that they may eat; for thus says the LORD: ‘They shall eat and have some left over.’”"
2 Kings,4,44,"So he set it before them; and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the LORD."
2 Kings,5,1,"Now Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, was a great and honorable man in the eyes of his master, because by him the LORD had given victory to Syria. He was also a mighty man of valor, but a leper."
2 Kings,5,2,"And the Syrians had gone out on raids, and had brought back captive a young girl from the land of Israel. She waited on Naaman’s wife."
2 Kings,5,3,"Then she said to her mistress, “If only my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria! For he would heal him of his leprosy.”"
2 Kings,5,4,"And Naaman went in and told his master, saying, “Thus and thus said the girl who is from the land of Israel.”"
2 Kings,5,5,"Then the king of Syria said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So he departed and took with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten changes of clothing."
2 Kings,5,6,"Then he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which said, Now be advised, when this letter comes to you, that I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy."
2 Kings,5,7,"And it happened, when the king of Israel read the letter, that he tore his clothes and said, “Am I God, to kill and make alive, that this man sends a man to me to heal him of his leprosy? Therefore please consider, and see how he seeks a quarrel with me.”"
2 Kings,5,8,"So it was, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Please let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.”"
2 Kings,5,9,"Then Naaman went with his horses and chariot, and he stood at the door of Elisha’s house."
2 Kings,5,10,"And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored to you, and you shall be clean.”"
2 Kings,5,11,"But Naaman became furious, and went away and said, “Indeed, I said to myself, ‘He will surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leprosy.’"
2 Kings,5,12,"Are not the Abanah and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage."
2 Kings,5,13,"And his servants came near and spoke to him, and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do something great, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean’?”"
2 Kings,5,14,"So he went down and dipped seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean."
2 Kings,5,15,"And he returned to the man of God, he and all his aides, and came and stood before him; and he said, “Indeed, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel; now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.”"
2 Kings,5,16,"But he said, “As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive nothing.” And he urged him to take it, but he refused."
2 Kings,5,17,"So Naaman said, “Then, if not, please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth; for your servant will no longer offer either burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD."
2 Kings,5,18,"Yet in this thing may the LORD pardon your servant: when my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon—when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD please pardon your servant in this thing.”"
2 Kings,5,19,"Then he said to him, “Go in peace.” So he departed from him a short distance."
2 Kings,5,20,"But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “Look, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, while not receiving from his hands what he brought; but as the LORD lives, I will run after him and take something from him.”"
2 Kings,5,21,"So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw him running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him, and said, “Is all well?”"
2 Kings,5,22,"And he said, “All is well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Indeed, just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the mountains of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of garments.’”"
2 Kings,5,23,"So Naaman said, “Please, take two talents.” And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and handed them to two of his servants; and they carried them on ahead of him."
2 Kings,5,24,"When he came to the citadel, he took them from their hand, and stored them away in the house; then he let the men go, and they departed."
2 Kings,5,25,"Now he went in and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, “Where did you go, Gehazi?” And he said, “Your servant did not go anywhere.”"
2 Kings,5,26,"Then he said to him, “Did not my heart go with you when the man turned back from his chariot to meet you? Is it time to receive money and to receive clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, male and female servants?"
2 Kings,5,27,"Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and your descendants forever.” And he went out from his presence leprous, as white as snow."
2 Kings,6,1,"And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “See now, the place where we dwell with you is too small for us."
2 Kings,6,2,"Please, let us go to the Jordan, and let every man take a beam from there, and let us make there a place where we may dwell.” So he answered, “Go.”"
2 Kings,6,3,"Then one said, “Please consent to go with your servants.” And he answered, “I will go.”"
2 Kings,6,4,"So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees."
2 Kings,6,5,"But as one was cutting down a tree, the iron ax head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, “Alas, master! For it was borrowed.”"
2 Kings,6,6,"So the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” And he showed him the place. So he cut off a stick, and threw it in there; and he made the iron float."
2 Kings,6,7,"Therefore he said, “Pick it up for yourself.” So he reached out his hand and took it."
2 Kings,6,8,"Now the king of Syria was making war against Israel; and he consulted with his servants, saying, “My camp will be in such and such a place.”"
2 Kings,6,9,"And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, “Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are coming down there.”"
2 Kings,6,10,"Then the king of Israel sent someone to the place of which the man of God had told him. Thus he warned him, and he was watchful there, not just once or twice."
2 Kings,6,11,"Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled by this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, “Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?”"
2 Kings,6,12,"And one of his servants said, “None, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.”"
2 Kings,6,13,"So he said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send and get him.” And it was told him, saying, “Surely he is in Dothan.”"
2 Kings,6,14,"Therefore he sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city."
2 Kings,6,15,"And when the servant of the man of God arose early and went out, there was an army, surrounding the city with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”"
2 Kings,6,16,"So he answered, “Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”"
2 Kings,6,17,"And Elisha prayed, and said, “LORD, I pray, open his eyes that he may see.” Then the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw. And behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha."
2 Kings,6,18,"So when the Syrians came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, and said, “Strike this people, I pray, with blindness.” And He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha."
2 Kings,6,19,"Now Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” But he led them to Samaria."
2 Kings,6,20,"So it was, when they had come to Samaria, that Elisha said, “LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.” And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and there they were, inside Samaria!"
2 Kings,6,21,"Now when the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, “My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?”"
2 Kings,6,22,"But he answered, “You shall not kill them. Would you kill those whom you have taken captive with your sword and your bow? Set food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.”"
2 Kings,6,23,"Then he prepared a great feast for them; and after they ate and drank, he sent them away and they went to their master. So the bands of Syrian raiders came no more into the land of Israel."
2 Kings,6,24,"And it happened after this that Ben-Hadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria."
2 Kings,6,25,"And there was a great famine in Samaria; and indeed they besieged it until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and one-fourth of a kab of dove droppings for five shekels of silver."
2 Kings,6,26,"Then, as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, “Help, my lord, O king!”"
2 Kings,6,27,"And he said, “If the LORD does not help you, where can I find help for you? From the threshing floor or from the winepress?”"
2 Kings,6,28,"Then the king said to her, “What is troubling you?” And she answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’"
2 Kings,6,29,"So we boiled my son, and ate him. And I said to her on the next day, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him’; but she has hidden her son.”"
2 Kings,6,30,"Now it happened, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes; and as he passed by on the wall, the people looked, and there underneath he had sackcloth on his body."
2 Kings,6,31,"Then he said, “God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today!”"
2 Kings,6,32,"But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And the king sent a man ahead of him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, “Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent someone to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door. Is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?”"
2 Kings,6,33,"And while he was still talking with them, there was the messenger, coming down to him; and then the king said, “Surely this calamity is from the LORD; why should I wait for the LORD any longer?”"
2 Kings,7,1,"Then Elisha said, “Hear the word of the LORD. Thus says the LORD: ‘Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.’”"
2 Kings,7,2,"So an officer on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said, “Look, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, could this thing be?” And he said, “In fact, you shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it.”"
2 Kings,7,3,"Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said to one another, “Why are we sitting here until we die?"
2 Kings,7,4,"If we say, ‘We will enter the city,’ the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit here, we die also. Now therefore, come, let us surrender to the army of the Syrians. If they keep us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall only die.”"
2 Kings,7,5,"And they rose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians; and when they had come to the outskirts of the Syrian camp, to their surprise no one was there."
2 Kings,7,6,"For the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians to hear the noise of chariots and the noise of horses—the noise of a great army; so they said to one another, “Look, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us!”"
2 Kings,7,7,"Therefore they arose and fled at twilight, and left the camp intact—their tents, their horses, and their donkeys—and they fled for their lives."
2 Kings,7,8,"And when these lepers came to the outskirts of the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank, and carried from it silver and gold and clothing, and went and hid them; then they came back and entered another tent, and carried some from there also, and went and hid it."
2 Kings,7,9,"Then they said to one another, “We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we remain silent. If we wait until morning light, some punishment will come upon us. Now therefore, come, let us go and tell the king’s household.”"
2 Kings,7,10,"So they went and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and told them, saying, “We went to the Syrian camp, and surprisingly no one was there, not a human sound—only horses and donkeys tied, and the tents intact.”"
2 Kings,7,11,"And the gatekeepers called out, and they told it to the king’s household inside."
2 Kings,7,12,"So the king arose in the night and said to his servants, “Let me now tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, ‘When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.’”"
2 Kings,7,13,"And one of his servants answered and said, “Please, let several men take five of the remaining horses which are left in the city. Look, they may either become like all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; or indeed, I say, they may become like all the multitude of Israel left from those who are consumed; so let us send them and see.”"
2 Kings,7,14,"Therefore they took two chariots with horses; and the king sent them in the direction of the Syrian army, saying, “Go and see.”"
2 Kings,7,15,And they went after them to the Jordan; and indeed all the road was full of garments and weapons which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. So the messengers returned and told the king.
2 Kings,7,16,"Then the people went out and plundered the tents of the Syrians. So a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD."
2 Kings,7,17,"Now the king had appointed the officer on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate. But the people trampled him in the gate, and he died, just as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him."
2 Kings,7,18,"So it happened just as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, “Two seahs of barley for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, shall be sold tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria.”"
2 Kings,7,19,"Then that officer had answered the man of God, and said, “Now look, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, could such a thing be?” And he had said, “In fact, you shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it.”"
2 Kings,7,20,"And so it happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gate, and he died."
2 Kings,8,1,"Then Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Arise and go, you and your household, and stay wherever you can; for the LORD has called for a famine, and furthermore, it will come upon the land for seven years.”"
2 Kings,8,2,"So the woman arose and did according to the saying of the man of God, and she went with her household and dwelt in the land of the Philistines seven years."
2 Kings,8,3,"It came to pass, at the end of seven years, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines; and she went to make an appeal to the king for her house and for her land."
2 Kings,8,4,"Then the king talked with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, “Tell me, please, all the great things Elisha has done.”"
2 Kings,8,5,"Now it happened, as he was telling the king how he had restored the dead to life, that there was the woman whose son he had restored to life, appealing to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, “My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.”"
2 Kings,8,6,"And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed a certain officer for her, saying, “Restore all that was hers, and all the proceeds of the field from the day that she left the land until now.”"
2 Kings,8,7,"Then Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, “The man of God has come here.”"
2 Kings,8,8,"And the king said to Hazael, “Take a present in your hand, and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this disease?’”"
2 Kings,8,9,"So Hazael went to meet him and took a present with him, of every good thing of Damascus, forty camel-loads; and he came and stood before him, and said, “Your son Ben-Hadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this disease?’”"
2 Kings,8,10,"And Elisha said to him, “Go, say to him, ‘You shall certainly recover.’ However the LORD has shown me that he will really die.”"
2 Kings,8,11,Then he set his countenance in a stare until he was ashamed; and the man of God wept.
2 Kings,8,12,"And Hazael said, “Why is my lord weeping?” He answered, “Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: Their strongholds you will set on fire, and their young men you will kill with the sword; and you will dash their children, and rip open their women with child.”"
2 Kings,8,13,"So Hazael said, “But what is your servant—a dog, that he should do this gross thing?” And Elisha answered, “The LORD has shown me that you will become king over Syria.”"
2 Kings,8,14,"Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he answered, “He told me you would surely recover.”"
2 Kings,8,15,"But it happened on the next day that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water, and spread it over his face so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his place."
2 Kings,8,16,"Now in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoshaphat having been king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat began to reign as king of Judah."
2 Kings,8,17,"He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem."
2 Kings,8,18,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the sight of the LORD."
2 Kings,8,19,"Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah, for the sake of His servant David, as He promised him to give a lamp to him and his sons forever."
2 Kings,8,20,"In his days Edom revolted against Judah’s authority, and made a king over themselves."
2 Kings,8,21,"So Joram went to Zair, and all his chariots with him. Then he rose by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots; and the troops fled to their tents."
2 Kings,8,22,Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah’s authority to this day. And Libnah revolted at that time.
2 Kings,8,23,"Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,8,24,"So Joram rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. Then Ahaziah his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,8,25,"In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign."
2 Kings,8,26,"Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri, king of Israel."
2 Kings,8,27,"And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, like the house of Ahab, for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab."
2 Kings,8,28,Now he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
2 Kings,8,29,"Then King Joram went back to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which the Syrians had inflicted on him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick."
2 Kings,9,1,"And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, “Get yourself ready, take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead."
2 Kings,9,2,"Now when you arrive at that place, look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, and go in and make him rise up from among his associates, and take him to an inner room."
2 Kings,9,3,"Then take the flask of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, ‘Thus says the LORD: “I have anointed you king over Israel.”’ Then open the door and flee, and do not delay.”"
2 Kings,9,4,"So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead."
2 Kings,9,5,"And when he arrived, there were the captains of the army sitting; and he said, “I have a message for you, Commander.” Jehu said, “For which one of us?” And he said, “For you, Commander.”"
2 Kings,9,6,"Then he arose and went into the house. And he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel."
2 Kings,9,7,"You shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel."
2 Kings,9,8,"For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab all the males in Israel, both bond and free."
2 Kings,9,9,"So I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah."
2 Kings,9,10,"The dogs shall eat Jezebel on the plot of ground at Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her.’” And he opened the door and fled."
2 Kings,9,11,"Then Jehu came out to the servants of his master, and one said to him, “Is all well? Why did this madman come to you?” And he said to them, “You know the man and his babble.”"
2 Kings,9,12,"And they said, “A lie! Tell us now.” So he said, “Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD: “I have anointed you king over Israel.”’”"
2 Kings,9,13,"Then each man hastened to take his garment and put it under him on the top of the steps; and they blew trumpets, saying, “Jehu is king!”"
2 Kings,9,14,"So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had been defending Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, against Hazael king of Syria."
2 Kings,9,15,"But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which the Syrians had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, “If you are so minded, let no one leave or escape from the city to go and tell it in Jezreel.”"
2 Kings,9,16,"So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was laid up there; and Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram."
2 Kings,9,17,"Now a watchman stood on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and said, “I see a company of men.” And Joram said, “Get a horseman and send him to meet them, and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’”"
2 Kings,9,18,"So the horseman went to meet him, and said, “Thus says the king: ‘Is it peace?’” And Jehu said, “What have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me.” So the watchman reported, saying, “The messenger went to them, but is not coming back.”"
2 Kings,9,19,"Then he sent out a second horseman who came to them, and said, “Thus says the king: ‘Is it peace?’” And Jehu answered, “What have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me.”"
2 Kings,9,20,"So the watchman reported, saying, “He went up to them and is not coming back; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously!”"
2 Kings,9,21,"Then Joram said, “Make ready.” And his chariot was made ready. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot; and they went out to meet Jehu, and met him on the property of Naboth the Jezreelite."
2 Kings,9,22,"Now it happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?” So he answered, “What peace, as long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft are so many?”"
2 Kings,9,23,"Then Joram turned around and fled, and said to Ahaziah, “Treachery, Ahaziah!”"
2 Kings,9,24,"Now Jehu drew his bow with full strength and shot Jehoram between his arms; and the arrow came out at his heart, and he sank down in his chariot."
2 Kings,9,25,"Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain, “Pick him up, and throw him into the tract of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember, when you and I were riding together behind Ahab his father, that the LORD laid this burden upon him:"
2 Kings,9,26,"‘Surely I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,’ says the LORD, ‘and I will repay you in this plot,’ says the LORD. Now therefore, take and throw him on the plot of ground, according to the word of the LORD.”"
2 Kings,9,27,"But when Ahaziah king of Judah saw this, he fled by the road to Beth Haggan. So Jehu pursued him, and said, “Shoot him also in the chariot.” And they shot him at the Ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. Then he fled to Megiddo, and died there."
2 Kings,9,28,"And his servants carried him in the chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the City of David."
2 Kings,9,29,"In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah."
2 Kings,9,30,"Now when Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she put paint on her eyes and adorned her head, and looked through a window."
2 Kings,9,31,"Then, as Jehu entered at the gate, she said, “Is it peace, Zimri, murderer of your master?”"
2 Kings,9,32,"And he looked up at the window, and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” So two or three eunuchs looked out at him."
2 Kings,9,33,"Then he said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses; and he trampled her underfoot."
2 Kings,9,34,"And when he had gone in, he ate and drank. Then he said, “Go now, see to this accursed woman, and bury her, for she was a king’s daughter.”"
2 Kings,9,35,"So they went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands."
2 Kings,9,36,"Therefore they came back and told him. And he said, “This is the word of the LORD, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel;"
2 Kings,9,37,"and the corpse of Jezebel shall be as refuse on the surface of the field, in the plot at Jezreel, so that they shall not say, “Here lies Jezebel.”’”"
2 Kings,10,1,"Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote and sent letters to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to those who reared Ahab’s sons, saying:"
2 Kings,10,2,"Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons are with you, and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and weapons,"
2 Kings,10,3,"choose the best qualified of your master’s sons, set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house."
2 Kings,10,4,"But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, “Look, two kings could not stand up to him; how then can we stand?”"
2 Kings,10,5,"And he who was in charge of the house, and he who was in charge of the city, the elders also, and those who reared the sons, sent to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants, we will do all you tell us; but we will not make anyone king. Do what is good in your sight.”"
2 Kings,10,6,"Then he wrote a second letter to them, saying: If you are for me and will obey my voice, take the heads of the men, your master’s sons, and come to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow. Now the king’s sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who were rearing them."
2 Kings,10,7,"So it was, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons and slaughtered seventy persons, put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel."
2 Kings,10,8,"Then a messenger came and told him, saying, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.” And he said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.”"
2 Kings,10,9,"So it was, in the morning, that he went out and stood, and said to all the people, “You are righteous. Indeed I conspired against my master and killed him; but who killed all these?"
2 Kings,10,10,Know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of the LORD which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab; for the LORD has done what He spoke by His servant Elijah.”
2 Kings,10,11,"So Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men and his close acquaintances and his priests, until he left him none remaining."
2 Kings,10,12,"And he arose and departed and went to Samaria. On the way, at Beth Eked of the Shepherds,"
2 Kings,10,13,"Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, “Who are you?” So they answered, “We are the brothers of Ahaziah; we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother.”"
2 Kings,10,14,"And he said, “Take them alive!” So they took them alive, and killed them at the well of Beth Eked, forty-two men; and he left none of them."
2 Kings,10,15,"Now when he departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab, coming to meet him; and he greeted him and said to him, “Is your heart right, as my heart is toward your heart?” And Jehonadab answered, “It is.” Jehu said, “If it is, give me your hand.” So he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot."
2 Kings,10,16,"Then he said, “Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD.” So they had him ride in his chariot."
2 Kings,10,17,"And when he came to Samaria, he killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed them, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke to Elijah."
2 Kings,10,18,"Then Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little, Jehu will serve him much."
2 Kings,10,19,"Now therefore, call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests. Let no one be missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever is missing shall not live.” But Jehu acted deceptively, with the intent of destroying the worshipers of Baal."
2 Kings,10,20,"And Jehu said, “Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal.” So they proclaimed it."
2 Kings,10,21,"Then Jehu sent throughout all Israel; and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. So they came into the temple of Baal, and the temple of Baal was full from one end to the other."
2 Kings,10,22,"And he said to the one in charge of the wardrobe, “Bring out vestments for all the worshipers of Baal.” So he brought out vestments for them."
2 Kings,10,23,"Then Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab went into the temple of Baal, and said to the worshipers of Baal, “Search and see that no servants of the LORD are here with you, but only the worshipers of Baal.”"
2 Kings,10,24,"So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed for himself eighty men on the outside, and had said, “If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escapes, whoever lets him escape, it shall be his life for the life of the other.”"
2 Kings,10,25,"Now it happened, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, “Go in and kill them; let no one come out!” And they killed them with the edge of the sword; then the guards and the officers threw them out, and went into the inner room of the temple of Baal."
2 Kings,10,26,And they brought the sacred pillars out of the temple of Baal and burned them.
2 Kings,10,27,"Then they broke down the sacred pillar of Baal, and tore down the temple of Baal and made it a refuse dump to this day."
2 Kings,10,28,Thus Jehu destroyed Baal from Israel.
2 Kings,10,29,"However Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin, that is, from the golden calves that were at Bethel and Dan."
2 Kings,10,30,"And the LORD said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in doing what is right in My sight, and have done to the house of Ahab all that was in My heart, your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.”"
2 Kings,10,31,"But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart; for he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, who had made Israel sin."
2 Kings,10,32,In those days the LORD began to cut off parts of Israel; and Hazael conquered them in all the territory of Israel
2 Kings,10,33,"from the Jordan eastward: all the land of Gilead—Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh—from Aroer, which is by the River Arnon, including Gilead and Bashan."
2 Kings,10,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,10,35,"So Jehu rested with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. Then Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,10,36,And the period that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
2 Kings,11,1,"When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal heirs."
2 Kings,11,2,"But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were being murdered; and they hid him and his nurse in the bedroom, from Athaliah, so that he was not killed."
2 Kings,11,3,"So he was hidden with her in the house of the LORD for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land."
2 Kings,11,4,"In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of hundreds—of the bodyguards and the escorts—and brought them into the house of the LORD to him. And he made a covenant with them and took an oath from them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king’s son."
2 Kings,11,5,"Then he commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall do: one-third of you who come on duty on the Sabbath shall be keeping watch over the king’s house,"
2 Kings,11,6,"one-third shall be at the gate of Sur, and one-third at the gate behind the escorts. You shall keep the watch of the house, lest it be broken down."
2 Kings,11,7,The two contingents of you who go off duty on the Sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD for the king.
2 Kings,11,8,"But you shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes within range, let him be put to death. You are to be with the king as he goes out and as he comes in.”"
2 Kings,11,9,"So the captains of the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each of them took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath, with those who were going off duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest."
2 Kings,11,10,"And the priest gave the captains of hundreds the spears and shields which had belonged to King David, that were in the temple of the LORD."
2 Kings,11,11,"Then the escorts stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, all around the king, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, by the altar and the house."
2 Kings,11,12,"And he brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, and gave him the Testimony; they made him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, “Long live the king!”"
2 Kings,11,13,"Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the escorts and the people, she came to the people in the temple of the LORD."
2 Kings,11,14,"When she looked, there was the king standing by a pillar according to custom; and the leaders and the trumpeters were by the king. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. So Athaliah tore her clothes and cried out, “Treason! Treason!”"
2 Kings,11,15,"And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the army, and said to them, “Take her outside under guard, and slay with the sword whoever follows her.” For the priest had said, “Do not let her be killed in the house of the LORD.”"
2 Kings,11,16,"So they seized her; and she went by way of the horses’ entrance into the king’s house, and there she was killed."
2 Kings,11,17,"Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD, the king, and the people, that they should be the LORD’s people, and also between the king and the people."
2 Kings,11,18,"And all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal, and tore it down. They thoroughly broke in pieces its altars and images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,11,19,"Then he took the captains of hundreds, the bodyguards, the escorts, and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, and went by way of the gate of the escorts to the king’s house. Then he sat on the throne of the kings."
2 Kings,11,20,"So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet, for they had slain Athaliah with the sword in the king’s house."
2 Kings,11,21,Jehoash was seven years old when he became king.
2 Kings,12,1,"In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba."
2 Kings,12,2,Jehoash did what was right in the sight of the LORD all the days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
2 Kings,12,3,But the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
2 Kings,12,4,"And Jehoash said to the priests, “All the money of the dedicated gifts that are brought into the house of the LORD—each man’s census money, each man’s assessment money—and all the money that a man purposes in his heart to bring into the house of the LORD,"
2 Kings,12,5,"let the priests take it themselves, each from his constituency; and let them repair the damages of the temple, wherever any dilapidation is found.”"
2 Kings,12,6,"Now it was so, by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, that the priests had not repaired the damages of the temple."
2 Kings,12,7,"So King Jehoash called Jehoiada the priest and the other priests, and said to them, “Why have you not repaired the damages of the temple? Now therefore, do not take more money from your constituency, but deliver it for repairing the damages of the temple.”"
2 Kings,12,8,"And the priests agreed that they would neither receive more money from the people, nor repair the damages of the temple."
2 Kings,12,9,"Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest, bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the LORD; and the priests who kept the door put there all the money brought into the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,12,10,"So it was, whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king’s scribe and the high priest came up and put it in bags, and counted the money that was found in the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,12,11,"Then they gave the money, which had been apportioned, into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the house of the LORD; and they paid it out to the carpenters and builders who worked on the house of the LORD,"
2 Kings,12,12,"and to masons and stonecutters, and for buying timber and hewn stone, to repair the damage of the house of the LORD, and for all that was paid out to repair the temple."
2 Kings,12,13,"However there were not made for the house of the LORD basins of silver, trimmers, sprinkling-bowls, trumpets, any articles of gold or articles of silver, from the money brought into the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,12,14,"But they gave that to the workmen, and they repaired the house of the LORD with it."
2 Kings,12,15,"Moreover they did not require an account from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to be paid to workmen, for they dealt faithfully."
2 Kings,12,16,The money from the trespass offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD. It belonged to the priests.
2 Kings,12,17,"Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath, and took it; then Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem."
2 Kings,12,18,"And Jehoash king of Judah took all the sacred things that his fathers, Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own sacred things, and all the gold found in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and in the king’s house, and sent them to Hazael king of Syria. Then he went away from Jerusalem."
2 Kings,12,19,"Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,12,20,"And his servants arose and formed a conspiracy, and killed Joash in the house of the Millo, which goes down to Silla."
2 Kings,12,21,"For Jozachar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him. So he died, and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David. Then Amaziah his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,13,1,"In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years."
2 Kings,13,2,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin. He did not depart from them."
2 Kings,13,3,"Then the anger of the LORD was aroused against Israel, and He delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-Hadad the son of Hazael, all their days."
2 Kings,13,4,"So Jehoahaz pleaded with the LORD, and the LORD listened to him; for He saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them."
2 Kings,13,5,"Then the LORD gave Israel a deliverer, so that they escaped from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as before."
2 Kings,13,6,"Nevertheless they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who had made Israel sin, but walked in them; and the wooden image also remained in Samaria."
2 Kings,13,7,"For He left of the army of Jehoahaz only fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers; for the king of Syria had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing."
2 Kings,13,8,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,13,9,"So Jehoahaz rested with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. Then Joash his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,13,10,"In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years."
2 Kings,13,11,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD. He did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, but walked in them."
2 Kings,13,12,"Now the rest of the acts of Joash, all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,13,13,So Joash rested with his fathers. Then Jeroboam sat on his throne. And Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,13,14,"Elisha had become sick with the illness of which he would die. Then Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, “O my father, my father, the chariots of Israel and their horsemen!”"
2 Kings,13,15,"And Elisha said to him, “Take a bow and some arrows.” So he took himself a bow and some arrows."
2 Kings,13,16,"Then he said to the king of Israel, “Put your hand on the bow.” So he put his hand on it, and Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands."
2 Kings,13,17,"And he said, “Open the east window”; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot”; and he shot. And he said, “The arrow of the LORD’s deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria; for you must strike the Syrians at Aphek till you have destroyed them.”"
2 Kings,13,18,"Then he said, “Take the arrows”; so he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground”; so he struck three times, and stopped."
2 Kings,13,19,"And the man of God was angry with him, and said, “You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck Syria till you had destroyed it! But now you will strike Syria only three times.”"
2 Kings,13,20,"Then Elisha died, and they buried him. And the raiding bands from Moab invaded the land in the spring of the year."
2 Kings,13,21,"So it was, as they were burying a man, that suddenly they spied a band of raiders; and they put the man in the tomb of Elisha; and when the man was let down and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived and stood on his feet."
2 Kings,13,22,And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
2 Kings,13,23,"But the LORD was gracious to them, had compassion on them, and regarded them, because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not yet destroy them or cast them from His presence."
2 Kings,13,24,Now Hazael king of Syria died. Then Ben-Hadad his son reigned in his place.
2 Kings,13,25,"And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz recaptured from the hand of Ben-Hadad, the son of Hazael, the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times Joash defeated him and recaptured the cities of Israel."
2 Kings,14,1,"In the second year of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, became king."
2 Kings,14,2,"He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem."
2 Kings,14,3,"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like his father David; he did everything as his father Joash had done."
2 Kings,14,4,"However the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places."
2 Kings,14,5,"Now it happened, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he executed his servants who had murdered his father the king."
2 Kings,14,6,"But the children of the murderers he did not execute, according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, in which the LORD commanded, saying, “Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their fathers; but a person shall be put to death for his own sin.”"
2 Kings,14,7,"He killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, and took Sela by war, and called its name Joktheel to this day."
2 Kings,14,8,"Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us face one another in battle.”"
2 Kings,14,9,"And Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife’; and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle."
2 Kings,14,10,"You have indeed defeated Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Glory in that, and stay at home; for why should you meddle with trouble so that you fall—you and Judah with you?”"
2 Kings,14,11,"But Amaziah would not heed. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went out; so he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah."
2 Kings,14,12,"And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his tent."
2 Kings,14,13,"Then Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh; and he went to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate—four hundred cubits."
2 Kings,14,14,"And he took all the gold and silver, all the articles that were found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria."
2 Kings,14,15,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did—his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah—are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,14,16,"So Jehoash rested with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. Then Jeroboam his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,14,17,"Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel."
2 Kings,14,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,14,19,"And they formed a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there."
2 Kings,14,20,"Then they brought him on horses, and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the City of David."
2 Kings,14,21,"And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah."
2 Kings,14,22,"He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king rested with his fathers."
2 Kings,14,23,"In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, became king in Samaria, and reigned forty-one years."
2 Kings,14,24,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin."
2 Kings,14,25,"He restored the territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which He had spoken through His servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet who was from Gath Hepher."
2 Kings,14,26,"For the LORD saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter; and whether bond or free, there was no helper for Israel."
2 Kings,14,27,And the LORD did not say that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
2 Kings,14,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did—his might, how he made war, and how he recaptured for Israel, from Damascus and Hamath, what had belonged to Judah—are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,14,29,"So Jeroboam rested with his fathers, the kings of Israel. Then Zechariah his son reigned in his place."

2 Kings,15,2,"He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem."
2 Kings,15,3,"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done,"
2 Kings,15,4,except that the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
2 Kings,15,5,"Then the LORD struck the king, so that he was a leper until the day of his death; so he dwelt in an isolated house. And Jotham the king’s son was over the royal house, judging the people of the land."
2 Kings,15,6,"Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,15,7,"So Azariah rested with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David. Then Jotham his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,15,8,"In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in Samaria six months."
2 Kings,15,9,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin."
2 Kings,15,10,"Then Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and struck and killed him in front of the people; and he reigned in his place."
2 Kings,15,11,"Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel."
2 Kings,15,12,"This was the word of the LORD which He spoke to Jehu, saying, “Your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.” And so it was."
2 Kings,15,13,Shallum the son of Jabesh became king in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.
2 Kings,15,14,"For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, came to Samaria, and struck Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria and killed him; and he reigned in his place."
2 Kings,15,15,"Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and the conspiracy which he led, indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel."
2 Kings,15,16,"Then from Tirzah, Menahem attacked Tiphsah, all who were there, and its territory. Because they did not surrender, therefore he attacked it. All the women there who were with child he ripped open."
2 Kings,15,17,"In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi became king over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria."
2 Kings,15,18,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin."
2 Kings,15,19,"Pul king of Assyria came against the land; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to strengthen the kingdom under his control."
2 Kings,15,20,"And Menahem exacted the money from Israel, from all the very wealthy, from each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and did not stay there in the land."
2 Kings,15,21,"Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,15,22,So Menahem rested with his fathers. Then Pekahiah his son reigned in his place.

2 Kings,15,25,"Then Pekah the son of Remaliah, an officer of his, conspired against him and killed him in Samaria, in the citadel of the king’s house, along with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of Gilead. He killed him and reigned in his place."
2 Kings,15,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel."
2 Kings,15,27,"In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years."

2 Kings,15,30,"Then Hoshea the son of Elah led a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and struck and killed him; so he reigned in his place in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah."
2 Kings,15,31,"Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel."

2 Kings,15,33,"He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok."
2 Kings,15,34,And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
2 Kings,15,35,However the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. He built the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD.
2 Kings,15,36,"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,15,37,In those days the LORD began to send Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah against Judah.
2 Kings,15,38,"So Jotham rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. Then Ahaz his son reigned in his place."

2 Kings,16,2,"Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD his God, as his father David had done."
2 Kings,16,3,"But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel; indeed he made his son pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had cast out from before the children of Israel."
2 Kings,16,4,"And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree."
2 Kings,16,5,"Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to make war; and they besieged Ahaz but could not overcome him."
2 Kings,16,6,"At that time Rezin king of Syria captured Elath for Syria, and drove the men of Judah from Elath. Then the Edomites went to Elath, and dwell there to this day."
2 Kings,16,7,"So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and save me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.”"
2 Kings,16,8,"And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasuries of the king’s house, and sent it as a present to the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,16,9,"So the king of Assyria heeded him; for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and took it, carried its people captive to Kir, and killed Rezin."
2 Kings,16,10,"Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the design of the altar and its pattern, according to all its workmanship."
2 Kings,16,11,Then Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus. So Urijah the priest made it before King Ahaz came back from Damascus.
2 Kings,16,12,"And when the king came back from Damascus, the king saw the altar; and the king approached the altar and made offerings on it."
2 Kings,16,13,So he burned his burnt offering and his grain offering; and he poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar.
2 Kings,16,14,"He also brought the bronze altar which was before the LORD, from the front of the temple—from between the new altar and the house of the LORD—and put it on the north side of the new altar."
2 Kings,16,15,"Then King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, “On the great new altar burn the morning burnt offering, the evening grain offering, the king’s burnt sacrifice, and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their grain offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice. And the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.”"
2 Kings,16,16,"Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that King Ahaz commanded."
2 Kings,16,17,"And King Ahaz cut off the panels of the carts, and removed the lavers from them; and he took down the Sea from the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stones."
2 Kings,16,18,"Also he removed the Sabbath pavilion which they had built in the temple, and he removed the king’s outer entrance from the house of the LORD, on account of the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,16,19,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,16,20,"So Ahaz rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. Then Hezekiah his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,17,1,"In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned nine years."
2 Kings,17,2,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel who were before him."
2 Kings,17,3,"Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him; and Hoshea became his vassal, and paid him tribute money."
2 Kings,17,4,"And the king of Assyria uncovered a conspiracy by Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and brought no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison."
2 Kings,17,5,"Now the king of Assyria went throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria and besieged it for three years."
2 Kings,17,6,"In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah and by the Habor, the River of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes."
2 Kings,17,7,"For so it was that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and they had feared other gods,"
2 Kings,17,8,"and had walked in the statutes of the nations whom the LORD had cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made."
2 Kings,17,9,"Also the children of Israel secretly did against the LORD their God things that were not right, and they built for themselves high places in all their cities, from watchtower to fortified city."
2 Kings,17,10,They set up for themselves sacred pillars and wooden images on every high hill and under every green tree.
2 Kings,17,11,"There they burned incense on all the high places, like the nations whom the LORD had carried away before them; and they did wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger,"
2 Kings,17,12,"for they served idols, of which the LORD had said to them, “You shall not do this thing.”"
2 Kings,17,13,"Yet the LORD testified against Israel and against Judah, by all of His prophets, every seer, saying, “Turn from your evil ways, and keep My commandments and My statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by My servants the prophets.”"
2 Kings,17,14,"Nevertheless they would not hear, but stiffened their necks, like the necks of their fathers, who did not believe in the LORD their God."
2 Kings,17,15,"And they rejected His statutes and His covenant that He had made with their fathers, and His testimonies which He had testified against them; they followed idols, became idolaters, and went after the nations who were all around them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them that they should not do like them."
2 Kings,17,16,"So they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, made for themselves a molded image and two calves, made a wooden image and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Baal."
2 Kings,17,17,"And they caused their sons and daughters to pass through the fire, practiced witchcraft and soothsaying, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him to anger."
2 Kings,17,18,"Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them from His sight; there was none left but the tribe of Judah alone."
2 Kings,17,19,"Also Judah did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made."
2 Kings,17,20,"And the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel, afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of plunderers, until He had cast them from His sight."
2 Kings,17,21,"For He tore Israel from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. Then Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD, and made them commit a great sin."
2 Kings,17,22,"For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from them,"
2 Kings,17,23,"until the LORD removed Israel out of His sight, as He had said by all His servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away from their own land to Assyria, as it is to this day."
2 Kings,17,24,"Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Ava, Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they took possession of Samaria and dwelt in its cities."
2 Kings,17,25,"And it was so, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they did not fear the LORD; therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of them."
2 Kings,17,26,"So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The nations whom you have removed and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the rituals of the God of the land; therefore He has sent lions among them, and indeed, they are killing them because they do not know the rituals of the God of the land.”"
2 Kings,17,27,"Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Send there one of the priests whom you brought from there; let him go and dwell there, and let him teach them the rituals of the God of the land.”"
2 Kings,17,28,"Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD."
2 Kings,17,29,"However every nation continued to make gods of its own, and put them in the shrines on the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in the cities where they dwelt."
2 Kings,17,30,"The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima,"
2 Kings,17,31,"and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim."
2 Kings,17,32,"So they feared the LORD, and from every class they appointed for themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the shrines of the high places."
2 Kings,17,33,"They feared the LORD, yet served their own gods—according to the rituals of the nations from among whom they were carried away."
2 Kings,17,34,"To this day they continue practicing the former rituals; they do not fear the LORD, nor do they follow their statutes or their ordinances, or the law and commandment which the LORD had commanded the children of Jacob, whom He named Israel,"
2 Kings,17,35,"with whom the LORD had made a covenant and charged them, saying: “You shall not fear other gods, nor bow down to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them;"
2 Kings,17,36,"but the LORD, who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm, Him you shall fear, Him you shall worship, and to Him you shall offer sacrifice."
2 Kings,17,37,"And the statutes, the ordinances, the law, and the commandment which He wrote for you, you shall be careful to observe forever; you shall not fear other gods."
2 Kings,17,38,"And the covenant that I have made with you, you shall not forget, nor shall you fear other gods."
2 Kings,17,39,But the LORD your God you shall fear; and He will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.”
2 Kings,17,40,"However they did not obey, but they followed their former rituals."
2 Kings,17,41,"So these nations feared the LORD, yet served their carved images; also their children and their children’s children have continued doing as their fathers did, even to this day."
2 Kings,18,1,"Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea the son of Elah, king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz, king of Judah, began to reign."
2 Kings,18,2,"He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah."
2 Kings,18,3,"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father David had done."
2 Kings,18,4,"He removed the high places and broke the sacred pillars, cut down the wooden image and broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made; for until those days the children of Israel burned incense to it, and called it Nehushtan."
2 Kings,18,5,"He trusted in the LORD God of Israel, so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor who were before him."
2 Kings,18,6,"For he held fast to the LORD; he did not depart from following Him, but kept His commandments, which the LORD had commanded Moses."
2 Kings,18,7,The LORD was with him; he prospered wherever he went. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.
2 Kings,18,8,"He subdued the Philistines, as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city."
2 Kings,18,9,"Now it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea the son of Elah, king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it."
2 Kings,18,10,"And at the end of three years they took it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is, the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken."
2 Kings,18,11,"Then the king of Assyria carried Israel away captive to Assyria, and put them in Halah and by the Habor, the River of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,"
2 Kings,18,12,"because they did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed His covenant and all that Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded; and they would neither hear nor do them."
2 Kings,18,13,"And in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them."
2 Kings,18,14,"Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, “I have done wrong; turn away from me; whatever you impose on me I will pay.” And the king of Assyria assessed Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold."
2 Kings,18,15,So Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king’s house.
2 Kings,18,16,"At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,18,17,"Then the king of Assyria sent the Tartan, the Rabsaris, and the Rabshakeh from Lachish, with a great army against Jerusalem, to King Hezekiah. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. When they had come up, they went and stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool, which was on the highway to the Fuller’s Field."
2 Kings,18,18,"And when they had called to the king, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to them."
2 Kings,18,19,"Then the Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: “What confidence is this in which you trust?"
2 Kings,18,20,"You speak of having plans and power for war; but they are mere words. And in whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?"
2 Kings,18,21,"Now look! You are trusting in the staff of this broken reed, Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him."
2 Kings,18,22,"But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the LORD our God,’ is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem’?”’"
2 Kings,18,23,"Now therefore, I urge you, give a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses—if you are able on your part to put riders on them!"
2 Kings,18,24,"How then will you repel one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen?"
2 Kings,18,25,"Have I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, ‘Go up against this land, and destroy it.’”"
2 Kings,18,26,"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”"
2 Kings,18,27,"But the Rabshakeh said to them, “Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat and drink their own waste with you?”"
2 Kings,18,28,"Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Hebrew, and spoke, saying, “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!"
2 Kings,18,29,"Thus says the king: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you from his hand;"
2 Kings,18,30,"nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, “The LORD will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”’"
2 Kings,18,31,"Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: ‘Make peace with me by a present and come out to me; and every one of you eat from his own vine and every one from his own fig tree, and every one of you drink the waters of his own cistern;"
2 Kings,18,32,"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive groves and honey, that you may live and not die. But do not listen to Hezekiah, lest he persuade you, saying, “The LORD will deliver us.”"
2 Kings,18,33,Has any of the gods of the nations at all delivered its land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
2 Kings,18,34,"Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim and Hena and Ivah? Indeed, have they delivered Samaria from my hand?"
2 Kings,18,35,"Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their countries from my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?’”"
2 Kings,18,36,"But the people held their peace and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, “Do not answer him.”"
2 Kings,18,37,"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh."
2 Kings,19,1,"And so it was, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,19,2,"Then he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz."
2 Kings,19,3,"And they said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah: ‘This day is a day of trouble, and rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children have come to birth, but there is no strength to bring them forth."
2 Kings,19,4,"It may be that the LORD your God will hear all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’”"
2 Kings,19,5,So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
2 Kings,19,6,"And Isaiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to your master, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me."
2 Kings,19,7,"Surely I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”"
2 Kings,19,8,"Then the Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he heard that he had departed from Lachish."
2 Kings,19,9,"And the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “Look, he has come out to make war with you.” So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,"
2 Kings,19,10,"“Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”"
2 Kings,19,11,Look! You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by utterly destroying them; and shall you be delivered?
2 Kings,19,12,"Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?"
2 Kings,19,13,"Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?’”"
2 Kings,19,14,"And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD."
2 Kings,19,15,"Then Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said: “O LORD God of Israel, the One who dwells between the cherubim, You are God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth."
2 Kings,19,16,"Incline Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to reproach the living God."
2 Kings,19,17,"Truly, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,"
2 Kings,19,18,"and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were not gods, but the work of men’s hands—wood and stone. Therefore they destroyed them."
2 Kings,19,19,"Now therefore, O LORD our God, I pray, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are the LORD God, You alone.”"
2 Kings,19,20,"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard.’"
2 Kings,19,21,"This is the word which the LORD has spoken concerning him: ‘The virgin, the daughter of Zion, Has despised you, laughed you to scorn; The daughter of Jerusalem Has shaken her head behind your back!"
2 Kings,19,22,"‘Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice, And lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel."
2 Kings,19,23,"By your messengers you have reproached the Lord, And said: “By the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, To the limits of Lebanon; I will cut down its tall cedars And its choice cypress trees; I will enter the extremity of its borders, To its fruitful forest."
2 Kings,19,24,"I have dug and drunk strange water, And with the soles of my feet I have dried up All the brooks of defense.”"
2 Kings,19,25,"‘Did you not hear long ago How I made it, From ancient times that I formed it? Now I have brought it to pass, That you should be For crushing fortified cities into heaps of ruins."
2 Kings,19,26,"Therefore their inhabitants had little power; They were dismayed and confounded; They were as the grass of the field And the green herb, As the grass on the housetops And grain blighted before it is grown."
2 Kings,19,27,"‘But I know your dwelling place, Your going out and your coming in, And your rage against Me."
2 Kings,19,28,"Because your rage against Me and your tumult Have come up to My ears, Therefore I will put My hook in your nose And My bridle in your lips, And I will turn you back By the way which you came."
2 Kings,19,29,"‘This shall be a sign to you: You shall eat this year such as grows of itself, And in the second year what springs from the same; Also in the third year sow and reap, Plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them."
2 Kings,19,30,"And the remnant who have escaped of the house of Judah Shall again take root downward, And bear fruit upward."
2 Kings,19,31,"For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, And those who escape from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.’"
2 Kings,19,32,"“Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: ‘He shall not come into this city, Nor shoot an arrow there, Nor come before it with shield, Nor build a siege mound against it."
2 Kings,19,33,"By the way that he came, By the same shall he return; And he shall not come into this city,’ Says the LORD."
2 Kings,19,34,"‘For I will defend this city, to save it For My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.’”"
2 Kings,19,35,"And it came to pass on a certain night that the angel of the LORD went out, and killed in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand; and when people arose early in the morning, there were the corpses—all dead."
2 Kings,19,36,"So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went away, returned home, and remained at Nineveh."
2 Kings,19,37,"Now it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the temple of Nisroch his god, that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Then Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,20,1,"In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, went to him and said to him, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Set your house in order, for you shall die, and not live.’”"
2 Kings,20,2,"Then he turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the LORD, saying,"
2 Kings,20,3,"“Remember now, O LORD, I pray, how I have walked before You in truth and with a loyal heart, and have done what was good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly."
2 Kings,20,4,"And it happened, before Isaiah had gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,"
2 Kings,20,5,"“Return and tell Hezekiah the leader of My people, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: “I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; surely I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,20,6,"And I will add to your days fifteen years. I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for My own sake, and for the sake of My servant David.”’”"
2 Kings,20,7,"Then Isaiah said, “Take a lump of figs.” So they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered."
2 Kings,20,8,"And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What is the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of the LORD the third day?”"
2 Kings,20,9,"Then Isaiah said, “This is the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing which He has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees or go backward ten degrees?”"
2 Kings,20,10,"And Hezekiah answered, “It is an easy thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees; no, but let the shadow go backward ten degrees.”"
2 Kings,20,11,"So Isaiah the prophet cried out to the LORD, and He brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down on the sundial of Ahaz."
2 Kings,20,12,"At that time Berodach-Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick."
2 Kings,20,13,"And Hezekiah was attentive to them, and showed them all the house of his treasures—the silver and gold, the spices and precious ointment, and all his armory—all that was found among his treasures. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them."
2 Kings,20,14,"Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?” So Hezekiah said, “They came from a far country, from Babylon.”"
2 Kings,20,15,"And he said, “What have they seen in your house?” So Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”"
2 Kings,20,16,"Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD:"
2 Kings,20,17,"‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and what your fathers have accumulated until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left,’ says the LORD."
2 Kings,20,18,"‘And they shall take away some of your sons who will descend from you, whom you will beget; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”"
2 Kings,20,19,"So Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the LORD which you have spoken is good!” For he said, “Will there not be peace and truth at least in my days?”"
2 Kings,20,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah—all his might, and how he made a pool and a tunnel and brought water into the city—are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,20,21,So Hezekiah rested with his fathers. Then Manasseh his son reigned in his place.
2 Kings,21,1,"Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hephzibah."
2 Kings,21,2,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel."
2 Kings,21,3,"For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; he raised up altars for Baal, and made a wooden image, as Ahab king of Israel had done; and he worshiped all the host of heaven and served them."
2 Kings,21,4,"He also built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, “In Jerusalem I will put My name.”"
2 Kings,21,5,And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
2 Kings,21,6,"Also he made his son pass through the fire, practiced soothsaying, used witchcraft, and consulted spiritists and mediums. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him to anger."
2 Kings,21,7,"He even set a carved image of Asherah that he had made, in the house of which the LORD had said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever;"
2 Kings,21,8,"and I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I gave their fathers—only if they are careful to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them.”"
2 Kings,21,9,"But they paid no attention, and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel."
2 Kings,21,10,"And the LORD spoke by His servants the prophets, saying,"
2 Kings,21,11,"“Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations (he has acted more wickedly than all the Amorites who were before him, and has also made Judah sin with his idols),"
2 Kings,21,12,"therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘Behold, I am bringing such calamity upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears will tingle."
2 Kings,21,13,"And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab; I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down."
2 Kings,21,14,"So I will forsake the remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become victims of plunder to all their enemies,"
2 Kings,21,15,"because they have done evil in My sight, and have provoked Me to anger since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day.’”"
2 Kings,21,16,"Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides his sin by which he made Judah sin, in doing evil in the sight of the LORD."
2 Kings,21,17,"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh—all that he did, and the sin that he committed—are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,21,18,"So Manasseh rested with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. Then his son Amon reigned in his place."
2 Kings,21,19,"Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah."
2 Kings,21,20,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done."
2 Kings,21,21,"So he walked in all the ways that his father had walked; and he served the idols that his father had served, and worshiped them."
2 Kings,21,22,"He forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the LORD."
2 Kings,21,23,"Then the servants of Amon conspired against him, and killed the king in his own house."
2 Kings,21,24,But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon. Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.
2 Kings,21,25,"Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,21,26,And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza. Then Josiah his son reigned in his place.
2 Kings,22,1,"Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath."
2 Kings,22,2,"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the ways of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left."
2 Kings,22,3,"Now it came to pass, in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the scribe, the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the house of the LORD, saying:"
2 Kings,22,4,"“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the money which has been brought into the house of the LORD, which the doorkeepers have gathered from the people."
2 Kings,22,5,"And let them deliver it into the hand of those doing the work, who are the overseers in the house of the LORD; let them give it to those who are in the house of the LORD doing the work, to repair the damages of the house—"
2 Kings,22,6,to carpenters and builders and masons—and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
2 Kings,22,7,"However there need be no accounting made with them of the money delivered into their hand, because they deal faithfully.”"
2 Kings,22,8,"Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD.” And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it."
2 Kings,22,9,"So Shaphan the scribe went to the king, bringing the king word, saying, “Your servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of those who do the work, who oversee the house of the LORD.”"
2 Kings,22,10,"Then Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it before the king."
2 Kings,22,11,"Now it happened, when the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, that he tore his clothes."
2 Kings,22,12,"Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Michaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,"
2 Kings,22,13,"“Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found; for great is the wrath of the LORD that is aroused against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.”"
2 Kings,22,14,"So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. (She dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter.) And they spoke with her."
2 Kings,22,15,"Then she said to them, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘Tell the man who sent you to Me,"
2 Kings,22,16,"“Thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will bring calamity on this place and on its inhabitants—all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read—"
2 Kings,22,17,"because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore My wrath shall be aroused against this place and shall not be quenched.’”’"
2 Kings,22,18,"But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, in this manner you shall speak to him, ‘Thus says the LORD God of Israel: “Concerning the words which you have heard—"
2 Kings,22,19,"because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants, that they would become a desolation and a curse, and you tore your clothes and wept before Me, I also have heard you,” says the LORD."
2 Kings,22,20,"“Surely, therefore, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the calamity which I will bring on this place.”’” So they brought back word to the king."
2 Kings,23,1,Now the king sent them to gather all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem to him.
2 Kings,23,2,"The king went up to the house of the LORD with all the men of Judah, and with him all the inhabitants of Jerusalem—the priests and the prophets and all the people, both small and great. And he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant which had been found in the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,23,3,"Then the king stood by a pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people took a stand for the covenant."
2 Kings,23,4,"And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers, to bring out of the temple of the LORD all the articles that were made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven; and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel."
2 Kings,23,5,"Then he removed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense on the high places in the cities of Judah and in the places all around Jerusalem, and those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven."
2 Kings,23,6,"And he brought out the wooden image from the house of the LORD, to the Brook Kidron outside Jerusalem, burned it at the Brook Kidron and ground it to ashes, and threw its ashes on the graves of the common people."
2 Kings,23,7,"Then he tore down the ritual booths of the perverted persons that were in the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the wooden image."
2 Kings,23,8,"And he brought all the priests from the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; also he broke down the high places at the gates which were at the entrance of the Gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were to the left of the city gate."
2 Kings,23,9,"Nevertheless the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brethren."
2 Kings,23,10,"And he defiled Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter pass through the fire to Molech."
2 Kings,23,11,"Then he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance to the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-Melech, the officer who was in the court; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire."
2 Kings,23,12,"The altars that were on the roof, the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, the king broke down and pulverized there, and threw their dust into the Brook Kidron."
2 Kings,23,13,"Then the king defiled the high places that were east of Jerusalem, which were on the south of the Mount of Corruption, which Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the people of Ammon."
2 Kings,23,14,"And he broke in pieces the sacred pillars and cut down the wooden images, and filled their places with the bones of men."
2 Kings,23,15,"Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and crushed it to powder, and burned the wooden image."
2 Kings,23,16,"As Josiah turned, he saw the tombs that were there on the mountain. And he sent and took the bones out of the tombs and burned them on the altar, and defiled it according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words."
2 Kings,23,17,"Then he said, “What gravestone is this that I see?” So the men of the city told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which you have done against the altar of Bethel.”"
2 Kings,23,18,"And he said, “Let him alone; let no one move his bones.” So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria."
2 Kings,23,19,"Now Josiah also took away all the shrines of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the LORD to anger; and he did to them according to all the deeds he had done in Bethel."
2 Kings,23,20,"He executed all the priests of the high places who were there, on the altars, and burned men’s bones on them; and he returned to Jerusalem."
2 Kings,23,21,"Then the king commanded all the people, saying, “Keep the Passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.”"
2 Kings,23,22,"Such a Passover surely had never been held since the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah."
2 Kings,23,23,But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this Passover was held before the LORD in Jerusalem.
2 Kings,23,24,"Moreover Josiah put away those who consulted mediums and spiritists, the household gods and idols, all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,23,25,"Now before him there was no king like him, who turned to the LORD with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moses; nor after him did any arise like him."
2 Kings,23,26,"Nevertheless the LORD did not turn from the fierceness of His great wrath, with which His anger was aroused against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked Him."
2 Kings,23,27,"And the LORD said, “I will also remove Judah from My sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, ‘My name shall be there.’”"
2 Kings,23,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,23,29,"In his days Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went to the aid of the king of Assyria, to the River Euphrates; and King Josiah went against him. And Pharaoh Necho killed him at Megiddo when he confronted him."
2 Kings,23,30,"Then his servants moved his body in a chariot from Megiddo, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, anointed him, and made him king in his father’s place."
2 Kings,23,31,"Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah."
2 Kings,23,32,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done."
2 Kings,23,33,"Now Pharaoh Necho put him in prison at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and he imposed on the land a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold."
2 Kings,23,34,"Then Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Pharaoh took Jehoahaz and went to Egypt, and he died there."
2 Kings,23,35,"So Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give money according to the command of Pharaoh; he exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land, from every one according to his assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Necho."
2 Kings,23,36,"Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebudah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah."
2 Kings,23,37,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done."
2 Kings,24,1,"In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years. Then he turned and rebelled against him."
2 Kings,24,2,"And the LORD sent against him raiding bands of Chaldeans, bands of Syrians, bands of Moabites, and bands of the people of Ammon; He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD which He had spoken by His servants the prophets."
2 Kings,24,3,"Surely at the commandment of the LORD this came upon Judah, to remove them from His sight because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done,"
2 Kings,24,4,"and also because of the innocent blood that he had shed; for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, which the LORD would not pardon."
2 Kings,24,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,24,6,So Jehoiakim rested with his fathers. Then Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.
2 Kings,24,7,"And the king of Egypt did not come out of his land anymore, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Brook of Egypt to the River Euphrates."
2 Kings,24,8,"Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem."
2 Kings,24,9,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done."
2 Kings,24,10,"At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged."
2 Kings,24,11,"And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, as his servants were besieging it."
2 Kings,24,12,"Then Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother, his servants, his princes, and his officers went out to the king of Babylon; and the king of Babylon, in the eighth year of his reign, took him prisoner."
2 Kings,24,13,"And he carried out from there all the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king’s house, and he cut in pieces all the articles of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said."
2 Kings,24,14,"Also he carried into captivity all Jerusalem: all the captains and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths. None remained except the poorest people of the land."
2 Kings,24,15,"And he carried Jehoiachin captive to Babylon. The king’s mother, the king’s wives, his officers, and the mighty of the land he carried into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon."
2 Kings,24,16,"All the valiant men, seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths, one thousand, all who were strong and fit for war, these the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon."
2 Kings,24,17,"Then the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah."
2 Kings,24,18,"Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah."
2 Kings,24,19,"He also did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done."
2 Kings,24,20,"For because of the anger of the LORD this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, that He finally cast them out from His presence. Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon."
2 Kings,25,1,"Now it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and encamped against it; and they built a siege wall against it all around."
2 Kings,25,2,So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
2 Kings,25,3,By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine had become so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
2 Kings,25,4,"Then the city wall was broken through, and all the men of war fled at night by way of the gate between two walls, which was by the king’s garden, even though the Chaldeans were still encamped all around against the city. And the king went by way of the plain."
2 Kings,25,5,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his army was scattered from him."
2 Kings,25,6,"So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and they pronounced judgment on him."
2 Kings,25,7,"Then they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, put out the eyes of Zedekiah, bound him with bronze fetters, and took him to Babylon."
2 Kings,25,8,"And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month (which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem."
2 Kings,25,9,"He burned the house of the LORD and the king’s house; all the houses of Jerusalem, that is, all the houses of the great, he burned with fire."
2 Kings,25,10,And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls of Jerusalem all around.
2 Kings,25,11,"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the rest of the people who remained in the city and the defectors who had deserted to the king of Babylon, with the rest of the multitude."
2 Kings,25,12,But the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers.
2 Kings,25,13,"The bronze pillars that were in the house of the LORD, and the carts and the bronze Sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried their bronze to Babylon."
2 Kings,25,14,"They also took away the pots, the shovels, the trimmers, the spoons, and all the bronze utensils with which the priests ministered."
2 Kings,25,15,"The firepans and the basins, the things of solid gold and solid silver, the captain of the guard took away."
2 Kings,25,16,"The two pillars, one Sea, and the carts, which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure."
2 Kings,25,17,"The height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital on it was of bronze. The height of the capital was three cubits, and the network and pomegranates all around the capital were all of bronze. The second pillar was the same, with a network."
2 Kings,25,18,"And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers."
2 Kings,25,19,"He also took out of the city an officer who had charge of the men of war, five men of the king’s close associates who were found in the city, the chief recruiting officer of the army, who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city."
2 Kings,25,20,"So Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah."
2 Kings,25,21,Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive from its own land.
2 Kings,25,22,"Then he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor over the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left."
2 Kings,25,23,"Now when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Careah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men."
2 Kings,25,24,"And Gedaliah took an oath before them and their men, and said to them, “Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.”"
2 Kings,25,25,"But it happened in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with ten men and struck and killed Gedaliah, the Jews, as well as the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah."
2 Kings,25,26,"And all the people, small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose and went to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans."
2 Kings,25,27,"Now it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, that Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison."
2 Kings,25,28,"He spoke kindly to him, and gave him a more prominent seat than those of the kings who were with him in Babylon."
2 Kings,25,29,"So Jehoiachin changed from his prison garments, and he ate bread regularly before the king all the days of his life."
2 Kings,25,30,"And as for his provisions, there was a regular ration given him by the king, a portion for each day, all the days of his life."

1 Chronicles,20,6,"Yet again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, with twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand and six on each foot; and he also was born to the giant."
1 Chronicles,20,7,"So when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him."
1 Chronicles,20,8,"These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants."
1 Chronicles,21,1,"Now Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel."
1 Chronicles,21,2,"So David said to Joab and to the leaders of the people, “Go, number Israel from Beersheba to Dan, and bring the number of them to me that I may know it.”"
1 Chronicles,21,3,"And Joab answered, “May the LORD make His people a hundred times more than they are. But, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? Why then does my lord require this thing? Why should he be a cause of guilt in Israel?”"
1 Chronicles,21,4,Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles,21,5,"Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. All Israel had one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and Judah had four hundred and seventy thousand men who drew the sword."
1 Chronicles,21,6,"But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s word was abominable to Joab."
1 Chronicles,21,7,And God was displeased with this thing; therefore He struck Israel.
1 Chronicles,21,8,"So David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing; but now, I pray, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.”"
1 Chronicles,21,9,"Then the LORD spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying,"
1 Chronicles,21,10,"“Go and tell David, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD: “I offer you three things; choose one of them for yourself, that I may do it to you.”’”"
1 Chronicles,21,11,"So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Choose for yourself,"
1 Chronicles,21,12,"either three years of famine, or three months to be defeated by your foes with the sword of your enemies overtaking you, or else for three days the sword of the LORD—the plague in the land, with the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.’ Now consider what answer I should take back to Him who sent me.”"
1 Chronicles,21,13,"And David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Please let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are very great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”"
1 Chronicles,21,14,"So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell."
1 Chronicles,21,15,"And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was destroying, the LORD looked and relented of the disaster, and said to the angel who was destroying, “It is enough; now restrain your hand.” And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,16,"Then David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, having in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. So David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces."
1 Chronicles,21,17,"And David said to God, “Was it not I who commanded the people to be numbered? I am the one who has sinned and done evil indeed; but these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, O LORD my God, be against me and my father’s house, but not against Your people that they should be plagued.”"
1 Chronicles,21,18,"Therefore, the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David that David should go and erect an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,19,"So David went up at the word of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of the LORD."
1 Chronicles,21,20,"Now Ornan turned and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves, but Ornan continued threshing wheat."
1 Chronicles,21,21,"So David came to Ornan, and Ornan looked and saw David. And he went out from the threshing floor, and bowed before David with his face to the ground."
1 Chronicles,21,22,"Then David said to Ornan, “Grant me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar on it to the LORD. You shall grant it to me at the full price, that the plague may be withdrawn from the people.”"
1 Chronicles,21,23,"But Ornan said to David, “Take it to yourself, and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes. Look, I also give you the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing implements for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering; I give it all.”"
1 Chronicles,21,24,"Then King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will surely buy it for the full price, for I will not take what is yours for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings with that which costs me nothing.”"
1 Chronicles,21,25,So David gave Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.
1 Chronicles,21,26,"And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on the LORD; and He answered him from heaven by fire on the altar of burnt offering."
1 Chronicles,21,27,"So the LORD commanded the angel, and he returned his sword to its sheath."
1 Chronicles,21,28,"At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there."

1 Chronicles,22,1,"Then David said, “This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”"
1 Chronicles,22,2,So David commanded to gather the aliens who were in the land of Israel; and he appointed masons to cut hewn stones to build the house of God.
1 Chronicles,22,3,"And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails of the doors of the gates and for the joints, and bronze in abundance beyond measure,"
1 Chronicles,22,4,and cedar trees in abundance; for the Sidonians and those from Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.
1 Chronicles,22,5,"Now David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all countries. I will now make preparation for it.” So David made abundant preparations before his death."
1 Chronicles,22,6,"Then he called for his son Solomon, and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel."
1 Chronicles,22,7,"And David said to Solomon: “My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house to the name of the LORD my God;"
1 Chronicles,22,8,"but the word of the LORD came to me, saying, ‘You have shed much blood and have made great wars; you shall not build a house for My name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in My sight."
1 Chronicles,22,9,"Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be Solomon, for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days."

1 Chronicles,22,14,"Indeed I have taken much trouble to prepare for the house of the LORD one hundred thousand talents of gold and one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond measure, for it is so abundant. I have prepared timber and stone also, and you may add to them."
1 Chronicles,22,15,"Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance: woodsmen and stonecutters, and all types of skillful men for every kind of work."
1 Chronicles,22,16,"Of gold and silver and bronze and iron there is no limit. Arise and begin working, and the LORD be with you.”"
1 Chronicles,22,17,"David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,"
1 Chronicles,22,18,"“Is not the LORD your God with you? And has He not given you rest on every side? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land is subdued before the LORD and before His people."
1 Chronicles,22,19,"Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God. Therefore arise and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy articles of God into the house that is to be built for the name of the LORD.”"

1 Chronicles,23,11,Jahath was the first and Zizah the second. But Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; therefore they were assigned as one father’s house.
