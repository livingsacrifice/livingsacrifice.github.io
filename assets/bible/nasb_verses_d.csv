Jeremiah,11,6,"And the LORD said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Hear the words of this covenant and do them."
Jeremiah,11,7,"For I solemnly warned your fathers in the day that I brought them up from the land of Egypt, even to this day, warning persistently, saying, “Listen to My voice.”"
Jeremiah,11,8,"Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked, each one, in the stubbornness of his evil heart; therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.’”"
Jeremiah,11,9,"Then the LORD said to me, “A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,11,10,"They have turned back to the iniquities of their ancestors who refused to hear My words, and they have gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.”"
Jeremiah,11,11,"Therefore thus says the LORD, “Behold I am bringing disaster on them which they will not be able to escape; though they will cry to Me, yet I will not listen to them."
Jeremiah,11,12,"Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they surely will not save them in the time of their disaster."

Jeremiah,12,14,"Thus says the LORD concerning all My wicked neighbors who strike at the inheritance with which I have endowed My people Israel, “Behold I am about to uproot them from their land and will uproot the house of Judah from among them."
Jeremiah,12,15,"And it will come about that after I have uprooted them, I will again have compassion on them; and I will bring them back, each one to his inheritance and each one to his land."
Jeremiah,12,16,"Then if they will really learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, ‘As the LORD lives,’ even as they taught My people to swear by Baal, they will be built up in the midst of My people."
Jeremiah,12,17,"But if they will not listen, then I will uproot that nation, uproot and destroy it,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,13,1,"Thus the LORD said to me, “Go and buy yourself a linen waistband and put it around your waist, but do not put it in water.”"
Jeremiah,13,2,So I bought the waistband in accordance with the word of the LORD and put it around my waist.
Jeremiah,13,3,"Then the word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying,"
Jeremiah,13,4,"“Take the waistband that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a crevice of the rock.”"
Jeremiah,13,5,"So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD had commanded me."
Jeremiah,13,6,"After many days the LORD said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates and take from there the waistband which I commanded you to hide there.”"
Jeremiah,13,7,"Then I went to the Euphrates and dug, and I took the waistband from the place where I had hidden it; and lo, the waistband was ruined, it was totally worthless."

Jeremiah,13,10,"This wicked people, who refuse to listen to My words, who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and have gone after other gods to serve them and to bow down to them, let them be just like this waistband which is totally worthless."
Jeremiah,13,11,"For as the waistband clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole household of Israel and the whole household of Judah cling to Me,’ declares the LORD, ‘that they might be for Me a people, for renown, for praise and for glory; but they did not listen.’"
Jeremiah,13,12,"“Therefore you are to speak this word to them, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, “Every jug is to be filled with wine.”’ And when they say to you, ‘Do we not very well know that every jug is to be filled with wine?’"
Jeremiah,13,13,"then say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Behold I am about to fill all the inhabitants of this land—the kings that sit for David on his throne, the priests, the prophets and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem—with drunkenness!"

Jeremiah,14,2,"“Judah mourns And her gates languish; They sit on the ground in mourning, And the cry of Jerusalem has ascended."
Jeremiah,14,3,"“Their nobles have sent their servants for water; They have come to the cisterns and found no water. They have returned with their vessels empty; They have been put to shame and humiliated, And they cover their heads."

Jeremiah,14,9,"“Why are You like a man dismayed, Like a mighty man who cannot save? Yet You are in our midst, O LORD, And we are called by Your name; Do not forsake us!”"
Jeremiah,14,10,"Thus says the LORD to this people, “Even so they have loved to wander; they have not kept their feet in check. Therefore the LORD does not accept them; now He will remember their iniquity and call their sins to account.”"
Jeremiah,14,11,"So the LORD said to me, “Do not pray for the welfare of this people."
Jeremiah,14,12,"When they fast, I am not going to listen to their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I am not going to accept them. Rather I am going to make an end of them by the sword, famine and pestilence.”"
Jeremiah,14,13,"But, “Ah, Lord GOD!” I said, “Look, the prophets are telling them, ‘You will not see the sword nor will you have famine, but I will give you lasting peace in this place.’”"
Jeremiah,14,14,"Then the LORD said to me, “The prophets are prophesying falsehood in My name. I have neither sent them nor commanded them nor spoken to them; they are prophesying to you a false vision, divination, futility and the deception of their own minds."
Jeremiah,14,15,"Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who are prophesying in My name, although it was not I who sent them—yet they keep saying, ‘There will be no sword or famine in this land’—by sword and famine those prophets shall meet their end!"
Jeremiah,14,16,"The people also to whom they are prophesying will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and there will be no one to bury them—neither them, nor their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters—for I will pour out their own wickedness on them."

Jeremiah,19,3,"and say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, “Behold I am about to bring a calamity upon this place, at which the ears of everyone that hears of it will tingle."
Jeremiah,19,4,"Because they have forsaken Me and have made this an alien place and have burned sacrifices in it to other gods, that neither they nor their forefathers nor the kings of Judah had ever known, and because they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent"
Jeremiah,19,5,"and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, a thing which I never commanded or spoke of, nor did it ever enter My mind;"
Jeremiah,19,6,"therefore, behold, days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-hinnom, but rather the valley of Slaughter."
Jeremiah,19,7,"I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of those who seek their life; and I will give over their carcasses as food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth."

Jeremiah,19,11,"and say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, “Just so will I break this people and this city, even as one breaks a potter’s vessel, which cannot again be repaired; and they will bury in Topheth because there is no other place for burial."
Jeremiah,19,12,"This is how I will treat this place and its inhabitants,” declares the LORD, “so as to make this city like Topheth."
Jeremiah,19,13,"The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled like the place Topheth, because of all the houses on whose rooftops they burned sacrifices to all the heavenly host and poured out drink offerings to other gods.”’”"
Jeremiah,19,14,"Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD’S house and said to all the people:"
Jeremiah,19,15,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, I am about to bring on this city and all its towns the entire calamity that I have declared against it, because they have stiffened their necks so as not to heed My words.’”"

Jeremiah,20,2,"Pashhur had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate, which was by the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,20,3,"On the next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “Pashhur is not the name the LORD has called you, but rather Magor-missabib."
Jeremiah,20,4,"For thus says the LORD, ‘Behold, I am going to make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; and while your eyes look on, they will fall by the sword of their enemies. So I will give over all Judah to the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them away as exiles to Babylon and will slay them with the sword."
Jeremiah,20,5,"I will also give over all the wealth of this city, all its produce and all its costly things; even all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give over to the hand of their enemies, and they will plunder them, take them away and bring them to Babylon."
Jeremiah,20,6,"And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into captivity; and you will enter Babylon, and there you will die and there you will be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied.’”"
Jeremiah,20,7,"O LORD, You have deceived me and I was deceived; You have overcome me and prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all day long; Everyone mocks me."
Jeremiah,20,8,"For each time I speak, I cry aloud; I proclaim violence and destruction, Because for me the word of the LORD has resulted In reproach and derision all day long."
Jeremiah,20,9,"But if I say, “I will not remember Him Or speak anymore in His name,” Then in my heart it becomes like a burning fire Shut up in my bones; And I am weary of holding it in, And I cannot endure it."
Jeremiah,20,10,"For I have heard the whispering of many, “Terror on every side! Denounce him; yes, let us denounce him!” All my trusted friends, Watching for my fall, say: “Perhaps he will be deceived, so that we may prevail against him And take our revenge on him.”"
Jeremiah,20,11,"But the LORD is with me like a dread champion; Therefore my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. They will be utterly ashamed, because they have failed, With an everlasting disgrace that will not be forgotten."
Jeremiah,20,12,"Yet, O LORD of hosts, You who test the righteous, Who see the mind and the heart; Let me see Your vengeance on them; For to You I have set forth my cause."

Jeremiah,20,15,"Cursed be the man who brought the news To my father, saying, “A baby boy has been born to you!” And made him very happy."
Jeremiah,20,16,"But let that man be like the cities Which the LORD overthrew without relenting, And let him hear an outcry in the morning And a shout of alarm at noon;"
Jeremiah,20,17,"Because he did not kill me before birth, So that my mother would have been my grave, And her womb ever pregnant."
Jeremiah,20,18,"Why did I ever come forth from the womb To look on trouble and sorrow, So that my days have been spent in shame?"
Jeremiah,21,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchijah, and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,21,2,"“Please inquire of the LORD on our behalf, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is warring against us; perhaps the LORD will deal with us according to all His wonderful acts, so that the enemy will withdraw from us.”"
Jeremiah,21,3,"Then Jeremiah said to them, “You shall say to Zedekiah as follows:"
Jeremiah,21,4,"‘Thus says the LORD God of Israel, “Behold, I am about to turn back the weapons of war which are in your hands, with which you are warring against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the wall; and I will gather them into the center of this city."
Jeremiah,21,5,"I Myself will war against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm, even in anger and wrath and great indignation."
Jeremiah,21,6,"I will also strike down the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they will die of a great pestilence."
Jeremiah,21,7,"Then afterwards,” declares the LORD, “I will give over Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people, even those who survive in this city from the pestilence, the sword and the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their foes and into the hand of those who seek their lives; and he will strike them down with the edge of the sword. He will not spare them nor have pity nor compassion.”’"
Jeremiah,21,8,"“You shall also say to this people, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death."
Jeremiah,21,9,"He who dwells in this city will die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence; but he who goes out and falls away to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live, and he will have his own life as booty."
Jeremiah,21,10,"For I have set My face against this city for harm and not for good,” declares the LORD. “It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon and he will burn it with fire.”’"
Jeremiah,21,11,"“Then say to the household of the king of Judah, ‘Hear the word of the LORD,"
Jeremiah,21,12,"O house of David, thus says the LORD: “Administer justice every morning; And deliver the person who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor, That My wrath may not go forth like fire And burn with none to extinguish it, Because of the evil of their deeds."
Jeremiah,21,13,"“Behold, I am against you, O valley dweller, O rocky plain,” declares the LORD, “You men who say, ‘Who will come down against us? Or who will enter into our habitations?’"
Jeremiah,21,14,"“But I will punish you according to the results of your deeds,” declares the LORD, “And I will kindle a fire in its forest That it may devour all its environs.”’”"
Jeremiah,22,1,"Thus says the LORD, “Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and there speak this word"
Jeremiah,22,2,"and say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, who sits on David’s throne, you and your servants and your people who enter these gates."
Jeremiah,22,3,"Thus says the LORD, “Do justice and righteousness, and deliver the one who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor. Also do not mistreat or do violence to the stranger, the orphan, or the widow; and do not shed innocent blood in this place."
Jeremiah,22,4,"For if you men will indeed perform this thing, then kings will enter the gates of this house, sitting in David’s place on his throne, riding in chariots and on horses, even the king himself and his servants and his people."
Jeremiah,22,5,"But if you will not obey these words, I swear by Myself,” declares the LORD, “that this house will become a desolation.”’”"
Jeremiah,22,6,"For thus says the LORD concerning the house of the king of Judah: “You are like Gilead to Me, Like the summit of Lebanon; Yet most assuredly I will make you like a wilderness, Like cities which are not inhabited."
Jeremiah,22,7,"“For I will set apart destroyers against you, Each with his weapons; And they will cut down your choicest cedars And throw them on the fire."
Jeremiah,22,8,"“Many nations will pass by this city; and they will say to one another, ‘Why has the LORD done thus to this great city?’"
Jeremiah,22,9,"Then they will answer, ‘Because they forsook the covenant of the LORD their God and bowed down to other gods and served them.’”"
Jeremiah,22,10,"Do not weep for the dead or mourn for him, But weep continually for the one who goes away; For he will never return Or see his native land."
Jeremiah,22,11,"For thus says the LORD in regard to Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who became king in the place of Josiah his father, who went forth from this place, “He will never return there;"
Jeremiah,22,12,"but in the place where they led him captive, there he will die and not see this land again."
Jeremiah,22,13,"“Woe to him who builds his house without righteousness And his upper rooms without justice, Who uses his neighbor’s services without pay And does not give him his wages,"
Jeremiah,22,14,"Who says, ‘I will build myself a roomy house With spacious upper rooms, And cut out its windows, Paneling it with cedar and painting it bright red.’"
Jeremiah,22,15,“Do you become a king because you are competing in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink And do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.
Jeremiah,22,16,“He pled the cause of the afflicted and needy; Then it was well. Is not that what it means to know Me?” Declares the LORD.
Jeremiah,22,17,"“But your eyes and your heart Are intent only upon your own dishonest gain, And on shedding innocent blood And on practicing oppression and extortion.”"
Jeremiah,22,18,"Therefore thus says the LORD in regard to Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, “They will not lament for him: ‘Alas, my brother!’ or, ‘Alas, sister!’ They will not lament for him: ‘Alas for the master!’ or, ‘Alas for his splendor!’"
Jeremiah,22,19,"“He will be buried with a donkey’s burial, Dragged off and thrown out beyond the gates of Jerusalem."

Jeremiah,22,22,"“The wind will sweep away all your shepherds, And your lovers will go into captivity; Then you will surely be ashamed and humiliated Because of all your wickedness."
Jeremiah,22,23,"“You who dwell in Lebanon, Nested in the cedars, How you will groan when pangs come upon you, Pain like a woman in childbirth!"
Jeremiah,22,24,"“As I live,” declares the LORD, “even though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were a signet ring on My right hand, yet I would pull you off;"
Jeremiah,22,25,"and I will give you over into the hand of those who are seeking your life, yes, into the hand of those whom you dread, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah,22,26,"I will hurl you and your mother who bore you into another country where you were not born, and there you will die."
Jeremiah,22,27,"But as for the land to which they desire to return, they will not return to it."
Jeremiah,22,28,"“Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered jar? Or is he an undesirable vessel? Why have he and his descendants been hurled out And cast into a land that they had not known?"
Jeremiah,22,29,"“O land, land, land, Hear the word of the LORD!"
Jeremiah,22,30,"“Thus says the LORD, ‘Write this man down childless, A man who will not prosper in his days; For no man of his descendants will prosper Sitting on the throne of David Or ruling again in Judah.’”"
Jeremiah,23,1,“Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of My pasture!” declares the LORD.
Jeremiah,23,2,"Therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning the shepherds who are tending My people: “You have scattered My flock and driven them away, and have not attended to them; behold, I am about to attend to you for the evil of your deeds,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,3,"“Then I Myself will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and bring them back to their pasture, and they will be fruitful and multiply."
Jeremiah,23,4,"I will also raise up shepherds over them and they will tend them; and they will not be afraid any longer, nor be terrified, nor will any be missing,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,5,"“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; And He will reign as king and act wisely And do justice and righteousness in the land."
Jeremiah,23,6,"“In His days Judah will be saved, And Israel will dwell securely; And this is His name by which He will be called, ‘The LORD our righteousness.’"
Jeremiah,23,7,"“Therefore behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when they will no longer say, ‘As the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt,’"
Jeremiah,23,8,"but, ‘As the LORD lives, who brought up and led back the descendants of the household of Israel from the north land and from all the countries where I had driven them.’ Then they will live on their own soil.”"
Jeremiah,23,9,"As for the prophets: My heart is broken within me, All my bones tremble; I have become like a drunken man, Even like a man overcome with wine, Because of the LORD And because of His holy words."
Jeremiah,23,10,For the land is full of adulterers; For the land mourns because of the curse. The pastures of the wilderness have dried up. Their course also is evil And their might is not right.
Jeremiah,23,11,"“For both prophet and priest are polluted; Even in My house I have found their wickedness,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,12,"“Therefore their way will be like slippery paths to them, They will be driven away into the gloom and fall down in it; For I will bring calamity upon them, The year of their punishment,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,13,"“Moreover, among the prophets of Samaria I saw an offensive thing: They prophesied by Baal and led My people Israel astray."
Jeremiah,23,14,"“Also among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: The committing of adultery and walking in falsehood; And they strengthen the hands of evildoers, So that no one has turned back from his wickedness. All of them have become to Me like Sodom, And her inhabitants like Gomorrah."
Jeremiah,23,15,"“Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets, ‘Behold, I am going to feed them wormwood And make them drink poisonous water, For from the prophets of Jerusalem Pollution has gone forth into all the land.’”"
Jeremiah,23,16,"Thus says the LORD of hosts, “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you. They are leading you into futility; They speak a vision of their own imagination, Not from the mouth of the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,17,"“They keep saying to those who despise Me, ‘The LORD has said, “You will have peace”’; And as for everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart, They say, ‘Calamity will not come upon you.’"
Jeremiah,23,18,"“But who has stood in the council of the LORD, That he should see and hear His word? Who has given heed to His word and listened?"
Jeremiah,23,19,"“Behold, the storm of the LORD has gone forth in wrath, Even a whirling tempest; It will swirl down on the head of the wicked."
Jeremiah,23,20,“The anger of the LORD will not turn back Until He has performed and carried out the purposes of His heart; In the last days you will clearly understand it.
Jeremiah,23,21,"“I did not send these prophets, But they ran. I did not speak to them, But they prophesied."
Jeremiah,23,22,"“But if they had stood in My council, Then they would have announced My words to My people, And would have turned them back from their evil way And from the evil of their deeds."
Jeremiah,23,23,"“Am I a God who is near,” declares the LORD, “And not a God far off?"
Jeremiah,23,24,“Can a man hide himself in hiding places So I do not see him?” declares the LORD. “Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?” declares the LORD.
Jeremiah,23,25,"“I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy falsely in My name, saying, ‘I had a dream, I had a dream!’"
Jeremiah,23,26,"How long? Is there anything in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy falsehood, even these prophets of the deception of their own heart,"
Jeremiah,23,27,"who intend to make My people forget My name by their dreams which they relate to one another, just as their fathers forgot My name because of Baal?"
Jeremiah,23,28,"The prophet who has a dream may relate his dream, but let him who has My word speak My word in truth. What does straw have in common with grain?” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,29,"“Is not My word like fire?” declares the LORD, “and like a hammer which shatters a rock?"
Jeremiah,23,30,"Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” declares the LORD, “who steal My words from each other."
Jeremiah,23,31,"Behold, I am against the prophets,” declares the LORD, “who use their tongues and declare, ‘The Lord declares.’"
Jeremiah,23,32,"Behold, I am against those who have prophesied false dreams,” declares the LORD, “and related them and led My people astray by their falsehoods and reckless boasting; yet I did not send them or command them, nor do they furnish this people the slightest benefit,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,33,"“Now when this people or the prophet or a priest asks you saying, ‘What is the oracle of the LORD?’ then you shall say to them, ‘What oracle?’ The LORD declares, ‘I will abandon you.’"
Jeremiah,23,34,"Then as for the prophet or the priest or the people who say, ‘The oracle of the LORD,’ I will bring punishment upon that man and his household."
Jeremiah,23,35,"Thus will each of you say to his neighbor and to his brother, ‘What has the LORD answered?’ or, ‘What has the LORD spoken?’"
Jeremiah,23,36,"For you will no longer remember the oracle of the LORD, because every man’s own word will become the oracle, and you have perverted the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God."
Jeremiah,23,37,"Thus you will say to that prophet, ‘What has the LORD answered you?’ and, ‘What has the LORD spoken?’"
Jeremiah,23,38,"For if you say, ‘The oracle of the LORD!’ surely thus says the LORD, ‘Because you said this word, “The oracle of the LORD!” I have also sent to you, saying, “You shall not say, ‘The oracle of the LORD!’”’"
Jeremiah,23,39,"Therefore behold, I will surely forget you and cast you away from My presence, along with the city which I gave you and your fathers."
Jeremiah,23,40,I will put an everlasting reproach on you and an everlasting humiliation which will not be forgotten.”
Jeremiah,24,1,"After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the officials of Judah with the craftsmen and smiths from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon, the LORD showed me: behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of the LORD!"
Jeremiah,24,2,"One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, and the other basket had very bad figs which could not be eaten due to rottenness."
Jeremiah,24,3,"Then the LORD said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” And I said, “Figs, the good figs, very good; and the bad figs, very bad, which cannot be eaten due to rottenness.”"
Jeremiah,24,4,"Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Jeremiah,24,5,"“Thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah,24,6,"For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land; and I will build them up and not overthrow them, and I will plant them and not pluck them up."
Jeremiah,24,7,"I will give them a heart to know Me, for I am the LORD; and they will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me with their whole heart."
Jeremiah,24,8,"‘But like the bad figs which cannot be eaten due to rottenness—indeed, thus says the LORD—so I will abandon Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land and the ones who dwell in the land of Egypt."
Jeremiah,24,9,"I will make them a terror and an evil for all the kingdoms of the earth, as a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse in all places where I will scatter them."
Jeremiah,24,10,"I will send the sword, the famine and the pestilence upon them until they are destroyed from the land which I gave to them and their forefathers.’”"
Jeremiah,25,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),"
Jeremiah,25,2,"which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,"
Jeremiah,25,3,"“From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened."
Jeremiah,25,4,"And the LORD has sent to you all His servants the prophets again and again, but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear,"
Jeremiah,25,5,"saying, ‘Turn now everyone from his evil way and from the evil of your deeds, and dwell on the land which the LORD has given to you and your forefathers forever and ever;"
Jeremiah,25,6,"and do not go after other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands, and I will do you no harm.’"
Jeremiah,25,7,"Yet you have not listened to Me,” declares the LORD, “in order that you might provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm."
Jeremiah,25,8,"“Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘Because you have not obeyed My words,"
Jeremiah,25,9,"behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,’ declares the LORD, ‘and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land and against its inhabitants and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them and make them a horror and a hissing, and an everlasting desolation."
Jeremiah,25,10,"Moreover, I will take from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp."
Jeremiah,25,11,"This whole land will be a desolation and a horror, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years."
Jeremiah,25,12,"‘Then it will be when seventy years are completed I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,’ declares the LORD, ‘for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it an everlasting desolation."
Jeremiah,25,13,"I will bring upon that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations."
Jeremiah,25,14,"(For many nations and great kings will make slaves of them, even them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands.)’”"
Jeremiah,25,15,"For thus the LORD, the God of Israel, says to me, “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand and cause all the nations to whom I send you to drink it."
Jeremiah,25,16,They will drink and stagger and go mad because of the sword that I will send among them.”
Jeremiah,25,17,Then I took the cup from the LORD’S hand and made all the nations to whom the LORD sent me drink it:
Jeremiah,25,18,"Jerusalem and the cities of Judah and its kings and its princes, to make them a ruin, a horror, a hissing and a curse, as it is this day;"
Jeremiah,25,19,"Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his princes and all his people;"
Jeremiah,25,20,"and all the foreign people, all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines (even Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and the remnant of Ashdod);"
Jeremiah,25,21,"Edom, Moab and the sons of Ammon;"
Jeremiah,25,22,"and all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon and the kings of the coastlands which are beyond the sea;"
Jeremiah,25,23,"and Dedan, Tema, Buz and all who cut the corners of their hair;"
Jeremiah,25,24,and all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who dwell in the desert;
Jeremiah,25,25,"and all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam and all the kings of Media;"
Jeremiah,25,26,"and all the kings of the north, near and far, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the earth which are upon the face of the ground, and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them."
Jeremiah,25,27,"“You shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, “Drink, be drunk, vomit, fall and rise no more because of the sword which I will send among you.”’"
Jeremiah,25,28,"And it will be, if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you will say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts: “You shall surely drink!"
Jeremiah,25,29,"For behold, I am beginning to work calamity in this city which is called by My name, and shall you be completely free from punishment? You will not be free from punishment; for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth,” declares the LORD of hosts.’"
Jeremiah,25,30,"“Therefore you shall prophesy against them all these words, and you shall say to them, ‘The LORD will roar from on high And utter His voice from His holy habitation; He will roar mightily against His fold. He will shout like those who tread the grapes, Against all the inhabitants of the earth."
Jeremiah,25,31,"‘A clamor has come to the end of the earth, Because the LORD has a controversy with the nations. He is entering into judgment with all flesh; As for the wicked, He has given them to the sword,’ declares the LORD.”"
Jeremiah,25,32,"Thus says the LORD of hosts, “Behold, evil is going forth From nation to nation, And a great storm is being stirred up From the remotest parts of the earth."
Jeremiah,25,33,"“Those slain by the LORD on that day will be from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be lamented, gathered or buried; they will be like dung on the face of the ground."
Jeremiah,25,34,"“Wail, you shepherds, and cry; And wallow in ashes, you masters of the flock; For the days of your slaughter and your dispersions have come, And you will fall like a choice vessel."
Jeremiah,25,35,"“Flight will perish from the shepherds, And escape from the masters of the flock."
Jeremiah,25,36,"“Hear the sound of the cry of the shepherds, And the wailing of the masters of the flock! For the LORD is destroying their pasture,"
Jeremiah,25,37,“And the peaceful folds are made silent Because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
Jeremiah,25,38,“He has left His hiding place like the lion; For their land has become a horror Because of the fierceness of the oppressing sword And because of His fierce anger.”
Jeremiah,26,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah,26,2,"“Thus says the LORD, ‘Stand in the court of the LORD’S house, and speak to all the cities of Judah who have come to worship in the LORD’S house all the words that I have commanded you to speak to them. Do not omit a word!"
Jeremiah,26,3,"Perhaps they will listen and everyone will turn from his evil way, that I may repent of the calamity which I am planning to do to them because of the evil of their deeds.’"
Jeremiah,26,4,"And you will say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD, “If you will not listen to Me, to walk in My law which I have set before you,"
Jeremiah,26,5,"to listen to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I have been sending to you again and again, but you have not listened;"
Jeremiah,26,6,"then I will make this house like Shiloh, and this city I will make a curse to all the nations of the earth.”’”"
Jeremiah,26,7,The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
Jeremiah,26,8,"When Jeremiah finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, “You must die!"
Jeremiah,26,9,"Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD saying, ‘This house will be like Shiloh and this city will be desolate, without inhabitant’?” And all the people gathered about Jeremiah in the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,26,10,"When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to the house of the LORD and sat in the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD’S house."
Jeremiah,26,11,"Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the officials and to all the people, saying, “A death sentence for this man! For he has prophesied against this city as you have heard in your hearing.”"
Jeremiah,26,12,"Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and to all the people, saying, “The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard."
Jeremiah,26,13,Now therefore amend your ways and your deeds and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will change His mind about the misfortune which He has pronounced against you.
Jeremiah,26,14,"But as for me, behold, I am in your hands; do with me as is good and right in your sight."
Jeremiah,26,15,"Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city and on its inhabitants; for truly the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.”"
Jeremiah,26,16,"Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, “No death sentence for this man! For he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.”"
Jeremiah,26,17,"Then some of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,26,18,"“Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘Thus the LORD of hosts has said, “Zion will be plowed as a field, And Jerusalem will become ruins, And the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.”’"
Jeremiah,26,19,"Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and entreat the favor of the LORD, and the LORD changed His mind about the misfortune which He had pronounced against them? But we are committing a great evil against ourselves.”"
Jeremiah,26,20,"Indeed, there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land words similar to all those of Jeremiah."
Jeremiah,26,21,"When King Jehoiakim and all his mighty men and all the officials heard his words, then the king sought to put him to death; but Uriah heard it, and he was afraid and fled and went to Egypt."
Jeremiah,26,22,Then King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor and certain men with him went into Egypt.
Jeremiah,26,23,"And they brought Uriah from Egypt and led him to King Jehoiakim, who slew him with a sword and cast his dead body into the burial place of the common people."
Jeremiah,26,24,"But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he was not given into the hands of the people to put him to death."
Jeremiah,27,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying—"
Jeremiah,27,2,"thus says the LORD to me—“Make for yourself bonds and yokes and put them on your neck,"
Jeremiah,27,3,"and send word to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of the sons of Ammon, to the king of Tyre and to the king of Sidon by the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah."
Jeremiah,27,4,"Command them to go to their masters, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, thus you shall say to your masters,"
Jeremiah,27,5,"“I have made the earth, the men and the beasts which are on the face of the earth by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and I will give it to the one who is pleasing in My sight."
Jeremiah,27,6,"Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and I have given him also the wild animals of the field to serve him."
Jeremiah,27,7,All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson until the time of his own land comes; then many nations and great kings will make him their servant.
Jeremiah,27,8,"“It will be, that the nation or the kingdom which will not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and which will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine and with pestilence,” declares the LORD, “until I have destroyed it by his hand."
Jeremiah,27,9,"But as for you, do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your soothsayers or your sorcerers who speak to you, saying, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon.’"
Jeremiah,27,10,For they prophesy a lie to you in order to remove you far from your land; and I will drive you out and you will perish.
Jeremiah,27,11,"But the nation which will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let remain on its land,” declares the LORD, “and they will till it and dwell in it.”’”"
Jeremiah,27,12,"I spoke words like all these to Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and live!"
Jeremiah,27,13,"Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, famine and pestilence, as the LORD has spoken to that nation which will not serve the king of Babylon?"
Jeremiah,27,14,"So do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they prophesy a lie to you;"
Jeremiah,27,15,"for I have not sent them,” declares the LORD, “but they prophesy falsely in My name, in order that I may drive you out and that you may perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you.”"
Jeremiah,27,16,"Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says the LORD: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, ‘Behold, the vessels of the LORD’S house will now shortly be brought again from Babylon’; for they are prophesying a lie to you."
Jeremiah,27,17,"Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live! Why should this city become a ruin?"
Jeremiah,27,18,"But if they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them now entreat the LORD of hosts that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon."
Jeremiah,27,19,"For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, concerning the sea, concerning the stands and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,"
Jeremiah,27,20,"which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried into exile Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,27,21,"Yes, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD and in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem,"
Jeremiah,27,22,"‘They will be carried to Babylon and they will be there until the day I visit them,’ declares the LORD. ‘Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.’”"
Jeremiah,28,1,"Now in the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and all the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,28,2,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,3,"Within two years I am going to bring back to this place all the vessels of the LORD’S house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,4,"I am also going to bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah who went to Babylon,’ declares the LORD, ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’”"
Jeremiah,28,5,"Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD,"
Jeremiah,28,6,"and the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May the LORD do so; may the LORD confirm your words which you have prophesied to bring back the vessels of the LORD’S house and all the exiles, from Babylon to this place."
Jeremiah,28,7,Yet hear now this word which I am about to speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people!
Jeremiah,28,8,"The prophets who were before me and before you from ancient times prophesied against many lands and against great kingdoms, of war and of calamity and of pestilence."
Jeremiah,28,9,"The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet comes to pass, then that prophet will be known as one whom the LORD has truly sent.”"
Jeremiah,28,10,Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it.
Jeremiah,28,11,"Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Even so will I break within two full years the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations.’” Then the prophet Jeremiah went his way."
Jeremiah,28,12,"The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,28,13,"“Go and speak to Hananiah, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD, “You have broken the yokes of wood, but you have made instead of them yokes of iron.”"
Jeremiah,28,14,"For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they will serve him. And I have also given him the beasts of the field.”’”"
Jeremiah,28,15,"Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen now, Hananiah, the LORD has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie."
Jeremiah,28,16,"Therefore thus says the LORD, ‘Behold, I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This year you are going to die, because you have counseled rebellion against the LORD.’”"
Jeremiah,28,17,So Hananiah the prophet died in the same year in the seventh month.
Jeremiah,29,1,"Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the exile, the priests, the prophets and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,2,"(This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the court officials, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem.)"
Jeremiah,29,3,"The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,4,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon,"
Jeremiah,29,5,‘Build houses and live in them; and plant gardens and eat their produce.
Jeremiah,29,6,"Take wives and become the fathers of sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply there and do not decrease."
Jeremiah,29,7,"Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf; for in its welfare you will have welfare.’"
Jeremiah,29,8,"For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Do not let your prophets who are in your midst and your diviners deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams which they dream."
Jeremiah,29,9,"For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them,’ declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,29,10,"“For thus says the LORD, ‘When seventy years have been completed for Babylon, I will visit you and fulfill My good word to you, to bring you back to this place."
Jeremiah,29,11,"For I know the plans that I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope."
Jeremiah,29,12,"Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you."
Jeremiah,29,13,You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.
Jeremiah,29,14,"I will be found by you,’ declares the LORD, ‘and I will restore your fortunes and will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you,’ declares the LORD, ‘and I will bring you back to the place from where I sent you into exile.’"
Jeremiah,29,15,"“Because you have said, ‘The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon’—"
Jeremiah,29,16,"for thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who did not go with you into exile—"
Jeremiah,29,17,"thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘Behold, I am sending upon them the sword, famine and pestilence, and I will make them like split-open figs that cannot be eaten due to rottenness."
Jeremiah,29,18,"I will pursue them with the sword, with famine and with pestilence; and I will make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse and a horror and a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,"
Jeremiah,29,19,"because they have not listened to My words,’ declares the LORD, ‘which I sent to them again and again by My servants the prophets; but you did not listen,’ declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,29,20,"You, therefore, hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,21,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you falsely in My name, ‘Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will slay them before your eyes."
Jeremiah,29,22,"Because of them a curse will be used by all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon, saying, “May the LORD make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,"
Jeremiah,29,23,"because they have acted foolishly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives and have spoken words in My name falsely, which I did not command them; and I am He who knows and am a witness,” declares the LORD.’”"
Jeremiah,29,24,"To Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,25,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,26,"“The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to be the overseer in the house of the LORD over every madman who prophesies, to put him in the stocks and in the iron collar,"
Jeremiah,29,27,"now then, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who prophesies to you?"
Jeremiah,29,28,"For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, ‘The exile will be long; build houses and live in them and plant gardens and eat their produce.’”’”"
Jeremiah,29,29,Zephaniah the priest read this letter to Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,29,30,"Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,31,"“Send to all the exiles, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite, “Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, although I did not send him, and he has made you trust in a lie,”"
Jeremiah,29,32,"therefore thus says the LORD, “Behold, I am about to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants; he will not have anyone living among this people, and he will not see the good that I am about to do to My people,” declares the LORD, “because he has preached rebellion against the LORD.”’”"
Jeremiah,30,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah,30,2,"“Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Write all the words which I have spoken to you in a book."
Jeremiah,30,3,"For behold, days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah.’ The LORD says, ‘I will also bring them back to the land that I gave to their forefathers and they shall possess it.’”"
Jeremiah,30,4,Now these are the words which the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah:
Jeremiah,30,5,"“For thus says the LORD, ‘I have heard a sound of terror, Of dread, and there is no peace."
Jeremiah,30,6,"‘Ask now, and see If a male can give birth. Why do I see every man With his hands on his loins, as a woman in childbirth? And why have all faces turned pale?"
Jeremiah,30,7,"‘Alas! for that day is great, There is none like it; And it is the time of Jacob’s distress, But he will be saved from it."
Jeremiah,30,8,"‘It shall come about on that day,’ declares the LORD of hosts, ‘that I will break his yoke from off their neck and will tear off their bonds; and strangers will no longer make them their slaves."
Jeremiah,30,9,"But they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them."
Jeremiah,30,10,"‘Fear not, O Jacob My servant,’ declares the LORD, ‘And do not be dismayed, O Israel; For behold, I will save you from afar And your offspring from the land of their captivity. And Jacob will return and will be quiet and at ease, And no one will make him afraid."
Jeremiah,30,11,"‘For I am with you,’ declares the LORD, ‘to save you; For I will destroy completely all the nations where I have scattered you, Only I will not destroy you completely. But I will chasten you justly And will by no means leave you unpunished.’"
Jeremiah,30,12,"“For thus says the LORD, ‘Your wound is incurable And your injury is serious."
Jeremiah,30,13,"‘There is no one to plead your cause; No healing for your sore, No recovery for you."
Jeremiah,30,14,"‘All your lovers have forgotten you, They do not seek you; For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, With the punishment of a cruel one, Because your iniquity is great And your sins are numerous."
Jeremiah,30,15,"‘Why do you cry out over your injury? Your pain is incurable. Because your iniquity is great And your sins are numerous, I have done these things to you."
Jeremiah,30,16,"‘Therefore all who devour you will be devoured; And all your adversaries, every one of them, will go into captivity; And those who plunder you will be for plunder, And all who prey upon you I will give for prey."
Jeremiah,30,17,"‘For I will restore you to health And I will heal you of your wounds,’ declares the LORD, ‘Because they have called you an outcast, saying: “It is Zion; no one cares for her.”’"
Jeremiah,30,18,"“Thus says the LORD, ‘Behold, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob And have compassion on his dwelling places; And the city will be rebuilt on its ruin, And the palace will stand on its rightful place."
Jeremiah,30,19,‘From them will proceed thanksgiving And the voice of those who celebrate; And I will multiply them and they will not be diminished; I will also honor them and they will not be insignificant.
Jeremiah,30,20,"‘Their children also will be as formerly, And their congregation shall be established before Me; And I will punish all their oppressors."
Jeremiah,30,21,"‘Their leader shall be one of them, And their ruler shall come forth from their midst; And I will bring him near and he shall approach Me; For who would dare to risk his life to approach Me?’ declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,30,22,"‘You shall be My people, And I will be your God.’”"
Jeremiah,30,23,"Behold, the tempest of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, A sweeping tempest; It will burst on the head of the wicked."
Jeremiah,30,24,The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back Until He has performed and until He has accomplished The intent of His heart; In the latter days you will understand this.
Jeremiah,31,1,"“At that time,” declares the LORD, “I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be My people.”"
Jeremiah,31,2,"Thus says the LORD, “The people who survived the sword Found grace in the wilderness— Israel, when it went to find its rest.”"
Jeremiah,31,3,"The LORD appeared to him from afar, saying, “I have loved you with an everlasting love; Therefore I have drawn you with lovingkindness."
Jeremiah,31,4,"“Again I will build you and you will be rebuilt, O virgin of Israel! Again you will take up your tambourines, And go forth to the dances of the merrymakers."
Jeremiah,31,5,“Again you will plant vineyards On the hills of Samaria; The planters will plant And will enjoy them.
Jeremiah,31,6,"“For there will be a day when watchmen On the hills of Ephraim call out, ‘Arise, and let us go up to Zion, To the LORD our God.’”"
Jeremiah,31,7,"For thus says the LORD, “Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob, And shout among the chief of the nations; Proclaim, give praise and say, ‘O LORD, save Your people, The remnant of Israel.’"
Jeremiah,31,8,"“Behold, I am bringing them from the north country, And I will gather them from the remote parts of the earth, Among them the blind and the lame, The woman with child and she who is in labor with child, together; A great company, they will return here."
Jeremiah,31,9,"“With weeping they will come, And by supplication I will lead them; I will make them walk by streams of waters, On a straight path in which they will not stumble; For I am a father to Israel, And Ephraim is My firstborn.”"
Jeremiah,31,10,"Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, And declare in the coastlands afar off, And say, “He who scattered Israel will gather him And keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock.”"
Jeremiah,31,11,For the LORD has ransomed Jacob And redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.
Jeremiah,31,12,"“They will come and shout for joy on the height of Zion, And they will be radiant over the bounty of the LORD— Over the grain and the new wine and the oil, And over the young of the flock and the herd; And their life will be like a watered garden, And they will never languish again."
Jeremiah,31,13,"“Then the virgin will rejoice in the dance, And the young men and the old, together, For I will turn their mourning into joy And will comfort them and give them joy for their sorrow."
Jeremiah,31,14,"“I will fill the soul of the priests with abundance, And My people will be satisfied with My goodness,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,15,"Thus says the LORD, “A voice is heard in Ramah, Lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; She refuses to be comforted for her children, Because they are no more.”"
Jeremiah,31,16,"Thus says the LORD, “Restrain your voice from weeping And your eyes from tears; For your work will be rewarded,” declares the LORD, “And they will return from the land of the enemy."
Jeremiah,31,17,"“There is hope for your future,” declares the LORD, “And your children will return to their own territory."
Jeremiah,31,18,"“I have surely heard Ephraim grieving, ‘You have chastised me, and I was chastised, Like an untrained calf; Bring me back that I may be restored, For You are the LORD my God."
Jeremiah,31,19,"‘For after I turned back, I repented; And after I was instructed, I smote on my thigh; I was ashamed and also humiliated Because I bore the reproach of my youth.’"
Jeremiah,31,20,"“Is Ephraim My dear son? Is he a delightful child? Indeed, as often as I have spoken against him, I certainly still remember him; Therefore My heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy on him,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,21,"“Set up for yourself roadmarks, Place for yourself guideposts; Direct your mind to the highway, The way by which you went. Return, O virgin of Israel, Return to these your cities."
Jeremiah,31,22,"“How long will you go here and there, O faithless daughter? For the LORD has created a new thing in the earth— A woman will encompass a man.”"
Jeremiah,31,23,"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, “Once again they will speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities when I restore their fortunes, ‘The LORD bless you, O abode of righteousness, O holy hill!’"
Jeremiah,31,24,"Judah and all its cities will dwell together in it, the farmer and they who go about with flocks."
Jeremiah,31,25,For I satisfy the weary ones and refresh everyone who languishes.”
Jeremiah,31,26,"At this I awoke and looked, and my sleep was pleasant to me."
Jeremiah,31,27,"“Behold, days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast."
Jeremiah,31,28,"As I have watched over them to pluck up, to break down, to overthrow, to destroy and to bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,29,"“In those days they will not say again, ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, And the children’s teeth are set on edge.’"
Jeremiah,31,30,"But everyone will die for his own iniquity; each man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth will be set on edge."
Jeremiah,31,31,"“Behold, days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,"
Jeremiah,31,32,"not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,33,"“But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days,” declares the LORD, “I will put My law within them and on their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."
Jeremiah,31,34,"They will not teach again, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them,” declares the LORD, “for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.”"
Jeremiah,31,35,"Thus says the LORD, Who gives the sun for light by day And the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night, Who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar; The LORD of hosts is His name:"
Jeremiah,31,36,"“If this fixed order departs From before Me,” declares the LORD, “Then the offspring of Israel also will cease From being a nation before Me forever.”"
Jeremiah,31,37,"Thus says the LORD, “If the heavens above can be measured And the foundations of the earth searched out below, Then I will also cast off all the offspring of Israel For all that they have done,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,38,"“Behold, days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when the city will be rebuilt for the LORD from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate."
Jeremiah,31,39,The measuring line will go out farther straight ahead to the hill Gareb; then it will turn to Goah.
Jeremiah,31,40,"And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields as far as the brook Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be holy to the LORD; it will not be plucked up or overthrown anymore forever.”"
Jeremiah,32,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar."
Jeremiah,32,2,"Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the house of the king of Judah,"
Jeremiah,32,3,"because Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, “Why do you prophesy, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Behold, I am about to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will take it;"
Jeremiah,32,4,"and Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but he will surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye;"
Jeremiah,32,5,"and he will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will be there until I visit him,” declares the LORD. “If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not succeed”’?”"
Jeremiah,32,6,"And Jeremiah said, “The word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,7,"‘Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle is coming to you, saying, “Buy for yourself my field which is at Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption to buy it.”’"
Jeremiah,32,8,"Then Hanamel my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of the LORD and said to me, ‘Buy my field, please, that is at Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for you have the right of possession and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD."
Jeremiah,32,9,"“I bought the field which was at Anathoth from Hanamel my uncle’s son, and I weighed out the silver for him, seventeen shekels of silver."
Jeremiah,32,10,"I signed and sealed the deed, and called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver on the scales."
Jeremiah,32,11,"Then I took the deeds of purchase, both the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions and the open copy;"
Jeremiah,32,12,"and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the sight of Hanamel my uncle’s son and in the sight of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, before all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard."
Jeremiah,32,13,"And I commanded Baruch in their presence, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,14,"‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, “Take these deeds, this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware jar, that they may last a long time.”"
Jeremiah,32,15,"For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, “Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.”’"
Jeremiah,32,16,"“After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, then I prayed to the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,17,"‘Ah Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for You,"
Jeremiah,32,18,"who shows lovingkindness to thousands, but repays the iniquity of fathers into the bosom of their children after them, O great and mighty God. The LORD of hosts is His name;"
Jeremiah,32,19,"great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, giving to everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds;"
Jeremiah,32,20,"who has set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and even to this day both in Israel and among mankind; and You have made a name for Yourself, as at this day."
Jeremiah,32,21,"You brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with great terror;"
Jeremiah,32,22,"and gave them this land, which You swore to their forefathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Jeremiah,32,23,"They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey Your voice or walk in Your law; they have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have made all this calamity come upon them."
Jeremiah,32,24,"Behold, the siege ramps have reached the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, the famine and the pestilence; and what You have spoken has come to pass; and behold, You see it."
Jeremiah,32,25,"You have said to me, O Lord GOD, “Buy for yourself the field with money and call in witnesses”—although the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’”"
Jeremiah,32,26,"Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,27,"“Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?”"
Jeremiah,32,28,"Therefore thus says the LORD, “Behold, I am about to give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will take it."
Jeremiah,32,29,"The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will enter and set this city on fire and burn it, with the houses where people have offered incense to Baal on their roofs and poured out drink offerings to other gods to provoke Me to anger."
Jeremiah,32,30,"Indeed the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have been doing only evil in My sight from their youth; for the sons of Israel have been only provoking Me to anger by the work of their hands,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,32,31,"“Indeed this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and My wrath from the day that they built it, even to this day, so that it should be removed from before My face,"
Jeremiah,32,32,"because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah which they have done to provoke Me to anger—they, their kings, their leaders, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,32,33,"They have turned their back to Me and not their face; though I taught them, teaching again and again, they would not listen and receive instruction."
Jeremiah,32,34,"But they put their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it."
Jeremiah,32,35,"They built the high places of Baal that are in the valley of Ben-hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech, which I had not commanded them nor had it entered My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin."
Jeremiah,32,36,"“Now therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning this city of which you say, ‘It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine and by pestilence.’"
Jeremiah,32,37,"Behold, I will gather them out of all the lands to which I have driven them in My anger, in My wrath and in great indignation; and I will bring them back to this place and make them dwell in safety."
Jeremiah,32,38,"They shall be My people, and I will be their God;"
Jeremiah,32,39,"and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me always, for their own good and for the good of their children after them."
Jeremiah,32,40,"I will make an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put the fear of Me in their hearts so that they will not turn away from Me."
Jeremiah,32,41,I will rejoice over them to do them good and will faithfully plant them in this land with all My heart and with all My soul.
Jeremiah,32,42,"For thus says the LORD, ‘Just as I brought all this great disaster on this people, so I am going to bring on them all the good that I am promising them."
Jeremiah,32,43,"Fields will be bought in this land of which you say, “It is a desolation, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.”"
Jeremiah,32,44,"Men will buy fields for money, sign and seal deeds, and call in witnesses in the land of Benjamin, in the environs of Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the Negev; for I will restore their fortunes,’ declares the LORD.”"
Jeremiah,33,1,"Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still confined in the court of the guard, saying,"
Jeremiah,33,2,"“Thus says the LORD who made the earth, the LORD who formed it to establish it, the LORD is His name,"
Jeremiah,33,3,"‘Call to Me and I will answer you, and I will tell you great and mighty things, which you do not know.’"
Jeremiah,33,4,"For thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah which are broken down to make a defense against the siege ramps and against the sword,"
Jeremiah,33,5,"‘While they are coming to fight with the Chaldeans and to fill them with the corpses of men whom I have slain in My anger and in My wrath, and I have hidden My face from this city because of all their wickedness:"
Jeremiah,33,6,"Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them; and I will reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth."
Jeremiah,33,7,I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel and will rebuild them as they were at first.
Jeremiah,33,8,"I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against Me, and I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against Me and by which they have transgressed against Me."
Jeremiah,33,9,"It will be to Me a name of joy, praise and glory before all the nations of the earth which will hear of all the good that I do for them, and they will fear and tremble because of all the good and all the peace that I make for it.’"
Jeremiah,33,10,"“Thus says the LORD, ‘Yet again there will be heard in this place, of which you say, “It is a waste, without man and without beast,” that is, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast,"
Jeremiah,33,11,"the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, “Give thanks to the LORD of hosts, For the LORD is good, For His lovingkindness is everlasting”; and of those who bring a thank offering into the house of the LORD. For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were at first,’ says the LORD."
Jeremiah,33,12,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘There will again be in this place which is waste, without man or beast, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds who rest their flocks."
Jeremiah,33,13,"In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the Negev, in the land of Benjamin, in the environs of Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who numbers them,’ says the LORD."
Jeremiah,33,14,"‘Behold, days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘when I will fulfill the good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house of Judah."
Jeremiah,33,15,In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch of David to spring forth; and He shall execute justice and righteousness on the earth.
Jeremiah,33,16,In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will dwell in safety; and this is the name by which she will be called: the LORD is our righteousness.’
Jeremiah,33,17,"For thus says the LORD, ‘David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;"
Jeremiah,33,18,"and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man before Me to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings and to prepare sacrifices continually.’”"
Jeremiah,33,19,"The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,33,20,"“Thus says the LORD, ‘If you can break My covenant for the day and My covenant for the night, so that day and night will not be at their appointed time,"
Jeremiah,33,21,"then My covenant may also be broken with David My servant so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levitical priests, My ministers."
Jeremiah,33,22,"As the host of heaven cannot be counted and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the descendants of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.’”"
Jeremiah,33,23,"And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,33,24,"“Have you not observed what this people have spoken, saying, ‘The two families which the LORD chose, He has rejected them’? Thus they despise My people, no longer are they as a nation in their sight."
Jeremiah,33,25,"Thus says the LORD, ‘If My covenant for day and night stand not, and the fixed patterns of heaven and earth I have not established,"
Jeremiah,33,26,"then I would reject the descendants of Jacob and David My servant, not taking from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. But I will restore their fortunes and will have mercy on them.’”"
Jeremiah,34,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army, with all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying,"
Jeremiah,34,2,"“Thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him: “Thus says the LORD, ‘Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire."
Jeremiah,34,3,"You will not escape from his hand, for you will surely be captured and delivered into his hand; and you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye, and he will speak with you face to face, and you will go to Babylon.’”’"
Jeremiah,34,4,"Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the LORD concerning you, ‘You will not die by the sword."
Jeremiah,34,5,"You will die in peace; and as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will burn spices for you; and they will lament for you, “Alas, lord!”’ For I have spoken the word,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,34,6,Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem
Jeremiah,34,7,"when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the remaining cities of Judah, that is, Lachish and Azekah, for they alone remained as fortified cities among the cities of Judah."
Jeremiah,34,8,The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem to proclaim release to them:
Jeremiah,34,9,"that each man should set free his male servant and each man his female servant, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman; so that no one should keep them, a Jew his brother, in bondage."
Jeremiah,34,10,"And all the officials and all the people obeyed who had entered into the covenant that each man should set free his male servant and each man his female servant, so that no one should keep them any longer in bondage; they obeyed, and set them free."
Jeremiah,34,11,"But afterward they turned around and took back the male servants and the female servants whom they had set free, and brought them into subjection for male servants and for female servants."
Jeremiah,34,12,"Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah,34,13,"“Thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘I made a covenant with your forefathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, saying,"
Jeremiah,34,14,"“At the end of seven years each of you shall set free his Hebrew brother who has been sold to you and has served you six years, you shall send him out free from you; but your forefathers did not obey Me or incline their ear to Me."
Jeremiah,34,15,"Although recently you had turned and done what is right in My sight, each man proclaiming release to his neighbor, and you had made a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name."
Jeremiah,34,16,"Yet you turned and profaned My name, and each man took back his male servant and each man his female servant whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your male servants and female servants.”’"
Jeremiah,34,17,"“Therefore thus says the LORD, ‘You have not obeyed Me in proclaiming release each man to his brother and each man to his neighbor. Behold, I am proclaiming a release to you,’ declares the LORD, ‘to the sword, to the pestilence and to the famine; and I will make you a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth."
Jeremiah,34,18,"I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not fulfilled the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts—"
Jeremiah,34,19,"the officials of Judah and the officials of Jerusalem, the court officers and the priests and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf—"
Jeremiah,34,20,I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life. And their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah,34,21,"Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has gone away from you."
Jeremiah,34,22,"Behold, I am going to command,’ declares the LORD, ‘and I will bring them back to this city; and they will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.’”"
Jeremiah,35,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,"
Jeremiah,35,2,"“Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.”"
Jeremiah,35,3,"Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites,"
Jeremiah,35,4,"and I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the doorkeeper."
Jeremiah,35,5,"Then I set before the men of the house of the Rechabites pitchers full of wine and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine!”"
Jeremiah,35,6,"But they said, “We will not drink wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall not drink wine, you or your sons, forever."
Jeremiah,35,7,"You shall not build a house, and you shall not sow seed and you shall not plant a vineyard or own one; but in tents you shall dwell all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.’"
Jeremiah,35,8,"We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons or our daughters,"
Jeremiah,35,9,nor to build ourselves houses to dwell in; and we do not have vineyard or field or seed.
Jeremiah,35,10,"We have only dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and have done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us."
Jeremiah,35,11,"But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come and let us go to Jerusalem before the army of the Chaldeans and before the army of the Arameans.’ So we have dwelt in Jerusalem.”"
Jeremiah,35,12,"Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,35,13,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Will you not receive instruction by listening to My words?” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,35,14,"“The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are observed. So they do not drink wine to this day, for they have obeyed their father’s command. But I have spoken to you again and again; yet you have not listened to Me."
Jeremiah,35,15,"Also I have sent to you all My servants the prophets, sending them again and again, saying: ‘Turn now every man from his evil way and amend your deeds, and do not go after other gods to worship them. Then you will dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your forefathers; but you have not inclined your ear or listened to Me."
Jeremiah,35,16,"Indeed, the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have observed the command of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to Me.’”’"
Jeremiah,35,17,"Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, I am bringing on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them; because I spoke to them but they did not listen, and I have called them but they did not answer.’”"
Jeremiah,35,18,"Then Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father, kept all his commands and done according to all that he commanded you;"
Jeremiah,35,19,"therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, “Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before Me always.”’”"
Jeremiah,36,1,"In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah,36,2,"“Take a scroll and write on it all the words which I have spoken to you concerning Israel and concerning Judah, and concerning all the nations, from the day I first spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day."
Jeremiah,36,3,"Perhaps the house of Judah will hear all the calamity which I plan to bring on them, in order that every man will turn from his evil way; then I will forgive their iniquity and their sin.”"
Jeremiah,36,4,"Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD which He had spoken to him."
Jeremiah,36,5,"Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, “I am restricted; I cannot go into the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,36,6,So you go and read from the scroll which you have written at my dictation the words of the LORD to the people in the LORD’S house on a fast day. And also you shall read them to all the people of Judah who come from their cities.
Jeremiah,36,7,"Perhaps their supplication will come before the LORD, and everyone will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and the wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people.”"
Jeremiah,36,8,"Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from the book the words of the LORD in the LORD’S house."
Jeremiah,36,9,"Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD."
Jeremiah,36,10,"Then Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD’S house, to all the people."
Jeremiah,36,11,"Now when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard all the words of the LORD from the book,"
Jeremiah,36,12,"he went down to the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber. And behold, all the officials were sitting there—Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the other officials."
Jeremiah,36,13,Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read from the book to the people.
Jeremiah,36,14,"Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read to the people and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and went to them."
Jeremiah,36,15,"They said to him, “Sit down, please, and read it to us.” So Baruch read it to them."
Jeremiah,36,16,"When they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one to another and said to Baruch, “We will surely report all these words to the king.”"
Jeremiah,36,17,"And they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?”"
Jeremiah,36,18,"Then Baruch said to them, “He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink on the book.”"
Jeremiah,36,19,"Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go, hide yourself, you and Jeremiah, and do not let anyone know where you are.”"
Jeremiah,36,20,"So they went to the king in the court, but they had deposited the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and they reported all the words to the king."
Jeremiah,36,21,"Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it to the king as well as to all the officials who stood beside the king."
Jeremiah,36,22,"Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, with a fire burning in the brazier before him."
Jeremiah,36,23,"When Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king cut it with a scribe’s knife and threw it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier."
Jeremiah,36,24,"Yet the king and all his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, nor did they rend their garments."
Jeremiah,36,25,"Even though Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah pleaded with the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them."
Jeremiah,36,26,"And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them."
Jeremiah,36,27,"Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll and the words which Baruch had written at the dictation of Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,36,28,“Take again another scroll and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned.
Jeremiah,36,29,"And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Thus says the LORD, “You have burned this scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written on it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will make man and beast to cease from it?’”"
Jeremiah,36,30,"Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah, “He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night."
Jeremiah,36,31,"I will also punish him and his descendants and his servants for their iniquity, and I will bring on them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the men of Judah all the calamity that I have declared to them—but they did not listen.”’”"
Jeremiah,36,32,"Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah, the scribe, and he wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them."
Jeremiah,37,1,"Now Zedekiah the son of Josiah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had made king in the land of Judah, reigned as king in place of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim."
Jeremiah,37,2,But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the LORD which He spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,37,3,"Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Please pray to the LORD our God on our behalf.”"
Jeremiah,37,4,"Now Jeremiah was still coming in and going out among the people, for they had not yet put him in the prison."
Jeremiah,37,5,"Meanwhile, Pharaoh’s army had set out from Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who had been besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they lifted the siege from Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,37,6,"Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,"
Jeremiah,37,7,"“Thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘Thus you are to say to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: “Behold, Pharaoh’s army which has come out for your assistance is going to return to its own land of Egypt."
Jeremiah,37,8,"The Chaldeans will also return and fight against this city, and they will capture it and burn it with fire.”’"
Jeremiah,37,9,"Thus says the LORD, ‘Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely go away from us,” for they will not go."
Jeremiah,37,10,"For even if you had defeated the entire army of Chaldeans who were fighting against you, and there were only wounded men left among them, each man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.’”"
Jeremiah,37,11,"Now it happened when the army of the Chaldeans had lifted the siege from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army,"
Jeremiah,37,12,that Jeremiah went out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin in order to take possession of some property there among the people.
Jeremiah,37,13,"While he was at the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah was there; and he arrested Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are going over to the Chaldeans!”"
Jeremiah,37,14,"But Jeremiah said, “A lie! I am not going over to the Chaldeans”; yet he would not listen to him. So Irijah arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials."
Jeremiah,37,15,"Then the officials were angry at Jeremiah and beat him, and they put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe, which they had made into the prison."
Jeremiah,37,16,"For Jeremiah had come into the dungeon, that is, the vaulted cell; and Jeremiah stayed there many days."
Jeremiah,37,17,"Now King Zedekiah sent and took him out; and in his palace the king secretly asked him and said, “Is there a word from the LORD?” And Jeremiah said, “There is!” Then he said, “You will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon!”"
Jeremiah,37,18,"Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “In what way have I sinned against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?"
Jeremiah,37,19,"Where then are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land’?"
Jeremiah,37,20,"But now, please listen, O my lord the king; please let my petition come before you and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, that I may not die there.”"
Jeremiah,37,21,"Then King Zedekiah gave commandment, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guardhouse and gave him a loaf of bread daily from the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guardhouse."
Jeremiah,38,1,"Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,38,2,"“Thus says the LORD, ‘He who stays in this city will die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence, but he who goes out to the Chaldeans will live and have his own life as booty and stay alive.’"
Jeremiah,38,3,"Thus says the LORD, ‘This city will certainly be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and he will capture it.’”"
Jeremiah,38,4,"Then the officials said to the king, “Now let this man be put to death, inasmuch as he is discouraging the men of war who are left in this city and all the people, by speaking such words to them; for this man is not seeking the well-being of this people but rather their harm.”"
Jeremiah,38,5,"So King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing against you.”"
Jeremiah,38,6,"Then they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchijah the king’s son, which was in the court of the guardhouse; and they let Jeremiah down with ropes. Now in the cistern there was no water but only mud, and Jeremiah sank into the mud."
Jeremiah,38,7,"But Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, while he was in the king’s palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. Now the king was sitting in the Gate of Benjamin;"
Jeremiah,38,8,"and Ebed-melech went out from the king’s palace and spoke to the king, saying,"
Jeremiah,38,9,"“My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the cistern; and he will die right where he is because of the famine, for there is no more bread in the city.”"
Jeremiah,38,10,"Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take thirty men from here under your authority and bring up Jeremiah the prophet from the cistern before he dies.”"
Jeremiah,38,11,So Ebed-melech took the men under his authority and went into the king’s palace to a place beneath the storeroom and took from there worn-out clothes and worn-out rags and let them down by ropes into the cistern to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,38,12,"Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Now put these worn-out clothes and rags under your armpits under the ropes”; and Jeremiah did so."
Jeremiah,38,13,"So they pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern, and Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guardhouse."
Jeremiah,38,14,"Then King Zedekiah sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance that is in the house of the LORD; and the king said to Jeremiah, “I am going to ask you something; do not hide anything from me.”"
Jeremiah,38,15,"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not certainly put me to death? Besides, if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.”"
Jeremiah,38,16,"But King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in secret saying, “As the LORD lives, who made this life for us, surely I will not put you to death nor will I give you over to the hand of these men who are seeking your life.”"
Jeremiah,38,17,"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘If you will indeed go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then you will live, this city will not be burned with fire, and you and your household will survive."
Jeremiah,38,18,"But if you will not go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given over to the hand of the Chaldeans; and they will burn it with fire, and you yourself will not escape from their hand.’”"
Jeremiah,38,19,"Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I dread the Jews who have gone over to the Chaldeans, for they may give me over into their hand and they will abuse me.”"
Jeremiah,38,20,"But Jeremiah said, “They will not give you over. Please obey the LORD in what I am saying to you, that it may go well with you and you may live."
Jeremiah,38,21,"But if you keep refusing to go out, this is the word which the LORD has shown me:"
Jeremiah,38,22,"‘Then behold, all of the women who have been left in the palace of the king of Judah are going to be brought out to the officers of the king of Babylon; and those women will say, “Your close friends Have misled and overpowered you; While your feet were sunk in the mire, They turned back.”"
Jeremiah,38,23,"They will also bring out all your wives and your sons to the Chaldeans, and you yourself will not escape from their hand, but will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned with fire.’”"
Jeremiah,38,24,"Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no man know about these words and you will not die."
Jeremiah,38,25,"But if the officials hear that I have talked with you and come to you and say to you, ‘Tell us now what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us and we will not put you to death,’"
Jeremiah,38,26,"then you are to say to them, ‘I was presenting my petition before the king, not to make me return to the house of Jonathan to die there.’”"
Jeremiah,38,27,"Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him. So he reported to them in accordance with all these words which the king had commanded; and they ceased speaking with him, since the conversation had not been overheard."
Jeremiah,38,28,So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guardhouse until the day that Jerusalem was captured.
Jeremiah,39,1,"Now when Jerusalem was captured in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it;"
Jeremiah,39,2,"in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the city wall was breached."
Jeremiah,39,3,"Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came in and sat down at the Middle Gate: Nergal-sar-ezer, Samgar-nebu, Sar-sekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,4,"When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, they fled and went out of the city at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah."
Jeremiah,39,5,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and they seized him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him."
Jeremiah,39,6,Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes at Riblah; the king of Babylon also slew all the nobles of Judah.
Jeremiah,39,7,He then blinded Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in fetters of bronze to bring him to Babylon.
Jeremiah,39,8,"The Chaldeans also burned with fire the king’s palace and the houses of the people, and they broke down the walls of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,39,9,"As for the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had gone over to him and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard carried them into exile in Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,10,"But some of the poorest people who had nothing, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard left behind in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at that time."
Jeremiah,39,11,"Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, saying,"
Jeremiah,39,12,"“Take him and look after him, and do nothing harmful to him, but rather deal with him just as he tells you.”"
Jeremiah,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard sent word, along with Nebushazban the Rab-saris, and Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the leading officers of the king of Babylon;"
Jeremiah,39,14,"they even sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guardhouse and entrusted him to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he stayed among the people."
Jeremiah,39,15,"Now the word of the LORD had come to Jeremiah while he was confined in the court of the guardhouse, saying,"
Jeremiah,39,16,"“Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, “Behold, I am about to bring My words on this city for disaster and not for prosperity; and they will take place before you on that day."
Jeremiah,39,17,"But I will deliver you on that day,” declares the LORD, “and you will not be given into the hand of the men whom you dread."
Jeremiah,39,18,"For I will certainly rescue you, and you will not fall by the sword; but you will have your own life as booty, because you have trusted in Me,” declares the LORD.’”"
Jeremiah,40,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan captain of the bodyguard had released him from Ramah, when he had taken him bound in chains among all the exiles of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon."
Jeremiah,40,2,"Now the captain of the bodyguard had taken Jeremiah and said to him, “The LORD your God promised this calamity against this place;"
Jeremiah,40,3,"and the LORD has brought it on and done just as He promised. Because you people sinned against the LORD and did not listen to His voice, therefore this thing has happened to you."
Jeremiah,40,4,"But now, behold, I am freeing you today from the chains which are on your hands. If you would prefer to come with me to Babylon, come along, and I will look after you; but if you would prefer not to come with me to Babylon, never mind. Look, the whole land is before you; go wherever it seems good and right for you to go.”"
Jeremiah,40,5,"As Jeremiah was still not going back, he said, “Go on back then to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people; or else go anywhere it seems right for you to go.” So the captain of the bodyguard gave him a ration and a gift and let him go."
Jeremiah,40,6,Then Jeremiah went to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.
Jeremiah,40,7,"Now all the commanders of the forces that were in the field, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam over the land and that he had put him in charge of the men, women and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been exiled to Babylon."
Jeremiah,40,8,"So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, along with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, both they and their men."
Jeremiah,40,9,"Then Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying, “Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans; stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, that it may go well with you."
Jeremiah,40,10,"Now as for me, behold, I am going to stay at Mizpah to stand for you before the Chaldeans who come to us; but as for you, gather in wine and summer fruit and oil and put them in your storage vessels, and live in your cities that you have taken over.”"
Jeremiah,40,11,"Likewise, also all the Jews who were in Moab and among the sons of Ammon and in Edom and who were in all the other countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant for Judah, and that he had appointed over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan."
Jeremiah,40,12,"Then all the Jews returned from all the places to which they had been driven away and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered in wine and summer fruit in great abundance."
Jeremiah,40,13,Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
Jeremiah,40,14,"and said to him, “Are you well aware that Baalis the king of the sons of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them."
Jeremiah,40,15,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying, “Let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and not a man will know! Why should he take your life, so that all the Jews who are gathered to you would be scattered and the remnant of Judah would perish?”"
Jeremiah,40,16,"But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “Do not do this thing, for you are telling a lie about Ishmael.”"
Jeremiah,41,1,"In the seventh month Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family and one of the chief officers of the king, along with ten men, came to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. While they were eating bread together there in Mizpah,"
Jeremiah,41,2,"Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him arose and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and put to death the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land."
Jeremiah,41,3,"Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with him, that is with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war."
Jeremiah,41,4,"Now it happened on the next day after the killing of Gedaliah, when no one knew about it,"
Jeremiah,41,5,"that eighty men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria with their beards shaved off and their clothes torn and their bodies gashed, having grain offerings and incense in their hands to bring to the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,41,6,"Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went; and as he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!”"
Jeremiah,41,7,"Yet it turned out that as soon as they came inside the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men that were with him slaughtered them and cast them into the cistern."
Jeremiah,41,8,"But ten men who were found among them said to Ishmael, “Do not put us to death; for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil and honey hidden in the field.” So he refrained and did not put them to death along with their companions."
Jeremiah,41,9,"Now as for the cistern where Ishmael had cast all the corpses of the men whom he had struck down because of Gedaliah, it was the one that King Asa had made on account of Baasha, king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain."
Jeremiah,41,10,"Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people who were in Mizpah, the king’s daughters and all the people who were left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had put under the charge of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; thus Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and proceeded to cross over to the sons of Ammon."
Jeremiah,41,11,But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done.
Jeremiah,41,12,So they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and they found him by the great pool that is in Gibeon.
Jeremiah,41,13,"Now as soon as all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and the commanders of the forces that were with him, they were glad."
Jeremiah,41,14,"So all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah."
Jeremiah,41,15,But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the sons of Ammon.
Jeremiah,41,16,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him took from Mizpah all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, that is, the men who were soldiers, the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon."
Jeremiah,41,17,"And they went and stayed in Geruth Chimham, which is beside Bethlehem, in order to proceed into Egypt"
Jeremiah,41,18,"because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, since Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land."
Jeremiah,42,1,"Then all the commanders of the forces, Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people both small and great approached"
Jeremiah,42,2,"and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please let our petition come before you, and pray for us to the LORD your God, that is for all this remnant; because we are left but a few out of many, as your own eyes now see us,"
Jeremiah,42,3,that the LORD your God may tell us the way in which we should walk and the thing that we should do.”
Jeremiah,42,4,"Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Behold, I am going to pray to the LORD your God in accordance with your words; and I will tell you the whole message which the LORD will answer you. I will not keep back a word from you.”"
Jeremiah,42,5,"Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with the whole message with which the LORD your God will send you to us."
Jeremiah,42,6,"Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will listen to the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you, so that it may go well with us when we listen to the voice of the LORD our God.”"
Jeremiah,42,7,Now at the end of ten days the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,42,8,"Then he called for Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him, and for all the people both small and great,"
Jeremiah,42,9,"and said to them, “Thus says the LORD the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition before Him:"
Jeremiah,42,10,"‘If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down, and I will plant you and not uproot you; for I will relent concerning the calamity that I have inflicted on you."
Jeremiah,42,11,"Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you are now fearing; do not be afraid of him,’ declares the LORD, ‘for I am with you to save you and deliver you from his hand."
Jeremiah,42,12,"I will also show you compassion, so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your own soil."
Jeremiah,42,13,"But if you are going to say, “We will not stay in this land,” so as not to listen to the voice of the LORD your God,"
Jeremiah,42,14,"saying, “No, but we will go to the land of Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the sound of a trumpet or hunger for bread, and we will stay there”;"
Jeremiah,42,15,"then in that case listen to the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, “If you really set your mind to enter Egypt and go in to reside there,"
Jeremiah,42,16,"then the sword, which you are afraid of, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are anxious, will follow closely after you there in Egypt, and you will die there."
Jeremiah,42,17,"So all the men who set their mind to go to Egypt to reside there will die by the sword, by famine and by pestilence; and they will have no survivors or refugees from the calamity that I am going to bring on them.”’”"
Jeremiah,42,18,"For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, “As My anger and wrath have been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so My wrath will be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. And you will become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation and a reproach; and you will see this place no more.”"
Jeremiah,42,19,"The LORD has spoken to you, O remnant of Judah, “Do not go into Egypt!” You should clearly understand that today I have testified against you."
Jeremiah,42,20,"For you have only deceived yourselves; for it is you who sent me to the LORD your God, saying, “Pray for us to the LORD our God; and whatever the LORD our God says, tell us so, and we will do it.”"
Jeremiah,42,21,"So I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the LORD your God, even in whatever He has sent me to tell you."
Jeremiah,42,22,"Therefore you should now clearly understand that you will die by the sword, by famine and by pestilence, in the place where you wish to go to reside."
Jeremiah,43,1,"But as soon as Jeremiah, whom the LORD their God had sent, had finished telling all the people all the words of the LORD their God—that is, all these words—"
Jeremiah,43,2,"Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie! The LORD our God has not sent you to say, ‘You are not to enter Egypt to reside there’;"
Jeremiah,43,3,"but Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us to give us over into the hand of the Chaldeans, so they will put us to death or exile us to Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,43,4,"So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces, and all the people, did not obey the voice of the LORD to stay in the land of Judah."
Jeremiah,43,5,"But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took the entire remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations to which they had been driven away, in order to reside in the land of Judah—"
Jeremiah,43,6,"the men, the women, the children, the king’s daughters and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, together with Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah—"
Jeremiah,43,7,and they entered the land of Egypt (for they did not obey the voice of the LORD) and went in as far as Tahpanhes.
Jeremiah,43,8,"Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,"
Jeremiah,43,9,"“Take some large stones in your hands and hide them in the mortar in the brick terrace which is at the entrance of Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of some of the Jews;"
Jeremiah,43,10,"and say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, “Behold, I am going to send and get Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and I am going to set his throne right over these stones that I have hidden; and he will spread his canopy over them."
Jeremiah,43,11,"He will also come and strike the land of Egypt; those who are meant for death will be given over to death, and those for captivity to captivity, and those for the sword to the sword."
Jeremiah,43,12,"And I shall set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he will burn them and take them captive. So he will wrap himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps himself with his garment, and he will depart from there safely."
Jeremiah,43,13,"He will also shatter the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt; and the temples of the gods of Egypt he will burn with fire.”’”"
Jeremiah,44,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews living in the land of Egypt, those who were living in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the land of Pathros, saying,"
Jeremiah,44,2,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘You yourselves have seen all the calamity that I have brought on Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they are in ruins and no one lives in them,"
Jeremiah,44,3,"because of their wickedness which they committed so as to provoke Me to anger by continuing to burn sacrifices and to serve other gods whom they had not known, neither they, you, nor your fathers."
Jeremiah,44,4,"Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets, again and again, saying, “Oh, do not do this abominable thing which I hate.”"
Jeremiah,44,5,"But they did not listen or incline their ears to turn from their wickedness, so as not to burn sacrifices to other gods."
Jeremiah,44,6,"Therefore My wrath and My anger were poured out and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, so they have become a ruin and a desolation as it is this day."
Jeremiah,44,7,"Now then thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, “Why are you doing great harm to yourselves, so as to cut off from you man and woman, child and infant, from among Judah, leaving yourselves without remnant,"
Jeremiah,44,8,"provoking Me to anger with the works of your hands, burning sacrifices to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you are entering to reside, so that you might be cut off and become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?"
Jeremiah,44,9,"Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?"
Jeremiah,44,10,"But they have not become contrite even to this day, nor have they feared nor walked in My law or My statutes, which I have set before you and before your fathers.”’"
Jeremiah,44,11,"“Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, I am going to set My face against you for woe, even to cut off all Judah."
Jeremiah,44,12,"And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have set their mind on entering the land of Egypt to reside there, and they will all meet their end in the land of Egypt; they will fall by the sword and meet their end by famine. Both small and great will die by the sword and famine; and they will become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation and a reproach."
Jeremiah,44,13,"And I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine and with pestilence."
Jeremiah,44,14,"So there will be no refugees or survivors for the remnant of Judah who have entered the land of Egypt to reside there and then to return to the land of Judah, to which they are longing to return and live; for none will return except a few refugees.’”"
Jeremiah,44,15,"Then all the men who were aware that their wives were burning sacrifices to other gods, along with all the women who were standing by, as a large assembly, including all the people who were living in Pathros in the land of Egypt, responded to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,44,16,"“As for the message that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we are not going to listen to you!"
Jeremiah,44,17,"But rather we will certainly carry out every word that has proceeded from our mouths, by burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, just as we ourselves, our forefathers, our kings and our princes did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food and were well off and saw no misfortune."
Jeremiah,44,18,"But since we stopped burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have met our end by the sword and by famine.”"
Jeremiah,44,19,"“And,” said the women, “when we were burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and were pouring out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands that we made for her sacrificial cakes in her image and poured out drink offerings to her?”"
Jeremiah,44,20,"Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and women—even to all the people who were giving him such an answer—saying,"
Jeremiah,44,21,"“As for the smoking sacrifices that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your forefathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them and did not all this come into His mind?"
Jeremiah,44,22,"So the LORD was no longer able to endure it, because of the evil of your deeds, because of the abominations which you have committed; thus your land has become a ruin, an object of horror and a curse, without an inhabitant, as it is this day."
Jeremiah,44,23,"Because you have burned sacrifices and have sinned against the LORD and not obeyed the voice of the LORD or walked in His law, His statutes or His testimonies, therefore this calamity has befallen you, as it has this day.”"
Jeremiah,44,24,"Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt,"
Jeremiah,44,25,"thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, as follows: ‘As for you and your wives, you have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled it with your hands, saying, “We will certainly perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her.” Go ahead and confirm your vows, and certainly perform your vows!’"
Jeremiah,44,26,"Nevertheless hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are living in the land of Egypt, ‘Behold, I have sworn by My great name,’ says the LORD, ‘never shall My name be invoked again by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, “As the Lord GOD lives.”"
Jeremiah,44,27,"Behold, I am watching over them for harm and not for good, and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will meet their end by the sword and by famine until they are completely gone."
Jeremiah,44,28,"Those who escape the sword will return out of the land of Egypt to the land of Judah few in number. Then all the remnant of Judah who have gone to the land of Egypt to reside there will know whose word will stand, Mine or theirs."
Jeremiah,44,29,"This will be the sign to you,’ declares the LORD, ‘that I am going to punish you in this place, so that you may know that My words will surely stand against you for harm.’"
Jeremiah,44,30,"Thus says the LORD, ‘Behold, I am going to give over Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt to the hand of his enemies, to the hand of those who seek his life, just as I gave over Zedekiah king of Judah to the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy and was seeking his life.’”"
Jeremiah,45,1,"This is the message which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written down these words in a book at Jeremiah’s dictation, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying:"
Jeremiah,45,2,"“Thus says the LORD the God of Israel to you, O Baruch:"
Jeremiah,45,3,"‘You said, “Ah, woe is me! For the LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning and have found no rest.”’"
Jeremiah,45,4,"Thus you are to say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Behold, what I have built I am about to tear down, and what I have planted I am about to uproot, that is, the whole land.”"
Jeremiah,45,5,"But you, are you seeking great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for behold, I am going to bring disaster on all flesh,’ declares the LORD, ‘but I will give your life to you as booty in all the places where you may go.’”"
Jeremiah,46,1,That which came as the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.
Jeremiah,46,2,"To Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was by the Euphrates River at Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:"

Jeremiah,46,9,"Go up, you horses, and drive madly, you chariots, That the mighty men may march forward: Ethiopia and Put, that handle the shield, And the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow."
Jeremiah,46,10,"For that day belongs to the Lord GOD of hosts, A day of vengeance, so as to avenge Himself on His foes; And the sword will devour and be satiated And drink its fill of their blood; For there will be a slaughter for the Lord GOD of hosts, In the land of the north by the river Euphrates."

Jeremiah,46,15,“Why have your mighty ones become prostrate? They do not stand because the LORD has thrust them down.

Jeremiah,51,59,"The message which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the grandson of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. (Now Seraiah was quartermaster.)"
Jeremiah,51,60,"So Jeremiah wrote in a single scroll all the calamity which would come upon Babylon, that is, all these words which have been written concerning Babylon."
Jeremiah,51,61,"Then Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “As soon as you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words aloud,"
Jeremiah,51,62,"and say, ‘You, O LORD, have promised concerning this place to cut it off, so that there will be nothing dwelling in it, whether man or beast, but it will be a perpetual desolation.’"
Jeremiah,51,63,"And as soon as you finish reading this scroll, you will tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates,"
Jeremiah,51,64,"and say, ‘Just so shall Babylon sink down and not rise again because of the calamity that I am going to bring upon her; and they will become exhausted.’” Thus far are the words of Jeremiah."
Jeremiah,52,1,"Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah."
Jeremiah,52,2,He did evil in the sight of the LORD like all that Jehoiakim had done.
Jeremiah,52,3,For through the anger of the LORD this came about in Jerusalem and Judah until He cast them out from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah,52,4,"Now it came about in the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, camped against it and built a siege wall all around it."
Jeremiah,52,5,So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
Jeremiah,52,6,On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
Jeremiah,52,7,"Then the city was broken into, and all the men of war fled and went forth from the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls which was by the king’s garden, though the Chaldeans were all around the city. And they went by way of the Arabah."
Jeremiah,52,8,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him."
Jeremiah,52,9,"Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him."
Jeremiah,52,10,"The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all the princes of Judah in Riblah."
Jeremiah,52,11,Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him with bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon and put him in prison until the day of his death.
Jeremiah,52,12,"Now on the tenth day of the fifth month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, who was in the service of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,52,13,"He burned the house of the LORD, the king’s house and all the houses of Jerusalem; even every large house he burned with fire."
Jeremiah,52,14,So all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,52,15,"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away into exile some of the poorest of the people, the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon and the rest of the artisans."
Jeremiah,52,16,But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
Jeremiah,52,17,"Now the bronze pillars which belonged to the house of the LORD and the stands and the bronze sea, which were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried all their bronze to Babylon."
Jeremiah,52,18,"They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the pans and all the bronze vessels which were used in temple service."
Jeremiah,52,19,"The captain of the guard also took away the bowls, the firepans, the basins, the pots, the lampstands, the pans and the drink offering bowls, what was fine gold and what was fine silver."
Jeremiah,52,20,"The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea, and the stands, which King Solomon had made for the house of the LORD—the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight."
Jeremiah,52,21,"As for the pillars, the height of each pillar was eighteen cubits, and it was twelve cubits in circumference and four fingers in thickness, and hollow."
Jeremiah,52,22,"Now a capital of bronze was on it; and the height of each capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital all around, all of bronze. And the second pillar was like these, including pomegranates."
Jeremiah,52,23,There were ninety-six exposed pomegranates; all the pomegranates numbered a hundred on the network all around.
Jeremiah,52,24,"Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest, with the three officers of the temple."
Jeremiah,52,25,"He also took from the city one official who was overseer of the men of war, and seven of the king’s advisers who were found in the city, and the scribe of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city."
Jeremiah,52,26,Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
Jeremiah,52,27,Then the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was led away into exile from its land.
Jeremiah,52,28,"These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away into exile: in the seventh year 3,023 Jews;"
Jeremiah,52,29,in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar 832 persons from Jerusalem;
Jeremiah,52,30,"in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile 745 Jewish people; there were 4,600 persons in all."
Jeremiah,52,31,"Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, showed favor to Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison."
Jeremiah,52,32,Then he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
Jeremiah,52,33,"So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and had his meals in the king’s presence regularly all the days of his life."
Jeremiah,52,34,"For his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king of Babylon, a daily portion all the days of his life until the day of his death."
Lamentations,1,1,How lonely sits the city That was full of people! She has become like a widow Who was once great among the nations! She who was a princess among the provinces Has become a forced laborer!
Lamentations,1,2,She weeps bitterly in the night And her tears are on her cheeks; She has none to comfort her Among all her lovers. All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; They have become her enemies.
Lamentations,1,3,"Judah has gone into exile under affliction And under harsh servitude; She dwells among the nations, But she has found no rest; All her pursuers have overtaken her In the midst of distress."
Lamentations,1,4,"The roads of Zion are in mourning Because no one comes to the appointed feasts. All her gates are desolate; Her priests are groaning, Her virgins are afflicted, And she herself is bitter."

Lamentations,1,6,All her majesty Has departed from the daughter of Zion; Her princes have become like deer That have found no pasture; And they have fled without strength Before the pursuer.
Lamentations,1,7,"In the days of her affliction and homelessness Jerusalem remembers all her precious things That were from the days of old, When her people fell into the hand of the adversary And no one helped her. The adversaries saw her, They mocked at her ruin."
Lamentations,1,8,"Jerusalem sinned greatly, Therefore she has become an unclean thing. All who honored her despise her Because they have seen her nakedness; Even she herself groans and turns away."
Lamentations,1,9,"Her uncleanness was in her skirts; She did not consider her future. Therefore she has fallen astonishingly; She has no comforter. “See, O LORD, my affliction, For the enemy has magnified himself!”"
Lamentations,1,10,"The adversary has stretched out his hand Over all her precious things, For she has seen the nations enter her sanctuary, The ones whom You commanded That they should not enter into Your congregation."

Lamentations,1,13,"“From on high He sent fire into my bones, And it prevailed over them. He has spread a net for my feet; He has turned me back; He has made me desolate, Faint all day long."
Lamentations,1,14,“The yoke of my transgressions is bound; By His hand they are knit together. They have come upon my neck; He has made my strength fail. The Lord has given me into the hands Of those against whom I am not able to stand.
Lamentations,1,15,“The Lord has rejected all my strong men In my midst; He has called an appointed time against me To crush my young men; The Lord has trodden as in a wine press The virgin daughter of Judah.
Lamentations,1,16,"“For these things I weep; My eyes run down with water; Because far from me is a comforter, One who restores my soul. My children are desolate Because the enemy has prevailed.”"
Lamentations,1,17,Zion stretches out her hands; There is no one to comfort her; The LORD has commanded concerning Jacob That the ones round about him should be his adversaries; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.
Lamentations,1,18,"“The LORD is righteous; For I have rebelled against His command; Hear now, all peoples, And behold my pain; My virgins and my young men Have gone into captivity."
Lamentations,1,19,"“I called to my lovers, but they deceived me; My priests and my elders perished in the city While they sought food to restore their strength themselves."
Lamentations,1,20,"“See, O LORD, for I am in distress; My spirit is greatly troubled; My heart is overturned within me, For I have been very rebellious. In the street the sword slays; In the house it is like death."
Lamentations,1,21,"“They have heard that I groan; There is no one to comfort me; All my enemies have heard of my calamity; They are glad that You have done it. Oh, that You would bring the day which You have proclaimed, That they may become like me."
Lamentations,1,22,“Let all their wickedness come before You; And deal with them as You have dealt with me For all my transgressions; For my groans are many and my heart is faint.”
Lamentations,2,1,"How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion With a cloud in His anger! He has cast from heaven to earth The glory of Israel, And has not remembered His footstool In the day of His anger."
Lamentations,2,2,The Lord has swallowed up; He has not spared All the habitations of Jacob. In His wrath He has thrown down The strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He has brought them down to the ground; He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.
Lamentations,2,3,In fierce anger He has cut off All the strength of Israel; He has drawn back His right hand From before the enemy. And He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire Consuming round about.
Lamentations,2,4,He has bent His bow like an enemy; He has set His right hand like an adversary And slain all that were pleasant to the eye; In the tent of the daughter of Zion He has poured out His wrath like fire.
Lamentations,2,5,"The Lord has become like an enemy. He has swallowed up Israel; He has swallowed up all its palaces, He has destroyed its strongholds And multiplied in the daughter of Judah Mourning and moaning."
Lamentations,2,6,"And He has violently treated His tabernacle like a garden booth; He has destroyed His appointed meeting place. The LORD has caused to be forgotten The appointed feast and sabbath in Zion, And He has despised king and priest In the indignation of His anger."
Lamentations,2,7,"The Lord has rejected His altar, He has abandoned His sanctuary; He has delivered into the hand of the enemy The walls of her palaces. They have made a noise in the house of the LORD As in the day of an appointed feast."
Lamentations,2,8,"The LORD determined to destroy The wall of the daughter of Zion. He has stretched out a line, He has not restrained His hand from destroying, And He has caused rampart and wall to lament; They have languished together."
Lamentations,2,9,"Her gates have sunk into the ground, He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her princes are among the nations; The law is no more. Also, her prophets find No vision from the LORD."
Lamentations,2,10,"The elders of the daughter of Zion Sit on the ground, they are silent. They have thrown dust on their heads; They have girded themselves with sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem Have bowed their heads to the ground."
Lamentations,2,11,"My eyes fail because of tears, My spirit is greatly troubled; My heart is poured out on the earth Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, When little ones and infants faint In the streets of the city."
Lamentations,2,12,"They say to their mothers, “Where is grain and wine?” As they faint like a wounded man In the streets of the city, As their life is poured out On their mothers’ bosom."
Lamentations,2,13,"How shall I admonish you? To what shall I compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem? To what shall I liken you as I comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your ruin is as vast as the sea; Who can heal you?"
Lamentations,2,14,"Your prophets have seen for you False and foolish visions; And they have not exposed your iniquity So as to restore you from captivity, But they have seen for you false and misleading oracles."
Lamentations,2,15,"All who pass along the way Clap their hands in derision at you; They hiss and shake their heads At the daughter of Jerusalem, “Is this the city of which they said, ‘The perfection of beauty, A joy to all the earth’?”"
Lamentations,2,16,"All your enemies Have opened their mouths wide against you; They hiss and gnash their teeth. They say, “We have swallowed her up! Surely this is the day for which we waited; We have reached it, we have seen it.”"
Lamentations,2,17,"The LORD has done what He purposed; He has accomplished His word Which He commanded from days of old. He has thrown down without sparing, And He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you; He has exalted the might of your adversaries."
Lamentations,2,18,"Their heart cried out to the Lord, “O wall of the daughter of Zion, Let your tears run down like a river day and night; Give yourself no relief, Let your eyes have no rest."
Lamentations,2,19,"“Arise, cry aloud in the night At the beginning of the night watches; Pour out your heart like water Before the presence of the Lord; Lift up your hands to Him For the life of your little ones Who are faint because of hunger At the head of every street.”"
Lamentations,2,20,"See, O LORD, and look! With whom have You dealt thus? Should women eat their offspring, The little ones who were born healthy? Should priest and prophet be slain In the sanctuary of the Lord?"
Lamentations,2,21,"On the ground in the streets Lie young and old; My virgins and my young men Have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of Your anger, You have slaughtered, not sparing."
Lamentations,2,22,"You called as in the day of an appointed feast My terrors on every side; And there was no one who escaped or survived In the day of the LORD’S anger. Those whom I bore and reared, My enemy annihilated them."
Lamentations,3,1,I am the man who has seen affliction Because of the rod of His wrath.
Lamentations,3,2,He has driven me and made me walk In darkness and not in light.
Lamentations,3,3,Surely against me He has turned His hand Repeatedly all the day.

Lamentations,3,6,"In dark places He has made me dwell, Like those who have long been dead."
Lamentations,3,7,He has walled me in so that I cannot go out; He has made my chain heavy.
Lamentations,3,8,"Even when I cry out and call for help, He shuts out my prayer."
Lamentations,3,9,He has blocked my ways with hewn stone; He has made my paths crooked.
Lamentations,3,10,"He is to me like a bear lying in wait, Like a lion in secret places."
Lamentations,3,11,He has turned aside my ways and torn me to pieces; He has made me desolate.
Lamentations,3,12,He bent His bow And set me as a target for the arrow.
Lamentations,3,13,He made the arrows of His quiver To enter into my inward parts.
Lamentations,3,14,"I have become a laughingstock to all my people, Their mocking song all the day."
Lamentations,3,15,"He has filled me with bitterness, He has made me drunk with wormwood."
Lamentations,3,16,He has broken my teeth with gravel; He has made me cower in the dust.
Lamentations,3,17,My soul has been rejected from peace; I have forgotten happiness.
Lamentations,3,18,"So I say, “My strength has perished, And so has my hope from the LORD.”"
Lamentations,3,19,"Remember my affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and bitterness."
Lamentations,3,20,Surely my soul remembers And is bowed down within me.
Lamentations,3,21,"This I recall to my mind, Therefore I have hope."
Lamentations,3,22,"The LORD’S lovingkindnesses indeed never cease, For His compassions never fail."

Lamentations,3,29,"Let him put his mouth in the dust, Perhaps there is hope."
Lamentations,3,30,"Let him give his cheek to the smiter, Let him be filled with reproach."
Lamentations,3,31,"For the Lord will not reject forever,"
Lamentations,3,32,"For if He causes grief, Then He will have compassion According to His abundant lovingkindness."
Lamentations,3,33,For He does not afflict willingly Or grieve the sons of men.
Lamentations,3,34,"To crush under His feet All the prisoners of the land,"
Lamentations,3,35,"To deprive a man of justice In the presence of the Most High,"
Lamentations,3,36,To defraud a man in his lawsuit— Of these things the Lord does not approve.

Lamentations,3,39,"Why should any living mortal, or any man, Offer complaint in view of his sins?"
Lamentations,3,40,"Let us examine and probe our ways, And let us return to the LORD."
Lamentations,3,41,We lift up our heart and hands Toward God in heaven;
Lamentations,3,42,"We have transgressed and rebelled, You have not pardoned."
Lamentations,3,43,You have covered Yourself with anger And pursued us; You have slain and have not spared.
Lamentations,3,44,You have covered Yourself with a cloud So that no prayer can pass through.
Lamentations,3,45,You have made us mere offscouring and refuse In the midst of the peoples.
Lamentations,3,46,All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
Lamentations,3,47,"Panic and pitfall have befallen us, Devastation and destruction;"

Lamentations,3,51,My eyes bring pain to my soul Because of all the daughters of my city.
Lamentations,3,52,My enemies without cause Hunted me down like a bird;
Lamentations,3,53,They have silenced me in the pit And have placed a stone on me.
Lamentations,3,54,"Waters flowed over my head; I said, “I am cut off!”"
Lamentations,3,55,"I called on Your name, O LORD, Out of the lowest pit."

Lamentations,3,66,You will pursue them in anger and destroy them From under the heavens of the LORD!

Lamentations,4,14,"They wandered, blind, in the streets; They were defiled with blood So that no one could touch their garments."
Lamentations,4,15,"“Depart! Unclean!” they cried of themselves. “Depart, depart, do not touch!” So they fled and wandered; Men among the nations said, “They shall not continue to dwell with us.”"
Lamentations,4,16,"The presence of the LORD has scattered them, He will not continue to regard them; They did not honor the priests, They did not favor the elders."
Lamentations,4,17,"Yet our eyes failed, Looking for help was useless; In our watching we have watched For a nation that could not save."
Lamentations,4,18,"They hunted our steps So that we could not walk in our streets; Our end drew near, Our days were finished For our end had come."

Ezekiel,1,1,"Now it came about in the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was by the river Chebar among the exiles, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God."
Ezekiel,1,2,"(On the fifth of the month in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s exile,"
Ezekiel,1,3,"the word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and there the hand of the LORD came upon him.)"
Ezekiel,1,4,"As I looked, behold, a storm wind was coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing forth continually and a bright light around it, and in its midst something like glowing metal in the midst of the fire."
Ezekiel,1,5,Within it there were figures resembling four living beings. And this was their appearance: they had human form.
Ezekiel,1,6,Each of them had four faces and four wings.
Ezekiel,1,7,"Their legs were straight and their feet were like a calf’s hoof, and they gleamed like burnished bronze."
Ezekiel,1,8,"Under their wings on their four sides were human hands. As for the faces and wings of the four of them,"
Ezekiel,1,9,"their wings touched one another; their faces did not turn when they moved, each went straight forward."
Ezekiel,1,10,"As for the form of their faces, each had the face of a man; all four had the face of a lion on the right and the face of a bull on the left, and all four had the face of an eagle."
Ezekiel,1,11,"Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each had two touching another being, and two covering their bodies."
Ezekiel,1,12,"And each went straight forward; wherever the spirit was about to go, they would go, without turning as they went."
Ezekiel,1,13,"In the midst of the living beings there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches darting back and forth among the living beings. The fire was bright, and lightning was flashing from the fire."
Ezekiel,1,14,And the living beings ran to and fro like bolts of lightning.
Ezekiel,1,15,"Now as I looked at the living beings, behold, there was one wheel on the earth beside the living beings, for each of the four of them."
Ezekiel,1,16,"The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship was like sparkling beryl, and all four of them had the same form, their appearance and workmanship being as if one wheel were within another."
Ezekiel,1,17,"Whenever they moved, they moved in any of their four directions without turning as they moved."
Ezekiel,1,18,"As for their rims they were lofty and awesome, and the rims of all four of them were full of eyes round about."
Ezekiel,1,19,"Whenever the living beings moved, the wheels moved with them. And whenever the living beings rose from the earth, the wheels rose also."
Ezekiel,1,20,"Wherever the spirit was about to go, they would go in that direction. And the wheels rose close beside them; for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,21,"Whenever those went, these went; and whenever those stood still, these stood still. And whenever those rose from the earth, the wheels rose close beside them; for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,22,"Now over the heads of the living beings there was something like an expanse, like the awesome gleam of crystal, spread out over their heads."
Ezekiel,1,23,"Under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight, one toward the other; each one also had two wings covering its body on the one side and on the other."
Ezekiel,1,24,"I also heard the sound of their wings like the sound of abundant waters as they went, like the voice of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army camp; whenever they stood still, they dropped their wings."
Ezekiel,1,25,"And there came a voice from above the expanse that was over their heads; whenever they stood still, they dropped their wings."
Ezekiel,1,26,"Now above the expanse that was over their heads there was something resembling a throne, like lapis lazuli in appearance; and on that which resembled a throne, high up, was a figure with the appearance of a man."
Ezekiel,1,27,"Then I noticed from the appearance of His loins and upward something like glowing metal that looked like fire all around within it, and from the appearance of His loins and downward I saw something like fire; and there was a radiance around Him."
Ezekiel,1,28,"As the appearance of the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the surrounding radiance. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face and heard a voice speaking."
Ezekiel,2,1,"Then He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet that I may speak with you!”"
Ezekiel,2,2,As He spoke to me the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet; and I heard Him speaking to me.
Ezekiel,2,3,"Then He said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to a rebellious people who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day."
Ezekiel,2,4,"I am sending you to them who are stubborn and obstinate children, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD.’"
Ezekiel,2,5,"As for them, whether they listen or not—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a prophet has been among them."
Ezekiel,2,6,"And you, son of man, neither fear them nor fear their words, though thistles and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions; neither fear their words nor be dismayed at their presence, for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,2,7,"But you shall speak My words to them whether they listen or not, for they are rebellious."
Ezekiel,2,8,"“Now you, son of man, listen to what I am speaking to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.”"
Ezekiel,2,9,"Then I looked, and behold, a hand was extended to me; and lo, a scroll was in it."
Ezekiel,2,10,"When He spread it out before me, it was written on the front and back, and written on it were lamentations, mourning and woe."
Ezekiel,3,1,"Then He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.”"
Ezekiel,3,2,"So I opened my mouth, and He fed me this scroll."
Ezekiel,3,3,"He said to me, “Son of man, feed your stomach and fill your body with this scroll which I am giving you.” Then I ate it, and it was sweet as honey in my mouth."
Ezekiel,3,4,"Then He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with My words to them."
Ezekiel,3,5,"For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech or difficult language, but to the house of Israel,"
Ezekiel,3,6,"nor to many peoples of unintelligible speech or difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. But I have sent you to them who should listen to you;"
Ezekiel,3,7,"yet the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, since they are not willing to listen to Me. Surely the whole house of Israel is stubborn and obstinate."
Ezekiel,3,8,"Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces and your forehead as hard as their foreheads."
Ezekiel,3,9,"Like emery harder than flint I have made your forehead. Do not be afraid of them or be dismayed before them, though they are a rebellious house.”"
Ezekiel,3,10,"Moreover, He said to me, “Son of man, take into your heart all My words which I will speak to you and listen closely."
Ezekiel,3,11,"Go to the exiles, to the sons of your people, and speak to them and tell them, whether they listen or not, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,3,12,"Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me, “Blessed be the glory of the LORD in His place.”"
Ezekiel,3,13,"And I heard the sound of the wings of the living beings touching one another and the sound of the wheels beside them, even a great rumbling sound."
Ezekiel,3,14,"So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away; and I went embittered in the rage of my spirit, and the hand of the LORD was strong on me."
Ezekiel,3,15,"Then I came to the exiles who lived beside the river Chebar at Tel-abib, and I sat there seven days where they were living, causing consternation among them."
Ezekiel,3,16,"At the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,3,17,"“Son of man, I have appointed you a watchman to the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from My mouth, warn them from Me."
Ezekiel,3,18,"When I say to the wicked, ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn him or speak out to warn the wicked from his wicked way that he may live, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand."
Ezekiel,3,19,"Yet if you have warned the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered yourself."
Ezekiel,3,20,"Again, when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I place an obstacle before him, he will die; since you have not warned him, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand."
Ezekiel,3,21,"However, if you have warned the righteous man that the righteous should not sin and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he took warning; and you have delivered yourself.”"
Ezekiel,3,22,"The hand of the LORD was on me there, and He said to me, “Get up, go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you.”"
Ezekiel,3,23,"So I got up and went out to the plain; and behold, the glory of the LORD was standing there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar, and I fell on my face."
Ezekiel,3,24,"The Spirit then entered me and made me stand on my feet, and He spoke with me and said to me, “Go, shut yourself up in your house."
Ezekiel,3,25,"As for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and bind you with them so that you cannot go out among them."
Ezekiel,3,26,"Moreover, I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be mute and cannot be a man who rebukes them, for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,3,27,"But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you will say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD.’ He who hears, let him hear; and he who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,4,1,"“Now you son of man, get yourself a brick, place it before you and inscribe a city on it, Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,4,2,"Then lay siege against it, build a siege wall, raise up a ramp, pitch camps and place battering rams against it all around."
Ezekiel,4,3,"Then get yourself an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between you and the city, and set your face toward it so that it is under siege, and besiege it. This is a sign to the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,4,4,"“As for you, lie down on your left side and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; you shall bear their iniquity for the number of days that you lie on it."
Ezekiel,4,5,"For I have assigned you a number of days corresponding to the years of their iniquity, three hundred and ninety days; thus you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,4,6,"When you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah; I have assigned it to you for forty days, a day for each year."
Ezekiel,4,7,Then you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared and prophesy against it.
Ezekiel,4,8,"Now behold, I will put ropes on you so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of your siege."
Ezekiel,4,9,"“But as for you, take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet and spelt, put them in one vessel and make them into bread for yourself; you shall eat it according to the number of the days that you lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days."
Ezekiel,4,10,Your food which you eat shall be twenty shekels a day by weight; you shall eat it from time to time.
Ezekiel,4,11,The water you drink shall be the sixth part of a hin by measure; you shall drink it from time to time.
Ezekiel,4,12,"You shall eat it as a barley cake, having baked it in their sight over human dung.”"
Ezekiel,4,13,"Then the LORD said, “Thus will the sons of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations where I will banish them.”"
Ezekiel,4,14,"But I said, “Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I have never been defiled; for from my youth until now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has any unclean meat ever entered my mouth.”"
Ezekiel,4,15,"Then He said to me, “See, I will give you cow’s dung in place of human dung over which you will prepare your bread.”"
Ezekiel,4,16,"Moreover, He said to me, “Son of man, behold, I am going to break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they will eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and drink water by measure and in horror,"
Ezekiel,4,17,because bread and water will be scarce; and they will be appalled with one another and waste away in their iniquity.
Ezekiel,5,1,"“As for you, son of man, take a sharp sword; take and use it as a barber’s razor on your head and beard. Then take scales for weighing and divide the hair."
Ezekiel,5,2,"One third you shall burn in the fire at the center of the city, when the days of the siege are completed. Then you shall take one third and strike it with the sword all around the city, and one third you shall scatter to the wind; and I will unsheathe a sword behind them."
Ezekiel,5,3,Take also a few in number from them and bind them in the edges of your robes.
Ezekiel,5,4,Take again some of them and throw them into the fire and burn them in the fire; from it a fire will spread to all the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,5,5,"“Thus says the Lord GOD, ‘This is Jerusalem; I have set her at the center of the nations, with lands around her."
Ezekiel,5,6,But she has rebelled against My ordinances more wickedly than the nations and against My statutes more than the lands which surround her; for they have rejected My ordinances and have not walked in My statutes.’
Ezekiel,5,7,"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Because you have more turmoil than the nations which surround you and have not walked in My statutes, nor observed My ordinances, nor observed the ordinances of the nations which surround you,’"
Ezekiel,5,8,"therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Behold, I, even I, am against you, and I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations."
Ezekiel,5,9,"And because of all your abominations, I will do among you what I have not done, and the like of which I will never do again."
Ezekiel,5,10,"Therefore, fathers will eat their sons among you, and sons will eat their fathers; for I will execute judgments on you and scatter all your remnant to every wind."
Ezekiel,5,11,"So as I live,’ declares the Lord GOD, ‘surely, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable idols and with all your abominations, therefore I will also withdraw, and My eye will have no pity and I will not spare."
Ezekiel,5,12,"One third of you will die by plague or be consumed by famine among you, one third will fall by the sword around you, and one third I will scatter to every wind, and I will unsheathe a sword behind them."
Ezekiel,5,13,"‘Thus My anger will be spent and I will satisfy My wrath on them, and I will be appeased; then they will know that I, the LORD, have spoken in My zeal when I have spent My wrath upon them."
Ezekiel,5,14,"Moreover, I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations which surround you, in the sight of all who pass by."
Ezekiel,5,15,"So it will be a reproach, a reviling, a warning and an object of horror to the nations who surround you when I execute judgments against you in anger, wrath and raging rebukes. I, the LORD, have spoken."
Ezekiel,5,16,"When I send against them the deadly arrows of famine which were for the destruction of those whom I will send to destroy you, then I will also intensify the famine upon you and break the staff of bread."
Ezekiel,5,17,"Moreover, I will send on you famine and wild beasts, and they will bereave you of children; plague and bloodshed also will pass through you, and I will bring the sword on you. I, the LORD, have spoken.’”"
Ezekiel,6,1,"And the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,6,2,"“Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them"
Ezekiel,6,3,"and say, ‘Mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains, the hills, the ravines and the valleys: “Behold, I Myself am going to bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places."
Ezekiel,6,4,So your altars will become desolate and your incense altars will be smashed; and I will make your slain fall in front of your idols.
Ezekiel,6,5,I will also lay the dead bodies of the sons of Israel in front of their idols; and I will scatter your bones around your altars.
Ezekiel,6,6,"In all your dwellings, cities will become waste and the high places will be desolate, that your altars may become waste and desolate, your idols may be broken and brought to an end, your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be blotted out."
Ezekiel,6,7,"The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,6,8,"“However, I will leave a remnant, for you will have those who escaped the sword among the nations when you are scattered among the countries."
Ezekiel,6,9,"Then those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations to which they will be carried captive, how I have been hurt by their adulterous hearts which turned away from Me, and by their eyes which played the harlot after their idols; and they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed, for all their abominations."
Ezekiel,6,10,Then they will know that I am the LORD; I have not said in vain that I would inflict this disaster on them.”’
Ezekiel,6,11,"“Thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Clap your hand, stamp your foot and say, “Alas, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, which will fall by sword, famine and plague!"
Ezekiel,6,12,"He who is far off will die by the plague, and he who is near will fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged will die by the famine. Thus will I spend My wrath on them."
Ezekiel,6,13,"Then you will know that I am the LORD, when their slain are among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, under every green tree and under every leafy oak—the places where they offered soothing aroma to all their idols."
Ezekiel,6,14,So throughout all their habitations I will stretch out My hand against them and make the land more desolate and waste than the wilderness toward Diblah; thus they will know that I am the LORD.”’”
Ezekiel,7,1,"Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,7,2,"“And you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel, ‘An end! The end is coming on the four corners of the land."
Ezekiel,7,3,"Now the end is upon you, and I will send My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways and bring all your abominations upon you."
Ezekiel,7,4,"For My eye will have no pity on you, nor will I spare you, but I will bring your ways upon you, and your abominations will be among you; then you will know that I am the LORD!’"
Ezekiel,7,5,"“Thus says the Lord GOD, ‘A disaster, unique disaster, behold it is coming!"
Ezekiel,7,6,"An end is coming; the end has come! It has awakened against you; behold, it has come!"
Ezekiel,7,7,"Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come, the day is near—tumult rather than joyful shouting on the mountains."
Ezekiel,7,8,Now I will shortly pour out My wrath on you and spend My anger against you; judge you according to your ways and bring on you all your abominations.
Ezekiel,7,9,"My eye will show no pity nor will I spare. I will repay you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst; then you will know that I, the LORD, do the smiting."
Ezekiel,7,10,"‘Behold, the day! Behold, it is coming! Your doom has gone forth; the rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed."
Ezekiel,7,11,"Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, none of their people, none of their wealth, nor anything eminent among them."
Ezekiel,7,12,"The time has come, the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn; for wrath is against all their multitude."
Ezekiel,7,13,"Indeed, the seller will not regain what he sold as long as they both live; for the vision regarding all their multitude will not be averted, nor will any of them maintain his life by his iniquity."
Ezekiel,7,14,"‘They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but no one is going to the battle, for My wrath is against all their multitude."
Ezekiel,7,15,The sword is outside and the plague and the famine are within. He who is in the field will die by the sword; famine and the plague will also consume those in the city.
Ezekiel,7,16,"Even when their survivors escape, they will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, each over his own iniquity."
Ezekiel,7,17,All hands will hang limp and all knees will become like water.
Ezekiel,7,18,They will gird themselves with sackcloth and shuddering will overwhelm them; and shame will be on all faces and baldness on all their heads.
Ezekiel,7,19,"They will fling their silver into the streets and their gold will become an abhorrent thing; their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their appetite nor can they fill their stomachs, for their iniquity has become an occasion of stumbling."
Ezekiel,7,20,"They transformed the beauty of His ornaments into pride, and they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things with it; therefore I will make it an abhorrent thing to them."
Ezekiel,7,21,"I will give it into the hands of the foreigners as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they will profane it."
Ezekiel,7,22,"I will also turn My face from them, and they will profane My secret place; then robbers will enter and profane it."
Ezekiel,7,23,"‘Make the chain, for the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence."
Ezekiel,7,24,"Therefore, I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses. I will also make the pride of the strong ones cease, and their holy places will be profaned."
Ezekiel,7,25,"When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there will be none."
Ezekiel,7,26,"Disaster will come upon disaster and rumor will be added to rumor; then they will seek a vision from a prophet, but the law will be lost from the priest and counsel from the elders."
Ezekiel,7,27,"The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with horror, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. According to their conduct I will deal with them, and by their judgments I will judge them. And they will know that I am the LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,8,1,"It came about in the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month, as I was sitting in my house with the elders of Judah sitting before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell on me there."
Ezekiel,8,2,"Then I looked, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of a man; from His loins and downward there was the appearance of fire, and from His loins and upward the appearance of brightness, like the appearance of glowing metal."
Ezekiel,8,3,"He stretched out the form of a hand and caught me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where the seat of the idol of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy, was located."
Ezekiel,8,4,"And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the appearance which I saw in the plain."
Ezekiel,8,5,"Then He said to me, “Son of man, raise your eyes now toward the north.” So I raised my eyes toward the north, and behold, to the north of the altar gate was this idol of jealousy at the entrance."
Ezekiel,8,6,"And He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations which the house of Israel are committing here, so that I would be far from My sanctuary? But yet you will see still greater abominations.”"
Ezekiel,8,7,"Then He brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall."
Ezekiel,8,8,"He said to me, “Son of man, now dig through the wall.” So I dug through the wall, and behold, an entrance."
Ezekiel,8,9,"And He said to me, “Go in and see the wicked abominations that they are committing here.”"
Ezekiel,8,10,"So I entered and looked, and behold, every form of creeping things and beasts and detestable things, with all the idols of the house of Israel, were carved on the wall all around."
Ezekiel,8,11,"Standing in front of them were seventy elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them, each man with his censer in his hand and the fragrance of the cloud of incense rising."
Ezekiel,8,12,"Then He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are committing in the dark, each man in the room of his carved images? For they say, ‘The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the land.’”"
Ezekiel,8,13,"And He said to me, “Yet you will see still greater abominations which they are committing.”"
Ezekiel,8,14,"Then He brought me to the entrance of the gate of the LORD’S house which was toward the north; and behold, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz."
Ezekiel,8,15,"He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? Yet you will see still greater abominations than these.”"
Ezekiel,8,16,"Then He brought me into the inner court of the LORD’S house. And behold, at the entrance to the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east; and they were prostrating themselves eastward toward the sun."
Ezekiel,8,17,"He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they have committed here, that they have filled the land with violence and provoked Me repeatedly? For behold, they are putting the twig to their nose."
Ezekiel,8,18,"Therefore, I indeed will deal in wrath. My eye will have no pity nor will I spare; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, yet I will not listen to them.”"
Ezekiel,9,1,"Then He cried out in my hearing with a loud voice saying, “Draw near, O executioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand.”"
Ezekiel,9,2,"Behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate which faces north, each with his shattering weapon in his hand; and among them was a certain man clothed in linen with a writing case at his loins. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar."
Ezekiel,9,3,"Then the glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub on which it had been, to the threshold of the temple. And He called to the man clothed in linen at whose loins was the writing case."
Ezekiel,9,4,"The LORD said to him, “Go through the midst of the city, even through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations which are being committed in its midst.”"
Ezekiel,9,5,"But to the others He said in my hearing, “Go through the city after him and strike; do not let your eye have pity and do not spare."
Ezekiel,9,6,"Utterly slay old men, young men, maidens, little children, and women, but do not touch any man on whom is the mark; and you shall start from My sanctuary.” So they started with the elders who were before the temple."
Ezekiel,9,7,"And He said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!” Thus they went out and struck down the people in the city."
Ezekiel,9,8,"As they were striking the people and I alone was left, I fell on my face and cried out saying, “Alas, Lord GOD! Are You destroying the whole remnant of Israel by pouring out Your wrath on Jerusalem?”"
Ezekiel,9,9,"Then He said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is very, very great, and the land is filled with blood and the city is full of perversion; for they say, ‘The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD does not see!’"
Ezekiel,9,10,"But as for Me, My eye will have no pity nor will I spare, but I will bring their conduct upon their heads.”"
Ezekiel,9,11,"Then behold, the man clothed in linen at whose loins was the writing case reported, saying, “I have done just as You have commanded me.”"
Ezekiel,10,1,"Then I looked, and behold, in the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim something like a sapphire stone, in appearance resembling a throne, appeared above them."
Ezekiel,10,2,"And He spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, “Enter between the whirling wheels under the cherubim and fill your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim and scatter them over the city.” And he entered in my sight."
Ezekiel,10,3,"Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the temple when the man entered, and the cloud filled the inner court."
Ezekiel,10,4,"Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub to the threshold of the temple, and the temple was filled with the cloud and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD."
Ezekiel,10,5,"Moreover, the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks."
Ezekiel,10,6,"It came about when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” he entered and stood beside a wheel."
Ezekiel,10,7,"Then the cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire which was between the cherubim, took some and put it into the hands of the one clothed in linen, who took it and went out."
Ezekiel,10,8,The cherubim appeared to have the form of a man’s hand under their wings.
Ezekiel,10,9,"Then I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like the gleam of a Tarshish stone."
Ezekiel,10,10,"As for their appearance, all four of them had the same likeness, as if one wheel were within another wheel."
Ezekiel,10,11,"When they moved, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went; but they followed in the direction which they faced, without turning as they went."
Ezekiel,10,12,"Their whole body, their backs, their hands, their wings and the wheels were full of eyes all around, the wheels belonging to all four of them."
Ezekiel,10,13,"The wheels were called in my hearing, the whirling wheels."
Ezekiel,10,14,"And each one had four faces. The first face was the face of a cherub, the second face was the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle."
Ezekiel,10,15,Then the cherubim rose up. They are the living beings that I saw by the river Chebar.
Ezekiel,10,16,"Now when the cherubim moved, the wheels would go beside them; also when the cherubim lifted up their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels would not turn from beside them."
Ezekiel,10,17,"When the cherubim stood still, the wheels would stand still; and when they rose up, the wheels would rise with them, for the spirit of the living beings was in them."
Ezekiel,10,18,Then the glory of the LORD departed from the threshold of the temple and stood over the cherubim.
Ezekiel,10,19,"When the cherubim departed, they lifted their wings and rose up from the earth in my sight with the wheels beside them; and they stood still at the entrance of the east gate of the LORD’S house, and the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them."
Ezekiel,10,20,These are the living beings that I saw beneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar; so I knew that they were cherubim.
Ezekiel,10,21,"Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and beneath their wings was the form of human hands."
Ezekiel,10,22,"As for the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the river Chebar. Each one went straight ahead."
Ezekiel,11,1,"Moreover, the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the LORD’S house which faced eastward. And behold, there were twenty-five men at the entrance of the gate, and among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people."
Ezekiel,11,2,"He said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and give evil advice in this city,"
Ezekiel,11,3,"who say, ‘The time is not near to build houses. This city is the pot and we are the flesh.’"
Ezekiel,11,4,"Therefore, prophesy against them, son of man, prophesy!”"
Ezekiel,11,5,"Then the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and He said to me, “Say, ‘Thus says the LORD, “So you think, house of Israel, for I know your thoughts."
Ezekiel,11,6,"You have multiplied your slain in this city, filling its streets with them.”"
Ezekiel,11,7,"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, “Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of the city are the flesh and this city is the pot; but I will bring you out of it."
Ezekiel,11,8,"You have feared a sword; so I will bring a sword upon you,” the Lord GOD declares."
Ezekiel,11,9,“And I will bring you out of the midst of the city and deliver you into the hands of strangers and execute judgments against you.
Ezekiel,11,10,You will fall by the sword. I will judge you to the border of Israel; so you shall know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,11,11,"This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be flesh in the midst of it, but I will judge you to the border of Israel."
Ezekiel,11,12,"Thus you will know that I am the LORD; for you have not walked in My statutes nor have you executed My ordinances, but have acted according to the ordinances of the nations around you.”’”"
Ezekiel,11,13,"Now it came about as I prophesied, that Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, “Alas, Lord GOD! Will You bring the remnant of Israel to a complete end?”"
Ezekiel,11,14,"Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,11,15,"“Son of man, your brothers, your relatives, your fellow exiles and the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Go far from the LORD; this land has been given us as a possession.’"
Ezekiel,11,16,"Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Though I had removed them far away among the nations and though I had scattered them among the countries, yet I was a sanctuary for them a little while in the countries where they had gone.”’"
Ezekiel,11,17,"Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries among which you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.”’"
Ezekiel,11,18,"When they come there, they will remove all its detestable things and all its abominations from it."
Ezekiel,11,19,"And I will give them one heart, and put a new spirit within them. And I will take the heart of stone out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,"
Ezekiel,11,20,"that they may walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances and do them. Then they will be My people, and I shall be their God."
Ezekiel,11,21,"But as for those whose hearts go after their detestable things and abominations, I will bring their conduct down on their heads,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,11,22,"Then the cherubim lifted up their wings with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them."
Ezekiel,11,23,The glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood over the mountain which is east of the city.
Ezekiel,11,24,And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God to the exiles in Chaldea. So the vision that I had seen left me.
Ezekiel,11,25,Then I told the exiles all the things that the LORD had shown me.
Ezekiel,12,1,"Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,2,"“Son of man, you live in the midst of the rebellious house, who have eyes to see but do not see, ears to hear but do not hear; for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,12,3,"Therefore, son of man, prepare for yourself baggage for exile and go into exile by day in their sight; even go into exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand though they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,12,4,"Bring your baggage out by day in their sight, as baggage for exile. Then you will go out at evening in their sight, as those going into exile."
Ezekiel,12,5,Dig a hole through the wall in their sight and go out through it.
Ezekiel,12,6,"Load the baggage on your shoulder in their sight and carry it out in the dark. You shall cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have set you as a sign to the house of Israel.”"
Ezekiel,12,7,"I did so, as I had been commanded. By day I brought out my baggage like the baggage of an exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands; I went out in the dark and carried the baggage on my shoulder in their sight."
Ezekiel,12,8,"In the morning the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,9,"“Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’"
Ezekiel,12,10,"Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem as well as all the house of Israel who are in it.”’"
Ezekiel,12,11,"Say, ‘I am a sign to you. As I have done, so it will be done to them; they will go into exile, into captivity.’"
Ezekiel,12,12,The prince who is among them will load his baggage on his shoulder in the dark and go out. They will dig a hole through the wall to bring it out. He will cover his face so that he can not see the land with his eyes.
Ezekiel,12,13,"I will also spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. And I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he will die there."
Ezekiel,12,14,"I will scatter to every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops; and I will draw out a sword after them."
Ezekiel,12,15,So they will know that I am the LORD when I scatter them among the nations and spread them among the countries.
Ezekiel,12,16,"But I will spare a few of them from the sword, the famine and the pestilence that they may tell all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the LORD.”"
Ezekiel,12,17,"Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,12,18,"“Son of man, eat your bread with trembling and drink your water with quivering and anxiety."
Ezekiel,12,19,"Then say to the people of the land, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel, “They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with horror, because their land will be stripped of its fullness on account of the violence of all who live in it."
Ezekiel,12,20,The inhabited cities will be laid waste and the land will be a desolation. So you will know that I am the LORD.”’”
Ezekiel,12,21,"Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,22,"“Son of man, what is this proverb you people have concerning the land of Israel, saying, ‘The days are long and every vision fails’?"
Ezekiel,12,23,"Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “I will make this proverb cease so that they will no longer use it as a proverb in Israel.” But tell them, “The days draw near as well as the fulfillment of every vision."
Ezekiel,12,24,For there will no longer be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,12,25,"For I the LORD will speak, and whatever word I speak will be performed. It will no longer be delayed, for in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word and perform it,” declares the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,12,26,"Furthermore, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,27,"“Son of man, behold, the house of Israel is saying, ‘The vision that he sees is for many years from now, and he prophesies of times far off.’"
Ezekiel,12,28,"Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “None of My words will be delayed any longer. Whatever word I speak will be performed,”’” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,13,1,"Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,13,2,"“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy from their own inspiration, ‘Listen to the word of the LORD!"
Ezekiel,13,3,"Thus says the Lord GOD, “Woe to the foolish prophets who are following their own spirit and have seen nothing."
Ezekiel,13,4,"O Israel, your prophets have been like foxes among ruins."
Ezekiel,13,5,"You have not gone up into the breaches, nor did you build the wall around the house of Israel to stand in the battle on the day of the LORD."
Ezekiel,13,6,"They see falsehood and lying divination who are saying, ‘The LORD declares,’ when the LORD has not sent them; yet they hope for the fulfillment of their word."
Ezekiel,13,7,"Did you not see a false vision and speak a lying divination when you said, ‘The LORD declares,’ but it is not I who have spoken?”’”"
Ezekiel,13,8,"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, “Because you have spoken falsehood and seen a lie, therefore behold, I am against you,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,13,9,"“So My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will have no place in the council of My people, nor will they be written down in the register of the house of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel, that you may know that I am the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,13,10,"It is definitely because they have misled My people by saying, ‘Peace!’ when there is no peace. And when anyone builds a wall, behold, they plaster it over with whitewash;"
Ezekiel,13,11,"so tell those who plaster it over with whitewash, that it will fall. A flooding rain will come, and you, O hailstones, will fall; and a violent wind will break out."
Ezekiel,13,12,"Behold, when the wall has fallen, will you not be asked, ‘Where is the plaster with which you plastered it?’”"
Ezekiel,13,13,"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, “I will make a violent wind break out in My wrath. There will also be in My anger a flooding rain and hailstones to consume it in wrath."
Ezekiel,13,14,"So I will tear down the wall which you plastered over with whitewash and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation is laid bare; and when it falls, you will be consumed in its midst. And you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,13,15,"Thus I will spend My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it over with whitewash; and I will say to you, ‘The wall is gone and its plasterers are gone,"
Ezekiel,13,16,"along with the prophets of Israel who prophesy to Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace,’ declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,13,17,"“Now you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who are prophesying from their own inspiration. Prophesy against them"
Ezekiel,13,18,"and say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Woe to the women who sew magic bands on all wrists and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature to hunt down lives! Will you hunt down the lives of My people, but preserve the lives of others for yourselves?"
Ezekiel,13,19,"For handfuls of barley and fragments of bread, you have profaned Me to My people to put to death some who should not die and to keep others alive who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies.”’”"
Ezekiel,13,20,"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, “Behold, I am against your magic bands by which you hunt lives there as birds and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let them go, even those lives whom you hunt as birds."
Ezekiel,13,21,"I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people from your hands, and they will no longer be in your hands to be hunted; and you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,13,22,"Because you disheartened the righteous with falsehood when I did not cause him grief, but have encouraged the wicked not to turn from his wicked way and preserve his life,"
Ezekiel,13,23,"therefore, you women will no longer see false visions or practice divination, and I will deliver My people out of your hand. Thus you will know that I am the LORD.”"
Ezekiel,14,1,Then some elders of Israel came to me and sat down before me.
Ezekiel,14,2,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,14,3,"“Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts and have put right before their faces the stumbling block of their iniquity. Should I be consulted by them at all?"
Ezekiel,14,4,"Therefore speak to them and tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Any man of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, puts right before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity, and then comes to the prophet, I the LORD will be brought to give him an answer in the matter in view of the multitude of his idols,"
Ezekiel,14,5,in order to lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel who are estranged from Me through all their idols.”’
Ezekiel,14,6,"“Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Repent and turn away from your idols and turn your faces away from all your abominations."
Ezekiel,14,7,"For anyone of the house of Israel or of the immigrants who stay in Israel who separates himself from Me, sets up his idols in his heart, puts right before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity, and then comes to the prophet to inquire of Me for himself, I the LORD will be brought to answer him in My own person."
Ezekiel,14,8,"I will set My face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from among My people. So you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,14,9,"“But if the prophet is prevailed upon to speak a word, it is I, the LORD, who have prevailed upon that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from among My people Israel."
Ezekiel,14,10,"They will bear the punishment of their iniquity; as the iniquity of the inquirer is, so the iniquity of the prophet will be,"
Ezekiel,14,11,"in order that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me and no longer defile themselves with all their transgressions. Thus they will be My people, and I shall be their God,”’ declares the Lord GOD.”"
Ezekiel,14,12,"Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,14,13,"“Son of man, if a country sins against Me by committing unfaithfulness, and I stretch out My hand against it, destroy its supply of bread, send famine against it and cut off from it both man and beast,"
Ezekiel,14,14,"even though these three men, Noah, Daniel and Job were in its midst, by their own righteousness they could only deliver themselves,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,14,15,"“If I were to cause wild beasts to pass through the land and they depopulated it, and it became desolate so that no one would pass through it because of the beasts,"
Ezekiel,14,16,"though these three men were in its midst, as I live,” declares the Lord GOD, “they could not deliver either their sons or their daughters. They alone would be delivered, but the country would be desolate."
Ezekiel,14,17,"Or if I should bring a sword on that country and say, ‘Let the sword pass through the country and cut off man and beast from it,’"
Ezekiel,14,18,"even though these three men were in its midst, as I live,” declares the Lord GOD, “they could not deliver either their sons or their daughters, but they alone would be delivered."
Ezekiel,14,19,"Or if I should send a plague against that country and pour out My wrath in blood on it to cut off man and beast from it,"
Ezekiel,14,20,"even though Noah, Daniel and Job were in its midst, as I live,” declares the Lord GOD, “they could not deliver either their son or their daughter. They would deliver only themselves by their righteousness.”"
Ezekiel,14,21,"For thus says the Lord GOD, “How much more when I send My four severe judgments against Jerusalem: sword, famine, wild beasts and plague to cut off man and beast from it!"
Ezekiel,14,22,"Yet, behold, survivors will be left in it who will be brought out, both sons and daughters. Behold, they are going to come forth to you and you will see their conduct and actions; then you will be comforted for the calamity which I have brought against Jerusalem for everything which I have brought upon it."
Ezekiel,14,23,"Then they will comfort you when you see their conduct and actions, for you will know that I have not done in vain whatever I did to it,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,15,1,"Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,15,2,"“Son of man, how is the wood of the vine better than any wood of a branch which is among the trees of the forest?"
Ezekiel,15,3,"Can wood be taken from it to make anything, or can men take a peg from it on which to hang any vessel?"
Ezekiel,15,4,"If it has been put into the fire for fuel, and the fire has consumed both of its ends and its middle part has been charred, is it then useful for anything?"
Ezekiel,15,5,"Behold, while it is intact, it is not made into anything. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it still be made into anything!"
Ezekiel,15,6,"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, ‘As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem;"
Ezekiel,15,7,"and I set My face against them. Though they have come out of the fire, yet the fire will consume them. Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I set My face against them."
Ezekiel,15,8,"Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have acted unfaithfully,’” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,16,1,"Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,16,2,"“Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations"
Ezekiel,16,3,"and say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD to Jerusalem, “Your origin and your birth are from the land of the Canaanite, your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite."
Ezekiel,16,4,"As for your birth, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water for cleansing; you were not rubbed with salt or even wrapped in cloths."
Ezekiel,16,5,"No eye looked with pity on you to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you. Rather you were thrown out into the open field, for you were abhorred on the day you were born."
Ezekiel,16,6,"“When I passed by you and saw you squirming in your blood, I said to you while you were in your blood, ‘Live!’ Yes, I said to you while you were in your blood, ‘Live!’"
Ezekiel,16,7,"I made you numerous like plants of the field. Then you grew up, became tall and reached the age for fine ornaments; your breasts were formed and your hair had grown. Yet you were naked and bare."
Ezekiel,16,8,"“Then I passed by you and saw you, and behold, you were at the time for love; so I spread My skirt over you and covered your nakedness. I also swore to you and entered into a covenant with you so that you became Mine,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,16,9,"“Then I bathed you with water, washed off your blood from you and anointed you with oil."
Ezekiel,16,10,I also clothed you with embroidered cloth and put sandals of porpoise skin on your feet; and I wrapped you with fine linen and covered you with silk.
Ezekiel,16,11,"I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your hands and a necklace around your neck."
Ezekiel,16,12,"I also put a ring in your nostril, earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head."
Ezekiel,16,13,"Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your dress was of fine linen, silk and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour, honey and oil; so you were exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty."
Ezekiel,16,14,"Then your fame went forth among the nations on account of your beauty, for it was perfect because of My splendor which I bestowed on you,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,16,15,"“But you trusted in your beauty and played the harlot because of your fame, and you poured out your harlotries on every passer-by who might be willing."
Ezekiel,16,16,"You took some of your clothes, made for yourself high places of various colors and played the harlot on them, which should never come about nor happen."
Ezekiel,16,17,"You also took your beautiful jewels made of My gold and of My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images that you might play the harlot with them."
Ezekiel,16,18,"Then you took your embroidered cloth and covered them, and offered My oil and My incense before them."
Ezekiel,16,19,"Also My bread which I gave you, fine flour, oil and honey with which I fed you, you would offer before them for a soothing aroma; so it happened,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,16,20,"“Moreover, you took your sons and daughters whom you had borne to Me and sacrificed them to idols to be devoured. Were your harlotries so small a matter?"
Ezekiel,16,21,You slaughtered My children and offered them up to idols by causing them to pass through the fire.
Ezekiel,16,22,"Besides all your abominations and harlotries you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare and squirming in your blood."
Ezekiel,16,23,"“Then it came about after all your wickedness (‘Woe, woe to you!’ declares the Lord GOD),"
Ezekiel,16,24,that you built yourself a shrine and made yourself a high place in every square.
Ezekiel,16,25,"You built yourself a high place at the top of every street and made your beauty abominable, and you spread your legs to every passer-by to multiply your harlotry."
Ezekiel,16,26,"You also played the harlot with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and multiplied your harlotry to make Me angry."
Ezekiel,16,27,"Behold now, I have stretched out My hand against you and diminished your rations. And I delivered you up to the desire of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd conduct."
Ezekiel,16,28,"Moreover, you played the harlot with the Assyrians because you were not satisfied; you played the harlot with them and still were not satisfied."
Ezekiel,16,29,"You also multiplied your harlotry with the land of merchants, Chaldea, yet even with this you were not satisfied.”’”"
Ezekiel,16,30,"“How languishing is your heart,” declares the Lord GOD, “while you do all these things, the actions of a bold-faced harlot."
Ezekiel,16,31,"When you built your shrine at the beginning of every street and made your high place in every square, in disdaining money, you were not like a harlot."
Ezekiel,16,32,"You adulteress wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband!"
Ezekiel,16,33,"Men give gifts to all harlots, but you give your gifts to all your lovers to bribe them to come to you from every direction for your harlotries."
Ezekiel,16,34,"Thus you are different from those women in your harlotries, in that no one plays the harlot as you do, because you give money and no money is given you; thus you are different.”"
Ezekiel,16,35,"Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD."
Ezekiel,16,36,"Thus says the Lord GOD, “Because your lewdness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered through your harlotries with your lovers and with all your detestable idols, and because of the blood of your sons which you gave to idols,"
Ezekiel,16,37,"therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, even all those whom you loved and all those whom you hated. So I will gather them against you from every direction and expose your nakedness to them that they may see all your nakedness."
Ezekiel,16,38,Thus I will judge you like women who commit adultery or shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy.
Ezekiel,16,39,"I will also give you into the hands of your lovers, and they will tear down your shrines, demolish your high places, strip you of your clothing, take away your jewels, and will leave you naked and bare."
Ezekiel,16,40,They will incite a crowd against you and they will stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords.
Ezekiel,16,41,"They will burn your houses with fire and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women. Then I will stop you from playing the harlot, and you will also no longer pay your lovers."
Ezekiel,16,42,"So I will calm My fury against you and My jealousy will depart from you, and I will be pacified and angry no more."
Ezekiel,16,43,"Because you have not remembered the days of your youth but have enraged Me by all these things, behold, I in turn will bring your conduct down on your own head,” declares the Lord GOD, “so that you will not commit this lewdness on top of all your other abominations."
Ezekiel,16,44,"“Behold, everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb concerning you, saying, ‘Like mother, like daughter.’"
Ezekiel,16,45,"You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and children. You are also the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite."
Ezekiel,16,46,"Now your older sister is Samaria, who lives north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lives south of you, is Sodom with her daughters."
Ezekiel,16,47,"Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you acted more corruptly in all your conduct than they."
Ezekiel,16,48,"As I live,” declares the Lord GOD, “Sodom, your sister and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done."
Ezekiel,16,49,"Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy."
Ezekiel,16,50,Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. Therefore I removed them when I saw it.
Ezekiel,16,51,"Furthermore, Samaria did not commit half of your sins, for you have multiplied your abominations more than they. Thus you have made your sisters appear righteous by all your abominations which you have committed."
Ezekiel,16,52,"Also bear your disgrace in that you have made judgment favorable for your sisters. Because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you. Yes, be also ashamed and bear your disgrace, in that you made your sisters appear righteous."
Ezekiel,16,53,"“Nevertheless, I will restore their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and along with them your own captivity,"
Ezekiel,16,54,in order that you may bear your humiliation and feel ashamed for all that you have done when you become a consolation to them.
Ezekiel,16,55,"Your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to their former state, and you with your daughters will also return to your former state."
Ezekiel,16,56,"As the name of your sister Sodom was not heard from your lips in your day of pride,"
Ezekiel,16,57,"before your wickedness was uncovered, so now you have become the reproach of the daughters of Edom and of all who are around her, of the daughters of the Philistines—those surrounding you who despise you."
Ezekiel,16,58,"You have borne the penalty of your lewdness and abominations,” the LORD declares."
Ezekiel,16,59,"For thus says the Lord GOD, “I will also do with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath by breaking the covenant."
Ezekiel,16,60,"“Nevertheless, I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you."
Ezekiel,16,61,"Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both your older and your younger; and I will give them to you as daughters, but not because of your covenant."
Ezekiel,16,62,"Thus I will establish My covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the LORD,"
Ezekiel,16,63,"so that you may remember and be ashamed and never open your mouth anymore because of your humiliation, when I have forgiven you for all that you have done,” the Lord GOD declares."
Ezekiel,17,1,"Now the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,17,2,"“Son of man, propound a riddle and speak a parable to the house of Israel,"
Ezekiel,17,3,"saying, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “A great eagle with great wings, long pinions and a full plumage of many colors came to Lebanon and took away the top of the cedar."
Ezekiel,17,4,He plucked off the topmost of its young twigs and brought it to a land of merchants; he set it in a city of traders.
Ezekiel,17,5,He also took some of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil. He placed it beside abundant waters; he set it like a willow.
Ezekiel,17,6,"Then it sprouted and became a low, spreading vine with its branches turned toward him, but its roots remained under it. So it became a vine and yielded shoots and sent out branches."
Ezekiel,17,7,"“But there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage; and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and sent out its branches toward him from the beds where it was planted, that he might water it."
Ezekiel,17,8,"It was planted in good soil beside abundant waters, that it might yield branches and bear fruit and become a splendid vine.”’"
Ezekiel,17,9,"Say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, so that it withers—so that all its sprouting leaves wither? And neither by great strength nor by many people can it be raised from its roots again."
Ezekiel,17,10,"Behold, though it is planted, will it thrive? Will it not completely wither as soon as the east wind strikes it—wither on the beds where it grew?”’”"
Ezekiel,17,11,"Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,17,12,"“Say now to the rebellious house, ‘Do you not know what these things mean?’ Say, ‘Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, took its king and princes and brought them to him in Babylon."
Ezekiel,17,13,"He took one of the royal family and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath. He also took away the mighty of the land,"
Ezekiel,17,14,"that the kingdom might be in subjection, not exalting itself, but keeping his covenant that it might continue."
Ezekiel,17,15,But he rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt that they might give him horses and many troops. Will he succeed? Will he who does such things escape? Can he indeed break the covenant and escape?
Ezekiel,17,16,"As I live,’ declares the Lord GOD, ‘Surely in the country of the king who put him on the throne, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke, in Babylon he shall die."
Ezekiel,17,17,"Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in the war, when they cast up ramps and build siege walls to cut off many lives."
Ezekiel,17,18,"Now he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and behold, he pledged his allegiance, yet did all these things; he shall not escape.’”"
Ezekiel,17,19,"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, “As I live, surely My oath which he despised and My covenant which he broke, I will inflict on his head."
Ezekiel,17,20,"I will spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. Then I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there regarding the unfaithful act which he has committed against Me."
Ezekiel,17,21,"All the choice men in all his troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to every wind; and you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken.”"
Ezekiel,17,22,"Thus says the Lord GOD, “I will also take a sprig from the lofty top of the cedar and set it out; I will pluck from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain."
Ezekiel,17,23,"On the high mountain of Israel I will plant it, that it may bring forth boughs and bear fruit and become a stately cedar. And birds of every kind will nest under it; they will nest in the shade of its branches."
Ezekiel,17,24,"All the trees of the field will know that I am the LORD; I bring down the high tree, exalt the low tree, dry up the green tree and make the dry tree flourish. I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will perform it.”"
Ezekiel,18,1,"Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,18,2,"“What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, ‘The fathers eat the sour grapes, But the children’s teeth are set on edge’?"
Ezekiel,18,3,"As I live,” declares the Lord GOD, “you are surely not going to use this proverb in Israel anymore."
Ezekiel,18,4,"Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is Mine. The soul who sins will die."
Ezekiel,18,5,"“But if a man is righteous and practices justice and righteousness,"
Ezekiel,18,6,"and does not eat at the mountain shrines or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbor’s wife or approach a woman during her menstrual period—"
Ezekiel,18,7,"if a man does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge, does not commit robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing,"
Ezekiel,18,8,"if he does not lend money on interest or take increase, if he keeps his hand from iniquity and executes true justice between man and man,"
Ezekiel,18,9,"if he walks in My statutes and My ordinances so as to deal faithfully—he is righteous and will surely live,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,18,10,“Then he may have a violent son who sheds blood and who does any of these things to a brother
Ezekiel,18,11,"(though he himself did not do any of these things), that is, he even eats at the mountain shrines, and defiles his neighbor’s wife,"
Ezekiel,18,12,"oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore a pledge, but lifts up his eyes to the idols and commits abomination,"
Ezekiel,18,13,"he lends money on interest and takes increase; will he live? He will not live! He has committed all these abominations, he will surely be put to death; his blood will be on his own head."
Ezekiel,18,14,"“Now behold, he has a son who has observed all his father’s sins which he committed, and observing does not do likewise."
Ezekiel,18,15,"He does not eat at the mountain shrines or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbor’s wife,"
Ezekiel,18,16,"or oppress anyone, or retain a pledge, or commit robbery, but he gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing,"
Ezekiel,18,17,"he keeps his hand from the poor, does not take interest or increase, but executes My ordinances, and walks in My statutes; he will not die for his father’s iniquity, he will surely live."
Ezekiel,18,18,"As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother and did what was not good among his people, behold, he will die for his iniquity."
Ezekiel,18,19,"“Yet you say, ‘Why should the son not bear the punishment for the father’s iniquity?’ When the son has practiced justice and righteousness and has observed all My statutes and done them, he shall surely live."
Ezekiel,18,20,"The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father’s iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son’s iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself."
Ezekiel,18,21,"“But if the wicked man turns from all his sins which he has committed and observes all My statutes and practices justice and righteousness, he shall surely live; he shall not die."
Ezekiel,18,22,"All his transgressions which he has committed will not be remembered against him; because of his righteousness which he has practiced, he will live."
Ezekiel,18,23,"Do I have any pleasure in the death of the wicked,” declares the Lord GOD, “rather than that he should turn from his ways and live?"
Ezekiel,18,24,"“But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity and does according to all the abominations that a wicked man does, will he live? All his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered for his treachery which he has committed and his sin which he has committed; for them he will die."
Ezekiel,18,25,"Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not right.’ Hear now, O house of Israel! Is My way not right? Is it not your ways that are not right?"
Ezekiel,18,26,"When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity and dies because of it, for his iniquity which he has committed he will die."
Ezekiel,18,27,"Again, when a wicked man turns away from his wickedness which he has committed and practices justice and righteousness, he will save his life."
Ezekiel,18,28,"Because he considered and turned away from all his transgressions which he had committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die."
Ezekiel,18,29,"But the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not right.’ Are My ways not right, O house of Israel? Is it not your ways that are not right?"
Ezekiel,18,30,"“Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, each according to his conduct,” declares the Lord GOD. “Repent and turn away from all your transgressions, so that iniquity may not become a stumbling block to you."
Ezekiel,18,31,"Cast away from you all your transgressions which you have committed and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! For why will you die, O house of Israel?"
Ezekiel,18,32,"For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies,” declares the Lord GOD. “Therefore, repent and live.”"
Ezekiel,19,1,"“As for you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel"
Ezekiel,19,2,"and say, ‘What was your mother? A lioness among lions! She lay down among young lions, She reared her cubs."
Ezekiel,19,3,"‘When she brought up one of her cubs, He became a lion, And he learned to tear his prey; He devoured men."
Ezekiel,19,4,"‘Then nations heard about him; He was captured in their pit, And they brought him with hooks To the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,19,5,"‘When she saw, as she waited, That her hope was lost, She took another of her cubs And made him a young lion."
Ezekiel,19,6,"‘And he walked about among the lions; He became a young lion, He learned to tear his prey; He devoured men."
Ezekiel,19,7,‘He destroyed their fortified towers And laid waste their cities; And the land and its fullness were appalled Because of the sound of his roaring.
Ezekiel,19,8,"‘Then nations set against him On every side from their provinces, And they spread their net over him; He was captured in their pit."
Ezekiel,19,9,‘They put him in a cage with hooks And brought him to the king of Babylon; They brought him in hunting nets So that his voice would be heard no more On the mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel,19,10,"‘Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, Planted by the waters; It was fruitful and full of branches Because of abundant waters."
Ezekiel,19,11,"‘And it had strong branches fit for scepters of rulers, And its height was raised above the clouds So that it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches."
Ezekiel,19,12,‘But it was plucked up in fury; It was cast down to the ground; And the east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong branch was torn off So that it withered; The fire consumed it.
Ezekiel,19,13,"‘And now it is planted in the wilderness, In a dry and thirsty land."
Ezekiel,19,14,"‘And fire has gone out from its branch; It has consumed its shoots and fruit, So that there is not in it a strong branch, A scepter to rule.’” This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation."
Ezekiel,20,1,"Now in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month, certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me."
Ezekiel,20,2,"And the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,20,3,"“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Do you come to inquire of Me? As I live,” declares the Lord GOD, “I will not be inquired of by you.”’"
Ezekiel,20,4,"Will you judge them, will you judge them, son of man? Make them know the abominations of their fathers;"
Ezekiel,20,5,"and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “On the day when I chose Israel and swore to the descendants of the house of Jacob and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, I am the LORD your God,"
Ezekiel,20,6,"on that day I swore to them, to bring them out from the land of Egypt into a land that I had selected for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands."
Ezekiel,20,7,"I said to them, ‘Cast away, each of you, the detestable things of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the LORD your God.’"
Ezekiel,20,8,"But they rebelled against Me and were not willing to listen to Me; they did not cast away the detestable things of their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I resolved to pour out My wrath on them, to accomplish My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,9,"But I acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they lived, in whose sight I made Myself known to them by bringing them out of the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,10,So I took them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
Ezekiel,20,11,"I gave them My statutes and informed them of My ordinances, by which, if a man observes them, he will live."
Ezekiel,20,12,"Also I gave them My sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them."
Ezekiel,20,13,"But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness. They did not walk in My statutes and they rejected My ordinances, by which, if a man observes them, he will live; and My sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I resolved to pour out My wrath on them in the wilderness, to annihilate them."
Ezekiel,20,14,"But I acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, before whose sight I had brought them out."
Ezekiel,20,15,"Also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands,"
Ezekiel,20,16,"because they rejected My ordinances, and as for My statutes, they did not walk in them; they even profaned My sabbaths, for their heart continually went after their idols."
Ezekiel,20,17,"Yet My eye spared them rather than destroying them, and I did not cause their annihilation in the wilderness."
Ezekiel,20,18,"“I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers or keep their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols."
Ezekiel,20,19,I am the LORD your God; walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances and observe them.
Ezekiel,20,20,"Sanctify My sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.’"
Ezekiel,20,21,"But the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, nor were they careful to observe My ordinances, by which, if a man observes them, he will live; they profaned My sabbaths. So I resolved to pour out My wrath on them, to accomplish My anger against them in the wilderness."
Ezekiel,20,22,"But I withdrew My hand and acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out."
Ezekiel,20,23,"Also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands,"
Ezekiel,20,24,"because they had not observed My ordinances, but had rejected My statutes and had profaned My sabbaths, and their eyes were on the idols of their fathers."
Ezekiel,20,25,I also gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not live;
Ezekiel,20,26,"and I pronounced them unclean because of their gifts, in that they caused all their firstborn to pass through the fire so that I might make them desolate, in order that they might know that I am the LORD.”’"
Ezekiel,20,27,"“Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed Me by acting treacherously against Me."
Ezekiel,20,28,"When I had brought them into the land which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill and every leafy tree, and they offered there their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering. There also they made their soothing aroma and there they poured out their drink offerings."
Ezekiel,20,29,"Then I said to them, ‘What is the high place to which you go?’ So its name is called Bamah to this day.”’"
Ezekiel,20,30,"Therefore, say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers and play the harlot after their detestable things?"
Ezekiel,20,31,"When you offer your gifts, when you cause your sons to pass through the fire, you are defiling yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live,” declares the Lord GOD, “I will not be inquired of by you."
Ezekiel,20,32,"What comes into your mind will not come about, when you say: ‘We will be like the nations, like the tribes of the lands, serving wood and stone.’"
Ezekiel,20,33,"“As I live,” declares the Lord GOD, “surely with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out, I shall be king over you."
Ezekiel,20,34,"I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out;"
Ezekiel,20,35,"and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face."
Ezekiel,20,36,"As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,20,37,"“I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;"
Ezekiel,20,38,"and I will purge from you the rebels and those who transgress against Me; I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, but they will not enter the land of Israel. Thus you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,20,39,"“As for you, O house of Israel,” thus says the Lord GOD, “Go, serve everyone his idols; but later you will surely listen to Me, and My holy name you will profane no longer with your gifts and with your idols."
Ezekiel,20,40,"For on My holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel,” declares the Lord GOD, “there the whole house of Israel, all of them, will serve Me in the land; there I will accept them and there I will seek your contributions and the choicest of your gifts, with all your holy things."
Ezekiel,20,41,As a soothing aroma I will accept you when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are scattered; and I will prove Myself holy among you in the sight of the nations.
Ezekiel,20,42,"And you will know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the land which I swore to give to your forefathers."
Ezekiel,20,43,There you will remember your ways and all your deeds with which you have defiled yourselves; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for all the evil things that you have done.
Ezekiel,20,44,"Then you will know that I am the LORD when I have dealt with you for My name’s sake, not according to your evil ways or according to your corrupt deeds, O house of Israel,” declares the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,20,45,"Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,20,46,"“Son of man, set your face toward Teman, and speak out against the south and prophesy against the forest land of the Negev,"
Ezekiel,20,47,"and say to the forest of the Negev, ‘Hear the word of the LORD: thus says the Lord GOD, “Behold, I am about to kindle a fire in you, and it will consume every green tree in you, as well as every dry tree; the blazing flame will not be quenched and the whole surface from south to north will be burned by it."
Ezekiel,20,48,"All flesh will see that I, the LORD, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.”’”"
Ezekiel,20,49,"Then I said, “Ah Lord GOD! They are saying of me, ‘Is he not just speaking parables?’”"
Ezekiel,21,1,"And the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,21,2,"“Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and speak against the sanctuaries and prophesy against the land of Israel;"
Ezekiel,21,3,"and say to the land of Israel, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Behold, I am against you; and I will draw My sword out of its sheath and cut off from you the righteous and the wicked."
Ezekiel,21,4,"Because I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore My sword will go forth from its sheath against all flesh from south to north."
Ezekiel,21,5,"Thus all flesh will know that I, the LORD, have drawn My sword out of its sheath. It will not return to its sheath again.”’"
Ezekiel,21,6,"As for you, son of man, groan with breaking heart and bitter grief, groan in their sight."
Ezekiel,21,7,"And when they say to you, ‘Why do you groan?’ you shall say, ‘Because of the news that is coming; and every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it comes and it will happen,’ declares the Lord GOD.”"
Ezekiel,21,8,"Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,21,9,"“Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the LORD.’ Say, ‘A sword, a sword sharpened And also polished!"
Ezekiel,21,10,"‘Sharpened to make a slaughter, Polished to flash like lightning!’ Or shall we rejoice, the rod of My son despising every tree?"
Ezekiel,21,11,"It is given to be polished, that it may be handled; the sword is sharpened and polished, to give it into the hand of the slayer."
Ezekiel,21,12,"Cry out and wail, son of man; for it is against My people, it is against all the officials of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with My people, therefore strike your thigh."
Ezekiel,21,13,For there is a testing; and what if even the rod which despises will be no more?” declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel,21,14,"“You therefore, son of man, prophesy and clap your hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword for the slain. It is the sword for the great one slain, which surrounds them,"
Ezekiel,21,15,"that their hearts may melt, and many fall at all their gates. I have given the glittering sword. Ah! It is made for striking like lightning, it is wrapped up in readiness for slaughter."
Ezekiel,21,16,"Show yourself sharp, go to the right; set yourself; go to the left, wherever your edge is appointed."
Ezekiel,21,17,"I will also clap My hands together, and I will appease My wrath; I, the LORD, have spoken.”"
Ezekiel,21,18,"The word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,21,19,"“As for you, son of man, make two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; both of them will go out of one land. And make a signpost; make it at the head of the way to the city."
Ezekiel,21,20,"You shall mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah into fortified Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,21,21,"For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shakes the arrows, he consults the household idols, he looks at the liver."
Ezekiel,21,22,"Into his right hand came the divination, ‘Jerusalem,’ to set battering rams, to open the mouth for slaughter, to lift up the voice with a battle cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up ramps, to build a siege wall."
Ezekiel,21,23,"And it will be to them like a false divination in their eyes; they have sworn solemn oaths. But he brings iniquity to remembrance, that they may be seized."
Ezekiel,21,24,"“Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your deeds your sins appear—because you have come to remembrance, you will be seized with the hand."
Ezekiel,21,25,"And you, O slain, wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the punishment of the end,’"
Ezekiel,21,26,"thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Remove the turban and take off the crown; this will no longer be the same. Exalt that which is low and abase that which is high."
Ezekiel,21,27,"A ruin, a ruin, a ruin, I will make it. This also will be no more until He comes whose right it is, and I will give it to Him.’"
Ezekiel,21,28,"“And you, son of man, prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the sons of Ammon and concerning their reproach,’ and say: ‘A sword, a sword is drawn, polished for the slaughter, to cause it to consume, that it may be like lightning—"
Ezekiel,21,29,"while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies for you—to place you on the necks of the wicked who are slain, whose day has come, in the time of the punishment of the end."
Ezekiel,21,30,"Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you."
Ezekiel,21,31,"I will pour out My indignation on you; I will blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and I will give you into the hand of brutal men, skilled in destruction."
Ezekiel,21,32,"You will be fuel for the fire; your blood will be in the midst of the land. You will not be remembered, for I, the LORD, have spoken.’”"
Ezekiel,22,1,"Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,22,2,"“And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Then cause her to know all her abominations."
Ezekiel,22,3,"You shall say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “A city shedding blood in her midst, so that her time will come, and that makes idols, contrary to her interest, for defilement!"
Ezekiel,22,4,"You have become guilty by the blood which you have shed, and defiled by your idols which you have made. Thus you have brought your day near and have come to your years; therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations and a mocking to all the lands."
Ezekiel,22,5,"Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you, you of ill repute, full of turmoil."
Ezekiel,22,6,"“Behold, the rulers of Israel, each according to his power, have been in you for the purpose of shedding blood."
Ezekiel,22,7,They have treated father and mother lightly within you. The alien they have oppressed in your midst; the fatherless and the widow they have wronged in you.
Ezekiel,22,8,You have despised My holy things and profaned My sabbaths.
Ezekiel,22,9,"Slanderous men have been in you for the purpose of shedding blood, and in you they have eaten at the mountain shrines. In your midst they have committed acts of lewdness."
Ezekiel,22,10,In you they have uncovered their fathers’ nakedness; in you they have humbled her who was unclean in her menstrual impurity.
Ezekiel,22,11,"One has committed abomination with his neighbor’s wife and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law. And another in you has humbled his sister, his father’s daughter."
Ezekiel,22,12,"In you they have taken bribes to shed blood; you have taken interest and profits, and you have injured your neighbors for gain by oppression, and you have forgotten Me,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,22,13,"“Behold, then, I smite My hand at your dishonest gain which you have acquired and at the bloodshed which is among you."
Ezekiel,22,14,"Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong in the days that I will deal with you? I, the LORD, have spoken and will act."
Ezekiel,22,15,"I will scatter you among the nations and I will disperse you through the lands, and I will consume your uncleanness from you."
Ezekiel,22,16,"You will profane yourself in the sight of the nations, and you will know that I am the LORD.”’”"
Ezekiel,22,17,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,22,18,"“Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me; all of them are bronze and tin and iron and lead in the furnace; they are the dross of silver."
Ezekiel,22,19,"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Because all of you have become dross, therefore, behold, I am going to gather you into the midst of Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,22,20,"As they gather silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into the furnace to blow fire on it in order to melt it, so I will gather you in My anger and in My wrath and I will lay you there and melt you."
Ezekiel,22,21,"I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and you will be melted in the midst of it."
Ezekiel,22,22,"As silver is melted in the furnace, so you will be melted in the midst of it; and you will know that I, the LORD, have poured out My wrath on you.’”"
Ezekiel,22,23,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,22,24,"“Son of man, say to her, ‘You are a land that is not cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation.’"
Ezekiel,22,25,There is a conspiracy of her prophets in her midst like a roaring lion tearing the prey. They have devoured lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in the midst of her.
Ezekiel,22,26,"Her priests have done violence to My law and have profaned My holy things; they have made no distinction between the holy and the profane, and they have not taught the difference between the unclean and the clean; and they hide their eyes from My sabbaths, and I am profaned among them."
Ezekiel,22,27,"Her princes within her are like wolves tearing the prey, by shedding blood and destroying lives in order to get dishonest gain."
Ezekiel,22,28,"Her prophets have smeared whitewash for them, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD,’ when the LORD has not spoken."
Ezekiel,22,29,"The people of the land have practiced oppression and committed robbery, and they have wronged the poor and needy and have oppressed the sojourner without justice."
Ezekiel,22,30,"I searched for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before Me for the land, so that I would not destroy it; but I found no one."
Ezekiel,22,31,"Thus I have poured out My indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; their way I have brought upon their heads,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,23,1,"The word of the LORD came to me again, saying,"
Ezekiel,23,2,"“Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother;"
Ezekiel,23,3,and they played the harlot in Egypt. They played the harlot in their youth; there their breasts were pressed and there their virgin bosom was handled.
Ezekiel,23,4,"Their names were Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister. And they became Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah and Jerusalem is Oholibah."
Ezekiel,23,5,"“Oholah played the harlot while she was Mine; and she lusted after her lovers, after the Assyrians, her neighbors,"
Ezekiel,23,6,"who were clothed in purple, governors and officials, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses."
Ezekiel,23,7,"She bestowed her harlotries on them, all of whom were the choicest men of Assyria; and with all whom she lusted after, with all their idols she defiled herself."
Ezekiel,23,8,"She did not forsake her harlotries from the time in Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her, and they handled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her."
Ezekiel,23,9,"Therefore, I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, after whom she lusted."
Ezekiel,23,10,"They uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters, but they slew her with the sword. Thus she became a byword among women, and they executed judgments on her."
Ezekiel,23,11,"“Now her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her lust than she, and her harlotries were more than the harlotries of her sister."
Ezekiel,23,12,"She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and officials, the ones near, magnificently dressed, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men."
Ezekiel,23,13,I saw that she had defiled herself; they both took the same way.
Ezekiel,23,14,"So she increased her harlotries. And she saw men portrayed on the wall, images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,"
Ezekiel,23,15,"girded with belts on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, like the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth."
Ezekiel,23,16,When she saw them she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
Ezekiel,23,17,"The Babylonians came to her to the bed of love and defiled her with their harlotry. And when she had been defiled by them, she became disgusted with them."
Ezekiel,23,18,"She uncovered her harlotries and uncovered her nakedness; then I became disgusted with her, as I had become disgusted with her sister."
Ezekiel,23,19,"Yet she multiplied her harlotries, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the harlot in the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,23,20,"She lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys and whose issue is like the issue of horses."
Ezekiel,23,21,"Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom because of the breasts of your youth."
Ezekiel,23,22,"“Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Behold I will arouse your lovers against you, from whom you were alienated, and I will bring them against you from every side:"
Ezekiel,23,23,"the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and officials all of them, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses."
Ezekiel,23,24,"They will come against you with weapons, chariots and wagons, and with a company of peoples. They will set themselves against you on every side with buckler and shield and helmet; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge you according to their customs."
Ezekiel,23,25,"I will set My jealousy against you, that they may deal with you in wrath. They will remove your nose and your ears; and your survivors will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters; and your survivors will be consumed by the fire."
Ezekiel,23,26,They will also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels.
Ezekiel,23,27,"Thus I will make your lewdness and your harlotry brought from the land of Egypt to cease from you, so that you will not lift up your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore.’"
Ezekiel,23,28,"For thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Behold, I will give you into the hand of those whom you hate, into the hand of those from whom you were alienated."
Ezekiel,23,29,"They will deal with you in hatred, take all your property, and leave you naked and bare. And the nakedness of your harlotries will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your harlotries."
Ezekiel,23,30,"These things will be done to you because you have played the harlot with the nations, because you have defiled yourself with their idols."
Ezekiel,23,31,You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.’
Ezekiel,23,32,"Thus says the Lord GOD, ‘You will drink your sister’s cup, Which is deep and wide. You will be laughed at and held in derision; It contains much."
Ezekiel,23,33,"‘You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, The cup of horror and desolation, The cup of your sister Samaria."
Ezekiel,23,34,"‘You will drink it and drain it. Then you will gnaw its fragments And tear your breasts; for I have spoken,’ declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,23,35,"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, bear now the punishment of your lewdness and your harlotries.’”"
Ezekiel,23,36,"Moreover, the LORD said to me, “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations."
Ezekiel,23,37,"For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. Thus they have committed adultery with their idols and even caused their sons, whom they bore to Me, to pass through the fire to them as food."
Ezekiel,23,38,"Again, they have done this to Me: they have defiled My sanctuary on the same day and have profaned My sabbaths."
Ezekiel,23,39,"For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols, they entered My sanctuary on the same day to profane it; and lo, thus they did within My house."
Ezekiel,23,40,"“Furthermore, they have even sent for men who come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and lo, they came—for whom you bathed, painted your eyes and decorated yourselves with ornaments;"
Ezekiel,23,41,and you sat on a splendid couch with a table arranged before it on which you had set My incense and My oil.
Ezekiel,23,42,The sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and drunkards were brought from the wilderness with men of the common sort. And they put bracelets on the hands of the women and beautiful crowns on their heads.
Ezekiel,23,43,"“Then I said concerning her who was worn out by adulteries, ‘Will they now commit adultery with her when she is thus?’"
Ezekiel,23,44,"But they went in to her as they would go in to a harlot. Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women."
Ezekiel,23,45,"But they, righteous men, will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands."
Ezekiel,23,46,"“For thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Bring up a company against them and give them over to terror and plunder."
Ezekiel,23,47,The company will stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords; they will slay their sons and their daughters and burn their houses with fire.
Ezekiel,23,48,"Thus I will make lewdness cease from the land, that all women may be admonished and not commit lewdness as you have done."
Ezekiel,23,49,"Your lewdness will be requited upon you, and you will bear the penalty of worshiping your idols; thus you will know that I am the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,24,1,"And the word of the LORD came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, saying,"
Ezekiel,24,2,"“Son of man, write the name of the day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day."
Ezekiel,24,3,"Speak a parable to the rebellious house and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Put on the pot, put it on and also pour water in it;"
Ezekiel,24,4,"Put in it the pieces, Every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder; Fill it with choice bones."
Ezekiel,24,5,"“Take the choicest of the flock, And also pile wood under the pot. Make it boil vigorously. Also seethe its bones in it.”"
Ezekiel,24,6,"‘Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, “Woe to the bloody city, To the pot in which there is rust And whose rust has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece, Without making a choice."
Ezekiel,24,7,“For her blood is in her midst; She placed it on the bare rock; She did not pour it on the ground To cover it with dust.
Ezekiel,24,8,"“That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have put her blood on the bare rock, That it may not be covered.”"
Ezekiel,24,9,"‘Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, “Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great."
Ezekiel,24,10,"“Heap on the wood, kindle the fire, Boil the flesh well And mix in the spices, And let the bones be burned."
Ezekiel,24,11,"“Then set it empty on its coals So that it may be hot And its bronze may glow And its filthiness may be melted in it, Its rust consumed."
Ezekiel,24,12,"“She has wearied Me with toil, Yet her great rust has not gone from her; Let her rust be in the fire!"
Ezekiel,24,13,"“In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I would have cleansed you, Yet you are not clean, You will not be cleansed from your filthiness again Until I have spent My wrath on you."
Ezekiel,24,14,"I, the LORD, have spoken; it is coming and I will act. I will not relent, and I will not pity and I will not be sorry; according to your ways and according to your deeds I will judge you,” declares the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,24,15,"And the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,24,16,"“Son of man, behold, I am about to take from you the desire of your eyes with a blow; but you shall not mourn and you shall not weep, and your tears shall not come."
Ezekiel,24,17,"Groan silently; make no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban and put your shoes on your feet, and do not cover your mustache and do not eat the bread of men.”"
Ezekiel,24,18,"So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. And in the morning I did as I was commanded."
Ezekiel,24,19,"The people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these things that you are doing mean for us?”"
Ezekiel,24,20,"Then I said to them, “The word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,24,21,"‘Speak to the house of Israel, “Thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Behold, I am about to profane My sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes and the delight of your soul; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword."
Ezekiel,24,22,You will do as I have done; you will not cover your mustache and you will not eat the bread of men.
Ezekiel,24,23,"Your turbans will be on your heads and your shoes on your feet. You will not mourn and you will not weep, but you will rot away in your iniquities and you will groan to one another."
Ezekiel,24,24,"Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done you will do; when it comes, then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,24,25,"‘As for you, son of man, will it not be on the day when I take from them their stronghold, the joy of their pride, the desire of their eyes and their heart’s delight, their sons and their daughters,"
Ezekiel,24,26,that on that day he who escapes will come to you with information for your ears?
Ezekiel,24,27,"On that day your mouth will be opened to him who escaped, and you will speak and be mute no longer. Thus you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,25,1,"And the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,25,2,"“Son of man, set your face toward the sons of Ammon and prophesy against them,"
Ezekiel,25,3,"and say to the sons of Ammon, ‘Hear the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD, “Because you said, ‘Aha!’ against My sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into exile,"
Ezekiel,25,4,"therefore, behold, I am going to give you to the sons of the east for a possession, and they will set their encampments among you and make their dwellings among you; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk."
Ezekiel,25,5,I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the sons of Ammon a resting place for flocks. Thus you will know that I am the LORD.”
Ezekiel,25,6,"For thus says the Lord GOD, “Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet and rejoiced with all the scorn of your soul against the land of Israel,"
Ezekiel,25,7,"therefore, behold, I have stretched out My hand against you and I will give you for spoil to the nations. And I will cut you off from the peoples and make you perish from the lands; I will destroy you. Thus you will know that I am the LORD.”"
Ezekiel,25,8,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Because Moab and Seir say, ‘Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations,’"
Ezekiel,25,9,"therefore, behold, I am going to deprive the flank of Moab of its cities, of its cities which are on its frontiers, the glory of the land, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon and Kiriathaim,"
Ezekiel,25,10,"and I will give it for a possession along with the sons of Ammon to the sons of the east, so that the sons of Ammon will not be remembered among the nations."
Ezekiel,25,11,"Thus I will execute judgments on Moab, and they will know that I am the LORD.”"
Ezekiel,25,12,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Because Edom has acted against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has incurred grievous guilt, and avenged themselves upon them,”"
Ezekiel,25,13,"therefore thus says the Lord GOD, “I will also stretch out My hand against Edom and cut off man and beast from it. And I will lay it waste; from Teman even to Dedan they will fall by the sword."
Ezekiel,25,14,"I will lay My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel. Therefore, they will act in Edom according to My anger and according to My wrath; thus they will know My vengeance,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,25,15,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Because the Philistines have acted in revenge and have taken vengeance with scorn of soul to destroy with everlasting enmity,”"
Ezekiel,25,16,"therefore thus says the Lord GOD, “Behold, I will stretch out My hand against the Philistines, even cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant of the seacoast."
Ezekiel,25,17,I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes; and they will know that I am the LORD when I lay My vengeance on them.”’”
Ezekiel,26,1,"Now in the eleventh year, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,26,2,"“Son of man, because Tyre has said concerning Jerusalem, ‘Aha, the gateway of the peoples is broken; it has opened to me. I shall be filled, now that she is laid waste,’"
Ezekiel,26,3,"therefore thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and I will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves."
Ezekiel,26,4,They will destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; and I will scrape her debris from her and make her a bare rock.
Ezekiel,26,5,"She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken,’ declares the Lord GOD, ‘and she will become spoil for the nations."
Ezekiel,26,6,"Also her daughters who are on the mainland will be slain by the sword, and they will know that I am the LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,26,7,"For thus says the Lord GOD, “Behold, I will bring upon Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, chariots, cavalry and a great army."

Ezekiel,29,9,"The land of Egypt will become a desolation and waste. Then they will know that I am the LORD. Because you said, ‘The Nile is mine, and I have made it,’"
Ezekiel,29,10,"therefore, behold, I am against you and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol to Syene and even to the border of Ethiopia."
Ezekiel,29,11,"A man’s foot will not pass through it, and the foot of a beast will not pass through it, and it will not be inhabited for forty years."
Ezekiel,29,12,"So I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated lands. And her cities, in the midst of cities that are laid waste, will be desolate forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands.”"
Ezekiel,29,13,"‘For thus says the Lord GOD, “At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered."
Ezekiel,29,14,"I will turn the fortunes of Egypt and make them return to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and there they will be a lowly kingdom."
Ezekiel,29,15,"It will be the lowest of the kingdoms, and it will never again lift itself up above the nations. And I will make them so small that they will not rule over the nations."
Ezekiel,29,16,"And it will never again be the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing to mind the iniquity of their having turned to Egypt. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD.”’”"
Ezekiel,29,17,"Now in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,29,18,"“Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre; every head was made bald and every shoulder was rubbed bare. But he and his army had no wages from Tyre for the labor that he had performed against it.”"
Ezekiel,29,19,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, “Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. And he will carry off her wealth and capture her spoil and seize her plunder; and it will be wages for his army."
Ezekiel,29,20,"I have given him the land of Egypt for his labor which he performed, because they acted for Me,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,29,21,"“On that day I will make a horn sprout for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth in their midst. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”"

Ezekiel,30,20,"In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,30,21,"“Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, behold, it has not been bound up for healing or wrapped with a bandage, that it may be strong to hold the sword."
Ezekiel,30,22,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt and will break his arms, both the strong and the broken; and I will make the sword fall from his hand."
Ezekiel,30,23,I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands.
Ezekiel,30,24,"For I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put My sword in his hand; and I will break the arms of Pharaoh, so that he will groan before him with the groanings of a wounded man."
Ezekiel,30,25,"Thus I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh will fall. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he stretches it out against the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,30,26,"When I scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands, then they will know that I am the LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,31,1,"In the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,31,2,"“Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his hordes, ‘Whom are you like in your greatness?"
Ezekiel,31,3,"‘Behold, Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon With beautiful branches and forest shade, And very high, And its top was among the clouds."
Ezekiel,31,4,"‘The waters made it grow, the deep made it high. With its rivers it continually extended all around its planting place, And sent out its channels to all the trees of the field."
Ezekiel,31,5,‘Therefore its height was loftier than all the trees of the field And its boughs became many and its branches long Because of many waters as it spread them out.
Ezekiel,31,6,"‘All the birds of the heavens nested in its boughs, And under its branches all the beasts of the field gave birth, And all great nations lived under its shade."
Ezekiel,31,7,"‘So it was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches; For its roots extended to many waters."
Ezekiel,31,8,"‘The cedars in God’s garden could not match it; The cypresses could not compare with its boughs, And the plane trees could not match its branches. No tree in God’s garden could compare with it in its beauty."
Ezekiel,31,9,"‘I made it beautiful with the multitude of its branches, And all the trees of Eden, which were in the garden of God, were jealous of it."
Ezekiel,31,10,"‘Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, “Because it is high in stature and has set its top among the clouds, and its heart is haughty in its loftiness,"
Ezekiel,31,11,therefore I will give it into the hand of a despot of the nations; he will thoroughly deal with it. According to its wickedness I have driven it away.
Ezekiel,31,12,Alien tyrants of the nations have cut it down and left it; on the mountains and in all the valleys its branches have fallen and its boughs have been broken in all the ravines of the land. And all the peoples of the earth have gone down from its shade and left it.
Ezekiel,31,13,"On its ruin all the birds of the heavens will dwell, and all the beasts of the field will be on its fallen branches"
Ezekiel,31,14,"so that all the trees by the waters may not be exalted in their stature, nor set their top among the clouds, nor their well-watered mighty ones stand erect in their height. For they have all been given over to death, to the earth beneath, among the sons of men, with those who go down to the pit.”"
Ezekiel,31,15,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “On the day when it went down to Sheol I caused lamentations; I closed the deep over it and held back its rivers. And its many waters were stopped up, and I made Lebanon mourn for it, and all the trees of the field wilted away on account of it."
Ezekiel,31,16,"I made the nations quake at the sound of its fall when I made it go down to Sheol with those who go down to the pit; and all the well-watered trees of Eden, the choicest and best of Lebanon, were comforted in the earth beneath."
Ezekiel,31,17,They also went down with it to Sheol to those who were slain by the sword; and those who were its strength lived under its shade among the nations.
Ezekiel,31,18,"“To which among the trees of Eden are you thus equal in glory and greatness? Yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth beneath; you will lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those who were slain by the sword. So is Pharaoh and all his hordes!”’ declares the Lord GOD.”"
Ezekiel,32,1,"In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,32,2,"“Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him, ‘You compared yourself to a young lion of the nations, Yet you are like the monster in the seas; And you burst forth in your rivers And muddied the waters with your feet And fouled their rivers.’”"
Ezekiel,32,3,"Thus says the Lord GOD, “Now I will spread My net over you With a company of many peoples, And they shall lift you up in My net."

Ezekiel,32,6,"“I will also make the land drink the discharge of your blood As far as the mountains, And the ravines will be full of you."
Ezekiel,32,7,"“And when I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens and darken their stars; I will cover the sun with a cloud And the moon will not give its light."
Ezekiel,32,8,"“All the shining lights in the heavens I will darken over you And will set darkness on your land,” Declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,32,9,"“I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples when I bring your destruction among the nations, into lands which you have not known."
Ezekiel,32,10,"I will make many peoples appalled at you, and their kings will be horribly afraid of you when I brandish My sword before them; and they will tremble every moment, every man for his own life, on the day of your fall.”"
Ezekiel,32,11,"For thus says the Lord GOD, “The sword of the king of Babylon will come upon you."
Ezekiel,32,12,"By the swords of the mighty ones I will cause your hordes to fall; all of them are tyrants of the nations, And they will devastate the pride of Egypt, And all its hordes will be destroyed."
Ezekiel,32,13,“I will also destroy all its cattle from beside many waters; And the foot of man will not muddy them anymore And the hoofs of beasts will not muddy them.

Ezekiel,32,16,"This is a lamentation and they shall chant it. The daughters of the nations shall chant it. Over Egypt and over all her hordes they shall chant it,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,32,17,"In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,32,18,"“Son of man, wail for the hordes of Egypt and bring it down, her and the daughters of the powerful nations, to the nether world, with those who go down to the pit;"
Ezekiel,32,19,‘Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down and make your bed with the uncircumcised.’
Ezekiel,32,20,They shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword. She is given over to the sword; they have drawn her and all her hordes away.
Ezekiel,32,21,"The strong among the mighty ones shall speak of him and his helpers from the midst of Sheol, ‘They have gone down, they lie still, the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.’"
Ezekiel,32,22,"“Assyria is there and all her company; her graves are round about her. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword,"
Ezekiel,32,23,"whose graves are set in the remotest parts of the pit and her company is round about her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword, who spread terror in the land of the living."
Ezekiel,32,24,"“Elam is there and all her hordes around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth, who instilled their terror in the land of the living and bore their disgrace with those who went down to the pit."
Ezekiel,32,25,"They have made a bed for her among the slain with all her hordes. Her graves are around it, they are all uncircumcised, slain by the sword (although their terror was instilled in the land of the living), and they bore their disgrace with those who go down to the pit; they were put in the midst of the slain."
Ezekiel,32,26,"“Meshech, Tubal and all their hordes are there; their graves surround them. All of them were slain by the sword uncircumcised, though they instilled their terror in the land of the living."
Ezekiel,32,27,"Nor do they lie beside the fallen heroes of the uncircumcised, who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war and whose swords were laid under their heads; but the punishment for their iniquity rested on their bones, though the terror of these heroes was once in the land of the living."
Ezekiel,32,28,But in the midst of the uncircumcised you will be broken and lie with those slain by the sword.
Ezekiel,32,29,"“There also is Edom, its kings and all its princes, who for all their might are laid with those slain by the sword; they will lie with the uncircumcised and with those who go down to the pit."
Ezekiel,32,30,"“There also are the chiefs of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who in spite of the terror resulting from their might, in shame went down with the slain. So they lay down uncircumcised with those slain by the sword and bore their disgrace with those who go down to the pit."
Ezekiel,32,31,"“These Pharaoh will see, and he will be comforted for all his hordes slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his army,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,32,32,"“Though I instilled a terror of him in the land of the living, yet he will be made to lie down among the uncircumcised along with those slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his hordes,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,33,1,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,33,2,"“Son of man, speak to the sons of your people and say to them, ‘If I bring a sword upon a land, and the people of the land take one man from among them and make him their watchman,"
Ezekiel,33,3,"and he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows on the trumpet and warns the people,"
Ezekiel,33,4,"then he who hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning, and a sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head."
Ezekiel,33,5,"He heard the sound of the trumpet but did not take warning; his blood will be on himself. But had he taken warning, he would have delivered his life."
Ezekiel,33,6,"But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet and the people are not warned, and a sword comes and takes a person from them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood I will require from the watchman’s hand.’"
Ezekiel,33,7,"“Now as for you, son of man, I have appointed you a watchman for the house of Israel; so you will hear a message from My mouth and give them warning from Me."
Ezekiel,33,8,"When I say to the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you will surely die,’ and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require from your hand."
Ezekiel,33,9,"But if you on your part warn a wicked man to turn from his way and he does not turn from his way, he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your life."
Ezekiel,33,10,"“Now as for you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus you have spoken, saying, “Surely our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we are rotting away in them; how then can we survive?”’"
Ezekiel,33,11,"Say to them, ‘As I live!’ declares the Lord GOD, ‘I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn back, turn back from your evil ways! Why then will you die, O house of Israel?’"
Ezekiel,33,12,"And you, son of man, say to your fellow citizens, ‘The righteousness of a righteous man will not deliver him in the day of his transgression, and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he will not stumble because of it in the day when he turns from his wickedness; whereas a righteous man will not be able to live by his righteousness on the day when he commits sin.’"
Ezekiel,33,13,"When I say to the righteous he will surely live, and he so trusts in his righteousness that he commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered; but in that same iniquity of his which he has committed he will die."
Ezekiel,33,14,"But when I say to the wicked, ‘You will surely die,’ and he turns from his sin and practices justice and righteousness,"
Ezekiel,33,15,"if a wicked man restores a pledge, pays back what he has taken by robbery, walks by the statutes which ensure life without committing iniquity, he shall surely live; he shall not die."
Ezekiel,33,16,None of his sins that he has committed will be remembered against him. He has practiced justice and righteousness; he shall surely live.
Ezekiel,33,17,"“Yet your fellow citizens say, ‘The way of the Lord is not right,’ when it is their own way that is not right."
Ezekiel,33,18,"When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, then he shall die in it."
Ezekiel,33,19,"But when the wicked turns from his wickedness and practices justice and righteousness, he will live by them."
Ezekiel,33,20,"Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not right.’ O house of Israel, I will judge each of you according to his ways.”"
Ezekiel,33,21,"Now in the twelfth year of our exile, on the fifth of the tenth month, the refugees from Jerusalem came to me, saying, “The city has been taken.”"
Ezekiel,33,22,"Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me in the evening, before the refugees came. And He opened my mouth at the time they came to me in the morning; so my mouth was opened and I was no longer speechless."
Ezekiel,33,23,"Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,33,24,"“Son of man, they who live in these waste places in the land of Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was only one, yet he possessed the land; so to us who are many the land has been given as a possession.’"
Ezekiel,33,25,"Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “You eat meat with the blood in it, lift up your eyes to your idols as you shed blood. Should you then possess the land?"
Ezekiel,33,26,"You rely on your sword, you commit abominations and each of you defiles his neighbor’s wife. Should you then possess the land?”’"
Ezekiel,33,27,"Thus you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “As I live, surely those who are in the waste places will fall by the sword, and whoever is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in the strongholds and in the caves will die of pestilence."
Ezekiel,33,28,"I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and the pride of her power will cease; and the mountains of Israel will be desolate so that no one will pass through."
Ezekiel,33,29,"Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I make the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations which they have committed.”’"
Ezekiel,33,30,"“But as for you, son of man, your fellow citizens who talk about you by the walls and in the doorways of the houses, speak to one another, each to his brother, saying, ‘Come now and hear what the message is which comes forth from the LORD.’"
Ezekiel,33,31,"They come to you as people come, and sit before you as My people and hear your words, but they do not do them, for they do the lustful desires expressed by their mouth, and their heart goes after their gain."
Ezekiel,33,32,"Behold, you are to them like a sensual song by one who has a beautiful voice and plays well on an instrument; for they hear your words but they do not practice them."
Ezekiel,33,33,So when it comes to pass—as surely it will—then they will know that a prophet has been in their midst.”
Ezekiel,34,1,"Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,34,2,"“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to those shepherds, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Woe, shepherds of Israel who have been feeding themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flock?"
Ezekiel,34,3,"You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat sheep without feeding the flock."
Ezekiel,34,4,"Those who are sickly you have not strengthened, the diseased you have not healed, the broken you have not bound up, the scattered you have not brought back, nor have you sought for the lost; but with force and with severity you have dominated them."
Ezekiel,34,5,"They were scattered for lack of a shepherd, and they became food for every beast of the field and were scattered."
Ezekiel,34,6,"My flock wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill; My flock was scattered over all the surface of the earth, and there was no one to search or seek for them.”’”"
Ezekiel,34,7,"Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:"
Ezekiel,34,8,"“As I live,” declares the Lord GOD, “surely because My flock has become a prey, My flock has even become food for all the beasts of the field for lack of a shepherd, and My shepherds did not search for My flock, but rather the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed My flock;"
Ezekiel,34,9,"therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:"
Ezekiel,34,10,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will demand My sheep from them and make them cease from feeding sheep. So the shepherds will not feed themselves anymore, but I will deliver My flock from their mouth, so that they will not be food for them.”’”"
Ezekiel,34,11,"For thus says the Lord GOD, “Behold, I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out."
Ezekiel,34,12,"As a shepherd cares for his herd in the day when he is among his scattered sheep, so I will care for My sheep and will deliver them from all the places to which they were scattered on a cloudy and gloomy day."
Ezekiel,34,13,"I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and bring them to their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the streams, and in all the inhabited places of the land."
Ezekiel,34,14,"I will feed them in a good pasture, and their grazing ground will be on the mountain heights of Israel. There they will lie down on good grazing ground and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel."
Ezekiel,34,15,"I will feed My flock and I will lead them to rest,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,34,16,"“I will seek the lost, bring back the scattered, bind up the broken and strengthen the sick; but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with judgment."
Ezekiel,34,17,"“As for you, My flock, thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Behold, I will judge between one sheep and another, between the rams and the male goats."
Ezekiel,34,18,"Is it too slight a thing for you that you should feed in the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pastures? Or that you should drink of the clear waters, that you must foul the rest with your feet?"
Ezekiel,34,19,"As for My flock, they must eat what you tread down with your feet and drink what you foul with your feet!’”"
Ezekiel,34,20,"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them, “Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep."
Ezekiel,34,21,"Because you push with side and with shoulder, and thrust at all the weak with your horns until you have scattered them abroad,"
Ezekiel,34,22,"therefore, I will deliver My flock, and they will no longer be a prey; and I will judge between one sheep and another."
Ezekiel,34,23,"“Then I will set over them one shepherd, My servant David, and he will feed them; he will feed them himself and be their shepherd."
Ezekiel,34,24,"And I, the LORD, will be their God, and My servant David will be prince among them; I the LORD have spoken."
Ezekiel,34,25,“I will make a covenant of peace with them and eliminate harmful beasts from the land so that they may live securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.
Ezekiel,34,26,I will make them and the places around My hill a blessing. And I will cause showers to come down in their season; they will be showers of blessing.
Ezekiel,34,27,"Also the tree of the field will yield its fruit and the earth will yield its increase, and they will be secure on their land. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bars of their yoke and have delivered them from the hand of those who enslaved them."
Ezekiel,34,28,"They will no longer be a prey to the nations, and the beasts of the earth will not devour them; but they will live securely, and no one will make them afraid."
Ezekiel,34,29,"I will establish for them a renowned planting place, and they will not again be victims of famine in the land, and they will not endure the insults of the nations anymore."
Ezekiel,34,30,"Then they will know that I, the LORD their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are My people,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,34,31,"“As for you, My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, you are men, and I am your God,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,35,1,"Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,35,2,"“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it"
Ezekiel,35,3,"and say to it, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, And I will stretch out My hand against you And make you a desolation and a waste."
Ezekiel,35,4,“I will lay waste your cities And you will become a desolation. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,35,5,"Because you have had everlasting enmity and have delivered the sons of Israel to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of the punishment of the end,"
Ezekiel,35,6,"therefore as I live,” declares the Lord GOD, “I will give you over to bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you; since you have not hated bloodshed, therefore bloodshed will pursue you."
Ezekiel,35,7,I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation and I will cut off from it the one who passes through and returns.
Ezekiel,35,8,I will fill its mountains with its slain; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those slain by the sword will fall.
Ezekiel,35,9,I will make you an everlasting desolation and your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,35,10,"“Because you have said, ‘These two nations and these two lands will be mine, and we will possess them,’ although the LORD was there,"
Ezekiel,35,11,"therefore as I live,” declares the Lord GOD, “I will deal with you according to your anger and according to your envy which you showed because of your hatred against them; so I will make Myself known among them when I judge you."
Ezekiel,35,12,"Then you will know that I, the LORD, have heard all your revilings which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel saying, ‘They are laid desolate; they are given to us for food.’"
Ezekiel,35,13,And you have spoken arrogantly against Me and have multiplied your words against Me; I have heard it.”
Ezekiel,35,14,"Thus says the Lord GOD, “As all the earth rejoices, I will make you a desolation."
Ezekiel,35,15,"As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate, so I will do to you. You will be a desolation, O Mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”’"
Ezekiel,36,1,"“And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, ‘O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD."
Ezekiel,36,2,"Thus says the Lord GOD, “Because the enemy has spoken against you, ‘Aha!’ and, ‘The everlasting heights have become our possession,’"
Ezekiel,36,3,"therefore prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “For good reason they have made you desolate and crushed you from every side, that you would become a possession of the rest of the nations and you have been taken up in the talk and the whispering of the people.”’”"
Ezekiel,36,4,"Therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD. Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and to the hills, to the ravines and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the forsaken cities which have become a prey and a derision to the rest of the nations which are round about,"
Ezekiel,36,5,"therefore thus says the Lord GOD, “Surely in the fire of My jealousy I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who appropriated My land for themselves as a possession with wholehearted joy and with scorn of soul, to drive it out for a prey.”"
Ezekiel,36,6,"Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the ravines and to the valleys, “Thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and in My wrath because you have endured the insults of the nations.’"
Ezekiel,36,7,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, ‘I have sworn that surely the nations which are around you will themselves endure their insults."
Ezekiel,36,8,"But you, O mountains of Israel, you will put forth your branches and bear your fruit for My people Israel; for they will soon come."
Ezekiel,36,9,"For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you will be cultivated and sown."
Ezekiel,36,10,"I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities will be inhabited and the waste places will be rebuilt."
Ezekiel,36,11,I will multiply on you man and beast; and they will increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited as you were formerly and will treat you better than at the first. Thus you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,36,12,"Yes, I will cause men—My people Israel—to walk on you and possess you, so that you will become their inheritance and never again bereave them of children.’"
Ezekiel,36,13,"“Thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Because they say to you, “You are a devourer of men and have bereaved your nation of children,”"
Ezekiel,36,14,"therefore you will no longer devour men and no longer bereave your nation of children,’ declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,36,15,"“I will not let you hear insults from the nations anymore, nor will you bear disgrace from the peoples any longer, nor will you cause your nation to stumble any longer,” declares the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,36,16,"Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,36,17,"“Son of man, when the house of Israel was living in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and their deeds; their way before Me was like the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity."
Ezekiel,36,18,"Therefore I poured out My wrath on them for the blood which they had shed on the land, because they had defiled it with their idols."
Ezekiel,36,19,Also I scattered them among the nations and they were dispersed throughout the lands. According to their ways and their deeds I judged them.
Ezekiel,36,20,"When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned My holy name, because it was said of them, ‘These are the people of the LORD; yet they have come out of His land.’"
Ezekiel,36,21,"But I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went."
Ezekiel,36,22,"“Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for My holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went."
Ezekiel,36,23,"I will vindicate the holiness of My great name which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst. Then the nations will know that I am the LORD,” declares the Lord GOD, “when I prove Myself holy among you in their sight."
Ezekiel,36,24,"For I will take you from the nations, gather you from all the lands and bring you into your own land."
Ezekiel,36,25,"Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols."
Ezekiel,36,26,"Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh."
Ezekiel,36,27,"I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will be careful to observe My ordinances."
Ezekiel,36,28,"You will live in the land that I gave to your forefathers; so you will be My people, and I will be your God."
Ezekiel,36,29,"Moreover, I will save you from all your uncleanness; and I will call for the grain and multiply it, and I will not bring a famine on you."
Ezekiel,36,30,"I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field, so that you will not receive again the disgrace of famine among the nations."
Ezekiel,36,31,"Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and your abominations."
Ezekiel,36,32,"I am not doing this for your sake,” declares the Lord GOD, “let it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel!”"
Ezekiel,36,33,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places will be rebuilt."
Ezekiel,36,34,The desolate land will be cultivated instead of being a desolation in the sight of everyone who passes by.
Ezekiel,36,35,"They will say, ‘This desolate land has become like the garden of Eden; and the waste, desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.’"
Ezekiel,36,36,"Then the nations that are left round about you will know that I, the LORD, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted that which was desolate; I, the LORD, have spoken and will do it.”"
Ezekiel,36,37,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “This also I will let the house of Israel ask Me to do for them: I will increase their men like a flock."
Ezekiel,36,38,"Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so will the waste cities be filled with flocks of men. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”’”"
Ezekiel,37,1,"The hand of the LORD was upon me, and He brought me out by the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of the valley; and it was full of bones."
Ezekiel,37,2,"He caused me to pass among them round about, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley; and lo, they were very dry."
Ezekiel,37,3,"He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” And I answered, “O Lord GOD, You know.”"
Ezekiel,37,4,"Again He said to me, “Prophesy over these bones and say to them, ‘O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.’"
Ezekiel,37,5,"Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones, ‘Behold, I will cause breath to enter you that you may come to life."
Ezekiel,37,6,"I will put sinews on you, make flesh grow back on you, cover you with skin and put breath in you that you may come alive; and you will know that I am the LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,37,7,"So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone."
Ezekiel,37,8,"And I looked, and behold, sinews were on them, and flesh grew and skin covered them; but there was no breath in them."
Ezekiel,37,9,"Then He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they come to life.”’”"
Ezekiel,37,10,"So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they came to life and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army."
Ezekiel,37,11,"Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel; behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up and our hope has perished. We are completely cut off.’"
Ezekiel,37,12,"Therefore prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Behold, I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel."
Ezekiel,37,13,"Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves and caused you to come up out of your graves, My people."
Ezekiel,37,14,"I will put My Spirit within you and you will come to life, and I will place you on your own land. Then you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken and done it,” declares the LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,37,15,"The word of the LORD came again to me saying,"
Ezekiel,37,16,"“And you, son of man, take for yourself one stick and write on it, ‘For Judah and for the sons of Israel, his companions’; then take another stick and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and all the house of Israel, his companions.’"
Ezekiel,37,17,"Then join them for yourself one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand."
Ezekiel,37,18,"When the sons of your people speak to you saying, ‘Will you not declare to us what you mean by these?’"
Ezekiel,37,19,"say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions; and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in My hand.”’"
Ezekiel,37,20,The sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.
Ezekiel,37,21,"Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Behold, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and I will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land;"
Ezekiel,37,22,"and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king will be king for all of them; and they will no longer be two nations and no longer be divided into two kingdoms."
Ezekiel,37,23,"They will no longer defile themselves with their idols, or with their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions; but I will deliver them from all their dwelling places in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. And they will be My people, and I will be their God."
Ezekiel,37,24,"“My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd; and they will walk in My ordinances and keep My statutes and observe them."
Ezekiel,37,25,"They will live on the land that I gave to Jacob My servant, in which your fathers lived; and they will live on it, they, and their sons and their sons’ sons, forever; and David My servant will be their prince forever."
Ezekiel,37,26,"I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in their midst forever."
Ezekiel,37,27,"My dwelling place also will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people."
Ezekiel,37,28,"And the nations will know that I am the LORD who sanctifies Israel, when My sanctuary is in their midst forever.”’”"
Ezekiel,38,1,"And the word of the LORD came to me saying,"
Ezekiel,38,2,"“Son of man, set your face toward Gog of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him"
Ezekiel,38,3,"and say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Behold, I am against you, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal."
Ezekiel,38,4,"I will turn you about and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them splendidly attired, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them wielding swords;"
Ezekiel,38,5,"Persia, Ethiopia and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet;"
Ezekiel,38,6,Gomer with all its troops; Beth-togarmah from the remote parts of the north with all its troops—many peoples with you.
Ezekiel,38,7,"“Be prepared, and prepare yourself, you and all your companies that are assembled about you, and be a guard for them."
Ezekiel,38,8,"After many days you will be summoned; in the latter years you will come into the land that is restored from the sword, whose inhabitants have been gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel which had been a continual waste; but its people were brought out from the nations, and they are living securely, all of them."
Ezekiel,38,9,"You will go up, you will come like a storm; you will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your troops, and many peoples with you.”"
Ezekiel,38,10,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “It will come about on that day, that thoughts will come into your mind and you will devise an evil plan,"
Ezekiel,38,11,"and you will say, ‘I will go up against the land of unwalled villages. I will go against those who are at rest, that live securely, all of them living without walls and having no bars or gates,"
Ezekiel,38,12,"to capture spoil and to seize plunder, to turn your hand against the waste places which are now inhabited, and against the people who are gathered from the nations, who have acquired cattle and goods, who live at the center of the world.’"
Ezekiel,38,13,"Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish with all its villages will say to you, ‘Have you come to capture spoil? Have you assembled your company to seize plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to capture great spoil?’”’"
Ezekiel,38,14,"“Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “On that day when My people Israel are living securely, will you not know it?"
Ezekiel,38,15,"You will come from your place out of the remote parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great assembly and a mighty army;"
Ezekiel,38,16,"and you will come up against My people Israel like a cloud to cover the land. It shall come about in the last days that I will bring you against My land, so that the nations may know Me when I am sanctified through you before their eyes, O Gog.”"
Ezekiel,38,17,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Are you the one of whom I spoke in former days through My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days for many years that I would bring you against them?"
Ezekiel,38,18,"It will come about on that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel,” declares the Lord GOD, “that My fury will mount up in My anger."
Ezekiel,38,19,In My zeal and in My blazing wrath I declare that on that day there will surely be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
Ezekiel,38,20,"The fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, the beasts of the field, all the creeping things that creep on the earth, and all the men who are on the face of the earth will shake at My presence; the mountains also will be thrown down, the steep pathways will collapse and every wall will fall to the ground."
Ezekiel,38,21,"I will call for a sword against him on all My mountains,” declares the Lord GOD. “Every man’s sword will be against his brother."
Ezekiel,38,22,"With pestilence and with blood I will enter into judgment with him; and I will rain on him and on his troops, and on the many peoples who are with him, a torrential rain, with hailstones, fire and brimstone."

Ezekiel,39,3,I will strike your bow from your left hand and dash down your arrows from your right hand.
Ezekiel,39,4,"You will fall on the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops and the peoples who are with you; I will give you as food to every kind of predatory bird and beast of the field."

Ezekiel,39,11,"“On that day I will give Gog a burial ground there in Israel, the valley of those who pass by east of the sea, and it will block off those who would pass by. So they will bury Gog there with all his horde, and they will call it the valley of Hamon-gog."
Ezekiel,39,12,For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them in order to cleanse the land.
Ezekiel,39,13,"Even all the people of the land will bury them; and it will be to their renown on the day that I glorify Myself,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,39,14,"“They will set apart men who will constantly pass through the land, burying those who were passing through, even those left on the surface of the ground, in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will make a search."
Ezekiel,39,15,"As those who pass through the land pass through and anyone sees a man’s bone, then he will set up a marker by it until the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog."
Ezekiel,39,16,And even the name of the city will be Hamonah. So they will cleanse the land.”’
Ezekiel,39,17,"“As for you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Speak to every kind of bird and to every beast of the field, “Assemble and come, gather from every side to My sacrifice which I am going to sacrifice for you, as a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh and drink blood."
Ezekiel,39,18,"You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, as though they were rams, lambs, goats and bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan."
Ezekiel,39,19,"So you will eat fat until you are glutted, and drink blood until you are drunk, from My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you."
Ezekiel,39,20,"You will be glutted at My table with horses and charioteers, with mighty men and all the men of war,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,39,21,“And I will set My glory among the nations; and all the nations will see My judgment which I have executed and My hand which I have laid on them.
Ezekiel,39,22,And the house of Israel will know that I am the LORD their God from that day onward.
Ezekiel,39,23,"The nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile for their iniquity because they acted treacherously against Me, and I hid My face from them; so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and all of them fell by the sword."
Ezekiel,39,24,"According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I dealt with them, and I hid My face from them.”’”"
Ezekiel,39,25,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, “Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for My holy name."
Ezekiel,39,26,"They will forget their disgrace and all their treachery which they perpetrated against Me, when they live securely on their own land with no one to make them afraid."
Ezekiel,39,27,"When I bring them back from the peoples and gather them from the lands of their enemies, then I shall be sanctified through them in the sight of the many nations."
Ezekiel,39,28,"Then they will know that I am the LORD their God because I made them go into exile among the nations, and then gathered them again to their own land; and I will leave none of them there any longer."
Ezekiel,39,29,"I will not hide My face from them any longer, for I will have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,40,1,"In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was taken, on that same day the hand of the LORD was upon me and He brought me there."
Ezekiel,40,2,"In the visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, and on it to the south there was a structure like a city."
Ezekiel,40,3,"So He brought me there; and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax and a measuring rod in his hand; and he was standing in the gateway."
Ezekiel,40,4,"The man said to me, “Son of man, see with your eyes, hear with your ears, and give attention to all that I am going to show you; for you have been brought here in order to show it to you. Declare to the house of Israel all that you see.”"
Ezekiel,40,5,"And behold, there was a wall on the outside of the temple all around, and in the man’s hand was a measuring rod of six cubits, each of which was a cubit and a handbreadth. So he measured the thickness of the wall, one rod; and the height, one rod."
Ezekiel,40,6,"Then he went to the gate which faced east, went up its steps and measured the threshold of the gate, one rod in width; and the other threshold was one rod in width."
Ezekiel,40,7,The guardroom was one rod long and one rod wide; and there were five cubits between the guardrooms. And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate facing inward was one rod.
Ezekiel,40,8,"Then he measured the porch of the gate facing inward, one rod."
Ezekiel,40,9,"He measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its side pillars, two cubits. And the porch of the gate was faced inward."
Ezekiel,40,10,The guardrooms of the gate toward the east numbered three on each side; the three of them had the same measurement. The side pillars also had the same measurement on each side.
Ezekiel,40,11,"And he measured the width of the gateway, ten cubits, and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits."
Ezekiel,40,12,There was a barrier wall one cubit wide in front of the guardrooms on each side; and the guardrooms were six cubits square on each side.
Ezekiel,40,13,"He measured the gate from the roof of the one guardroom to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits from one door to the door opposite."
Ezekiel,40,14,He made the side pillars sixty cubits high; the gate extended round about to the side pillar of the courtyard.
Ezekiel,40,15,From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the inner porch of the gate was fifty cubits.
Ezekiel,40,16,"There were shuttered windows looking toward the guardrooms, and toward their side pillars within the gate all around, and likewise for the porches. And there were windows all around inside; and on each side pillar were palm tree ornaments."
Ezekiel,40,17,"Then he brought me into the outer court, and behold, there were chambers and a pavement made for the court all around; thirty chambers faced the pavement."
Ezekiel,40,18,"The pavement (that is, the lower pavement) was by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates."
Ezekiel,40,19,"Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the exterior of the inner court, a hundred cubits on the east and on the north."
Ezekiel,40,20,"As for the gate of the outer court which faced the north, he measured its length and its width."
Ezekiel,40,21,It had three guardrooms on each side; and its side pillars and its porches had the same measurement as the first gate. Its length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits.
Ezekiel,40,22,"Its windows and its porches and its palm tree ornaments had the same measurements as the gate which faced toward the east; and it was reached by seven steps, and its porch was in front of them."
Ezekiel,40,23,The inner court had a gate opposite the gate on the north as well as the gate on the east; and he measured a hundred cubits from gate to gate.
Ezekiel,40,24,"Then he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate toward the south; and he measured its side pillars and its porches according to those same measurements."
Ezekiel,40,25,The gate and its porches had windows all around like those other windows; the length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits.
Ezekiel,40,26,"There were seven steps going up to it, and its porches were in front of them; and it had palm tree ornaments on its side pillars, one on each side."
Ezekiel,40,27,"The inner court had a gate toward the south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,40,28,Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to those same measurements.
Ezekiel,40,29,"Its guardrooms also, its side pillars and its porches were according to those same measurements. And the gate and its porches had windows all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide."
Ezekiel,40,30,"There were porches all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide."
Ezekiel,40,31,"Its porches were toward the outer court; and palm tree ornaments were on its side pillars, and its stairway had eight steps."
Ezekiel,40,32,He brought me into the inner court toward the east. And he measured the gate according to those same measurements.
Ezekiel,40,33,"Its guardrooms also, its side pillars and its porches were according to those same measurements. And the gate and its porches had windows all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide."
Ezekiel,40,34,"Its porches were toward the outer court; and palm tree ornaments were on its side pillars, on each side, and its stairway had eight steps."
Ezekiel,40,35,"Then he brought me to the north gate; and he measured it according to those same measurements,"
Ezekiel,40,36,"with its guardrooms, its side pillars and its porches. And the gate had windows all around; the length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits."
Ezekiel,40,37,"Its side pillars were toward the outer court; and palm tree ornaments were on its side pillars on each side, and its stairway had eight steps."
Ezekiel,40,38,A chamber with its doorway was by the side pillars at the gates; there they rinse the burnt offering.
Ezekiel,40,39,"In the porch of the gate were two tables on each side, on which to slaughter the burnt offering, the sin offering and the guilt offering."
Ezekiel,40,40,"On the outer side, as one went up to the gateway toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables."
Ezekiel,40,41,"Four tables were on each side next to the gate; or, eight tables on which they slaughter sacrifices."
Ezekiel,40,42,"For the burnt offering there were four tables of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide and one cubit high, on which they lay the instruments with which they slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice."
Ezekiel,40,43,"The double hooks, one handbreadth in length, were installed in the house all around; and on the tables was the flesh of the offering."
Ezekiel,40,44,"From the outside to the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, one of which was at the side of the north gate, with its front toward the south, and one at the side of the south gate facing toward the north."
Ezekiel,40,45,"He said to me, “This is the chamber which faces toward the south, intended for the priests who keep charge of the temple;"
Ezekiel,40,46,"but the chamber which faces toward the north is for the priests who keep charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who from the sons of Levi come near to the LORD to minister to Him.”"
Ezekiel,40,47,"He measured the court, a perfect square, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide; and the altar was in front of the temple."
Ezekiel,40,48,"Then he brought me to the porch of the temple and measured each side pillar of the porch, five cubits on each side; and the width of the gate was three cubits on each side."
Ezekiel,40,49,"The length of the porch was twenty cubits and the width eleven cubits; and at the stairway by which it was ascended were columns belonging to the side pillars, one on each side."
Ezekiel,41,1,Then he brought me to the nave and measured the side pillars; six cubits wide on each side was the width of the side pillar.
Ezekiel,41,2,"The width of the entrance was ten cubits and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on each side. And he measured the length of the nave, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits."
Ezekiel,41,3,"Then he went inside and measured each side pillar of the doorway, two cubits, and the doorway, six cubits high; and the width of the doorway, seven cubits."
Ezekiel,41,4,"He measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the nave; and he said to me, “This is the most holy place.”"
Ezekiel,41,5,"Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits; and the width of the side chambers, four cubits, all around about the house on every side."
Ezekiel,41,6,"The side chambers were in three stories, one above another, and thirty in each story; and the side chambers extended to the wall which stood on their inward side all around, that they might be fastened, and not be fastened into the wall of the temple itself."
Ezekiel,41,7,"The side chambers surrounding the temple were wider at each successive story. Because the structure surrounding the temple went upward by stages on all sides of the temple, therefore the width of the temple increased as it went higher; and thus one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way of the second story."
Ezekiel,41,8,I saw also that the house had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers were a full rod of six long cubits in height.
Ezekiel,41,9,The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. But the free space between the side chambers belonging to the temple
Ezekiel,41,10,and the outer chambers was twenty cubits in width all around the temple on every side.
Ezekiel,41,11,The doorways of the side chambers toward the free space consisted of one doorway toward the north and another doorway toward the south; and the width of the free space was five cubits all around.
Ezekiel,41,12,"The building that was in front of the separate area at the side toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length was ninety cubits."
Ezekiel,41,13,"Then he measured the temple, a hundred cubits long; the separate area with the building and its walls were also a hundred cubits long."
Ezekiel,41,14,Also the width of the front of the temple and that of the separate areas along the east side totaled a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel,41,15,"He measured the length of the building along the front of the separate area behind it, with a gallery on each side, a hundred cubits; he also measured the inner nave and the porches of the court."
Ezekiel,41,16,"The thresholds, the latticed windows and the galleries round about their three stories, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, and from the ground to the windows (but the windows were covered),"
Ezekiel,41,17,"over the entrance, and to the inner house, and on the outside, and on all the wall all around inside and outside, by measurement."
Ezekiel,41,18,"It was carved with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces,"
Ezekiel,41,19,a man’s face toward the palm tree on one side and a young lion’s face toward the palm tree on the other side; they were carved on all the house all around.
Ezekiel,41,20,"From the ground to above the entrance cherubim and palm trees were carved, as well as on the wall of the nave."
Ezekiel,41,21,"The doorposts of the nave were square; as for the front of the sanctuary, the appearance of one doorpost was like that of the other."
Ezekiel,41,22,"The altar was of wood, three cubits high and its length two cubits; its corners, its base and its sides were of wood. And he said to me, “This is the table that is before the LORD.”"
Ezekiel,41,23,The nave and the sanctuary each had a double door.
Ezekiel,41,24,"Each of the doors had two leaves, two swinging leaves; two leaves for one door and two leaves for the other."
Ezekiel,41,25,"Also there were carved on them, on the doors of the nave, cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls; and there was a threshold of wood on the front of the porch outside."
Ezekiel,41,26,"There were latticed windows and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch; thus were the side chambers of the house and the thresholds."
Ezekiel,42,1,"Then he brought me out into the outer court, the way toward the north; and he brought me to the chamber which was opposite the separate area and opposite the building toward the north."
Ezekiel,42,2,"Along the length, which was a hundred cubits, was the north door; the width was fifty cubits."
Ezekiel,42,3,"Opposite the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery corresponding to gallery in three stories."
Ezekiel,42,4,"Before the chambers was an inner walk ten cubits wide, a way of one hundred cubits; and their openings were on the north."
Ezekiel,42,5,Now the upper chambers were smaller because the galleries took more space away from them than from the lower and middle ones in the building.
Ezekiel,42,6,"For they were in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper chambers were set back from the ground upward, more than the lower and middle ones."
Ezekiel,42,7,"As for the outer wall by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court facing the chambers, its length was fifty cubits."
Ezekiel,42,8,"For the length of the chambers which were in the outer court was fifty cubits; and behold, the length of those facing the temple was a hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,42,9,"Below these chambers was the entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court."
Ezekiel,42,10,"In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, facing the separate area and facing the building, there were chambers."
Ezekiel,42,11,"The way in front of them was like the appearance of the chambers which were on the north, according to their length so was their width, and all their exits were both according to their arrangements and openings."
Ezekiel,42,12,"Corresponding to the openings of the chambers which were toward the south was an opening at the head of the way, the way in front of the wall toward the east, as one enters them."
Ezekiel,42,13,"Then he said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers, which are opposite the separate area, they are the holy chambers where the priests who are near to the LORD shall eat the most holy things. There they shall lay the most holy things, the grain offering, the sin offering and the guilt offering; for the place is holy."
Ezekiel,42,14,"When the priests enter, then they shall not go out into the outer court from the sanctuary without laying there their garments in which they minister, for they are holy. They shall put on other garments; then they shall approach that which is for the people.”"
Ezekiel,42,15,"Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate which faced toward the east and measured it all around."
Ezekiel,42,16,He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds by the measuring reed.
Ezekiel,42,17,He measured on the north side five hundred reeds by the measuring reed.
Ezekiel,42,18,On the south side he measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
Ezekiel,42,19,He turned to the west side and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
Ezekiel,42,20,"He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, the length five hundred and the width five hundred, to divide between the holy and the profane."
Ezekiel,43,1,"Then he led me to the gate, the gate facing toward the east;"
Ezekiel,43,2,"and behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the way of the east. And His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory."
Ezekiel,43,3,"And it was like the appearance of the vision which I saw, like the vision which I saw when He came to destroy the city. And the visions were like the vision which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face."
Ezekiel,43,4,And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate facing toward the east.
Ezekiel,43,5,"And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house."
Ezekiel,43,6,"Then I heard one speaking to me from the house, while a man was standing beside me."
Ezekiel,43,7,"He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell among the sons of Israel forever. And the house of Israel will not again defile My holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their harlotry and by the corpses of their kings when they die,"
Ezekiel,43,8,"by setting their threshold by My threshold and their door post beside My door post, with only the wall between Me and them. And they have defiled My holy name by their abominations which they have committed. So I have consumed them in My anger."
Ezekiel,43,9,Now let them put away their harlotry and the corpses of their kings far from Me; and I will dwell among them forever.
Ezekiel,43,10,"“As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the plan."
Ezekiel,43,11,"If they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the house, its structure, its exits, its entrances, all its designs, all its statutes, and all its laws. And write it in their sight, so that they may observe its whole design and all its statutes and do them."
Ezekiel,43,12,"This is the law of the house: its entire area on the top of the mountain all around shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house."
Ezekiel,43,13,"“And these are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth): the base shall be a cubit and the width a cubit, and its border on its edge round about one span; and this shall be the height of the base of the altar."
Ezekiel,43,14,From the base on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits and the width one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge shall be four cubits and the width one cubit.
Ezekiel,43,15,The altar hearth shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth shall extend upwards four horns.
Ezekiel,43,16,"Now the altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve wide, square in its four sides."
Ezekiel,43,17,"The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide in its four sides, the border around it shall be half a cubit and its base shall be a cubit round about; and its steps shall face the east.”"
Ezekiel,43,18,"And He said to me, “Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD, ‘These are the statutes for the altar on the day it is built, to offer burnt offerings on it and to sprinkle blood on it."
Ezekiel,43,19,"You shall give to the Levitical priests who are from the offspring of Zadok, who draw near to Me to minister to Me,’ declares the Lord GOD, ‘a young bull for a sin offering."
Ezekiel,43,20,You shall take some of its blood and put it on its four horns and on the four corners of the ledge and on the border round about; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.
Ezekiel,43,21,"You shall also take the bull for the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,43,22,"‘On the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering, and they shall cleanse the altar as they cleansed it with the bull."
Ezekiel,43,23,"When you have finished cleansing it, you shall present a young bull without blemish and a ram without blemish from the flock."
Ezekiel,43,24,"You shall present them before the LORD, and the priests shall throw salt on them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD."
Ezekiel,43,25,"For seven days you shall prepare daily a goat for a sin offering; also a young bull and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be prepared."
Ezekiel,43,26,For seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it.
Ezekiel,43,27,"When they have completed the days, it shall be that on the eighth day and onward, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you,’ declares the Lord GOD.”"
Ezekiel,44,1,"Then He brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces the east; and it was shut."
Ezekiel,44,2,"The LORD said to me, “This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no one shall enter by it, for the LORD God of Israel has entered by it; therefore it shall be shut."
Ezekiel,44,3,"As for the prince, he shall sit in it as prince to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by way of the porch of the gate and shall go out by the same way.”"
Ezekiel,44,4,"Then He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the house; and I looked, and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD, and I fell on my face."
Ezekiel,44,5,"The LORD said to me, “Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes and hear with your ears all that I say to you concerning all the statutes of the house of the LORD and concerning all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with all exits of the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,44,6,"You shall say to the rebellious ones, to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Enough of all your abominations, O house of Israel,"
Ezekiel,44,7,"when you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary to profane it, even My house, when you offered My food, the fat and the blood; for they made My covenant void—this in addition to all your abominations."
Ezekiel,44,8,"And you have not kept charge of My holy things yourselves, but you have set foreigners to keep charge of My sanctuary.”"
Ezekiel,44,9,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, of all the foreigners who are among the sons of Israel, shall enter My sanctuary."
Ezekiel,44,10,"But the Levites who went far from Me when Israel went astray, who went astray from Me after their idols, shall bear the punishment for their iniquity."
Ezekiel,44,11,"Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house and ministering in the house; they shall slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them."
Ezekiel,44,12,"Because they ministered to them before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have sworn against them,” declares the Lord GOD, “that they shall bear the punishment for their iniquity."
Ezekiel,44,13,"And they shall not come near to Me to serve as a priest to Me, nor come near to any of My holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they will bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed."
Ezekiel,44,14,"Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the house, of all its service and of all that shall be done in it."
Ezekiel,44,15,"“But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept charge of My sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from Me, shall come near to Me to minister to Me; and they shall stand before Me to offer Me the fat and the blood,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,44,16,“They shall enter My sanctuary; they shall come near to My table to minister to Me and keep My charge.
Ezekiel,44,17,"It shall be that when they enter at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and wool shall not be on them while they are ministering in the gates of the inner court and in the house."
Ezekiel,44,18,Linen turbans shall be on their heads and linen undergarments shall be on their loins; they shall not gird themselves with anything which makes them sweat.
Ezekiel,44,19,"When they go out into the outer court, into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they have been ministering and lay them in the holy chambers; then they shall put on other garments so that they will not transmit holiness to the people with their garments."
Ezekiel,44,20,"Also they shall not shave their heads, yet they shall not let their locks grow long; they shall only trim the hair of their heads."
Ezekiel,44,21,Nor shall any of the priests drink wine when they enter the inner court.
Ezekiel,44,22,"And they shall not marry a widow or a divorced woman but shall take virgins from the offspring of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest."
Ezekiel,44,23,"Moreover, they shall teach My people the difference between the holy and the profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean."
Ezekiel,44,24,In a dispute they shall take their stand to judge; they shall judge it according to My ordinances. They shall also keep My laws and My statutes in all My appointed feasts and sanctify My sabbaths.
Ezekiel,44,25,"They shall not go to a dead person to defile themselves; however, for father, for mother, for son, for daughter, for brother, or for a sister who has not had a husband, they may defile themselves."
Ezekiel,44,26,"After he is cleansed, seven days shall elapse for him."
Ezekiel,44,27,"On the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,44,28,"“And it shall be with regard to an inheritance for them, that I am their inheritance; and you shall give them no possession in Israel—I am their possession."
Ezekiel,44,29,"They shall eat the grain offering, the sin offering and the guilt offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs."
Ezekiel,44,30,"The first of all the first fruits of every kind and every contribution of every kind, from all your contributions, shall be for the priests; you shall also give to the priest the first of your dough to cause a blessing to rest on your house."
Ezekiel,44,31,The priests shall not eat any bird or beast that has died a natural death or has been torn to pieces.
Ezekiel,45,1,"“And when you divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an allotment to the LORD, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be the length of 25,000 cubits, and the width shall be 20,000. It shall be holy within all its boundary round about."
Ezekiel,45,2,"Out of this there shall be for the holy place a square round about five hundred by five hundred cubits, and fifty cubits for its open space round about."
Ezekiel,45,3,"From this area you shall measure a length of 25,000 cubits and a width of 10,000 cubits; and in it shall be the sanctuary, the most holy place."
Ezekiel,45,4,"It shall be the holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to the LORD, and it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,45,5,"An area 25,000 cubits in length and 10,000 in width shall be for the Levites, the ministers of the house, and for their possession cities to dwell in."
Ezekiel,45,6,"“You shall give the city possession of an area 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, alongside the allotment of the holy portion; it shall be for the whole house of Israel."
Ezekiel,45,7,"“The prince shall have land on either side of the holy allotment and the property of the city, adjacent to the holy allotment and the property of the city, on the west side toward the west and on the east side toward the east, and in length comparable to one of the portions, from the west border to the east border."
Ezekiel,45,8,"This shall be his land for a possession in Israel; so My princes shall no longer oppress My people, but they shall give the rest of the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.”"
Ezekiel,45,9,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Enough, you princes of Israel; put away violence and destruction, and practice justice and righteousness. Stop your expropriations from My people,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,45,10,"“You shall have just balances, a just ephah and a just bath."
Ezekiel,45,11,"The ephah and the bath shall be the same quantity, so that the bath will contain a tenth of a homer and the ephah a tenth of a homer; their standard shall be according to the homer."
Ezekiel,45,12,"The shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels shall be your maneh."
Ezekiel,45,13,“This is the offering that you shall offer: a sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat; a sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley;
Ezekiel,45,14,"and the prescribed portion of oil (namely, the bath of oil), a tenth of a bath from each kor (which is ten baths or a homer, for ten baths are a homer);"
Ezekiel,45,15,"and one sheep from each flock of two hundred from the watering places of Israel—for a grain offering, for a burnt offering and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,45,16,“All the people of the land shall give to this offering for the prince in Israel.
Ezekiel,45,17,"It shall be the prince’s part to provide the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the drink offerings, at the feasts, on the new moons and on the sabbaths, at all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel; he shall provide the sin offering, the grain offering, the burnt offering and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.”"
Ezekiel,45,18,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “In the first month, on the first of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish and cleanse the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,45,19,"The priest shall take some of the blood from the sin offering and put it on the door posts of the house, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar and on the posts of the gate of the inner court."
Ezekiel,45,20,Thus you shall do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who goes astray or is naive; so you shall make atonement for the house.
Ezekiel,45,21,"“In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten."
Ezekiel,45,22,On that day the prince shall provide for himself and all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering.
Ezekiel,45,23,"During the seven days of the feast he shall provide as a burnt offering to the LORD seven bulls and seven rams without blemish on every day of the seven days, and a male goat daily for a sin offering."
Ezekiel,45,24,"He shall provide as a grain offering an ephah with a bull, an ephah with a ram and a hin of oil with an ephah."
Ezekiel,45,25,"In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast, he shall provide like this, seven days for the sin offering, the burnt offering, the grain offering and the oil.”"
Ezekiel,46,1,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “The gate of the inner court facing east shall be shut the six working days; but it shall be opened on the sabbath day and opened on the day of the new moon."
Ezekiel,46,2,"The prince shall enter by way of the porch of the gate from outside and stand by the post of the gate. Then the priests shall provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate and then go out; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening."
Ezekiel,46,3,The people of the land shall also worship at the doorway of that gate before the LORD on the sabbaths and on the new moons.
Ezekiel,46,4,The burnt offering which the prince shall offer to the LORD on the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish;
Ezekiel,46,5,"and the grain offering shall be an ephah with the ram, and the grain offering with the lambs as much as he is able to give, and a hin of oil with an ephah."
Ezekiel,46,6,"On the day of the new moon he shall offer a young bull without blemish, also six lambs and a ram, which shall be without blemish."
Ezekiel,46,7,"And he shall provide a grain offering, an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he is able, and a hin of oil with an ephah."
Ezekiel,46,8,"When the prince enters, he shall go in by way of the porch of the gate and go out by the same way."
Ezekiel,46,9,"But when the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, he who enters by way of the north gate to worship shall go out by way of the south gate. And he who enters by way of the south gate shall go out by way of the north gate. No one shall return by way of the gate by which he entered but shall go straight out."
Ezekiel,46,10,"When they go in, the prince shall go in among them; and when they go out, he shall go out."
Ezekiel,46,11,"“At the festivals and the appointed feasts the grain offering shall be an ephah with a bull and an ephah with a ram, and with the lambs as much as one is able to give, and a hin of oil with an ephah."
Ezekiel,46,12,"When the prince provides a freewill offering, a burnt offering, or peace offerings as a freewill offering to the LORD, the gate facing east shall be opened for him. And he shall provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he does on the sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and the gate shall be shut after he goes out."
Ezekiel,46,13,“And you shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the LORD daily; morning by morning you shall provide it.
Ezekiel,46,14,"Also you shall provide a grain offering with it morning by morning, a sixth of an ephah and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour, a grain offering to the LORD continually by a perpetual ordinance."
Ezekiel,46,15,"Thus they shall provide the lamb, the grain offering and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering.”"
Ezekiel,46,16,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “If the prince gives a gift out of his inheritance to any of his sons, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance."
Ezekiel,46,17,"But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince. His inheritance shall be only his sons’; it shall belong to them."
Ezekiel,46,18,"The prince shall not take from the people’s inheritance, thrusting them out of their possession; he shall give his sons inheritance from his own possession so that My people will not be scattered, anyone from his possession.”’”"
Ezekiel,46,19,"Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which faced north; and behold, there was a place at the extreme rear toward the west."
Ezekiel,46,20,"He said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering and where they shall bake the grain offering, in order that they may not bring them out into the outer court to transmit holiness to the people.”"
Ezekiel,46,21,"Then he brought me out into the outer court and led me across to the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court there was a small court."
Ezekiel,46,22,"In the four corners of the court there were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty wide; these four in the corners were the same size."
Ezekiel,46,23,"There was a row of masonry round about in them, around the four of them, and boiling places were made under the rows round about."
Ezekiel,46,24,"Then he said to me, “These are the boiling places where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people.”"
Ezekiel,47,1,"Then he brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, water was flowing from under the threshold of the house toward the east, for the house faced east. And the water was flowing down from under, from the right side of the house, from south of the altar."
Ezekiel,47,2,"He brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate by way of the gate that faces east. And behold, water was trickling from the south side."
Ezekiel,47,3,"When the man went out toward the east with a line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he led me through the water, water reaching the ankles."
Ezekiel,47,4,"Again he measured a thousand and led me through the water, water reaching the knees. Again he measured a thousand and led me through the water, water reaching the loins."
Ezekiel,47,5,"Again he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not ford, for the water had risen, enough water to swim in, a river that could not be forded."
Ezekiel,47,6,"He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen this?” Then he brought me back to the bank of the river."
Ezekiel,47,7,"Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river there were very many trees on the one side and on the other."
Ezekiel,47,8,"Then he said to me, “These waters go out toward the eastern region and go down into the Arabah; then they go toward the sea, being made to flow into the sea, and the waters of the sea become fresh."
Ezekiel,47,9,"It will come about that every living creature which swarms in every place where the river goes, will live. And there will be very many fish, for these waters go there and the others become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes."
Ezekiel,47,10,"And it will come about that fishermen will stand beside it; from Engedi to Eneglaim there will be a place for the spreading of nets. Their fish will be according to their kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea, very many."
Ezekiel,47,11,But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt.
Ezekiel,47,12,"By the river on its bank, on one side and on the other, will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither and their fruit will not fail. They will bear every month because their water flows from the sanctuary, and their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing.”"
Ezekiel,47,13,"Thus says the Lord GOD, “This shall be the boundary by which you shall divide the land for an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel; Joseph shall have two portions."
Ezekiel,47,14,"You shall divide it for an inheritance, each one equally with the other; for I swore to give it to your forefathers, and this land shall fall to you as an inheritance."
Ezekiel,47,15,"“This shall be the boundary of the land: on the north side, from the Great Sea by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad;"
Ezekiel,47,16,"Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran."
Ezekiel,47,17,"The boundary shall extend from the sea to Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus, and on the north toward the north is the border of Hamath. This is the north side."
Ezekiel,47,18,"“The east side, from between Hauran, Damascus, Gilead and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the north border to the eastern sea you shall measure. This is the east side."
Ezekiel,47,19,"“The south side toward the south shall extend from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook of Egypt and to the Great Sea. This is the south side toward the south."
Ezekiel,47,20,"“The west side shall be the Great Sea, from the south border to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This is the west side."
Ezekiel,47,21,“So you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel,47,22,"You shall divide it by lot for an inheritance among yourselves and among the aliens who stay in your midst, who bring forth sons in your midst. And they shall be to you as the native-born among the sons of Israel; they shall be allotted an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel."
Ezekiel,47,23,"And in the tribe with which the alien stays, there you shall give him his inheritance,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,48,1,"“Now these are the names of the tribes: from the northern extremity, beside the way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, as far as Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus, toward the north beside Hamath, running from east to west, Dan, one portion."
Ezekiel,48,2,"Beside the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side, Asher, one portion."
Ezekiel,48,3,"Beside the border of Asher, from the east side to the west side, Naphtali, one portion."
Ezekiel,48,4,"Beside the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side, Manasseh, one portion."
Ezekiel,48,5,"Beside the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side, Ephraim, one portion."
Ezekiel,48,6,"Beside the border of Ephraim, from the east side to the west side, Reuben, one portion."
Ezekiel,48,7,"Beside the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west side, Judah, one portion."
Ezekiel,48,8,"“And beside the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the allotment which you shall set apart, 25,000 cubits in width, and in length like one of the portions, from the east side to the west side; and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it."
Ezekiel,48,9,"The allotment that you shall set apart to the LORD shall be 25,000 cubits in length and 10,000 in width."
Ezekiel,48,10,"The holy allotment shall be for these, namely for the priests, toward the north 25,000 cubits in length, toward the west 10,000 in width, toward the east 10,000 in width, and toward the south 25,000 in length; and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in its midst."
Ezekiel,48,11,"It shall be for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, who have kept My charge, who did not go astray when the sons of Israel went astray as the Levites went astray."
Ezekiel,48,12,"It shall be an allotment to them from the allotment of the land, a most holy place, by the border of the Levites."
Ezekiel,48,13,"Alongside the border of the priests the Levites shall have 25,000 cubits in length and 10,000 in width. The whole length shall be 25,000 cubits and the width 10,000."
Ezekiel,48,14,"Moreover, they shall not sell or exchange any of it, or alienate this choice portion of land; for it is holy to the LORD."
Ezekiel,48,15,"“The remainder, 5,000 cubits in width and 25,000 in length, shall be for common use for the city, for dwellings and for open spaces; and the city shall be in its midst."
Ezekiel,48,16,"These shall be its measurements: the north side 4,500 cubits, the south side 4,500 cubits, the east side 4,500 cubits, and the west side 4,500 cubits."
Ezekiel,48,17,"The city shall have open spaces: on the north 250 cubits, on the south 250 cubits, on the east 250 cubits, and on the west 250 cubits."
Ezekiel,48,18,"The remainder of the length alongside the holy allotment shall be 10,000 cubits toward the east and 10,000 toward the west; and it shall be alongside the holy allotment. And its produce shall be food for the workers of the city."
Ezekiel,48,19,"The workers of the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall cultivate it."
Ezekiel,48,20,"The whole allotment shall be 25,000 by 25,000 cubits; you shall set apart the holy allotment, a square, with the property of the city."
Ezekiel,48,21,"“The remainder shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy allotment and of the property of the city; in front of the 25,000 cubits of the allotment toward the east border and westward in front of the 25,000 toward the west border, alongside the portions, it shall be for the prince. And the holy allotment and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the middle of it."
Ezekiel,48,22,"Exclusive of the property of the Levites and the property of the city, which are in the middle of that which belongs to the prince, everything between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall be for the prince."
Ezekiel,48,23,"“As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west side, Benjamin, one portion."
Ezekiel,48,24,"Beside the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side, Simeon, one portion."
Ezekiel,48,25,"Beside the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, Issachar, one portion."
Ezekiel,48,26,"Beside the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side, Zebulun, one portion."
Ezekiel,48,27,"Beside the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side, Gad, one portion."
Ezekiel,48,28,"And beside the border of Gad, at the south side toward the south, the border shall be from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook of Egypt, to the Great Sea."
Ezekiel,48,29,"This is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for an inheritance, and these are their several portions,” declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,48,30,"“These are the exits of the city: on the north side, 4,500 cubits by measurement,"
Ezekiel,48,31,"shall be the gates of the city, named for the tribes of Israel, three gates toward the north: the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one."
Ezekiel,48,32,"On the east side, 4,500 cubits, shall be three gates: the gate of Joseph, one; the gate of Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one."
Ezekiel,48,33,"On the south side, 4,500 cubits by measurement, shall be three gates: the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one."
Ezekiel,48,34,"On the west side, 4,500 cubits, shall be three gates: the gate of Gad, one; the gate of Asher, one; the gate of Naphtali, one."
Ezekiel,48,35,"The city shall be 18,000 cubits round about; and the name of the city from that day shall be, ‘The LORD is there.’”"
Daniel,1,1,"In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it."
Daniel,1,2,"The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and he brought the vessels into the treasury of his god."
Daniel,1,3,"Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, the chief of his officials, to bring in some of the sons of Israel, including some of the royal family and of the nobles,"
Daniel,1,4,"youths in whom was no defect, who were good-looking, showing intelligence in every branch of wisdom, endowed with understanding and discerning knowledge, and who had ability for serving in the king’s court; and he ordered him to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans."
Daniel,1,5,"The king appointed for them a daily ration from the king’s choice food and from the wine which he drank, and appointed that they should be educated three years, at the end of which they were to enter the king’s personal service."
Daniel,1,6,"Now among them from the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah."
Daniel,1,7,"Then the commander of the officials assigned new names to them; and to Daniel he assigned the name Belteshazzar, to Hananiah Shadrach, to Mishael Meshach and to Azariah Abed-nego."
Daniel,1,8,But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the king’s choice food or with the wine which he drank; so he sought permission from the commander of the officials that he might not defile himself.
Daniel,1,9,"Now God granted Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the commander of the officials,"
Daniel,1,10,"and the commander of the officials said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces looking more haggard than the youths who are your own age? Then you would make me forfeit my head to the king.”"
Daniel,1,11,"But Daniel said to the overseer whom the commander of the officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah,"
Daniel,1,12,"“Please test your servants for ten days, and let us be given some vegetables to eat and water to drink."
Daniel,1,13,Then let our appearance be observed in your presence and the appearance of the youths who are eating the king’s choice food; and deal with your servants according to what you see.”
Daniel,1,14,So he listened to them in this matter and tested them for ten days.
Daniel,1,15,At the end of ten days their appearance seemed better and they were fatter than all the youths who had been eating the king’s choice food.
Daniel,1,16,"So the overseer continued to withhold their choice food and the wine they were to drink, and kept giving them vegetables."
Daniel,1,17,"As for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and intelligence in every branch of literature and wisdom; Daniel even understood all kinds of visions and dreams."
Daniel,1,18,"Then at the end of the days which the king had specified for presenting them, the commander of the officials presented them before Nebuchadnezzar."
Daniel,1,19,"The king talked with them, and out of them all not one was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king’s personal service."
Daniel,1,20,"As for every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king consulted them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and conjurers who were in all his realm."
Daniel,1,21,And Daniel continued until the first year of Cyrus the king.
Daniel,2,1,"Now in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him."
Daniel,2,2,"Then the king gave orders to call in the magicians, the conjurers, the sorcerers and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king."
Daniel,2,3,"The king said to them, “I had a dream and my spirit is anxious to understand the dream.”"
Daniel,2,4,"Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic: “O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants, and we will declare the interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,5,"The king replied to the Chaldeans, “The command from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb and your houses will be made a rubbish heap."
Daniel,2,6,"But if you declare the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts and a reward and great honor; therefore declare to me the dream and its interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,7,"They answered a second time and said, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will declare the interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,8,"The king replied, “I know for certain that you are bargaining for time, inasmuch as you have seen that the command from me is firm,"
Daniel,2,9,"that if you do not make the dream known to me, there is only one decree for you. For you have agreed together to speak lying and corrupt words before me until the situation is changed; therefore tell me the dream, that I may know that you can declare to me its interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth who could declare the matter for the king, inasmuch as no great king or ruler has ever asked anything like this of any magician, conjurer or Chaldean."
Daniel,2,11,"Moreover, the thing which the king demands is difficult, and there is no one else who could declare it to the king except gods, whose dwelling place is not with mortal flesh.”"
Daniel,2,12,Because of this the king became indignant and very furious and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel,2,13,So the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they looked for Daniel and his friends to kill them.
Daniel,2,14,"Then Daniel replied with discretion and discernment to Arioch, the captain of the king’s bodyguard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;"
Daniel,2,15,"he said to Arioch, the king’s commander, “For what reason is the decree from the king so urgent?” Then Arioch informed Daniel about the matter."
Daniel,2,16,"So Daniel went in and requested of the king that he would give him time, in order that he might declare the interpretation to the king."
Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house and informed his friends, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, about the matter,"
Daniel,2,18,"so that they might request compassion from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his friends would not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,19,Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven;
Daniel,2,20,"Daniel said, “Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever, For wisdom and power belong to Him."
Daniel,2,21,“It is He who changes the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes kings; He gives wisdom to wise men And knowledge to men of understanding.
Daniel,2,22,"“It is He who reveals the profound and hidden things; He knows what is in the darkness, And the light dwells with Him."
Daniel,2,23,"“To You, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise, For You have given me wisdom and power; Even now You have made known to me what we requested of You, For You have made known to us the king’s matter.”"
Daniel,2,24,"Therefore, Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and spoke to him as follows: “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon! Take me into the king’s presence, and I will declare the interpretation to the king.”"
Daniel,2,25,Then Arioch hurriedly brought Daniel into the king’s presence and spoke to him as follows: “I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can make the interpretation known to the king!”
Daniel,2,26,"The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen and its interpretation?”"
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel answered before the king and said, “As for the mystery about which the king has inquired, neither wise men, conjurers, magicians nor diviners are able to declare it to the king."
Daniel,2,28,"However, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will take place in the latter days. This was your dream and the visions in your mind while on your bed."
Daniel,2,29,"As for you, O king, while on your bed your thoughts turned to what would take place in the future; and He who reveals mysteries has made known to you what will take place."
Daniel,2,30,"But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me for any wisdom residing in me more than in any other living man, but for the purpose of making the interpretation known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind."
Daniel,2,31,"“You, O king, were looking and behold, there was a single great statue; that statue, which was large and of extraordinary splendor, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was awesome."
Daniel,2,32,"The head of that statue was made of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,"
Daniel,2,33,"its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay."
Daniel,2,34,"You continued looking until a stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and crushed them."
Daniel,2,35,"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were crushed all at the same time and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them was found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,“This was the dream; now we will tell its interpretation before the king.
Daniel,2,37,"You, O king, are the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength and the glory;"
Daniel,2,38,"and wherever the sons of men dwell, or the beasts of the field, or the birds of the sky, He has given them into your hand and has caused you to rule over them all. You are the head of gold."
Daniel,2,39,"After you there will arise another kingdom inferior to you, then another third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over all the earth."
Daniel,2,40,"Then there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron; inasmuch as iron crushes and shatters all things, so, like iron that breaks in pieces, it will crush and break all these in pieces."
Daniel,2,41,"In that you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but it will have in it the toughness of iron, inasmuch as you saw the iron mixed with common clay."
Daniel,2,42,"As the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of pottery, so some of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will be brittle."
Daniel,2,43,"And in that you saw the iron mixed with common clay, they will combine with one another in the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, even as iron does not combine with pottery."
Daniel,2,44,"In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, and that kingdom will not be left for another people; it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, but it will itself endure forever."
Daniel,2,45,"Inasmuch as you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what will take place in the future; so the dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy.”"
Daniel,2,46,"Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and did homage to Daniel, and gave orders to present to him an offering and fragrant incense."
Daniel,2,47,"The king answered Daniel and said, “Surely your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, since you have been able to reveal this mystery.”"
Daniel,2,48,"Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,49,"And Daniel made request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon, while Daniel was at the king’s court."
Daniel,3,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, the height of which was sixty cubits and its width six cubits; he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,3,2,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent word to assemble the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up."
Daniel,3,3,"Then the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces were assembled for the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
Daniel,3,4,"Then the herald loudly proclaimed: “To you the command is given, O peoples, nations and men of every language,"
Daniel,3,5,"that at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up."
Daniel,3,6,But whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.”
Daniel,3,7,"Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up."
Daniel,3,8,For this reason at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought charges against the Jews.
Daniel,3,9,"They responded and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king: “O king, live forever!"
Daniel,3,10,"You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe and all kinds of music, is to fall down and worship the golden image."
Daniel,3,11,But whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.
Daniel,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon, namely Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. These men, O king, have disregarded you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and anger gave orders to bring Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego; then these men were brought before the king."
Daniel,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar responded and said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up?"
Daniel,3,15,"Now if you are ready, at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery and bagpipe and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, very well. But if you do not worship, you will immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire; and what god is there who can deliver you out of my hands?”"
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego replied to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to give you an answer concerning this matter."
Daniel,3,17,"If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire; and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king."
Daniel,3,18,"But even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,19,"Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath, and his facial expression was altered toward Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. He answered by giving orders to heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated."
Daniel,3,20,"He commanded certain valiant warriors who were in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego in order to cast them into the furnace of blazing fire."
Daniel,3,21,"Then these men were tied up in their trousers, their coats, their caps and their other clothes, and were cast into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire."
Daniel,3,22,"For this reason, because the king’s command was urgent and the furnace had been made extremely hot, the flame of the fire slew those men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego."
Daniel,3,23,"But these three men, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, fell into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire still tied up."
Daniel,3,24,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astounded and stood up in haste; he said to his high officials, “Was it not three men we cast bound into the midst of the fire?” They replied to the king, “Certainly, O king.”"
Daniel,3,25,"He said, “Look! I see four men loosed and walking about in the midst of the fire without harm, and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods!”"
Daniel,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the furnace of blazing fire; he responded and said, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, come out, you servants of the Most High God, and come here!” Then Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego came out of the midst of the fire."
Daniel,3,27,"The satraps, the prefects, the governors and the king’s high officials gathered around and saw in regard to these men that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men nor was the hair of their head singed, nor were their trousers damaged, nor had the smell of fire even come upon them."
Daniel,3,28,"Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who put their trust in Him, violating the king’s command, and yielded up their bodies so as not to serve or worship any god except their own God."
Daniel,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation or tongue that speaks anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego shall be torn limb from limb and their houses reduced to a rubbish heap, inasmuch as there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way.”"
Daniel,3,30,"Then the king caused Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego to prosper in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,4,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples, nations, and men of every language that live in all the earth: “May your peace abound!"
Daniel,4,2,It has seemed good to me to declare the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me.
Daniel,4,3,“How great are His signs And how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom And His dominion is from generation to generation.
Daniel,4,4,"“I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace."
Daniel,4,5,I saw a dream and it made me fearful; and these fantasies as I lay on my bed and the visions in my mind kept alarming me.
Daniel,4,6,"So I gave orders to bring into my presence all the wise men of Babylon, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream."
Daniel,4,7,"Then the magicians, the conjurers, the Chaldeans and the diviners came in and I related the dream to them, but they could not make its interpretation known to me."
Daniel,4,8,"But finally Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar according to the name of my god, and in whom is a spirit of the holy gods; and I related the dream to him, saying,"
Daniel,4,9,"‘O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, since I know that a spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery baffles you, tell me the visions of my dream which I have seen, along with its interpretation."
Daniel,4,10,"‘Now these were the visions in my mind as I lay on my bed: I was looking, and behold, there was a tree in the midst of the earth and its height was great."
Daniel,4,11,"‘The tree grew large and became strong And its height reached to the sky, And it was visible to the end of the whole earth."
Daniel,4,12,"‘Its foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, And in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, And the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches, And all living creatures fed themselves from it."
Daniel,4,13,"‘I was looking in the visions in my mind as I lay on my bed, and behold, an angelic watcher, a holy one, descended from heaven."
Daniel,4,14,"‘He shouted out and spoke as follows: Chop down the tree and cut off its branches, Strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit; Let the beasts flee from under it And the birds from its branches."
Daniel,4,15,"“Yet leave the stump with its roots in the ground, But with a band of iron and bronze around it In the new grass of the field; And let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, And let him share with the beasts in the grass of the earth."
Daniel,4,16,"“Let his mind be changed from that of a man And let a beast’s mind be given to him, And let seven periods of time pass over him."
Daniel,4,17,"“This sentence is by the decree of the angelic watchers And the decision is a command of the holy ones, In order that the living may know That the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind, And bestows it on whom He wishes And sets over it the lowliest of men.”"
Daniel,4,18,"This is the dream which I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. Now you, Belteshazzar, tell me its interpretation, inasmuch as none of the wise men of my kingdom is able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able, for a spirit of the holy gods is in you.’"
Daniel,4,19,"“Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was appalled for a while as his thoughts alarmed him. The king responded and said, ‘Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation alarm you.’ Belteshazzar replied, ‘My lord, if only the dream applied to those who hate you and its interpretation to your adversaries!"
Daniel,4,20,"The tree that you saw, which became large and grew strong, whose height reached to the sky and was visible to all the earth"
Daniel,4,21,"and whose foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt and in whose branches the birds of the sky lodged—"
Daniel,4,22,"it is you, O king; for you have become great and grown strong, and your majesty has become great and reached to the sky and your dominion to the end of the earth."
Daniel,4,23,"In that the king saw an angelic watcher, a holy one, descending from heaven and saying, “Chop down the tree and destroy it; yet leave the stump with its roots in the ground, but with a band of iron and bronze around it in the new grass of the field, and let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him share with the beasts of the field until seven periods of time pass over him,”"
Daniel,4,24,"this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:"
Daniel,4,25,"that you be driven away from mankind and your dwelling place be with the beasts of the field, and you be given grass to eat like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven; and seven periods of time will pass over you, until you recognize that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever He wishes."
Daniel,4,26,"And in that it was commanded to leave the stump with the roots of the tree, your kingdom will be assured to you after you recognize that it is Heaven that rules."
Daniel,4,27,"Therefore, O king, may my advice be pleasing to you: break away now from your sins by doing righteousness and from your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor, in case there may be a prolonging of your prosperity.’"
Daniel,4,28,“All this happened to Nebuchadnezzar the king.
Daniel,4,29,Twelve months later he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon.
Daniel,4,30,"The king reflected and said, ‘Is this not Babylon the great, which I myself have built as a royal residence by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?’"
Daniel,4,31,"While the word was in the king’s mouth, a voice came from heaven, saying, ‘King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared: sovereignty has been removed from you,"
Daniel,4,32,"and you will be driven away from mankind, and your dwelling place will be with the beasts of the field. You will be given grass to eat like cattle, and seven periods of time will pass over you until you recognize that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever He wishes.’"
Daniel,4,33,"Immediately the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled; and he was driven away from mankind and began eating grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws."
Daniel,4,34,"“But at the end of that period, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High and praised and honored Him who lives forever; For His dominion is an everlasting dominion, And His kingdom endures from generation to generation."
Daniel,4,35,"“All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, But He does according to His will in the host of heaven And among the inhabitants of earth; And no one can ward off His hand Or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’"
Daniel,4,36,"At that time my reason returned to me. And my majesty and splendor were restored to me for the glory of my kingdom, and my counselors and my nobles began seeking me out; so I was reestablished in my sovereignty, and surpassing greatness was added to me."
Daniel,4,37,"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt and honor the King of heaven, for all His works are true and His ways just, and He is able to humble those who walk in pride.”"
Daniel,5,1,"Belshazzar the king held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles, and he was drinking wine in the presence of the thousand."
Daniel,5,2,"When Belshazzar tasted the wine, he gave orders to bring the gold and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them."
Daniel,5,3,"Then they brought the gold vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God which was in Jerusalem; and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them."
Daniel,5,4,"They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone."
Daniel,5,5,"Suddenly the fingers of a man’s hand emerged and began writing opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace, and the king saw the back of the hand that did the writing."
Daniel,5,6,"Then the king’s face grew pale and his thoughts alarmed him, and his hip joints went slack and his knees began knocking together."
Daniel,5,7,"The king called aloud to bring in the conjurers, the Chaldeans and the diviners. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, “Any man who can read this inscription and explain its interpretation to me shall be clothed with purple and have a necklace of gold around his neck, and have authority as third ruler in the kingdom.”"
Daniel,5,8,"Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the inscription or make known its interpretation to the king."
Daniel,5,9,"Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed, his face grew even paler, and his nobles were perplexed."
Daniel,5,10,"The queen entered the banquet hall because of the words of the king and his nobles; the queen spoke and said, “O king, live forever! Do not let your thoughts alarm you or your face be pale."
Daniel,5,11,"There is a man in your kingdom in whom is a spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father, illumination, insight and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him. And King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, your father the king, appointed him chief of the magicians, conjurers, Chaldeans and diviners."
Daniel,5,12,"This was because an extraordinary spirit, knowledge and insight, interpretation of dreams, explanation of enigmas and solving of difficult problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Let Daniel now be summoned and he will declare the interpretation.”"
Daniel,5,13,"Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Are you that Daniel who is one of the exiles from Judah, whom my father the king brought from Judah?"
Daniel,5,14,"Now I have heard about you that a spirit of the gods is in you, and that illumination, insight and extraordinary wisdom have been found in you."
Daniel,5,15,"Just now the wise men and the conjurers were brought in before me that they might read this inscription and make its interpretation known to me, but they could not declare the interpretation of the message."
Daniel,5,16,"But I personally have heard about you, that you are able to give interpretations and solve difficult problems. Now if you are able to read the inscription and make its interpretation known to me, you will be clothed with purple and wear a necklace of gold around your neck, and you will have authority as the third ruler in the kingdom.”"
Daniel,5,17,"Then Daniel answered and said before the king, “Keep your gifts for yourself or give your rewards to someone else; however, I will read the inscription to the king and make the interpretation known to him."
Daniel,5,18,"O king, the Most High God granted sovereignty, grandeur, glory and majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your father."
Daniel,5,19,"Because of the grandeur which He bestowed on him, all the peoples, nations and men of every language feared and trembled before him; whomever he wished he killed and whomever he wished he spared alive; and whomever he wished he elevated and whomever he wished he humbled."
Daniel,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became so proud that he behaved arrogantly, he was deposed from his royal throne and his glory was taken away from him."
Daniel,5,21,"He was also driven away from mankind, and his heart was made like that of beasts, and his dwelling place was with the wild donkeys. He was given grass to eat like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he recognized that the Most High God is ruler over the realm of mankind and that He sets over it whomever He wishes."
Daniel,5,22,"Yet you, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this,"
Daniel,5,23,"but you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines have been drinking wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which do not see, hear or understand. But the God in whose hand are your life-breath and all your ways, you have not glorified."
Daniel,5,24,Then the hand was sent from Him and this inscription was written out.
Daniel,5,25,"“Now this is the inscription that was written out: ‘MENĒ, MENĒ, TEKĒL, UPHARSIN.’"
Daniel,5,26,This is the interpretation of the message: ‘MENĒ’—God has numbered your kingdom and put an end to it.
Daniel,5,27,‘TEKĒL’—you have been weighed on the scales and found deficient.
Daniel,5,28,‘PERĒS’—your kingdom has been divided and given over to the Medes and Persians.”
Daniel,5,29,"Then Belshazzar gave orders, and they clothed Daniel with purple and put a necklace of gold around his neck, and issued a proclamation concerning him that he now had authority as the third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,30,That same night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain.
Daniel,5,31,So Darius the Mede received the kingdom at about the age of sixty-two.
Daniel,6,1,"It seemed good to Darius to appoint 120 satraps over the kingdom, that they would be in charge of the whole kingdom,"
Daniel,6,2,"and over them three commissioners (of whom Daniel was one), that these satraps might be accountable to them, and that the king might not suffer loss."
Daniel,6,3,"Then this Daniel began distinguishing himself among the commissioners and satraps because he possessed an extraordinary spirit, and the king planned to appoint him over the entire kingdom."
Daniel,6,4,"Then the commissioners and satraps began trying to find a ground of accusation against Daniel in regard to government affairs; but they could find no ground of accusation or evidence of corruption, inasmuch as he was faithful, and no negligence or corruption was to be found in him."
Daniel,6,5,"Then these men said, “We will not find any ground of accusation against this Daniel unless we find it against him with regard to the law of his God.”"
Daniel,6,6,"Then these commissioners and satraps came by agreement to the king and spoke to him as follows: “King Darius, live forever!"
Daniel,6,7,"All the commissioners of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the high officials and the governors have consulted together that the king should establish a statute and enforce an injunction that anyone who makes a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, for thirty days, shall be cast into the lions’ den."
Daniel,6,8,"Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document so that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked.”"
Daniel,6,9,"Therefore King Darius signed the document, that is, the injunction."
Daniel,6,10,"Now when Daniel knew that the document was signed, he entered his house (now in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem); and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and giving thanks before his God, as he had been doing previously."
Daniel,6,11,Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.
Daniel,6,12,"Then they approached and spoke before the king about the king’s injunction, “Did you not sign an injunction that any man who makes a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, for thirty days, is to be cast into the lions’ den?” The king replied, “The statement is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked.”"
Daniel,6,13,"Then they answered and spoke before the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the injunction which you signed, but keeps making his petition three times a day.”"
Daniel,6,14,"Then, as soon as the king heard this statement, he was deeply distressed and set his mind on delivering Daniel; and even until sunset he kept exerting himself to rescue him."
Daniel,6,15,"Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, “Recognize, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or statute which the king establishes may be changed.”"
Daniel,6,16,"Then the king gave orders, and Daniel was brought in and cast into the lions’ den. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Your God whom you constantly serve will Himself deliver you.”"
Daniel,6,17,"A stone was brought and laid over the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles, so that nothing would be changed in regard to Daniel."
Daniel,6,18,"Then the king went off to his palace and spent the night fasting, and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him."
Daniel,6,19,"Then the king arose at dawn, at the break of day, and went in haste to the lions’ den."
Daniel,6,20,"When he had come near the den to Daniel, he cried out with a troubled voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you constantly serve, been able to deliver you from the lions?”"
Daniel,6,21,"Then Daniel spoke to the king, “O king, live forever!"
Daniel,6,22,"My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths and they have not harmed me, inasmuch as I was found innocent before Him; and also toward you, O king, I have committed no crime.”"
Daniel,6,23,"Then the king was very pleased and gave orders for Daniel to be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no injury whatever was found on him, because he had trusted in his God."
Daniel,6,24,"The king then gave orders, and they brought those men who had maliciously accused Daniel, and they cast them, their children and their wives into the lions’ den; and they had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones."
Daniel,6,25,"Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, nations and men of every language who were living in all the land: “May your peace abound!"
Daniel,6,26,"I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men are to fear and tremble before the God of Daniel; For He is the living God and enduring forever, And His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed, And His dominion will be forever."
Daniel,6,27,"“He delivers and rescues and performs signs and wonders In heaven and on earth, Who has also delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.”"
Daniel,6,28,So this Daniel enjoyed success in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
Daniel,7,1,In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel saw a dream and visions in his mind as he lay on his bed; then he wrote the dream down and related the following summary of it.
Daniel,7,2,"Daniel said, “I was looking in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea."
Daniel,7,3,"And four great beasts were coming up from the sea, different from one another."
Daniel,7,4,"The first was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle. I kept looking until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man; a human mind also was given to it."
Daniel,7,5,"And behold, another beast, a second one, resembling a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and thus they said to it, ‘Arise, devour much meat!’"
Daniel,7,6,"After this I kept looking, and behold, another one, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it."
Daniel,7,7,"After this I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrifying and extremely strong; and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns."
Daniel,7,8,"While I was contemplating the horns, behold, another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth uttering great boasts."
Daniel,7,9,"“I kept looking Until thrones were set up, And the Ancient of Days took His seat; His vesture was like white snow And the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was ablaze with flames, Its wheels were a burning fire."
Daniel,7,10,"“A river of fire was flowing And coming out from before Him; Thousands upon thousands were attending Him, And myriads upon myriads were standing before Him; The court sat, And the books were opened."
Daniel,7,11,"Then I kept looking because of the sound of the boastful words which the horn was speaking; I kept looking until the beast was slain, and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire."
Daniel,7,12,"As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was granted to them for an appointed period of time."
Daniel,7,13,"“I kept looking in the night visions, And behold, with the clouds of heaven One like a Son of Man was coming, And He came up to the Ancient of Days And was presented before Him."
Daniel,7,14,"“And to Him was given dominion, Glory and a kingdom, That all the peoples, nations and men of every language Might serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion Which will not pass away; And His kingdom is one Which will not be destroyed."
Daniel,7,15,"“As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed within me, and the visions in my mind kept alarming me."
Daniel,7,16,I approached one of those who were standing by and began asking him the exact meaning of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things:
Daniel,7,17,"‘These great beasts, which are four in number, are four kings who will arise from the earth."
Daniel,7,18,"But the saints of the Highest One will receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, for all ages to come.’"
Daniel,7,19,"“Then I desired to know the exact meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, with its teeth of iron and its claws of bronze, and which devoured, crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet,"
Daniel,7,20,"and the meaning of the ten horns that were on its head and the other horn which came up, and before which three of them fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth uttering great boasts and which was larger in appearance than its associates."
Daniel,7,21,"I kept looking, and that horn was waging war with the saints and overpowering them"
Daniel,7,22,"until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was passed in favor of the saints of the Highest One, and the time arrived when the saints took possession of the kingdom."
Daniel,7,23,"“Thus he said: ‘The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, which will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth and tread it down and crush it."
Daniel,7,24,"As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them, and he will be different from the previous ones and will subdue three kings."
Daniel,7,25,"He will speak out against the Most High and wear down the saints of the Highest One, and he will intend to make alterations in times and in law; and they will be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time."
Daniel,7,26,"But the court will sit for judgment, and his dominion will be taken away, annihilated and destroyed forever."
Daniel,7,27,"Then the sovereignty, the dominion and the greatness of all the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Highest One; His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all the dominions will serve and obey Him.’"
Daniel,7,28,"“At this point the revelation ended. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts were greatly alarming me and my face grew pale, but I kept the matter to myself.”"
Daniel,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king a vision appeared to me, Daniel, subsequent to the one which appeared to me previously."
Daniel,8,2,"I looked in the vision, and while I was looking I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam; and I looked in the vision and I myself was beside the Ulai Canal."
Daniel,8,3,"Then I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, a ram which had two horns was standing in front of the canal. Now the two horns were long, but one was longer than the other, with the longer one coming up last."
Daniel,8,4,"I saw the ram butting westward, northward, and southward, and no other beasts could stand before him nor was there anyone to rescue from his power, but he did as he pleased and magnified himself."
Daniel,8,5,"While I was observing, behold, a male goat was coming from the west over the surface of the whole earth without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes."
Daniel,8,6,"He came up to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing in front of the canal, and rushed at him in his mighty wrath."
Daniel,8,7,"I saw him come beside the ram, and he was enraged at him; and he struck the ram and shattered his two horns, and the ram had no strength to withstand him. So he hurled him to the ground and trampled on him, and there was none to rescue the ram from his power."
Daniel,8,8,"Then the male goat magnified himself exceedingly. But as soon as he was mighty, the large horn was broken; and in its place there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven."
Daniel,8,9,"Out of one of them came forth a rather small horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Beautiful Land."
Daniel,8,10,"It grew up to the host of heaven and caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it trampled them down."
Daniel,8,11,"It even magnified itself to be equal with the Commander of the host; and it removed the regular sacrifice from Him, and the place of His sanctuary was thrown down."
Daniel,8,12,And on account of transgression the host will be given over to the horn along with the regular sacrifice; and it will fling truth to the ground and perform its will and prosper.
Daniel,8,13,"Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to that particular one who was speaking, “How long will the vision about the regular sacrifice apply, while the transgression causes horror, so as to allow both the holy place and the host to be trampled?”"
Daniel,8,14,"He said to me, “For 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the holy place will be properly restored.”"
Daniel,8,15,"When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; and behold, standing before me was one who looked like a man."
Daniel,8,16,"And I heard the voice of a man between the banks of Ulai, and he called out and said, “Gabriel, give this man an understanding of the vision.”"
Daniel,8,17,"So he came near to where I was standing, and when he came I was frightened and fell on my face; but he said to me, “Son of man, understand that the vision pertains to the time of the end.”"
Daniel,8,18,"Now while he was talking with me, I sank into a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me and made me stand upright."
Daniel,8,19,"He said, “Behold, I am going to let you know what will occur at the final period of the indignation, for it pertains to the appointed time of the end."
Daniel,8,20,The ram which you saw with the two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia.
Daniel,8,21,"The shaggy goat represents the kingdom of Greece, and the large horn that is between his eyes is the first king."
Daniel,8,22,"The broken horn and the four horns that arose in its place represent four kingdoms which will arise from his nation, although not with his power."
Daniel,8,23,"“In the latter period of their rule, When the transgressors have run their course, A king will arise, Insolent and skilled in intrigue."
Daniel,8,24,"“His power will be mighty, but not by his own power, And he will destroy to an extraordinary degree And prosper and perform his will; He will destroy mighty men and the holy people."
Daniel,8,25,"“And through his shrewdness He will cause deceit to succeed by his influence; And he will magnify himself in his heart, And he will destroy many while they are at ease. He will even oppose the Prince of princes, But he will be broken without human agency."
Daniel,8,26,"“The vision of the evenings and mornings Which has been told is true; But keep the vision secret, For it pertains to many days in the future.”"
Daniel,8,27,"Then I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick for days. Then I got up again and carried on the king’s business; but I was astounded at the vision, and there was none to explain it."
Daniel,9,1,"In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of Median descent, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans—"
Daniel,9,2,"in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, observed in the books the number of the years which was revealed as the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet for the completion of the desolations of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years."
Daniel,9,3,"So I gave my attention to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth and ashes."
Daniel,9,4,"I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed and said, “Alas, O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments,"
Daniel,9,5,"we have sinned, committed iniquity, acted wickedly and rebelled, even turning aside from Your commandments and ordinances."
Daniel,9,6,"Moreover, we have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our princes, our fathers and all the people of the land."
Daniel,9,7,"“Righteousness belongs to You, O Lord, but to us open shame, as it is this day—to the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, those who are nearby and those who are far away in all the countries to which You have driven them, because of their unfaithful deeds which they have committed against You."
Daniel,9,8,"Open shame belongs to us, O Lord, to our kings, our princes and our fathers, because we have sinned against You."
Daniel,9,9,"To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against Him;"
Daniel,9,10,"nor have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in His teachings which He set before us through His servants the prophets."
Daniel,9,11,"Indeed all Israel has transgressed Your law and turned aside, not obeying Your voice; so the curse has been poured out on us, along with the oath which is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we have sinned against Him."
Daniel,9,12,"Thus He has confirmed His words which He had spoken against us and against our rulers who ruled us, to bring on us great calamity; for under the whole heaven there has not been done anything like what was done to Jerusalem."
Daniel,9,13,"As it is written in the law of Moses, all this calamity has come on us; yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our iniquity and giving attention to Your truth."
Daniel,9,14,"Therefore the LORD has kept the calamity in store and brought it on us; for the LORD our God is righteous with respect to all His deeds which He has done, but we have not obeyed His voice."
Daniel,9,15,"“And now, O Lord our God, who have brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and have made a name for Yourself, as it is this day—we have sinned, we have been wicked."
Daniel,9,16,"O Lord, in accordance with all Your righteous acts, let now Your anger and Your wrath turn away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people have become a reproach to all those around us."
Daniel,9,17,"So now, our God, listen to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplications, and for Your sake, O Lord, let Your face shine on Your desolate sanctuary."
Daniel,9,18,"O my God, incline Your ear and hear! Open Your eyes and see our desolations and the city which is called by Your name; for we are not presenting our supplications before You on account of any merits of our own, but on account of Your great compassion."
Daniel,9,19,"O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and take action! For Your own sake, O my God, do not delay, because Your city and Your people are called by Your name.”"
Daniel,9,20,"Now while I was speaking and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God in behalf of the holy mountain of my God,"
Daniel,9,21,"while I was still speaking in prayer, then the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision previously, came to me in my extreme weariness about the time of the evening offering."
Daniel,9,22,"He gave me instruction and talked with me and said, “O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you insight with understanding."
Daniel,9,23,"At the beginning of your supplications the command was issued, and I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed; so give heed to the message and gain understanding of the vision."
Daniel,9,24,"“Seventy weeks have been decreed for your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sin, to make atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy place."
Daniel,9,25,"So you are to know and discern that from the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; it will be built again, with plaza and moat, even in times of distress."
Daniel,9,26,"Then after the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be cut off and have nothing, and the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end will come with a flood; even to the end there will be war; desolations are determined."
Daniel,9,27,"And he will make a firm covenant with the many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations will come one who makes desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, is poured out on the one who makes desolate.”"
Daniel,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar; and the message was true and one of great conflict, but he understood the message and had an understanding of the vision."
Daniel,10,2,"In those days, I, Daniel, had been mourning for three entire weeks."
Daniel,10,3,"I did not eat any tasty food, nor did meat or wine enter my mouth, nor did I use any ointment at all until the entire three weeks were completed."
Daniel,10,4,"On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, while I was by the bank of the great river, that is, the Tigris,"
Daniel,10,5,"I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a certain man dressed in linen, whose waist was girded with a belt of pure gold of Uphaz."
Daniel,10,6,"His body also was like beryl, his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and feet like the gleam of polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a tumult."
Daniel,10,7,"Now I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, while the men who were with me did not see the vision; nevertheless, a great dread fell on them, and they ran away to hide themselves."
Daniel,10,8,"So I was left alone and saw this great vision; yet no strength was left in me, for my natural color turned to a deathly pallor, and I retained no strength."
Daniel,10,9,"But I heard the sound of his words; and as soon as I heard the sound of his words, I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground."
Daniel,10,10,"Then behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees."
Daniel,10,11,"He said to me, “O Daniel, man of high esteem, understand the words that I am about to tell you and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you.” And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling."
Daniel,10,12,"Then he said to me, “Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding this and on humbling yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to your words."
Daniel,10,13,"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia was withstanding me for twenty-one days; then behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia."
Daniel,10,14,"Now I have come to give you an understanding of what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision pertains to the days yet future.”"
Daniel,10,15,"When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and became speechless."
Daniel,10,16,"And behold, one who resembled a human being was touching my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who was standing before me, “O my lord, as a result of the vision anguish has come upon me, and I have retained no strength."
Daniel,10,17,"For how can such a servant of my lord talk with such as my lord? As for me, there remains just now no strength in me, nor has any breath been left in me.”"
Daniel,10,18,Then this one with human appearance touched me again and strengthened me.
Daniel,10,19,"He said, “O man of high esteem, do not be afraid. Peace be with you; take courage and be courageous!” Now as soon as he spoke to me, I received strength and said, “May my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”"
Daniel,10,20,"Then he said, “Do you understand why I came to you? But I shall now return to fight against the prince of Persia; so I am going forth, and behold, the prince of Greece is about to come."
Daniel,10,21,"However, I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth. Yet there is no one who stands firmly with me against these forces except Michael your prince."
Daniel,11,1,"“In the first year of Darius the Mede, I arose to be an encouragement and a protection for him."
Daniel,11,2,"And now I will tell you the truth. Behold, three more kings are going to arise in Persia. Then a fourth will gain far more riches than all of them; as soon as he becomes strong through his riches, he will arouse the whole empire against the realm of Greece."
Daniel,11,3,"And a mighty king will arise, and he will rule with great authority and do as he pleases."
Daniel,11,4,"But as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom will be broken up and parceled out toward the four points of the compass, though not to his own descendants, nor according to his authority which he wielded, for his sovereignty will be uprooted and given to others besides them."
Daniel,11,5,"“Then the king of the South will grow strong, along with one of his princes who will gain ascendancy over him and obtain dominion; his domain will be a great dominion indeed."
Daniel,11,6,"After some years they will form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will come to the king of the North to carry out a peaceful arrangement. But she will not retain her position of power, nor will he remain with his power, but she will be given up, along with those who brought her in and the one who sired her as well as he who supported her in those times."
Daniel,11,7,"But one of the descendants of her line will arise in his place, and he will come against their army and enter the fortress of the king of the North, and he will deal with them and display great strength."
Daniel,11,8,"Also their gods with their metal images and their precious vessels of silver and gold he will take into captivity to Egypt, and he on his part will refrain from attacking the king of the North for some years."
Daniel,11,9,"Then the latter will enter the realm of the king of the South, but will return to his own land."
Daniel,11,10,"“His sons will mobilize and assemble a multitude of great forces; and one of them will keep on coming and overflow and pass through, that he may again wage war up to his very fortress."
Daniel,11,11,"The king of the South will be enraged and go forth and fight with the king of the North. Then the latter will raise a great multitude, but that multitude will be given into the hand of the former."
Daniel,11,12,"When the multitude is carried away, his heart will be lifted up, and he will cause tens of thousands to fall; yet he will not prevail."
Daniel,11,13,"For the king of the North will again raise a greater multitude than the former, and after an interval of some years he will press on with a great army and much equipment."
Daniel,11,14,"“Now in those times many will rise up against the king of the South; the violent ones among your people will also lift themselves up in order to fulfill the vision, but they will fall down."
Daniel,11,15,"Then the king of the North will come, cast up a siege ramp and capture a well-fortified city; and the forces of the South will not stand their ground, not even their choicest troops, for there will be no strength to make a stand."
Daniel,11,16,"But he who comes against him will do as he pleases, and no one will be able to withstand him; he will also stay for a time in the Beautiful Land, with destruction in his hand."
Daniel,11,17,"He will set his face to come with the power of his whole kingdom, bringing with him a proposal of peace which he will put into effect; he will also give him the daughter of women to ruin it. But she will not take a stand for him or be on his side."
Daniel,11,18,"Then he will turn his face to the coastlands and capture many. But a commander will put a stop to his scorn against him; moreover, he will repay him for his scorn."
Daniel,11,19,"So he will turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall and be found no more."
Daniel,11,20,"“Then in his place one will arise who will send an oppressor through the Jewel of his kingdom; yet within a few days he will be shattered, though not in anger nor in battle."
Daniel,11,21,"In his place a despicable person will arise, on whom the honor of kingship has not been conferred, but he will come in a time of tranquility and seize the kingdom by intrigue."
Daniel,11,22,"The overflowing forces will be flooded away before him and shattered, and also the prince of the covenant."
Daniel,11,23,"After an alliance is made with him he will practice deception, and he will go up and gain power with a small force of people."
Daniel,11,24,"In a time of tranquility he will enter the richest parts of the realm, and he will accomplish what his fathers never did, nor his ancestors; he will distribute plunder, booty and possessions among them, and he will devise his schemes against strongholds, but only for a time."
Daniel,11,25,"He will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South with a large army; so the king of the South will mobilize an extremely large and mighty army for war; but he will not stand, for schemes will be devised against him."
Daniel,11,26,"Those who eat his choice food will destroy him, and his army will overflow, but many will fall down slain."
Daniel,11,27,"As for both kings, their hearts will be intent on evil, and they will speak lies to each other at the same table; but it will not succeed, for the end is still to come at the appointed time."
Daniel,11,28,"Then he will return to his land with much plunder; but his heart will be set against the holy covenant, and he will take action and then return to his own land."
Daniel,11,29,"“At the appointed time he will return and come into the South, but this last time it will not turn out the way it did before."
Daniel,11,30,For ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be disheartened and will return and become enraged at the holy covenant and take action; so he will come back and show regard for those who forsake the holy covenant.
Daniel,11,31,"Forces from him will arise, desecrate the sanctuary fortress, and do away with the regular sacrifice. And they will set up the abomination of desolation."
Daniel,11,32,"By smooth words he will turn to godlessness those who act wickedly toward the covenant, but the people who know their God will display strength and take action."
Daniel,11,33,"Those who have insight among the people will give understanding to the many; yet they will fall by sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder for many days."
Daniel,11,34,"Now when they fall they will be granted a little help, and many will join with them in hypocrisy."
Daniel,11,35,"Some of those who have insight will fall, in order to refine, purge and make them pure until the end time; because it is still to come at the appointed time."
Daniel,11,36,"“Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will speak monstrous things against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation is finished, for that which is decreed will be done."
Daniel,11,37,"He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any other god; for he will magnify himself above them all."
Daniel,11,38,"But instead he will honor a god of fortresses, a god whom his fathers did not know; he will honor him with gold, silver, costly stones and treasures."
Daniel,11,39,"He will take action against the strongest of fortresses with the help of a foreign god; he will give great honor to those who acknowledge him and will cause them to rule over the many, and will parcel out land for a price."
Daniel,11,40,"“At the end time the king of the South will collide with him, and the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, with horsemen and with many ships; and he will enter countries, overflow them and pass through."
Daniel,11,41,"He will also enter the Beautiful Land, and many countries will fall; but these will be rescued out of his hand: Edom, Moab and the foremost of the sons of Ammon."
Daniel,11,42,"Then he will stretch out his hand against other countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape."
Daniel,11,43,But he will gain control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the precious things of Egypt; and Libyans and Ethiopians will follow at his heels.
Daniel,11,44,"But rumors from the East and from the North will disturb him, and he will go forth with great wrath to destroy and annihilate many."
Daniel,11,45,"He will pitch the tents of his royal pavilion between the seas and the beautiful Holy Mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him."
Daniel,12,1,"“Now at that time Michael, the great prince who stands guard over the sons of your people, will arise. And there will be a time of distress such as never occurred since there was a nation until that time; and at that time your people, everyone who is found written in the book, will be rescued."
Daniel,12,2,"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt."
Daniel,12,3,"Those who have insight will shine brightly like the brightness of the expanse of heaven, and those who lead the many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever."
Daniel,12,4,"But as for you, Daniel, conceal these words and seal up the book until the end of time; many will go back and forth, and knowledge will increase.”"
Daniel,12,5,"Then I, Daniel, looked and behold, two others were standing, one on this bank of the river and the other on that bank of the river."
Daniel,12,6,"And one said to the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long will it be until the end of these wonders?”"
Daniel,12,7,"I heard the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, as he raised his right hand and his left toward heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time; and as soon as they finish shattering the power of the holy people, all these events will be completed."
Daniel,12,8,"As for me, I heard but could not understand; so I said, “My lord, what will be the outcome of these events?”"
Daniel,12,9,"He said, “Go your way, Daniel, for these words are concealed and sealed up until the end time."
Daniel,12,10,"Many will be purged, purified and refined, but the wicked will act wickedly; and none of the wicked will understand, but those who have insight will understand."
Daniel,12,11,"From the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished and the abomination of desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days."
Daniel,12,12,"How blessed is he who keeps waiting and attains to the 1,335 days!"
Daniel,12,13,"But as for you, go your way to the end; then you will enter into rest and rise again for your allotted portion at the end of the age.”"
Hosea,1,1,"The word of the LORD which came to Hosea the son of Beeri, during the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel."
Hosea,1,2,"When the LORD first spoke through Hosea, the LORD said to Hosea, “Go, take to yourself a wife of harlotry and have children of harlotry; for the land commits flagrant harlotry, forsaking the LORD.”"
Hosea,1,3,"So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son."
Hosea,1,4,"And the LORD said to him, “Name him Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel."
Hosea,1,5,On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.”
Hosea,1,6,"Then she conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. And the LORD said to him, “Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel, that I would ever forgive them."
Hosea,1,7,"But I will have compassion on the house of Judah and deliver them by the LORD their God, and will not deliver them by bow, sword, battle, horses or horsemen.”"
Hosea,1,8,"When she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and gave birth to a son."
Hosea,1,9,"And the LORD said, “Name him Lo-ammi, for you are not My people and I am not your God.”"
Hosea,1,10,"Yet the number of the sons of Israel Will be like the sand of the sea, Which cannot be measured or numbered; And in the place Where it is said to them, “You are not My people,” It will be said to them, “You are the sons of the living God.”"
Hosea,1,11,"And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel will be gathered together, And they will appoint for themselves one leader, And they will go up from the land, For great will be the day of Jezreel."
Hosea,2,1,"Say to your brothers, “Ammi,” and to your sisters, “Ruhamah.”"
Hosea,2,2,"“Contend with your mother, contend, For she is not my wife, and I am not her husband; And let her put away her harlotry from her face And her adultery from between her breasts,"
Hosea,2,3,"Or I will strip her naked And expose her as on the day when she was born. I will also make her like a wilderness, Make her like desert land And slay her with thirst."
Hosea,2,4,"“Also, I will have no compassion on her children, Because they are children of harlotry."
Hosea,2,5,"“For their mother has played the harlot; She who conceived them has acted shamefully. For she said, ‘I will go after my lovers, Who give me my bread and my water, My wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.’"
Hosea,2,6,"“Therefore, behold, I will hedge up her way with thorns, And I will build a wall against her so that she cannot find her paths."
Hosea,2,7,"“She will pursue her lovers, but she will not overtake them; And she will seek them, but will not find them. Then she will say, ‘I will go back to my first husband, For it was better for me then than now!’"
Hosea,2,8,"“For she does not know that it was I who gave her the grain, the new wine and the oil, And lavished on her silver and gold, Which they used for Baal."
Hosea,2,9,"“Therefore, I will take back My grain at harvest time And My new wine in its season. I will also take away My wool and My flax Given to cover her nakedness."
Hosea,2,10,"“And then I will uncover her lewdness In the sight of her lovers, And no one will rescue her out of My hand."
Hosea,2,11,"“I will also put an end to all her gaiety, Her feasts, her new moons, her sabbaths And all her festal assemblies."
Hosea,2,12,"“I will destroy her vines and fig trees, Of which she said, ‘These are my wages Which my lovers have given me.’ And I will make them a forest, And the beasts of the field will devour them."
Hosea,2,13,"“I will punish her for the days of the Baals When she used to offer sacrifices to them And adorn herself with her earrings and jewelry, And follow her lovers, so that she forgot Me,” declares the LORD."
Hosea,2,14,"“Therefore, behold, I will allure her, Bring her into the wilderness And speak kindly to her."
Hosea,2,15,"“Then I will give her her vineyards from there, And the valley of Achor as a door of hope. And she will sing there as in the days of her youth, As in the day when she came up from the land of Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"“It will come about in that day,” declares the LORD, “That you will call Me Ishi And will no longer call Me Baali."
Hosea,2,17,"“For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, So that they will be mentioned by their names no more."
Hosea,2,18,"“In that day I will also make a covenant for them With the beasts of the field, The birds of the sky And the creeping things of the ground. And I will abolish the bow, the sword and war from the land, And will make them lie down in safety."
Hosea,2,19,"“I will betroth you to Me forever; Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice, In lovingkindness and in compassion,"
Hosea,2,20,And I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness. Then you will know the LORD.
Hosea,2,21,"“It will come about in that day that I will respond,” declares the LORD. “I will respond to the heavens, and they will respond to the earth,"
Hosea,2,22,"And the earth will respond to the grain, to the new wine and to the oil, And they will respond to Jezreel."
Hosea,2,23,"“I will sow her for Myself in the land. I will also have compassion on her who had not obtained compassion, And I will say to those who were not My people, ‘You are My people!’ And they will say, ‘You are my God!’”"
Hosea,3,1,"Then the LORD said to me, “Go again, love a woman who is loved by her husband, yet an adulteress, even as the LORD loves the sons of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes.”"
Hosea,3,2,So I bought her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a half of barley.
Hosea,3,3,"Then I said to her, “You shall stay with me for many days. You shall not play the harlot, nor shall you have a man; so I will also be toward you.”"
Hosea,3,4,"For the sons of Israel will remain for many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred pillar and without ephod or household idols."
Hosea,3,5,Afterward the sons of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king; and they will come trembling to the LORD and to His goodness in the last days.
Hosea,4,1,"Listen to the word of the LORD, O sons of Israel, For the LORD has a case against the inhabitants of the land, Because there is no faithfulness or kindness Or knowledge of God in the land."
Hosea,4,2,"There is swearing, deception, murder, stealing and adultery. They employ violence, so that bloodshed follows bloodshed."
Hosea,4,3,"Therefore the land mourns, And everyone who lives in it languishes Along with the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky, And also the fish of the sea disappear."
Hosea,4,4,"Yet let no one find fault, and let none offer reproof; For your people are like those who contend with the priest."
Hosea,4,5,"So you will stumble by day, And the prophet also will stumble with you by night; And I will destroy your mother."
Hosea,4,6,"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from being My priest. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children."
Hosea,4,7,"The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into shame."
Hosea,4,8,They feed on the sin of My people And direct their desire toward their iniquity.
Hosea,4,9,"And it will be, like people, like priest; So I will punish them for their ways And repay them for their deeds."
Hosea,4,10,"They will eat, but not have enough; They will play the harlot, but not increase, Because they have stopped giving heed to the LORD."
Hosea,4,11,"Harlotry, wine and new wine take away the understanding."
Hosea,4,12,"My people consult their wooden idol, and their diviner’s wand informs them; For a spirit of harlotry has led them astray, And they have played the harlot, departing from their God."
Hosea,4,13,"They offer sacrifices on the tops of the mountains And burn incense on the hills, Under oak, poplar and terebinth, Because their shade is pleasant. Therefore your daughters play the harlot And your brides commit adultery."
Hosea,4,14,"I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot Or your brides when they commit adultery, For the men themselves go apart with harlots And offer sacrifices with temple prostitutes; So the people without understanding are ruined."
Hosea,4,15,"Though you, Israel, play the harlot, Do not let Judah become guilty; Also do not go to Gilgal, Or go up to Beth-aven And take the oath: “As the LORD lives!”"
Hosea,4,16,"Since Israel is stubborn Like a stubborn heifer, Can the LORD now pasture them Like a lamb in a large field?"
Hosea,4,17,Ephraim is joined to idols; Let him alone.
Hosea,4,18,"Their liquor gone, They play the harlot continually; Their rulers dearly love shame."
Hosea,4,19,"The wind wraps them in its wings, And they will be ashamed because of their sacrifices."
Hosea,5,1,"Hear this, O priests! Give heed, O house of Israel! Listen, O house of the king! For the judgment applies to you, For you have been a snare at Mizpah And a net spread out on Tabor."
Hosea,5,2,"The revolters have gone deep in depravity, But I will chastise all of them."
Hosea,5,3,"I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from Me; For now, O Ephraim, you have played the harlot, Israel has defiled itself."
Hosea,5,4,"Their deeds will not allow them To return to their God. For a spirit of harlotry is within them, And they do not know the LORD."
Hosea,5,5,"Moreover, the pride of Israel testifies against him, And Israel and Ephraim stumble in their iniquity; Judah also has stumbled with them."
Hosea,5,6,"They will go with their flocks and herds To seek the LORD, but they will not find Him; He has withdrawn from them."
Hosea,5,7,"They have dealt treacherously against the LORD, For they have borne illegitimate children. Now the new moon will devour them with their land."
Hosea,5,8,"Blow the horn in Gibeah, The trumpet in Ramah. Sound an alarm at Beth-aven: “Behind you, Benjamin!”"
Hosea,5,9,Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke; Among the tribes of Israel I declare what is sure.
Hosea,5,10,The princes of Judah have become like those who move a boundary; On them I will pour out My wrath like water.
Hosea,5,11,"Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, Because he was determined to follow man’s command."
Hosea,5,12,Therefore I am like a moth to Ephraim And like rottenness to the house of Judah.
Hosea,5,13,"When Ephraim saw his sickness, And Judah his wound, Then Ephraim went to Assyria And sent to King Jareb. But he is unable to heal you, Or to cure you of your wound."
Hosea,5,14,"For I will be like a lion to Ephraim And like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear to pieces and go away, I will carry away, and there will be none to deliver."
Hosea,5,15,I will go away and return to My place Until they acknowledge their guilt and seek My face; In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me.
Hosea,6,1,"“Come, let us return to the LORD. For He has torn us, but He will heal us; He has wounded us, but He will bandage us."
Hosea,6,2,"“He will revive us after two days; He will raise us up on the third day, That we may live before Him."
Hosea,6,3,"“So let us know, let us press on to know the LORD. His going forth is as certain as the dawn; And He will come to us like the rain, Like the spring rain watering the earth.”"
Hosea,6,4,"What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? For your loyalty is like a morning cloud And like the dew which goes away early."
Hosea,6,5,Therefore I have hewn them in pieces by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth; And the judgments on you are like the light that goes forth.
Hosea,6,6,"For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice, And in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings."
Hosea,6,7,But like Adam they have transgressed the covenant; There they have dealt treacherously against Me.
Hosea,6,8,"Gilead is a city of wrongdoers, Tracked with bloody footprints."
Hosea,6,9,"And as raiders wait for a man, So a band of priests murder on the way to Shechem; Surely they have committed crime."
Hosea,6,10,"In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim’s harlotry is there, Israel has defiled itself."
Hosea,6,11,"Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, When I restore the fortunes of My people."
Hosea,7,1,"When I would heal Israel, The iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered, And the evil deeds of Samaria, For they deal falsely; The thief enters in, Bandits raid outside,"
Hosea,7,2,And they do not consider in their hearts That I remember all their wickedness. Now their deeds are all around them; They are before My face.
Hosea,7,3,"With their wickedness they make the king glad, And the princes with their lies."
Hosea,7,4,"They are all adulterers, Like an oven heated by the baker Who ceases to stir up the fire From the kneading of the dough until it is leavened."
Hosea,7,5,"On the day of our king, the princes became sick with the heat of wine; He stretched out his hand with scoffers,"
Hosea,7,6,"For their hearts are like an oven As they approach their plotting; Their anger smolders all night, In the morning it burns like a flaming fire."
Hosea,7,7,"All of them are hot like an oven, And they consume their rulers; All their kings have fallen. None of them calls on Me."
Hosea,7,8,Ephraim mixes himself with the nations; Ephraim has become a cake not turned.
Hosea,7,9,"Strangers devour his strength, Yet he does not know it; Gray hairs also are sprinkled on him, Yet he does not know it."
Hosea,7,10,"Though the pride of Israel testifies against him, Yet they have not returned to the LORD their God, Nor have they sought Him, for all this."
Hosea,7,11,"So Ephraim has become like a silly dove, without sense; They call to Egypt, they go to Assyria."
Hosea,7,12,"When they go, I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like the birds of the sky. I will chastise them in accordance with the proclamation to their assembly."
Hosea,7,13,"Woe to them, for they have strayed from Me! Destruction is theirs, for they have rebelled against Me! I would redeem them, but they speak lies against Me."
Hosea,7,14,"And they do not cry to Me from their heart When they wail on their beds; For the sake of grain and new wine they assemble themselves, They turn away from Me."
Hosea,7,15,"Although I trained and strengthened their arms, Yet they devise evil against Me."
Hosea,7,16,"They turn, but not upward, They are like a deceitful bow; Their princes will fall by the sword Because of the insolence of their tongue. This will be their derision in the land of Egypt."
Hosea,8,1,"Put the trumpet to your lips! Like an eagle the enemy comes against the house of the LORD, Because they have transgressed My covenant And rebelled against My law."
Hosea,8,2,"They cry out to Me, “My God, we of Israel know You!”"
Hosea,8,3,Israel has rejected the good; The enemy will pursue him.
Hosea,8,4,"They have set up kings, but not by Me; They have appointed princes, but I did not know it. With their silver and gold they have made idols for themselves, That they might be cut off."
Hosea,8,5,"He has rejected your calf, O Samaria, saying, “My anger burns against them!” How long will they be incapable of innocence?"
Hosea,8,6,"For from Israel is even this! A craftsman made it, so it is not God; Surely the calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces."
Hosea,8,7,"For they sow the wind And they reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no heads; It yields no grain. Should it yield, strangers would swallow it up."
Hosea,8,8,Israel is swallowed up; They are now among the nations Like a vessel in which no one delights.
Hosea,8,9,"For they have gone up to Assyria, Like a wild donkey all alone; Ephraim has hired lovers."
Hosea,8,10,"Even though they hire allies among the nations, Now I will gather them up; And they will begin to diminish Because of the burden of the king of princes."
Hosea,8,11,"Since Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin, They have become altars of sinning for him."
Hosea,8,12,"Though I wrote for him ten thousand precepts of My law, They are regarded as a strange thing."
Hosea,8,13,"As for My sacrificial gifts, They sacrifice the flesh and eat it, But the LORD has taken no delight in them. Now He will remember their iniquity, And punish them for their sins; They will return to Egypt."
Hosea,8,14,"For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; And Judah has multiplied fortified cities, But I will send a fire on its cities that it may consume its palatial dwellings."
Hosea,9,1,"Do not rejoice, O Israel, with exultation like the nations! For you have played the harlot, forsaking your God. You have loved harlots’ earnings on every threshing floor."
Hosea,9,2,"Threshing floor and wine press will not feed them, And the new wine will fail them."
Hosea,9,3,"They will not remain in the LORD’S land, But Ephraim will return to Egypt, And in Assyria they will eat unclean food."
Hosea,9,4,"They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the LORD, Their sacrifices will not please Him. Their bread will be like mourners’ bread; All who eat of it will be defiled, For their bread will be for themselves alone; It will not enter the house of the LORD."
Hosea,9,5,What will you do on the day of the appointed festival And on the day of the feast of the LORD?
Hosea,9,6,"For behold, they will go because of destruction; Egypt will gather them up, Memphis will bury them. Weeds will take over their treasures of silver; Thorns will be in their tents."
Hosea,9,7,"The days of punishment have come, The days of retribution have come; Let Israel know this! The prophet is a fool, The inspired man is demented, Because of the grossness of your iniquity, And because your hostility is so great."
Hosea,9,8,"Ephraim was a watchman with my God, a prophet; Yet the snare of a bird catcher is in all his ways, And there is only hostility in the house of his God."
Hosea,9,9,"They have gone deep in depravity As in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their iniquity, He will punish their sins."
Hosea,9,10,"I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your forefathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first season. But they came to Baal-peor and devoted themselves to shame, And they became as detestable as that which they loved."
Hosea,9,11,"As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird— No birth, no pregnancy and no conception!"
Hosea,9,12,"Though they bring up their children, Yet I will bereave them until not a man is left. Yes, woe to them indeed when I depart from them!"
Hosea,9,13,"Ephraim, as I have seen, Is planted in a pleasant meadow like Tyre; But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter."
Hosea,9,14,"Give them, O LORD—what will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts."
Hosea,9,15,"All their evil is at Gilgal; Indeed, I came to hate them there! Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of My house! I will love them no more; All their princes are rebels."
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up, They will bear no fruit. Even though they bear children, I will slay the precious ones of their womb."
Hosea,9,17,My God will cast them away Because they have not listened to Him; And they will be wanderers among the nations.
Hosea,10,1,"Israel is a luxuriant vine; He produces fruit for himself. The more his fruit, The more altars he made; The richer his land, The better he made the sacred pillars."
Hosea,10,2,Their heart is faithless; Now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will break down their altars And destroy their sacred pillars.
Hosea,10,3,"Surely now they will say, “We have no king, For we do not revere the LORD. As for the king, what can he do for us?”"
Hosea,10,4,"They speak mere words, With worthless oaths they make covenants; And judgment sprouts like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field."
Hosea,10,5,"The inhabitants of Samaria will fear For the calf of Beth-aven. Indeed, its people will mourn for it, And its idolatrous priests will cry out over it, Over its glory, since it has departed from it."
Hosea,10,6,The thing itself will be carried to Assyria As tribute to King Jareb; Ephraim will be seized with shame And Israel will be ashamed of its own counsel.
Hosea,10,7,Samaria will be cut off with her king Like a stick on the surface of the water.
Hosea,10,8,"Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed; Thorn and thistle will grow on their altars; Then they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!” And to the hills, “Fall on us!”"
Hosea,10,9,"From the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel; There they stand! Will not the battle against the sons of iniquity overtake them in Gibeah?"
Hosea,10,10,"When it is My desire, I will chastise them; And the peoples will be gathered against them When they are bound for their double guilt."
Hosea,10,11,"Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh, But I will come over her fair neck with a yoke; I will harness Ephraim, Judah will plow, Jacob will harrow for himself."
Hosea,10,12,"Sow with a view to righteousness, Reap in accordance with kindness; Break up your fallow ground, For it is time to seek the LORD Until He comes to rain righteousness on you."
Hosea,10,13,"You have plowed wickedness, you have reaped injustice, You have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your way, in your numerous warriors,"
Hosea,10,14,"Therefore a tumult will arise among your people, And all your fortresses will be destroyed, As Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle, When mothers were dashed in pieces with their children."
Hosea,10,15,Thus it will be done to you at Bethel because of your great wickedness. At dawn the king of Israel will be completely cut off.
Hosea,11,1,"When Israel was a youth I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son."
Hosea,11,2,"The more they called them, The more they went from them; They kept sacrificing to the Baals And burning incense to idols."
Hosea,11,3,"Yet it is I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took them in My arms; But they did not know that I healed them."
Hosea,11,4,"I led them with cords of a man, with bonds of love, And I became to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws; And I bent down and fed them."
Hosea,11,5,They will not return to the land of Egypt; But Assyria—he will be their king Because they refused to return to Me.
Hosea,11,6,"The sword will whirl against their cities, And will demolish their gate bars And consume them because of their counsels."
Hosea,11,7,"So My people are bent on turning from Me. Though they call them to the One on high, None at all exalts Him."
Hosea,11,8,"How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I surrender you, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned over within Me, All My compassions are kindled."
Hosea,11,9,"I will not execute My fierce anger; I will not destroy Ephraim again. For I am God and not man, the Holy One in your midst, And I will not come in wrath."
Hosea,11,10,"They will walk after the LORD, He will roar like a lion; Indeed He will roar And His sons will come trembling from the west."
Hosea,11,11,"They will come trembling like birds from Egypt And like doves from the land of Assyria; And I will settle them in their houses, declares the LORD."
Hosea,11,12,"Ephraim surrounds Me with lies And the house of Israel with deceit; Judah is also unruly against God, Even against the Holy One who is faithful."
Hosea,12,1,"Ephraim feeds on wind, And pursues the east wind continually; He multiplies lies and violence. Moreover, he makes a covenant with Assyria, And oil is carried to Egypt."
Hosea,12,2,"The LORD also has a dispute with Judah, And will punish Jacob according to his ways; He will repay him according to his deeds."
Hosea,12,3,"In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And in his maturity he contended with God."
Hosea,12,4,"Yes, he wrestled with the angel and prevailed; He wept and sought His favor. He found Him at Bethel And there He spoke with us,"
Hosea,12,5,"Even the LORD, the God of hosts, The LORD is His name."
Hosea,12,6,"Therefore, return to your God, Observe kindness and justice, And wait for your God continually."
Hosea,12,7,"A merchant, in whose hands are false balances, He loves to oppress."
Hosea,12,8,"And Ephraim said, “Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself; In all my labors they will find in me No iniquity, which would be sin.”"
Hosea,12,9,"But I have been the LORD your God since the land of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, As in the days of the appointed festival."
Hosea,12,10,"I have also spoken to the prophets, And I gave numerous visions, And through the prophets I gave parables."
Hosea,12,11,"Is there iniquity in Gilead? Surely they are worthless. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls, Yes, their altars are like the stone heaps Beside the furrows of the field."
Hosea,12,12,"Now Jacob fled to the land of Aram, And Israel worked for a wife, And for a wife he kept sheep."
Hosea,12,13,"But by a prophet the LORD brought Israel from Egypt, And by a prophet he was kept."
Hosea,12,14,Ephraim has provoked to bitter anger; So his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him And bring back his reproach to him.
Hosea,13,1,"When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling. He exalted himself in Israel, But through Baal he did wrong and died."
Hosea,13,2,"And now they sin more and more, And make for themselves molten images, Idols skillfully made from their silver, All of them the work of craftsmen. They say of them, “Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves!”"
Hosea,13,3,"Therefore they will be like the morning cloud And like dew which soon disappears, Like chaff which is blown away from the threshing floor And like smoke from a chimney."
Hosea,13,4,"Yet I have been the LORD your God Since the land of Egypt; And you were not to know any god except Me, For there is no savior besides Me."
Hosea,13,5,"I cared for you in the wilderness, In the land of drought."
Hosea,13,6,"As they had their pasture, they became satisfied, And being satisfied, their heart became proud; Therefore they forgot Me."
Hosea,13,7,So I will be like a lion to them; Like a leopard I will lie in wait by the wayside.
Hosea,13,8,"I will encounter them like a bear robbed of her cubs, And I will tear open their chests; There I will also devour them like a lioness, As a wild beast would tear them."
Hosea,13,9,"It is your destruction, O Israel, That you are against Me, against your help."
Hosea,13,10,"Where now is your king That he may save you in all your cities, And your judges of whom you requested, “Give me a king and princes”?"
Hosea,13,11,I gave you a king in My anger And took him away in My wrath.
Hosea,13,12,The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; His sin is stored up.
Hosea,13,13,"The pains of childbirth come upon him; He is not a wise son, For it is not the time that he should delay at the opening of the womb."
Hosea,13,14,"Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol? Shall I redeem them from death? O Death, where are your thorns? O Sheol, where is your sting? Compassion will be hidden from My sight."
Hosea,13,15,"Though he flourishes among the reeds, An east wind will come, The wind of the LORD coming up from the wilderness; And his fountain will become dry And his spring will be dried up; It will plunder his treasury of every precious article."
Hosea,13,16,"Samaria will be held guilty, For she has rebelled against her God. They will fall by the sword, Their little ones will be dashed in pieces, And their pregnant women will be ripped open."
Hosea,14,1,"Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God, For you have stumbled because of your iniquity."
Hosea,14,2,"Take words with you and return to the LORD. Say to Him, “Take away all iniquity And receive us graciously, That we may present the fruit of our lips."
Hosea,14,3,"“Assyria will not save us, We will not ride on horses; Nor will we say again, ‘Our god,’ To the work of our hands; For in You the orphan finds mercy.”"
Hosea,14,4,"I will heal their apostasy, I will love them freely, For My anger has turned away from them."
Hosea,14,5,"I will be like the dew to Israel; He will blossom like the lily, And he will take root like the cedars of Lebanon."
Hosea,14,6,"His shoots will sprout, And his beauty will be like the olive tree And his fragrance like the cedars of Lebanon."
Hosea,14,7,"Those who live in his shadow Will again raise grain, And they will blossom like the vine. His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon."
Hosea,14,8,"O Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after you. I am like a luxuriant cypress; From Me comes your fruit."
Hosea,14,9,"Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; Whoever is discerning, let him know them. For the ways of the LORD are right, And the righteous will walk in them, But transgressors will stumble in them."
Joel,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel:"
Joel,1,2,"Hear this, O elders, And listen, all inhabitants of the land. Has anything like this happened in your days Or in your fathers’ days?"
Joel,1,3,"Tell your sons about it, And let your sons tell their sons, And their sons the next generation."
Joel,1,4,"What the gnawing locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; And what the swarming locust has left, the creeping locust has eaten; And what the creeping locust has left, the stripping locust has eaten."
Joel,1,5,"Awake, drunkards, and weep; And wail, all you wine drinkers, On account of the sweet wine That is cut off from your mouth."
Joel,1,6,"For a nation has invaded my land, Mighty and without number; Its teeth are the teeth of a lion, And it has the fangs of a lioness."
Joel,1,7,It has made my vine a waste And my fig tree splinters. It has stripped them bare and cast them away; Their branches have become white.
Joel,1,8,Wail like a virgin girded with sackcloth For the bridegroom of her youth.
Joel,1,9,"The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off From the house of the LORD. The priests mourn, The ministers of the LORD."
Joel,1,10,"The field is ruined, The land mourns; For the grain is ruined, The new wine dries up, Fresh oil fails."
Joel,1,11,"Be ashamed, O farmers, Wail, O vinedressers, For the wheat and the barley; Because the harvest of the field is destroyed."
Joel,1,12,"The vine dries up And the fig tree fails; The pomegranate, the palm also, and the apple tree, All the trees of the field dry up. Indeed, rejoicing dries up From the sons of men."
Joel,1,13,"Gird yourselves with sackcloth And lament, O priests; Wail, O ministers of the altar! Come, spend the night in sackcloth O ministers of my God, For the grain offering and the drink offering Are withheld from the house of your God."
Joel,1,14,"Consecrate a fast, Proclaim a solemn assembly; Gather the elders And all the inhabitants of the land To the house of the LORD your God, And cry out to the LORD."
Joel,1,15,"Alas for the day! For the day of the LORD is near, And it will come as destruction from the Almighty."
Joel,1,16,"Has not food been cut off before our eyes, Gladness and joy from the house of our God?"
Joel,1,17,"The seeds shrivel under their clods; The storehouses are desolate, The barns are torn down, For the grain is dried up."
Joel,1,18,How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle wander aimlessly Because there is no pasture for them; Even the flocks of sheep suffer.
Joel,1,19,"To You, O LORD, I cry; For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness And the flame has burned up all the trees of the field."
Joel,1,20,Even the beasts of the field pant for You; For the water brooks are dried up And fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
Joel,2,1,"Blow a trumpet in Zion, And sound an alarm on My holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, For the day of the LORD is coming; Surely it is near,"
Joel,2,2,"A day of darkness and gloom, A day of clouds and thick darkness. As the dawn is spread over the mountains, So there is a great and mighty people; There has never been anything like it, Nor will there be again after it To the years of many generations."
Joel,2,3,"A fire consumes before them And behind them a flame burns. The land is like the garden of Eden before them But a desolate wilderness behind them, And nothing at all escapes them."
Joel,2,4,"Their appearance is like the appearance of horses; And like war horses, so they run."
Joel,2,5,"With a noise as of chariots They leap on the tops of the mountains, Like the crackling of a flame of fire consuming the stubble, Like a mighty people arranged for battle."
Joel,2,6,Before them the people are in anguish; All faces turn pale.
Joel,2,7,"They run like mighty men, They climb the wall like soldiers; And they each march in line, Nor do they deviate from their paths."
Joel,2,8,"They do not crowd each other, They march everyone in his path; When they burst through the defenses, They do not break ranks."
Joel,2,9,"They rush on the city, They run on the wall; They climb into the houses, They enter through the windows like a thief."
Joel,2,10,"Before them the earth quakes, The heavens tremble, The sun and the moon grow dark And the stars lose their brightness."
Joel,2,11,"The LORD utters His voice before His army; Surely His camp is very great, For strong is he who carries out His word. The day of the LORD is indeed great and very awesome, And who can endure it?"
Joel,2,12,"“Yet even now,” declares the LORD, “Return to Me with all your heart, And with fasting, weeping and mourning;"
Joel,2,13,"And rend your heart and not your garments.” Now return to the LORD your God, For He is gracious and compassionate, Slow to anger, abounding in lovingkindness And relenting of evil."
Joel,2,14,"Who knows whether He will not turn and relent And leave a blessing behind Him, Even a grain offering and a drink offering For the LORD your God?"
Joel,2,15,"Blow a trumpet in Zion, Consecrate a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly,"
Joel,2,16,"Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, Assemble the elders, Gather the children and the nursing infants. Let the bridegroom come out of his room And the bride out of her bridal chamber."
Joel,2,17,"Let the priests, the LORD’S ministers, Weep between the porch and the altar, And let them say, “Spare Your people, O LORD, And do not make Your inheritance a reproach, A byword among the nations. Why should they among the peoples say, ‘Where is their God?’”"
Joel,2,18,Then the LORD will be zealous for His land And will have pity on His people.
Joel,2,19,"The LORD will answer and say to His people, “Behold, I am going to send you grain, new wine and oil, And you will be satisfied in full with them; And I will never again make you a reproach among the nations."
Joel,2,20,"“But I will remove the northern army far from you, And I will drive it into a parched and desolate land, And its vanguard into the eastern sea, And its rear guard into the western sea. And its stench will arise and its foul smell will come up, For it has done great things.”"
Joel,2,21,"Do not fear, O land, rejoice and be glad, For the LORD has done great things."
Joel,2,22,"Do not fear, beasts of the field, For the pastures of the wilderness have turned green, For the tree has borne its fruit, The fig tree and the vine have yielded in full."
Joel,2,23,"So rejoice, O sons of Zion, And be glad in the LORD your God; For He has given you the early rain for your vindication. And He has poured down for you the rain, The early and latter rain as before."
Joel,2,24,"The threshing floors will be full of grain, And the vats will overflow with the new wine and oil."
Joel,2,25,"“Then I will make up to you for the years That the swarming locust has eaten, The creeping locust, the stripping locust and the gnawing locust, My great army which I sent among you."
Joel,2,26,"“You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied And praise the name of the LORD your God, Who has dealt wondrously with you; Then My people will never be put to shame."
Joel,2,27,"“Thus you will know that I am in the midst of Israel, And that I am the LORD your God, And there is no other; And My people will never be put to shame."
Joel,2,28,"“It will come about after this That I will pour out My Spirit on all mankind; And your sons and daughters will prophesy, Your old men will dream dreams, Your young men will see visions."
Joel,2,29,“Even on the male and female servants I will pour out My Spirit in those days.
Joel,2,30,"“I will display wonders in the sky and on the earth, Blood, fire and columns of smoke."
Joel,2,31,“The sun will be turned into darkness And the moon into blood Before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes.
Joel,2,32,"“And it will come about that whoever calls on the name of the LORD Will be delivered; For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem There will be those who escape, As the LORD has said, Even among the survivors whom the LORD calls."
Joel,3,1,"“For behold, in those days and at that time, When I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,"
Joel,3,2,"I will gather all the nations And bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat. Then I will enter into judgment with them there On behalf of My people and My inheritance, Israel, Whom they have scattered among the nations; And they have divided up My land."
Joel,3,3,"“They have also cast lots for My people, Traded a boy for a harlot And sold a girl for wine that they may drink."
Joel,3,4,"Moreover, what are you to Me, O Tyre, Sidon and all the regions of Philistia? Are you rendering Me a recompense? But if you do recompense Me, swiftly and speedily I will return your recompense on your head."
Joel,3,5,"Since you have taken My silver and My gold, brought My precious treasures to your temples,"
Joel,3,6,"and sold the sons of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks in order to remove them far from their territory,"
Joel,3,7,"behold, I am going to arouse them from the place where you have sold them, and return your recompense on your head."
Joel,3,8,"Also I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a distant nation,” for the LORD has spoken."
Joel,3,9,"Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare a war; rouse the mighty men! Let all the soldiers draw near, let them come up!"
Joel,3,10,"Beat your plowshares into swords And your pruning hooks into spears; Let the weak say, “I am a mighty man.”"

Jonah,1,4,The LORD hurled a great wind on the sea and there was a great storm on the sea so that the ship was about to break up.
Jonah,1,5,"Then the sailors became afraid and every man cried to his god, and they threw the cargo which was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone below into the hold of the ship, lain down and fallen sound asleep."
Jonah,1,6,"So the captain approached him and said, “How is it that you are sleeping? Get up, call on your god. Perhaps your god will be concerned about us so that we will not perish.”"
Jonah,1,7,"Each man said to his mate, “Come, let us cast lots so we may learn on whose account this calamity has struck us.” So they cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah."
Jonah,1,8,"Then they said to him, “Tell us, now! On whose account has this calamity struck us? What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? From what people are you?”"
Jonah,1,9,"He said to them, “I am a Hebrew, and I fear the LORD God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land.”"
Jonah,1,10,"Then the men became extremely frightened and they said to him, “How could you do this?” For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them."
Jonah,1,11,"So they said to him, “What should we do to you that the sea may become calm for us?”—for the sea was becoming increasingly stormy."
Jonah,1,12,"He said to them, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea. Then the sea will become calm for you, for I know that on account of me this great storm has come upon you.”"
Jonah,1,13,"However, the men rowed desperately to return to land but they could not, for the sea was becoming even stormier against them."
Jonah,1,14,"Then they called on the LORD and said, “We earnestly pray, O LORD, do not let us perish on account of this man’s life and do not put innocent blood on us; for You, O LORD, have done as You have pleased.”"
Jonah,1,15,"So they picked up Jonah, threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped its raging."
Jonah,1,16,"Then the men feared the LORD greatly, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows."
Jonah,1,17,"And the LORD appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the stomach of the fish three days and three nights."
Jonah,2,1,"Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the stomach of the fish,"
Jonah,2,2,"and he said, “I called out of my distress to the LORD, And He answered me. I cried for help from the depth of Sheol; You heard my voice."
Jonah,2,3,"“For You had cast me into the deep, Into the heart of the seas, And the current engulfed me. All Your breakers and billows passed over me."
Jonah,2,4,"“So I said, ‘I have been expelled from Your sight. Nevertheless I will look again toward Your holy temple.’"
Jonah,2,5,"“Water encompassed me to the point of death. The great deep engulfed me, Weeds were wrapped around my head."
Jonah,2,6,"“I descended to the roots of the mountains. The earth with its bars was around me forever, But You have brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God."
Jonah,2,7,"“While I was fainting away, I remembered the LORD, And my prayer came to You, Into Your holy temple."
Jonah,2,8,"“Those who regard vain idols Forsake their faithfulness,"
Jonah,2,9,But I will sacrifice to You With the voice of thanksgiving. That which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is from the LORD.”
Jonah,2,10,"Then the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah up onto the dry land."
Jonah,3,1,"Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time, saying,"
Jonah,3,2,"“Arise, go to Nineveh the great city and proclaim to it the proclamation which I am going to tell you.”"
Jonah,3,3,"So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, a three days’ walk."
Jonah,3,4,"Then Jonah began to go through the city one day’s walk; and he cried out and said, “Yet forty days and Nineveh will be overthrown.”"
Jonah,3,5,Then the people of Nineveh believed in God; and they called a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them.
Jonah,3,6,"When the word reached the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, laid aside his robe from him, covered himself with sackcloth and sat on the ashes."
Jonah,3,7,"He issued a proclamation and it said, “In Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let man, beast, herd, or flock taste a thing. Do not let them eat or drink water."
Jonah,3,8,But both man and beast must be covered with sackcloth; and let men call on God earnestly that each may turn from his wicked way and from the violence which is in his hands.
Jonah,3,9,"Who knows, God may turn and relent and withdraw His burning anger so that we will not perish.”"
Jonah,3,10,"When God saw their deeds, that they turned from their wicked way, then God relented concerning the calamity which He had declared He would bring upon them. And He did not do it."
Jonah,4,1,But it greatly displeased Jonah and he became angry.
Jonah,4,2,"He prayed to the LORD and said, “Please LORD, was not this what I said while I was still in my own country? Therefore in order to forestall this I fled to Tarshish, for I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, and one who relents concerning calamity."
Jonah,4,3,"Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for death is better to me than life.”"
Jonah,4,4,"The LORD said, “Do you have good reason to be angry?”"
Jonah,4,5,Then Jonah went out from the city and sat east of it. There he made a shelter for himself and sat under it in the shade until he could see what would happen in the city.
Jonah,4,6,So the LORD God appointed a plant and it grew up over Jonah to be a shade over his head to deliver him from his discomfort. And Jonah was extremely happy about the plant.
Jonah,4,7,But God appointed a worm when dawn came the next day and it attacked the plant and it withered.
Jonah,4,8,"When the sun came up God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah’s head so that he became faint and begged with all his soul to die, saying, “Death is better to me than life.”"
Jonah,4,9,"Then God said to Jonah, “Do you have good reason to be angry about the plant?” And he said, “I have good reason to be angry, even to death.”"
Jonah,4,10,"Then the LORD said, “You had compassion on the plant for which you did not work and which you did not cause to grow, which came up overnight and perished overnight."
Jonah,4,11,"Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know the difference between their right and left hand, as well as many animals?”"
Micah,1,1,"The word of the LORD which came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem."
Micah,1,2,"Hear, O peoples, all of you; Listen, O earth and all it contains, And let the Lord GOD be a witness against you, The Lord from His holy temple."
Micah,1,3,"For behold, the LORD is coming forth from His place. He will come down and tread on the high places of the earth."
Micah,1,4,"The mountains will melt under Him And the valleys will be split, Like wax before the fire, Like water poured down a steep place."
Micah,1,5,All this is for the rebellion of Jacob And for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the rebellion of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? What is the high place of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?
Micah,1,6,"For I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the open country, Planting places for a vineyard. I will pour her stones down into the valley And will lay bare her foundations."
Micah,1,7,"All of her idols will be smashed, All of her earnings will be burned with fire And all of her images I will make desolate, For she collected them from a harlot’s earnings, And to the earnings of a harlot they will return."
Micah,1,8,"Because of this I must lament and wail, I must go barefoot and naked; I must make a lament like the jackals And a mourning like the ostriches."
Micah,1,9,"For her wound is incurable, For it has come to Judah; It has reached the gate of my people, Even to Jerusalem."
Micah,1,10,"Tell it not in Gath, Weep not at all. At Beth-le-aphrah roll yourself in the dust."
Micah,1,11,"Go on your way, inhabitant of Shaphir, in shameful nakedness. The inhabitant of Zaanan does not escape. The lamentation of Beth-ezel: “He will take from you its support.”"
Micah,1,12,"For the inhabitant of Maroth Becomes weak waiting for good, Because a calamity has come down from the LORD To the gate of Jerusalem."
Micah,1,13,"Harness the chariot to the team of horses, O inhabitant of Lachish— She was the beginning of sin To the daughter of Zion— Because in you were found The rebellious acts of Israel."
Micah,1,14,Therefore you will give parting gifts On behalf of Moresheth-gath; The houses of Achzib will become a deception To the kings of Israel.
Micah,1,15,"Moreover, I will bring on you The one who takes possession, O inhabitant of Mareshah. The glory of Israel will enter Adullam."
Micah,1,16,"Make yourself bald and cut off your hair, Because of the children of your delight; Extend your baldness like the eagle, For they will go from you into exile."
Micah,2,1,"Woe to those who scheme iniquity, Who work out evil on their beds! When morning comes, they do it, For it is in the power of their hands."
Micah,2,2,"They covet fields and then seize them, And houses, and take them away. They rob a man and his house, A man and his inheritance."
Micah,2,3,"Therefore thus says the LORD, “Behold, I am planning against this family a calamity From which you cannot remove your necks; And you will not walk haughtily, For it will be an evil time."
Micah,2,4,"“On that day they will take up against you a taunt And utter a bitter lamentation and say, ‘We are completely destroyed! He exchanges the portion of my people; How He removes it from me! To the apostate He apportions our fields.’"
Micah,2,5,“Therefore you will have no one stretching a measuring line For you by lot in the assembly of the LORD.
Micah,2,6,"‘Do not speak out,’ so they speak out. But if they do not speak out concerning these things, Reproaches will not be turned back."
Micah,2,7,"“Is it being said, O house of Jacob: ‘Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient? Are these His doings?’ Do not My words do good To the one walking uprightly?"
Micah,2,8,"“Recently My people have arisen as an enemy— You strip the robe off the garment From unsuspecting passers-by, From those returned from war."
Micah,2,9,"“The women of My people you evict, Each one from her pleasant house. From her children you take My splendor forever."
Micah,2,10,"“Arise and go, For this is no place of rest Because of the uncleanness that brings on destruction, A painful destruction."
Micah,2,11,"“If a man walking after wind and falsehood Had told lies and said, ‘I will speak out to you concerning wine and liquor,’ He would be spokesman to this people."
Micah,2,12,"“I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob, I will surely gather the remnant of Israel. I will put them together like sheep in the fold; Like a flock in the midst of its pasture They will be noisy with men."
Micah,2,13,"“The breaker goes up before them; They break out, pass through the gate and go out by it. So their king goes on before them, And the LORD at their head.”"
Micah,3,1,"And I said, “Hear now, heads of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel. Is it not for you to know justice?"
Micah,3,2,"“You who hate good and love evil, Who tear off their skin from them And their flesh from their bones,"
Micah,3,3,"Who eat the flesh of my people, Strip off their skin from them, Break their bones And chop them up as for the pot And as meat in a kettle.”"
Micah,3,4,"Then they will cry out to the LORD, But He will not answer them. Instead, He will hide His face from them at that time Because they have practiced evil deeds."
Micah,3,5,"Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people astray; When they have something to bite with their teeth, They cry, “Peace,” But against him who puts nothing in their mouths They declare holy war."
Micah,3,6,"Therefore it will be night for you—without vision, And darkness for you—without divination. The sun will go down on the prophets, And the day will become dark over them."
Micah,3,7,"The seers will be ashamed And the diviners will be embarrassed. Indeed, they will all cover their mouths Because there is no answer from God."
Micah,3,8,"On the other hand I am filled with power— With the Spirit of the LORD— And with justice and courage To make known to Jacob his rebellious act, Even to Israel his sin."
Micah,3,9,"Now hear this, heads of the house of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel, Who abhor justice And twist everything that is straight,"
Micah,3,10,Who build Zion with bloodshed And Jerusalem with violent injustice.
Micah,3,11,"Her leaders pronounce judgment for a bribe, Her priests instruct for a price And her prophets divine for money. Yet they lean on the LORD saying, “Is not the LORD in our midst? Calamity will not come upon us.”"
Micah,3,12,"Therefore, on account of you Zion will be plowed as a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins, And the mountain of the temple will become high places of a forest."
Micah,4,1,"And it will come about in the last days That the mountain of the house of the LORD Will be established as the chief of the mountains. It will be raised above the hills, And the peoples will stream to it."
Micah,4,2,"Many nations will come and say, “Come and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD And to the house of the God of Jacob, That He may teach us about His ways And that we may walk in His paths.” For from Zion will go forth the law, Even the word of the LORD from Jerusalem."
Micah,4,3,"And He will judge between many peoples And render decisions for mighty, distant nations. Then they will hammer their swords into plowshares And their spears into pruning hooks; Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they train for war."
Micah,4,4,"Each of them will sit under his vine And under his fig tree, With no one to make them afraid, For the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken."
Micah,4,5,"Though all the peoples walk Each in the name of his god, As for us, we will walk In the name of the LORD our God forever and ever."
Micah,4,6,"“In that day,” declares the LORD, “I will assemble the lame And gather the outcasts, Even those whom I have afflicted."
Micah,4,7,"“I will make the lame a remnant And the outcasts a strong nation, And the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion From now on and forever."
Micah,4,8,"“As for you, tower of the flock, Hill of the daughter of Zion, To you it will come— Even the former dominion will come, The kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem."
Micah,4,9,"“Now, why do you cry out loudly? Is there no king among you, Or has your counselor perished, That agony has gripped you like a woman in childbirth?"
Micah,4,10,"“Writhe and labor to give birth, Daughter of Zion, Like a woman in childbirth; For now you will go out of the city, Dwell in the field, And go to Babylon. There you will be rescued; There the LORD will redeem you From the hand of your enemies."
Micah,4,11,"“And now many nations have been assembled against you Who say, ‘Let her be polluted, And let our eyes gloat over Zion.’"
Micah,4,12,"“But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD, And they do not understand His purpose; For He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor."
Micah,4,13,"“Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion, For your horn I will make iron And your hoofs I will make bronze, That you may pulverize many peoples, That you may devote to the LORD their unjust gain And their wealth to the Lord of all the earth."
Micah,5,1,"“Now muster yourselves in troops, daughter of troops; They have laid siege against us; With a rod they will smite the judge of Israel on the cheek."
Micah,5,2,"“But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, Too little to be among the clans of Judah, From you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in Israel. His goings forth are from long ago, From the days of eternity.”"
Micah,5,3,Therefore He will give them up until the time When she who is in labor has borne a child. Then the remainder of His brethren Will return to the sons of Israel.
Micah,5,4,"And He will arise and shepherd His flock In the strength of the LORD, In the majesty of the name of the LORD His God. And they will remain, Because at that time He will be great To the ends of the earth."
Micah,5,5,"This One will be our peace. When the Assyrian invades our land, When he tramples on our citadels, Then we will raise against him Seven shepherds and eight leaders of men."
Micah,5,6,"They will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, The land of Nimrod at its entrances; And He will deliver us from the Assyrian When he attacks our land And when he tramples our territory."
Micah,5,7,"Then the remnant of Jacob Will be among many peoples Like dew from the LORD, Like showers on vegetation Which do not wait for man Or delay for the sons of men."
Micah,5,8,"The remnant of Jacob Will be among the nations, Among many peoples Like a lion among the beasts of the forest, Like a young lion among flocks of sheep, Which, if he passes through, Tramples down and tears, And there is none to rescue."
Micah,5,9,"Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries, And all your enemies will be cut off."
Micah,5,10,"“It will be in that day,” declares the LORD, “That I will cut off your horses from among you And destroy your chariots."
Micah,5,11,“I will also cut off the cities of your land And tear down all your fortifications.
Micah,5,12,"“I will cut off sorceries from your hand, And you will have fortune-tellers no more."
Micah,5,13,"“I will cut off your carved images And your sacred pillars from among you, So that you will no longer bow down To the work of your hands."
Micah,5,14,“I will root out your Asherim from among you And destroy your cities.
Micah,5,15,“And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath On the nations which have not obeyed.”
Micah,6,1,"Hear now what the LORD is saying, “Arise, plead your case before the mountains, And let the hills hear your voice."
Micah,6,2,"“Listen, you mountains, to the indictment of the LORD, And you enduring foundations of the earth, Because the LORD has a case against His people; Even with Israel He will dispute."
Micah,6,3,"“My people, what have I done to you, And how have I wearied you? Answer Me."
Micah,6,4,"“Indeed, I brought you up from the land of Egypt And ransomed you from the house of slavery, And I sent before you Moses, Aaron and Miriam."
Micah,6,5,"“My people, remember now What Balak king of Moab counseled And what Balaam son of Beor answered him, And from Shittim to Gilgal, So that you might know the righteous acts of the LORD.”"
Micah,6,6,"With what shall I come to the LORD And bow myself before the God on high? Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings, With yearling calves?"
Micah,6,7,"Does the LORD take delight in thousands of rams, In ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I present my firstborn for my rebellious acts, The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?"
Micah,6,8,"He has told you, O man, what is good; And what does the LORD require of you But to do justice, to love kindness, And to walk humbly with your God?"
Micah,6,9,"The voice of the LORD will call to the city— And it is sound wisdom to fear Your name: “Hear, O tribe. Who has appointed its time?"
Micah,6,10,"“Is there yet a man in the wicked house, Along with treasures of wickedness And a short measure that is cursed?"
Micah,6,11,“Can I justify wicked scales And a bag of deceptive weights?
Micah,6,12,"“For the rich men of the city are full of violence, Her residents speak lies, And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth."
Micah,6,13,"“So also I will make you sick, striking you down, Desolating you because of your sins."
Micah,6,14,"“You will eat, but you will not be satisfied, And your vileness will be in your midst. You will try to remove for safekeeping, But you will not preserve anything, And what you do preserve I will give to the sword."
Micah,6,15,"“You will sow but you will not reap. You will tread the olive but will not anoint yourself with oil; And the grapes, but you will not drink wine."
Micah,6,16,"“The statutes of Omri And all the works of the house of Ahab are observed; And in their devices you walk. Therefore I will give you up for destruction And your inhabitants for derision, And you will bear the reproach of My people.”"
Micah,7,1,"Woe is me! For I am Like the fruit pickers, like the grape gatherers. There is not a cluster of grapes to eat, Or a first-ripe fig which I crave."
Micah,7,2,"The godly person has perished from the land, And there is no upright person among men. All of them lie in wait for bloodshed; Each of them hunts the other with a net."
Micah,7,3,"Concerning evil, both hands do it well. The prince asks, also the judge, for a bribe, And a great man speaks the desire of his soul; So they weave it together."
Micah,7,4,"The best of them is like a briar, The most upright like a thorn hedge. The day when you post your watchmen, Your punishment will come. Then their confusion will occur."
Micah,7,5,Do not trust in a neighbor; Do not have confidence in a friend. From her who lies in your bosom Guard your lips.
Micah,7,6,"For son treats father contemptuously, Daughter rises up against her mother, Daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; A man’s enemies are the men of his own household."
Micah,7,7,"But as for me, I will watch expectantly for the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me."
Micah,7,8,"Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy. Though I fall I will rise; Though I dwell in darkness, the LORD is a light for me."
Micah,7,9,"I will bear the indignation of the LORD Because I have sinned against Him, Until He pleads my case and executes justice for me. He will bring me out to the light, And I will see His righteousness."
Micah,7,10,"Then my enemy will see, And shame will cover her who said to me, “Where is the LORD your God?” My eyes will look on her; At that time she will be trampled down Like mire of the streets."
Micah,7,11,It will be a day for building your walls. On that day will your boundary be extended.
Micah,7,12,"It will be a day when they will come to you From Assyria and the cities of Egypt, From Egypt even to the Euphrates, Even from sea to sea and mountain to mountain."
Micah,7,13,"And the earth will become desolate because of her inhabitants, On account of the fruit of their deeds."
Micah,7,14,"Shepherd Your people with Your scepter, The flock of Your possession Which dwells by itself in the woodland, In the midst of a fruitful field. Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead As in the days of old."
Micah,7,15,"“As in the days when you came out from the land of Egypt, I will show you miracles.”"
Micah,7,16,"Nations will see and be ashamed Of all their might. They will put their hand on their mouth, Their ears will be deaf."
Micah,7,17,"They will lick the dust like a serpent, Like reptiles of the earth. They will come trembling out of their fortresses; To the LORD our God they will come in dread And they will be afraid before You."
Micah,7,18,"Who is a God like You, who pardons iniquity And passes over the rebellious act of the remnant of His possession? He does not retain His anger forever, Because He delights in unchanging love."
Micah,7,19,"He will again have compassion on us; He will tread our iniquities under foot. Yes, You will cast all their sins Into the depths of the sea."
Micah,7,20,"You will give truth to Jacob And unchanging love to Abraham, Which You swore to our forefathers From the days of old."
Nahum,1,1,The oracle of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
Nahum,1,2,"A jealous and avenging God is the LORD; The LORD is avenging and wrathful. The LORD takes vengeance on His adversaries, And He reserves wrath for His enemies."
Nahum,1,3,"The LORD is slow to anger and great in power, And the LORD will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. In whirlwind and storm is His way, And clouds are the dust beneath His feet."
Nahum,1,4,He rebukes the sea and makes it dry; He dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither; The blossoms of Lebanon wither.
Nahum,1,5,"Mountains quake because of Him And the hills dissolve; Indeed the earth is upheaved by His presence, The world and all the inhabitants in it."
Nahum,1,6,Who can stand before His indignation? Who can endure the burning of His anger? His wrath is poured out like fire And the rocks are broken up by Him.
Nahum,1,7,"The LORD is good, A stronghold in the day of trouble, And He knows those who take refuge in Him."
Nahum,1,8,"But with an overflowing flood He will make a complete end of its site, And will pursue His enemies into darkness."
Nahum,1,9,"Whatever you devise against the LORD, He will make a complete end of it. Distress will not rise up twice."
Nahum,1,10,"Like tangled thorns, And like those who are drunken with their drink, They are consumed As stubble completely withered."
Nahum,1,11,"From you has gone forth One who plotted evil against the LORD, A wicked counselor."
Nahum,1,12,"Thus says the LORD, “Though they are at full strength and likewise many, Even so, they will be cut off and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no longer."
Nahum,1,13,"“So now, I will break his yoke bar from upon you, And I will tear off your shackles.”"
Nahum,1,14,"The LORD has issued a command concerning you: “Your name will no longer be perpetuated. I will cut off idol and image From the house of your gods. I will prepare your grave, For you are contemptible.”"
Nahum,1,15,"Behold, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news, Who announces peace! Celebrate your feasts, O Judah; Pay your vows. For never again will the wicked one pass through you; He is cut off completely."
Nahum,2,1,"The one who scatters has come up against you. Man the fortress, watch the road; Strengthen your back, summon all your strength."
Nahum,2,2,"For the LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob Like the splendor of Israel, Even though devastators have devastated them And destroyed their vine branches."
Nahum,2,3,"The shields of his mighty men are colored red, The warriors are dressed in scarlet, The chariots are enveloped in flashing steel When he is prepared to march, And the cypress spears are brandished."
Nahum,2,4,"The chariots race madly in the streets, They rush wildly in the squares, Their appearance is like torches, They dash to and fro like lightning flashes."
Nahum,2,5,"He remembers his nobles; They stumble in their march, They hurry to her wall, And the mantelet is set up."
Nahum,2,6,The gates of the rivers are opened And the palace is dissolved.
Nahum,2,7,"It is fixed: She is stripped, she is carried away, And her handmaids are moaning like the sound of doves, Beating on their breasts."
Nahum,2,8,"Though Nineveh was like a pool of water throughout her days, Now they are fleeing; “Stop, stop,” But no one turns back."
Nahum,2,9,Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! For there is no limit to the treasure— Wealth from every kind of desirable object.
Nahum,2,10,"She is emptied! Yes, she is desolate and waste! Hearts are melting and knees knocking! Also anguish is in the whole body And all their faces are grown pale!"
Nahum,2,11,"Where is the den of the lions And the feeding place of the young lions, Where the lion, lioness and lion’s cub prowled, With nothing to disturb them?"
Nahum,2,12,"The lion tore enough for his cubs, Killed enough for his lionesses, And filled his lairs with prey And his dens with torn flesh."
Nahum,2,13,"“Behold, I am against you,” declares the LORD of hosts. “I will burn up her chariots in smoke, a sword will devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard.”"
Nahum,3,1,"Woe to the bloody city, completely full of lies and pillage; Her prey never departs."
Nahum,3,2,"The noise of the whip, The noise of the rattling of the wheel, Galloping horses And bounding chariots!"
Nahum,3,3,"Horsemen charging, Swords flashing, spears gleaming, Many slain, a mass of corpses, And countless dead bodies— They stumble over the dead bodies!"
Nahum,3,4,"All because of the many harlotries of the harlot, The charming one, the mistress of sorceries, Who sells nations by her harlotries And families by her sorceries."
Nahum,3,5,"“Behold, I am against you,” declares the LORD of hosts; “And I will lift up your skirts over your face, And show to the nations your nakedness And to the kingdoms your disgrace."
Nahum,3,6,"“I will throw filth on you And make you vile, And set you up as a spectacle."
Nahum,3,7,"“And it will come about that all who see you Will shrink from you and say, ‘Nineveh is devastated! Who will grieve for her?’ Where will I seek comforters for you?”"
Nahum,3,8,"Are you better than No-amon, Which was situated by the waters of the Nile, With water surrounding her, Whose rampart was the sea, Whose wall consisted of the sea?"
Nahum,3,9,"Ethiopia was her might, And Egypt too, without limits. Put and Lubim were among her helpers."
Nahum,3,10,"Yet she became an exile, She went into captivity; Also her small children were dashed to pieces At the head of every street; They cast lots for her honorable men, And all her great men were bound with fetters."
Nahum,3,11,"You too will become drunk, You will be hidden. You too will search for a refuge from the enemy."
Nahum,3,12,"All your fortifications are fig trees with ripe fruit— When shaken, they fall into the eater’s mouth."
Nahum,3,13,"Behold, your people are women in your midst! The gates of your land are opened wide to your enemies; Fire consumes your gate bars."
Nahum,3,14,Draw for yourself water for the siege! Strengthen your fortifications! Go into the clay and tread the mortar! Take hold of the brick mold!
Nahum,3,15,"There fire will consume you, The sword will cut you down; It will consume you as the locust does. Multiply yourself like the creeping locust, Multiply yourself like the swarming locust."
Nahum,3,16,You have increased your traders more than the stars of heaven— The creeping locust strips and flies away.
Nahum,3,17,"Your guardsmen are like the swarming locust. Your marshals are like hordes of grasshoppers Settling in the stone walls on a cold day. The sun rises and they flee, And the place where they are is not known."
Nahum,3,18,"Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria; Your nobles are lying down. Your people are scattered on the mountains And there is no one to regather them."
Nahum,3,19,"There is no relief for your breakdown, Your wound is incurable. All who hear about you Will clap their hands over you, For on whom has not your evil passed continually?"
Habakkuk,1,1,The oracle which Habakkuk the prophet saw.
Habakkuk,1,2,"How long, O LORD, will I call for help, And You will not hear? I cry out to You, “Violence!” Yet You do not save."
Habakkuk,1,3,"Why do You make me see iniquity, And cause me to look on wickedness? Yes, destruction and violence are before me; Strife exists and contention arises."
Habakkuk,1,4,Therefore the law is ignored And justice is never upheld. For the wicked surround the righteous; Therefore justice comes out perverted.
Habakkuk,1,5,“Look among the nations! Observe! Be astonished! Wonder! Because I am doing something in your days— You would not believe if you were told.
Habakkuk,1,6,"“For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans, That fierce and impetuous people Who march throughout the earth To seize dwelling places which are not theirs."
Habakkuk,1,7,“They are dreaded and feared; Their justice and authority originate with themselves.
Habakkuk,1,8,"“Their horses are swifter than leopards And keener than wolves in the evening. Their horsemen come galloping, Their horsemen come from afar; They fly like an eagle swooping down to devour."
Habakkuk,1,9,“All of them come for violence. Their horde of faces moves forward. They collect captives like sand.
Habakkuk,1,10,“They mock at kings And rulers are a laughing matter to them. They laugh at every fortress And heap up rubble to capture it.
Habakkuk,1,11,"“Then they will sweep through like the wind and pass on. But they will be held guilty, They whose strength is their god.”"
Habakkuk,1,12,"Are You not from everlasting, O LORD, my God, my Holy One? We will not die. You, O LORD, have appointed them to judge; And You, O Rock, have established them to correct."
Habakkuk,1,13,"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, And You can not look on wickedness with favor. Why do You look with favor On those who deal treacherously? Why are You silent when the wicked swallow up Those more righteous than they?"
Habakkuk,1,14,"Why have You made men like the fish of the sea, Like creeping things without a ruler over them?"
Habakkuk,1,15,"The Chaldeans bring all of them up with a hook, Drag them away with their net, And gather them together in their fishing net. Therefore they rejoice and are glad."
Habakkuk,1,16,"Therefore they offer a sacrifice to their net And burn incense to their fishing net; Because through these things their catch is large, And their food is plentiful."
Habakkuk,1,17,Will they therefore empty their net And continually slay nations without sparing?
Habakkuk,2,1,"I will stand on my guard post And station myself on the rampart; And I will keep watch to see what He will speak to me, And how I may reply when I am reproved."
Habakkuk,2,2,"Then the LORD answered me and said, “Record the vision And inscribe it on tablets, That the one who reads it may run."
Habakkuk,2,3,"“For the vision is yet for the appointed time; It hastens toward the goal and it will not fail. Though it tarries, wait for it; For it will certainly come, it will not delay."
Habakkuk,2,4,"“Behold, as for the proud one, His soul is not right within him; But the righteous will live by his faith."
Habakkuk,2,5,"“Furthermore, wine betrays the haughty man, So that he does not stay at home. He enlarges his appetite like Sheol, And he is like death, never satisfied. He also gathers to himself all nations And collects to himself all peoples."
Habakkuk,2,6,"“Will not all of these take up a taunt-song against him, Even mockery and insinuations against him And say, ‘Woe to him who increases what is not his— For how long— And makes himself rich with loans?’"
Habakkuk,2,7,"“Will not your creditors rise up suddenly, And those who collect from you awaken? Indeed, you will become plunder for them."
Habakkuk,2,8,"“Because you have looted many nations, All the remainder of the peoples will loot you— Because of human bloodshed and violence done to the land, To the town and all its inhabitants."
Habakkuk,2,9,"“Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house To put his nest on high, To be delivered from the hand of calamity!"
Habakkuk,2,10,“You have devised a shameful thing for your house By cutting off many peoples; So you are sinning against yourself.
Habakkuk,2,11,"“Surely the stone will cry out from the wall, And the rafter will answer it from the framework."
Habakkuk,2,12,“Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed And founds a town with violence!
Habakkuk,2,13,"“Is it not indeed from the LORD of hosts That peoples toil for fire, And nations grow weary for nothing?"
Habakkuk,2,14,"“For the earth will be filled With the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, As the waters cover the sea."
Habakkuk,2,15,"“Woe to you who make your neighbors drink, Who mix in your venom even to make them drunk So as to look on their nakedness!"
Habakkuk,2,16,"“You will be filled with disgrace rather than honor. Now you yourself drink and expose your own nakedness. The cup in the LORD’S right hand will come around to you, And utter disgrace will come upon your glory."
Habakkuk,2,17,"“For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, And the devastation of its beasts by which you terrified them, Because of human bloodshed and violence done to the land, To the town and all its inhabitants."
Habakkuk,2,18,"“What profit is the idol when its maker has carved it, Or an image, a teacher of falsehood? For its maker trusts in his own handiwork When he fashions speechless idols."
Habakkuk,2,19,"“Woe to him who says to a piece of wood, ‘Awake!’ To a mute stone, ‘Arise!’ And that is your teacher? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, And there is no breath at all inside it."
Habakkuk,2,20,“But the LORD is in His holy temple. Let all the earth be silent before Him.”
Habakkuk,3,1,"A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth."
Habakkuk,3,2,"LORD, I have heard the report about You and I fear. O LORD, revive Your work in the midst of the years, In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember mercy."
Habakkuk,3,3,"God comes from Teman, And the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His splendor covers the heavens, And the earth is full of His praise."
Habakkuk,3,4,"His radiance is like the sunlight; He has rays flashing from His hand, And there is the hiding of His power."
Habakkuk,3,5,"Before Him goes pestilence, And plague comes after Him."
Habakkuk,3,6,"He stood and surveyed the earth; He looked and startled the nations. Yes, the perpetual mountains were shattered, The ancient hills collapsed. His ways are everlasting."
Habakkuk,3,7,"I saw the tents of Cushan under distress, The tent curtains of the land of Midian were trembling."
Habakkuk,3,8,"Did the LORD rage against the rivers, Or was Your anger against the rivers, Or was Your wrath against the sea, That You rode on Your horses, On Your chariots of salvation?"
Habakkuk,3,9,"Your bow was made bare, The rods of chastisement were sworn. Selah. You cleaved the earth with rivers."
Habakkuk,3,10,"The mountains saw You and quaked; The downpour of waters swept by. The deep uttered forth its voice, It lifted high its hands."
Habakkuk,3,11,"Sun and moon stood in their places; They went away at the light of Your arrows, At the radiance of Your gleaming spear."
Habakkuk,3,12,In indignation You marched through the earth; In anger You trampled the nations.
Habakkuk,3,13,"You went forth for the salvation of Your people, For the salvation of Your anointed. You struck the head of the house of the evil To lay him open from thigh to neck. Selah."
Habakkuk,3,14,You pierced with his own spears The head of his throngs. They stormed in to scatter us; Their exultation was like those Who devour the oppressed in secret.
Habakkuk,3,15,"You trampled on the sea with Your horses, On the surge of many waters."
Habakkuk,3,16,"I heard and my inward parts trembled, At the sound my lips quivered. Decay enters my bones, And in my place I tremble. Because I must wait quietly for the day of distress, For the people to arise who will invade us."
Habakkuk,3,17,"Though the fig tree should not blossom And there be no fruit on the vines, Though the yield of the olive should fail And the fields produce no food, Though the flock should be cut off from the fold And there be no cattle in the stalls,"
Habakkuk,3,18,"Yet I will exult in the LORD, I will rejoice in the God of my salvation."
Habakkuk,3,19,"The Lord GOD is my strength, And He has made my feet like hinds’ feet, And makes me walk on my high places. For the choir director, on my stringed instruments."
Zephaniah,1,1,"The word of the LORD which came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah:"
Zephaniah,1,2,"“I will completely remove all things From the face of the earth,” declares the LORD."
Zephaniah,1,3,"“I will remove man and beast; I will remove the birds of the sky And the fish of the sea, And the ruins along with the wicked; And I will cut off man from the face of the earth,” declares the LORD."
Zephaniah,1,4,"“So I will stretch out My hand against Judah And against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, And the names of the idolatrous priests along with the priests."
Zephaniah,1,5,"“And those who bow down on the housetops to the host of heaven, And those who bow down and swear to the LORD and yet swear by Milcom,"
Zephaniah,1,6,"And those who have turned back from following the LORD, And those who have not sought the LORD or inquired of Him.”"
Zephaniah,1,7,"Be silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is near, For the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, He has consecrated His guests."
Zephaniah,1,8,"“Then it will come about on the day of the LORD’S sacrifice That I will punish the princes, the king’s sons And all who clothe themselves with foreign garments."
Zephaniah,1,9,"“And I will punish on that day all who leap on the temple threshold, Who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit."
Zephaniah,1,10,"“On that day,” declares the LORD, “There will be the sound of a cry from the Fish Gate, A wail from the Second Quarter, And a loud crash from the hills."
Zephaniah,1,11,"“Wail, O inhabitants of the Mortar, For all the people of Canaan will be silenced; All who weigh out silver will be cut off."
Zephaniah,1,12,"“It will come about at that time That I will search Jerusalem with lamps, And I will punish the men Who are stagnant in spirit, Who say in their hearts, ‘The LORD will not do good or evil!’"
Zephaniah,1,13,"“Moreover, their wealth will become plunder And their houses desolate; Yes, they will build houses but not inhabit them, And plant vineyards but not drink their wine.”"
Zephaniah,1,14,"Near is the great day of the LORD, Near and coming very quickly; Listen, the day of the LORD! In it the warrior cries out bitterly."
Zephaniah,1,15,"A day of wrath is that day, A day of trouble and distress, A day of destruction and desolation, A day of darkness and gloom, A day of clouds and thick darkness,"
Zephaniah,1,16,A day of trumpet and battle cry Against the fortified cities And the high corner towers.
Zephaniah,1,17,"I will bring distress on men So that they will walk like the blind, Because they have sinned against the LORD; And their blood will be poured out like dust And their flesh like dung."
Zephaniah,1,18,"Neither their silver nor their gold Will be able to deliver them On the day of the LORD’S wrath; And all the earth will be devoured In the fire of His jealousy, For He will make a complete end, Indeed a terrifying one, Of all the inhabitants of the earth."
Zephaniah,2,1,"Gather yourselves together, yes, gather, O nation without shame,"
Zephaniah,2,2,"Before the decree takes effect— The day passes like the chaff— Before the burning anger of the LORD comes upon you, Before the day of the LORD’S anger comes upon you."
Zephaniah,2,3,"Seek the LORD, All you humble of the earth Who have carried out His ordinances; Seek righteousness, seek humility. Perhaps you will be hidden In the day of the LORD’S anger."
Zephaniah,2,4,For Gaza will be abandoned And Ashkelon a desolation; Ashdod will be driven out at noon And Ekron will be uprooted.
Zephaniah,2,5,"Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, The nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; And I will destroy you So that there will be no inhabitant."
Zephaniah,2,6,"So the seacoast will be pastures, With caves for shepherds and folds for flocks."
Zephaniah,2,7,"And the coast will be For the remnant of the house of Judah, They will pasture on it. In the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down at evening; For the LORD their God will care for them And restore their fortune."
Zephaniah,2,8,"“I have heard the taunting of Moab And the revilings of the sons of Ammon, With which they have taunted My people And become arrogant against their territory."
Zephaniah,2,9,"“Therefore, as I live,” declares the LORD of hosts, The God of Israel, “Surely Moab will be like Sodom And the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah— A place possessed by nettles and salt pits, And a perpetual desolation. The remnant of My people will plunder them And the remainder of My nation will inherit them.”"
Zephaniah,2,10,"This they will have in return for their pride, because they have taunted and become arrogant against the people of the LORD of hosts."
Zephaniah,2,11,"The LORD will be terrifying to them, for He will starve all the gods of the earth; and all the coastlands of the nations will bow down to Him, everyone from his own place."
Zephaniah,2,12,"“You also, O Ethiopians, will be slain by My sword.”"
Zephaniah,2,13,"And He will stretch out His hand against the north And destroy Assyria, And He will make Nineveh a desolation, Parched like the wilderness."
Zephaniah,2,14,"Flocks will lie down in her midst, All beasts which range in herds; Both the pelican and the hedgehog Will lodge in the tops of her pillars; Birds will sing in the window, Desolation will be on the threshold; For He has laid bare the cedar work."
Zephaniah,2,15,"This is the exultant city Which dwells securely, Who says in her heart, “I am, and there is no one besides me.” How she has become a desolation, A resting place for beasts! Everyone who passes by her will hiss And wave his hand in contempt."
Zephaniah,3,1,"Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled, The tyrannical city!"
Zephaniah,3,2,"She heeded no voice, She accepted no instruction. She did not trust in the LORD, She did not draw near to her God."
Zephaniah,3,3,"Her princes within her are roaring lions, Her judges are wolves at evening; They leave nothing for the morning."
Zephaniah,3,4,"Her prophets are reckless, treacherous men; Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law."
Zephaniah,3,5,The LORD is righteous within her; He will do no injustice. Every morning He brings His justice to light; He does not fail. But the unjust knows no shame.
Zephaniah,3,6,"“I have cut off nations; Their corner towers are in ruins. I have made their streets desolate, With no one passing by; Their cities are laid waste, Without a man, without an inhabitant."
Zephaniah,3,7,"“I said, ‘Surely you will revere Me, Accept instruction.’ So her dwelling will not be cut off According to all that I have appointed concerning her. But they were eager to corrupt all their deeds."
Zephaniah,3,8,"“Therefore wait for Me,” declares the LORD, “For the day when I rise up as a witness. Indeed, My decision is to gather nations, To assemble kingdoms, To pour out on them My indignation, All My burning anger; For all the earth will be devoured By the fire of My zeal."
Zephaniah,3,9,"“For then I will give to the peoples purified lips, That all of them may call on the name of the LORD, To serve Him shoulder to shoulder."
Zephaniah,3,10,"“From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia My worshipers, My dispersed ones, Will bring My offerings."
Zephaniah,3,11,"“In that day you will feel no shame Because of all your deeds By which you have rebelled against Me; For then I will remove from your midst Your proud, exulting ones, And you will never again be haughty On My holy mountain."
Zephaniah,3,12,"“But I will leave among you A humble and lowly people, And they will take refuge in the name of the LORD."
Zephaniah,3,13,"“The remnant of Israel will do no wrong And tell no lies, Nor will a deceitful tongue Be found in their mouths; For they will feed and lie down With no one to make them tremble.”"
Zephaniah,3,14,"Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!"
Zephaniah,3,15,"The LORD has taken away His judgments against you, He has cleared away your enemies. The King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; You will fear disaster no more."
Zephaniah,3,16,"In that day it will be said to Jerusalem: “Do not be afraid, O Zion; Do not let your hands fall limp."
Zephaniah,3,17,"“The LORD your God is in your midst, A victorious warrior. He will exult over you with joy, He will be quiet in His love, He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy."
Zephaniah,3,18,"“I will gather those who grieve about the appointed feasts— They came from you, O Zion; The reproach of exile is a burden on them."
Zephaniah,3,19,"“Behold, I am going to deal at that time With all your oppressors, I will save the lame And gather the outcast, And I will turn their shame into praise and renown In all the earth."
Zephaniah,3,20,"“At that time I will bring you in, Even at the time when I gather you together; Indeed, I will give you renown and praise Among all the peoples of the earth, When I restore your fortunes before your eyes,” Says the LORD."
Haggai,1,1,"In the second year of Darius the king, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the LORD came by the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,"
Haggai,1,2,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘This people says, “The time has not come, even the time for the house of the LORD to be rebuilt.”’”"
Haggai,1,3,"Then the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet, saying,"
Haggai,1,4,“Is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses while this house lies desolate?”
Haggai,1,5,"Now therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, “Consider your ways!"
Haggai,1,6,"You have sown much, but harvest little; you eat, but there is not enough to be satisfied; you drink, but there is not enough to become drunk; you put on clothing, but no one is warm enough; and he who earns, earns wages to put into a purse with holes.”"
Haggai,1,7,"Thus says the LORD of hosts, “Consider your ways!"
Haggai,1,8,"Go up to the mountains, bring wood and rebuild the temple, that I may be pleased with it and be glorified,” says the LORD."
Haggai,1,9,"“You look for much, but behold, it comes to little; when you bring it home, I blow it away. Why?” declares the LORD of hosts, “Because of My house which lies desolate, while each of you runs to his own house."
Haggai,1,10,"Therefore, because of you the sky has withheld its dew and the earth has withheld its produce."
Haggai,1,11,"I called for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on what the ground produces, on men, on cattle, and on all the labor of your hands.”"
Haggai,1,12,"Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him. And the people showed reverence for the LORD."
Haggai,1,13,"Then Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, spoke by the commission of the LORD to the people saying, “‘I am with you,’ declares the LORD.”"
Haggai,1,14,"So the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,"
Haggai,1,15,on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius the king.
Haggai,2,1,"On the twenty-first of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet saying,"
Haggai,2,2,"“Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people saying,"
Haggai,2,3,‘Who is left among you who saw this temple in its former glory? And how do you see it now? Does it not seem to you like nothing in comparison?
Haggai,2,4,"But now take courage, Zerubbabel,’ declares the LORD, ‘take courage also, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all you people of the land take courage,’ declares the LORD, ‘and work; for I am with you,’ declares the LORD of hosts."
Haggai,2,5,"‘As for the promise which I made you when you came out of Egypt, My Spirit is abiding in your midst; do not fear!’"
Haggai,2,6,"For thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘Once more in a little while, I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, the sea also and the dry land."
Haggai,2,7,"I will shake all the nations; and they will come with the wealth of all nations, and I will fill this house with glory,’ says the LORD of hosts."
Haggai,2,8,"‘The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine,’ declares the LORD of hosts."
Haggai,2,9,"‘The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,’ says the LORD of hosts, ‘and in this place I will give peace,’ declares the LORD of hosts.”"
Haggai,2,10,"On the twenty-fourth of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Haggai the prophet, saying,"
Haggai,2,11,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘Ask now the priests for a ruling:"
Haggai,2,12,"If a man carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and touches bread with this fold, or cooked food, wine, oil, or any other food, will it become holy?’” And the priests answered, “No.”"
Haggai,2,13,"Then Haggai said, “If one who is unclean from a corpse touches any of these, will the latter become unclean?” And the priests answered, “It will become unclean.”"
Haggai,2,14,"Then Haggai said, “‘So is this people. And so is this nation before Me,’ declares the LORD, ‘and so is every work of their hands; and what they offer there is unclean."
Haggai,2,15,"But now, do consider from this day onward: before one stone was placed on another in the temple of the LORD,"
Haggai,2,16,"from that time when one came to a grain heap of twenty measures, there would be only ten; and when one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures, there would be only twenty."
Haggai,2,17,"I smote you and every work of your hands with blasting wind, mildew and hail; yet you did not come back to Me,’ declares the LORD."
Haggai,2,18,"‘Do consider from this day onward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month; from the day when the temple of the LORD was founded, consider:"
Haggai,2,19,"Is the seed still in the barn? Even including the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate and the olive tree, it has not borne fruit. Yet from this day on I will bless you.’”"
Haggai,2,20,"Then the word of the LORD came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,"
Haggai,2,21,"“Speak to Zerubbabel governor of Judah, saying, ‘I am going to shake the heavens and the earth."
Haggai,2,22,"I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots and their riders, and the horses and their riders will go down, everyone by the sword of another.’"
Haggai,2,23,"‘On that day,’ declares the LORD of hosts, ‘I will take you, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, My servant,’ declares the LORD, ‘and I will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you,’” declares the LORD of hosts."
Zechariah,1,1,"In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying,"
Zechariah,1,2,“The LORD was very angry with your fathers.
Zechariah,1,3,"Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, “Return to Me,” declares the LORD of hosts, “that I may return to you,” says the LORD of hosts."
Zechariah,1,4,"“Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, “Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.”’ But they did not listen or give heed to Me,” declares the LORD."
Zechariah,1,5,"“Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?"
Zechariah,1,6,"But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? Then they repented and said, ‘As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.’”’”"
Zechariah,1,7,"On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows:"
Zechariah,1,8,"I saw at night, and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him."
Zechariah,1,9,"Then I said, “My lord, what are these?” And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, “I will show you what these are.”"
Zechariah,1,10,"And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, “These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.”"
Zechariah,1,11,"So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, “We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.”"
Zechariah,1,12,"Then the angel of the LORD said, “O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?”"
Zechariah,1,13,"The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words."
Zechariah,1,14,"So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, “Proclaim, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, “I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion."
Zechariah,1,15,"But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.”"
Zechariah,1,16,"Therefore thus says the LORD, “I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it,” declares the LORD of hosts, “and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.”’"
Zechariah,1,17,"Again, proclaim, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, “My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.”’”"
Zechariah,1,18,"Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns."
Zechariah,1,19,"So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these?” And he answered me, “These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.”"
Zechariah,1,20,Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
Zechariah,1,21,"I said, “What are these coming to do?” And he said, “These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.”"
Zechariah,2,1,"Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand."
Zechariah,2,2,"So I said, “Where are you going?” And he said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.”"
Zechariah,2,3,"And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him,"
Zechariah,2,4,"and said to him, “Run, speak to that young man, saying, ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it."
Zechariah,2,5,"For I,’ declares the LORD, ‘will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.’”"
Zechariah,2,6,"“Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,” declares the LORD, “for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,” declares the LORD."
Zechariah,2,7,"“Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.”"
Zechariah,2,8,"For thus says the LORD of hosts, “After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye."
Zechariah,2,9,"For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me."
Zechariah,2,10,"Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,” declares the LORD."
Zechariah,2,11,"“Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you."
Zechariah,2,12,"The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem."
Zechariah,2,13,"“Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.”"
Zechariah,3,1,"Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him."
Zechariah,3,2,"The LORD said to Satan, “The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?”"
Zechariah,3,3,Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel.
Zechariah,3,4,"He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, “Remove the filthy garments from him.” Again he said to him, “See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.”"
Zechariah,3,5,"Then I said, “Let them put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by."
Zechariah,3,6,"And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying,"
Zechariah,3,7,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here."
Zechariah,3,8,"Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch."
Zechariah,3,9,"For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,’ declares the LORD of hosts, ‘and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day."
Zechariah,3,10,"‘In that day,’ declares the LORD of hosts, ‘every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.’”"
Zechariah,4,1,"Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep."
Zechariah,4,2,"He said to me, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it;"
Zechariah,4,3,"also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.”"
Zechariah,4,4,"Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, “What are these, my lord?”"
Zechariah,4,5,"So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” And I said, “No, my lord.”"
Zechariah,4,6,"Then he said to me, “This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, ‘Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,’ says the LORD of hosts."
Zechariah,4,7,"‘What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of “Grace, grace to it!”’”"
Zechariah,4,8,"Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Zechariah,4,9,"“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you."
Zechariah,4,10,For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth.”
Zechariah,4,11,"Then I said to him, “What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?”"
Zechariah,4,12,"And I answered the second time and said to him, “What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?”"
Zechariah,4,13,"So he answered me, saying, “Do you not know what these are?” And I said, “No, my lord.”"
Zechariah,4,14,"Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.”"
Zechariah,5,1,"Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll."
Zechariah,5,2,"And he said to me, “What do you see?” And I answered, “I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.”"
Zechariah,5,3,"Then he said to me, “This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side."
Zechariah,5,4,"I will make it go forth,” declares the LORD of hosts, “and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.”"
Zechariah,5,5,"Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, “Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.”"
Zechariah,5,6,"I said, “What is it?” And he said, “This is the ephah going forth.” Again he said, “This is their appearance in all the land"
Zechariah,5,7,"(and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.”"
Zechariah,5,8,"Then he said, “This is Wickedness!” And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening."
Zechariah,5,9,"Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens."
Zechariah,5,10,"I said to the angel who was speaking with me, “Where are they taking the ephah?”"
Zechariah,5,11,"Then he said to me, “To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.”"
Zechariah,6,1,"Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains."
Zechariah,6,2,"With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses,"
Zechariah,6,3,"with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses."
Zechariah,6,4,"Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these, my lord?”"
Zechariah,6,5,"The angel replied to me, “These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth,"
Zechariah,6,6,"with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country."
Zechariah,6,7,"When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.” And He said, “Go, patrol the earth.” So they patrolled the earth."
Zechariah,6,8,"Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, “See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.”"
Zechariah,6,9,"The word of the LORD also came to me, saying,"
Zechariah,6,10,"“Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon."
Zechariah,6,11,"Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest."
Zechariah,6,12,"Then say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, “Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD."
Zechariah,6,13,"Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.”’"
Zechariah,6,14,"Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah."
Zechariah,6,15,Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.” Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.
Zechariah,7,1,"In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev."
Zechariah,7,2,"Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD,"
Zechariah,7,3,"speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, “Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?”"
Zechariah,7,4,"Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,"
Zechariah,7,5,"“Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted?"
Zechariah,7,6,"When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves?"
Zechariah,7,7,"Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?’”"
Zechariah,7,8,"Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,"
Zechariah,7,9,"“Thus has the LORD of hosts said, ‘Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother;"
Zechariah,7,10,"and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.’"
Zechariah,7,11,But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing.
Zechariah,7,12,They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts.
Zechariah,7,13,"And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,” says the LORD of hosts;"
Zechariah,7,14,"“but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.”"
Zechariah,8,1,"Then the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying,"
Zechariah,8,2,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.’"
Zechariah,8,3,"Thus says the LORD, ‘I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts will be called the Holy Mountain.’"
Zechariah,8,4,"Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age."
Zechariah,8,5,And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.’
Zechariah,8,6,"Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?’ declares the LORD of hosts."
Zechariah,8,7,"Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west;"
Zechariah,8,8,"and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.’"
Zechariah,8,9,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built."
Zechariah,8,10,"For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another."
Zechariah,8,11,"But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,’ declares the LORD of hosts."
Zechariah,8,12,"‘For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things."
Zechariah,8,13,"It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.’"
Zechariah,8,14,"“For thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,’ says the LORD of hosts, ‘and I have not relented,"
Zechariah,8,15,so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear!
Zechariah,8,16,These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates.
Zechariah,8,17,"Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,’ declares the LORD.”"
Zechariah,8,18,"Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,"
Zechariah,8,19,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.’"
Zechariah,8,20,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities."
Zechariah,8,21,"The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, “Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.”"
Zechariah,8,22,So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.’
Zechariah,8,23,"Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, “Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.”’”"
Zechariah,9,1,"The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD),"
Zechariah,9,2,"And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise."
Zechariah,9,3,"For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets."
Zechariah,9,4,"Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire."
Zechariah,9,5,"Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited."
Zechariah,9,6,"And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines."
Zechariah,9,7,"And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite."
Zechariah,9,8,"But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes."
Zechariah,9,9,"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
Zechariah,9,10,"I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth."
Zechariah,9,11,"As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit."
Zechariah,9,12,"Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you."
Zechariah,9,13,"For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior’s sword."
Zechariah,9,14,"Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south."
Zechariah,9,15,"The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink and be boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin, Drenched like the corners of the altar."
Zechariah,9,16,"And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land."
Zechariah,9,17,"For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins."
Zechariah,10,1,"Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain— The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man."
Zechariah,10,2,"For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd."
Zechariah,10,3,"“My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle."
Zechariah,10,4,"“From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, all of them together."
Zechariah,10,5,"“They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemy in the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame."
Zechariah,10,6,"“I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them."
Zechariah,10,7,"“Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD."
Zechariah,10,8,"“I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before."
Zechariah,10,9,"“When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back."
Zechariah,10,10,“I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them.
Zechariah,10,11,"“And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart."
Zechariah,10,12,"“And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,” declares the LORD."
Zechariah,11,1,"Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars."
Zechariah,11,2,"Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down."
Zechariah,11,3,"There is a sound of the shepherds’ wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions’ roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined."
Zechariah,11,4,"Thus says the LORD my God, “Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter."
Zechariah,11,5,"Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, ‘Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!’ And their own shepherds have no pity on them."
Zechariah,11,6,"For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,” declares the LORD; “but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another’s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power.”"
Zechariah,11,7,"So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock."
Zechariah,11,8,"Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me."
Zechariah,11,9,"Then I said, “I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another’s flesh.”"
Zechariah,11,10,"I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples."
Zechariah,11,11,"So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD."
Zechariah,11,12,"I said to them, “If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!” So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages."
Zechariah,11,13,"Then the LORD said to me, “Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.” So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD."
Zechariah,11,14,"Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel."
Zechariah,11,15,"The LORD said to me, “Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd."
Zechariah,11,16,"For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs."
Zechariah,11,17,“Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.”
Zechariah,12,1,"The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him,"
Zechariah,12,2,"“Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah."
Zechariah,12,3,It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it.
Zechariah,12,4,"In that day,” declares the LORD, “I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness."
Zechariah,12,5,"Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, ‘A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.’"
Zechariah,12,6,"“In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem."
Zechariah,12,7,"The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah."
Zechariah,12,8,"In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them."
Zechariah,12,9,And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
Zechariah,12,10,"“I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn."
Zechariah,12,11,"In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo."
Zechariah,12,12,"The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves;"
Zechariah,12,13,the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves;
Zechariah,12,14,"all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves."
Zechariah,13,1,"“In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity."
Zechariah,13,2,"“It will come about in that day,” declares the LORD of hosts, “that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land."
Zechariah,13,3,"And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, ‘You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD’; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies."
Zechariah,13,4,"Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive;"
Zechariah,13,5,"but he will say, ‘I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.’"
Zechariah,13,6,"And one will say to him, ‘What are these wounds between your arms?’ Then he will say, ‘Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.’"
Zechariah,13,7,"“Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,” Declares the LORD of hosts. “Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones."
Zechariah,13,8,"“It will come about in all the land,” Declares the LORD, “That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it."
Zechariah,13,9,"“And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, ‘They are My people,’ And they will say, ‘The LORD is my God.’”"
Zechariah,14,1,"Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you."
Zechariah,14,2,"For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city."
Zechariah,14,3,"Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle."
Zechariah,14,4,"In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south."
Zechariah,14,5,"You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him!"
Zechariah,14,6,In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle.
Zechariah,14,7,"For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light."
Zechariah,14,8,"And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter."
Zechariah,14,9,"And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one."
Zechariah,14,10,"All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin’s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king’s wine presses."
Zechariah,14,11,"People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security."
Zechariah,14,12,"Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth."
Zechariah,14,13,"It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another’s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another."
Zechariah,14,14,"Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance."
Zechariah,14,15,"So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps."
Zechariah,14,16,"Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths."
Zechariah,14,17,"And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them."
Zechariah,14,18,"If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths."
Zechariah,14,19,"This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths."
Zechariah,14,20,"In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, “HOLY TO THE LORD.” And the cooking pots in the LORD’S house will be like the bowls before the altar."
Zechariah,14,21,Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.
Malachi,1,1,The oracle of the word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi.
Malachi,1,2,"“I have loved you,” says the LORD. But you say, “How have You loved us?” “Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” declares the LORD. “Yet I have loved Jacob;"
Malachi,1,3,"but I have hated Esau, and I have made his mountains a desolation and appointed his inheritance for the jackals of the wilderness.”"
Malachi,1,4,"Though Edom says, “We have been beaten down, but we will return and build up the ruins”; thus says the LORD of hosts, “They may build, but I will tear down; and men will call them the wicked territory, and the people toward whom the LORD is indignant forever.”"
Malachi,1,5,"Your eyes will see this and you will say, “The LORD be magnified beyond the border of Israel!”"
Malachi,1,6,"“‘A son honors his father, and a servant his master. Then if I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is My respect?’ says the LORD of hosts to you, O priests who despise My name. But you say, ‘How have we despised Your name?’"
Malachi,1,7,"You are presenting defiled food upon My altar. But you say, ‘How have we defiled You?’ In that you say, ‘The table of the LORD is to be despised.’"
Malachi,1,8,"But when you present the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And when you present the lame and sick, is it not evil? Why not offer it to your governor? Would he be pleased with you? Or would he receive you kindly?” says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,1,9,"“But now will you not entreat God’s favor, that He may be gracious to us? With such an offering on your part, will He receive any of you kindly?” says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,1,10,"“Oh that there were one among you who would shut the gates, that you might not uselessly kindle fire on My altar! I am not pleased with you,” says the LORD of hosts, “nor will I accept an offering from you."
Malachi,1,11,"For from the rising of the sun even to its setting, My name will be great among the nations, and in every place incense is going to be offered to My name, and a grain offering that is pure; for My name will be great among the nations,” says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,1,12,"“But you are profaning it, in that you say, ‘The table of the Lord is defiled, and as for its fruit, its food is to be despised.’"
Malachi,1,13,"You also say, ‘My, how tiresome it is!’ And you disdainfully sniff at it,” says the LORD of hosts, “and you bring what was taken by robbery and what is lame or sick; so you bring the offering! Should I receive that from your hand?” says the LORD."
Malachi,1,14,"“But cursed be the swindler who has a male in his flock and vows it, but sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord, for I am a great King,” says the LORD of hosts, “and My name is feared among the nations.”"
Malachi,2,1,"“And now this commandment is for you, O priests."
Malachi,2,2,"If you do not listen, and if you do not take it to heart to give honor to My name,” says the LORD of hosts, “then I will send the curse upon you and I will curse your blessings; and indeed, I have cursed them already, because you are not taking it to heart."
Malachi,2,3,"Behold, I am going to rebuke your offspring, and I will spread refuse on your faces, the refuse of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it."
Malachi,2,4,"Then you will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that My covenant may continue with Levi,” says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,2,5,"“My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave them to him as an object of reverence; so he revered Me and stood in awe of My name."
Malachi,2,6,"True instruction was in his mouth and unrighteousness was not found on his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many back from iniquity."
Malachi,2,7,"For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and men should seek instruction from his mouth; for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,2,8,"But as for you, you have turned aside from the way; you have caused many to stumble by the instruction; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi,” says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,2,9,"“So I also have made you despised and abased before all the people, just as you are not keeping My ways but are showing partiality in the instruction."
Malachi,2,10,“Do we not all have one father? Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously each against his brother so as to profane the covenant of our fathers?
Malachi,2,11,"Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD which He loves and has married the daughter of a foreign god."
Malachi,2,12,"As for the man who does this, may the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob everyone who awakes and answers, or who presents an offering to the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,2,13,"“This is another thing you do: you cover the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping and with groaning, because He no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand."
Malachi,2,14,"Yet you say, ‘For what reason?’ Because the LORD has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant."
Malachi,2,15,"But not one has done so who has a remnant of the Spirit. And what did that one do while he was seeking a godly offspring? Take heed then to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of your youth."
Malachi,2,16,"For I hate divorce,” says the LORD, the God of Israel, “and him who covers his garment with wrong,” says the LORD of hosts. “So take heed to your spirit, that you do not deal treacherously.”"
Malachi,2,17,"You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you say, “How have we wearied Him?” In that you say, “Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and He delights in them,” or, “Where is the God of justice?”"
Malachi,3,1,"“Behold, I am going to send My messenger, and he will clear the way before Me. And the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to His temple; and the messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight, behold, He is coming,” says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,3,2,“But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner’s fire and like fullers’ soap.
Malachi,3,3,"He will sit as a smelter and purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, so that they may present to the LORD offerings in righteousness."
Malachi,3,4,Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years.
Malachi,3,5,"“Then I will draw near to you for judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against those who swear falsely, and against those who oppress the wage earner in his wages, the widow and the orphan, and those who turn aside the alien and do not fear Me,” says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,3,6,"“For I, the LORD, do not change; therefore you, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed."
Malachi,3,7,"“From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you,” says the LORD of hosts. “But you say, ‘How shall we return?’"
Malachi,3,8,"“Will a man rob God? Yet you are robbing Me! But you say, ‘How have we robbed You?’ In tithes and offerings."
Malachi,3,9,"You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing Me, the whole nation of you!"
Malachi,3,10,"Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in My house, and test Me now in this,” says the LORD of hosts, “if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows."
Malachi,3,11,"Then I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of the ground; nor will your vine in the field cast its grapes,” says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,3,12,"“All the nations will call you blessed, for you shall be a delightful land,” says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,3,13,"“Your words have been arrogant against Me,” says the LORD. “Yet you say, ‘What have we spoken against You?’"
Malachi,3,14,"You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept His charge, and that we have walked in mourning before the LORD of hosts?"
Malachi,3,15,So now we call the arrogant blessed; not only are the doers of wickedness built up but they also test God and escape.’”
Malachi,3,16,"Then those who feared the LORD spoke to one another, and the LORD gave attention and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the LORD and who esteem His name."
Malachi,3,17,"“They will be Mine,” says the LORD of hosts, “on the day that I prepare My own possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him.”"
Malachi,3,18,"So you will again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him."
Malachi,4,1,"“For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace; and all the arrogant and every evildoer will be chaff; and the day that is coming will set them ablaze,” says the LORD of hosts, “so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.”"
Malachi,4,2,"“But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings; and you will go forth and skip about like calves from the stall."
Malachi,4,3,"You will tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day which I am preparing,” says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,4,4,"“Remember the law of Moses My servant, even the statutes and ordinances which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel."
Malachi,4,5,"“Behold, I am going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD."
Malachi,4,6,"He will restore the hearts of the fathers to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers, so that I will not come and smite the land with a curse.”"
Matthew,1,1,"The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham:"
Matthew,1,2,"Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers."
Matthew,1,3,"Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez was the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram."
Matthew,1,4,"Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon."
Matthew,1,5,"Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz was the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse."
Matthew,1,6,Jesse was the father of David the king. David was the father of Solomon by Bathsheba who had been the wife of Uriah.
Matthew,1,7,"Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa."
Matthew,1,8,"Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah."
Matthew,1,9,"Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah."
Matthew,1,10,"Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah."
Matthew,1,11,"Josiah became the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon."
Matthew,1,12,"After the deportation to Babylon: Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel."
Matthew,1,13,"Zerubbabel was the father of Abihud, Abihud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor."
Matthew,1,14,"Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud."
Matthew,1,15,"Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob."
Matthew,1,16,"Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called the Messiah."
Matthew,1,17,"So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations."
Matthew,1,18,"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit."
Matthew,1,19,"And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her, planned to send her away secretly."
Matthew,1,20,"But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit."
Matthew,1,21,"She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.”"
Matthew,1,22,Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet:
Matthew,1,23,"“BEHOLD, THE VIRGIN SHALL BE WITH CHILD AND SHALL BEAR A SON, AND THEY SHALL CALL HIS NAME IMMANUEL,” which translated means, “GOD WITH US.”"
Matthew,1,24,"And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took Mary as his wife,"
Matthew,1,25,but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he called His name Jesus.
Matthew,2,1,"Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying,"
Matthew,2,2,“Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.”
Matthew,2,3,"When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him."
Matthew,2,4,"Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born."
Matthew,2,5,"They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea; for this is what has been written by the prophet:"
Matthew,2,6,"‘AND YOU, BETHLEHEM, LAND OF JUDAH, ARE BY NO MEANS LEAST AMONG THE LEADERS OF JUDAH; FOR OUT OF YOU SHALL COME FORTH A RULER WHO WILL SHEPHERD MY PEOPLE ISRAEL.’”"
Matthew,2,7,Then Herod secretly called the magi and determined from them the exact time the star appeared.
Matthew,2,8,"And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the Child; and when you have found Him, report to me, so that I too may come and worship Him.”"
Matthew,2,9,"After hearing the king, they went their way; and the star, which they had seen in the east, went on before them until it came and stood over the place where the Child was."
Matthew,2,10,"When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy."
Matthew,2,11,"After coming into the house they saw the Child with Mary His mother; and they fell to the ground and worshiped Him. Then, opening their treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh."
Matthew,2,12,"And having been warned by God in a dream not to return to Herod, the magi left for their own country by another way."
Matthew,2,13,"Now when they had gone, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up! Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the Child to destroy Him.”"
Matthew,2,14,"So Joseph got up and took the Child and His mother while it was still night, and left for Egypt."
Matthew,2,15,He remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: “OUT OF EGYPT I CALLED MY SON.”
Matthew,2,16,"Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the magi, he became very enraged, and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and all its vicinity, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the magi."
Matthew,2,17,Then what had been spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:
Matthew,2,18,"“A VOICE WAS HEARD IN RAMAH, WEEPING AND GREAT MOURNING, RACHEL WEEPING FOR HER CHILDREN; AND SHE REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED, BECAUSE THEY WERE NO MORE.”"
Matthew,2,19,"But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said,"
Matthew,2,20,"“Get up, take the Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel; for those who sought the Child’s life are dead.”"
Matthew,2,21,"So Joseph got up, took the Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel."
Matthew,2,22,"But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Then after being warned by God in a dream, he left for the regions of Galilee,"
Matthew,2,23,and came and lived in a city called Nazareth. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets: “He shall be called a Nazarene.”
Matthew,3,1,"Now in those days John the Baptist *came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying,"
Matthew,3,2,"“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”"
Matthew,3,3,"For this is the one referred to by Isaiah the prophet when he said, “THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, ‘MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT!’”"
Matthew,3,4,Now John himself had a garment of camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
Matthew,3,5,"Then Jerusalem was going out to him, and all Judea and all the district around the Jordan;"
Matthew,3,6,"and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins."
Matthew,3,7,"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Matthew,3,8,Therefore bear fruit in keeping with repentance;
Matthew,3,9,"and do not suppose that you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father’; for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham."
Matthew,3,10,The axe is already laid at the root of the trees; therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Matthew,3,11,"“As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
Matthew,3,12,"His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor; and He will gather His wheat into the barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”"
Matthew,3,13,"Then Jesus *arrived from Galilee at the Jordan coming to John, to be baptized by him."
Matthew,3,14,"But John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?”"
Matthew,3,15,"But Jesus answering said to him, “Permit it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he *permitted Him."
Matthew,3,16,"After being baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and lighting on Him,"
Matthew,3,17,"and behold, a voice out of the heavens said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased.”"
Matthew,4,1,Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
Matthew,4,2,"And after He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He then became hungry."
Matthew,4,3,"And the tempter came and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.”"
Matthew,4,4,"But He answered and said, “It is written, ‘MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD.’”"
Matthew,4,5,"Then the devil *took Him into the holy city and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple,"
Matthew,4,6,"and *said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down; for it is written, ‘HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING YOU’; and ‘ON their HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP, SO THAT YOU WILL NOT STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.’”"
Matthew,4,7,"Jesus said to him, “On the other hand, it is written, ‘YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.’”"
Matthew,4,8,"Again, the devil *took Him to a very high mountain and *showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory;"
Matthew,4,9,"and he said to Him, “All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me.”"
Matthew,4,10,"Then Jesus *said to him, “Go, Satan! For it is written, ‘YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD, AND SERVE HIM ONLY.’”"
Matthew,4,11,"Then the devil *left Him; and behold, angels came and began to minister to Him."
Matthew,4,12,"Now when Jesus heard that John had been taken into custody, He withdrew into Galilee;"
Matthew,4,13,"and leaving Nazareth, He came and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali."
Matthew,4,14,This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet:
Matthew,4,15,"“THE LAND OF ZEBULUN AND THE LAND OF NAPHTALI, BY THE WAY OF THE SEA, BEYOND THE JORDAN, GALILEE OF THE GENTILES—"
Matthew,4,16,"“THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SITTING IN DARKNESS SAW A GREAT LIGHT, AND THOSE WHO WERE SITTING IN THE LAND AND SHADOW OF DEATH, UPON THEM A LIGHT DAWNED.”"
Matthew,4,17,"From that time Jesus began to preach and say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”"
Matthew,4,18,"Now as Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon who was called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen."
Matthew,4,19,"And He *said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.”"
Matthew,4,20,Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.
Matthew,4,21,"Going on from there He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them."
Matthew,4,22,"Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him."
Matthew,4,23,"Jesus was going throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people."
Matthew,4,24,"The news about Him spread throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all who were ill, those suffering with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics; and He healed them."
Matthew,4,25,Large crowds followed Him from Galilee and the Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan.
Matthew,5,1,"When Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain; and after He sat down, His disciples came to Him."
Matthew,5,2,"He opened His mouth and began to teach them, saying,"
Matthew,5,3,"“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,5,4,"“Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted."
Matthew,5,5,"“Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth."
Matthew,5,6,"“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied."
Matthew,5,7,"“Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy."
Matthew,5,8,"“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
Matthew,5,9,"“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God."
Matthew,5,10,"“Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,5,11,"“Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me."
Matthew,5,12,"Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you."
Matthew,5,13,"“You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men."
Matthew,5,14,“You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden;
Matthew,5,15,"nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house."
Matthew,5,16,"Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven."
Matthew,5,17,“Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.
Matthew,5,18,"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished."
Matthew,5,19,"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,5,20,"“For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,5,21,"“You have heard that the ancients were told, ‘YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT MURDER’ and ‘Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.’"
Matthew,5,22,"But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court; and whoever says to his brother, ‘You good-for-nothing,’ shall be guilty before the supreme court; and whoever says, ‘You fool,’ shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell."
Matthew,5,23,"Therefore if you are presenting your offering at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,"
Matthew,5,24,"leave your offering there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your offering."
Matthew,5,25,"Make friends quickly with your opponent at law while you are with him on the way, so that your opponent may not hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison."
Matthew,5,26,"Truly I say to you, you will not come out of there until you have paid up the last cent."
Matthew,5,27,"“You have heard that it was said, ‘YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY’;"
Matthew,5,28,but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Matthew,5,29,"If your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell."
Matthew,5,30,"If your right hand makes you stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to go into hell."
Matthew,5,31,"“It was said, ‘WHOEVER SENDS HIS WIFE AWAY, LET HIM GIVE HER A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE’;"
Matthew,5,32,"but I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for the reason of unchastity, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery."
Matthew,5,33,"“Again, you have heard that the ancients were told, ‘YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FALSE VOWS, BUT SHALL FULFILL YOUR VOWS TO THE LORD.’"
Matthew,5,34,"But I say to you, make no oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,"
Matthew,5,35,"or by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is THE CITY OF THE GREAT KING."
Matthew,5,36,"Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black."
Matthew,5,37,"But let your statement be, ‘Yes, yes’ or ‘No, no’; anything beyond these is of evil."
Matthew,5,38,"“You have heard that it was said, ‘AN EYE FOR AN EYE, AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH.’"
Matthew,5,39,"But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also."
Matthew,5,40,"If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat also."
Matthew,5,41,"Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two."
Matthew,5,42,"Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you."
Matthew,5,43,"“You have heard that it was said, ‘YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR and hate your enemy.’"
Matthew,5,44,"But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,"
Matthew,5,45,"so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous."
Matthew,5,46,"For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?"
Matthew,5,47,"If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?"
Matthew,5,48,"Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
Matthew,6,1,“Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.
Matthew,6,2,"“So when you give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be honored by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full."
Matthew,6,3,"But when you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,"
Matthew,6,4,so that your giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
Matthew,6,5,"“When you pray, you are not to be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full."
Matthew,6,6,"But you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you."
Matthew,6,7,"“And when you are praying, do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do, for they suppose that they will be heard for their many words."
Matthew,6,8,So do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
Matthew,6,9,"“Pray, then, in this way: ‘Our Father who is in heaven, Hallowed be Your name."
Matthew,6,10,"‘Your kingdom come. Your will be done, On earth as it is in heaven."
Matthew,6,11,‘Give us this day our daily bread.
Matthew,6,12,"‘And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors."
Matthew,6,13,"‘And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. [For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.’]"
Matthew,6,14,"For if you forgive others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you."
Matthew,6,15,"But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions."
Matthew,6,16,"“Whenever you fast, do not put on a gloomy face as the hypocrites do, for they neglect their appearance so that they will be noticed by men when they are fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full."
Matthew,6,17,"But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face"
Matthew,6,18,"so that your fasting will not be noticed by men, but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you."
Matthew,6,19,"“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal."
Matthew,6,20,"But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal;"
Matthew,6,21,"for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
Matthew,6,22,"“The eye is the lamp of the body; so then if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light."
Matthew,6,23,"But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!"
Matthew,6,24,"“No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth."
Matthew,6,25,"“For this reason I say to you, do not be worried about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?"
Matthew,6,26,"Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they?"
Matthew,6,27,And who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life?
Matthew,6,28,"And why are you worried about clothing? Observe how the lilies of the field grow; they do not toil nor do they spin,"
Matthew,6,29,yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.
Matthew,6,30,"But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you? You of little faith!"
Matthew,6,31,"Do not worry then, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear for clothing?’"
Matthew,6,32,For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
Matthew,6,33,"But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."
Matthew,6,34,“So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Matthew,7,1,“Do not judge so that you will not be judged.
Matthew,7,2,"For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you."
Matthew,7,3,"Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?"
Matthew,7,4,"Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ and behold, the log is in your own eye?"
Matthew,7,5,"You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye."
Matthew,7,6,"“Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, or they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces."
Matthew,7,7,"“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."
Matthew,7,8,"For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened."
Matthew,7,9,"Or what man is there among you who, when his son asks for a loaf, will give him a stone?"
Matthew,7,10,"Or if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he?"
Matthew,7,11,"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask Him!"
Matthew,7,12,"“In everything, therefore, treat people the same way you want them to treat you, for this is the Law and the Prophets."
Matthew,7,13,"“Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it."
Matthew,7,14,"For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it."
Matthew,7,15,"“Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves."
Matthew,7,16,"You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they?"
Matthew,7,17,"So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit."
Matthew,7,18,"A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit."
Matthew,7,19,Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Matthew,7,20,"So then, you will know them by their fruits."
Matthew,7,21,"“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter."
Matthew,7,22,"Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?’"
Matthew,7,23,"And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.’"
Matthew,7,24,"“Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock."
Matthew,7,25,"And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock."
Matthew,7,26,"Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand."
Matthew,7,27,"The rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and great was its fall.”"
Matthew,7,28,"When Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were amazed at His teaching;"
Matthew,7,29,"for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as their scribes."
Matthew,8,1,"When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him."
Matthew,8,2,"And a leper came to Him and bowed down before Him, and said, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”"
Matthew,8,3,"Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed.” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed."
Matthew,8,4,"And Jesus *said to him, “See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”"
Matthew,8,5,"And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, imploring Him,"
Matthew,8,6,"and saying, “Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, fearfully tormented.”"
Matthew,8,7,"Jesus *said to him, “I will come and heal him.”"
Matthew,8,8,"But the centurion said, “Lord, I am not worthy for You to come under my roof, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
Matthew,8,9,"For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”"
Matthew,8,10,"Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those who were following, “Truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith with anyone in Israel."
Matthew,8,11,"I say to you that many will come from east and west, and recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;"
Matthew,8,12,but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
Matthew,8,13,"And Jesus said to the centurion, “Go; it shall be done for you as you have believed.” And the servant was healed that very moment."
Matthew,8,14,"When Jesus came into Peter’s home, He saw his mother-in-law lying sick in bed with a fever."
Matthew,8,15,"He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up and waited on Him."
Matthew,8,16,"When evening came, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed; and He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were ill."
Matthew,8,17,This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet: “HE HIMSELF TOOK OUR INFIRMITIES AND CARRIED AWAY OUR DISEASES.”
Matthew,8,18,"Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side of the sea."
Matthew,8,19,"Then a scribe came and said to Him, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.”"
Matthew,8,20,"Jesus *said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.”"
Matthew,8,21,"Another of the disciples said to Him, “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.”"
Matthew,8,22,"But Jesus *said to him, “Follow Me, and allow the dead to bury their own dead.”"
Matthew,8,23,"When He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him."
Matthew,8,24,"And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being covered with the waves; but Jesus Himself was asleep."
Matthew,8,25,"And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, “Save us, Lord; we are perishing!”"
Matthew,8,26,"He *said to them, “Why are you afraid, you men of little faith?” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it became perfectly calm."
Matthew,8,27,"The men were amazed, and said, “What kind of a man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”"
Matthew,8,28,"When He came to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, two men who were demon-possessed met Him as they were coming out of the tombs. They were so extremely violent that no one could pass by that way."
Matthew,8,29,"And they cried out, saying, “What business do we have with each other, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?”"
Matthew,8,30,Now there was a herd of many swine feeding at a distance from them.
Matthew,8,31,"The demons began to entreat Him, saying, “If You are going to cast us out, send us into the herd of swine.”"
Matthew,8,32,"And He said to them, “Go!” And they came out and went into the swine, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters."
Matthew,8,33,"The herdsmen ran away, and went to the city and reported everything, including what had happened to the demoniacs."
Matthew,8,34,"And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they implored Him to leave their region."
Matthew,9,1,"Getting into a boat, Jesus crossed over the sea and came to His own city."
Matthew,9,2,"And they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, “Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven.”"
Matthew,9,3,"And some of the scribes said to themselves, “This fellow blasphemes.”"
Matthew,9,4,"And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, “Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?"
Matthew,9,5,"Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, and walk’?"
Matthew,9,6,"But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—then He *said to the paralytic, “Get up, pick up your bed and go home.”"
Matthew,9,7,And he got up and went home.
Matthew,9,8,"But when the crowds saw this, they were awestruck, and glorified God, who had given such authority to men."
Matthew,9,9,"As Jesus went on from there, He saw a man called Matthew, sitting in the tax collector’s booth; and He *said to him, “Follow Me!” And he got up and followed Him."
Matthew,9,10,"Then it happened that as Jesus was reclining at the table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were dining with Jesus and His disciples."
Matthew,9,11,"When the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, “Why is your Teacher eating with the tax collectors and sinners?”"
Matthew,9,12,"But when Jesus heard this, He said, “It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick."
Matthew,9,13,"But go and learn what this means: ‘I DESIRE COMPASSION, AND NOT SACRIFICE,’ for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”"
Matthew,9,14,"Then the disciples of John *came to Him, asking, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?”"
Matthew,9,15,"And Jesus said to them, “The attendants of the bridegroom cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast."
Matthew,9,16,"But no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results."
Matthew,9,17,"Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out and the wineskins are ruined; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.”"
Matthew,9,18,"While He was saying these things to them, a synagogue official came and bowed down before Him, and said, “My daughter has just died; but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live.”"
Matthew,9,19,"Jesus got up and began to follow him, and so did His disciples."
Matthew,9,20,"And a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years, came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak;"
Matthew,9,21,"for she was saying to herself, “If I only touch His garment, I will get well.”"
Matthew,9,22,"But Jesus turning and seeing her said, “Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well.” At once the woman was made well."
Matthew,9,23,"When Jesus came into the official’s house, and saw the flute-players and the crowd in noisy disorder,"
Matthew,9,24,"He said, “Leave; for the girl has not died, but is asleep.” And they began laughing at Him."
Matthew,9,25,"But when the crowd had been sent out, He entered and took her by the hand, and the girl got up."
Matthew,9,26,This news spread throughout all that land.
Matthew,9,27,"As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”"
Matthew,9,28,"When He entered the house, the blind men came up to Him, and Jesus *said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They *said to Him, “Yes, Lord.”"
Matthew,9,29,"Then He touched their eyes, saying, “It shall be done to you according to your faith.”"
Matthew,9,30,And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them: “See that no one knows about this!”
Matthew,9,31,But they went out and spread the news about Him throughout all that land.
Matthew,9,32,"As they were going out, a mute, demon-possessed man was brought to Him."
Matthew,9,33,"After the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds were amazed, and were saying, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.”"
Matthew,9,34,"But the Pharisees were saying, “He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons.”"
Matthew,9,35,"Jesus was going through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness."
Matthew,9,36,"Seeing the people, He felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd."
Matthew,9,37,"Then He *said to His disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
Matthew,9,38,Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest.”
Matthew,10,1,"Jesus summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and every kind of sickness."
Matthew,10,2,"Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;"
Matthew,10,3,"Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;"
Matthew,10,4,"Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed Him."
Matthew,10,5,"These twelve Jesus sent out after instructing them: “Do not go in the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter any city of the Samaritans;"
Matthew,10,6,but rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew,10,7,"And as you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’"
Matthew,10,8,"Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give."
Matthew,10,9,"Do not acquire gold, or silver, or copper for your money belts,"
Matthew,10,10,"or a bag for your journey, or even two coats, or sandals, or a staff; for the worker is worthy of his support."
Matthew,10,11,"And whatever city or village you enter, inquire who is worthy in it, and stay at his house until you leave that city."
Matthew,10,12,"As you enter the house, give it your greeting."
Matthew,10,13,"If the house is worthy, give it your blessing of peace. But if it is not worthy, take back your blessing of peace."
Matthew,10,14,"Whoever does not receive you, nor heed your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake the dust off your feet."
Matthew,10,15,"Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city."
Matthew,10,16,"“Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves."
Matthew,10,17,"But beware of men, for they will hand you over to the courts and scourge you in their synagogues;"
Matthew,10,18,"and you will even be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles."
Matthew,10,19,"But when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you are to say; for it will be given you in that hour what you are to say."
Matthew,10,20,"For it is not you who speak, but it is the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you."
Matthew,10,21,"“Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death."
Matthew,10,22,"You will be hated by all because of My name, but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved."
Matthew,10,23,"“But whenever they persecute you in one city, flee to the next; for truly I say to you, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes."
Matthew,10,24,"“A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master."
Matthew,10,25,"It is enough for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the head of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign the members of his household!"
Matthew,10,26,"“Therefore do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known."
Matthew,10,27,"What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops."
Matthew,10,28,Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
Matthew,10,29,Are not two sparrows sold for a cent? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
Matthew,10,30,But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Matthew,10,31,So do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows.
Matthew,10,32,"“Therefore everyone who confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father who is in heaven."
Matthew,10,33,"But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven."
Matthew,10,34,"“Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword."
Matthew,10,35,"For I came to SET A MAN AGAINST HIS FATHER, AND A DAUGHTER AGAINST HER MOTHER, AND A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AGAINST HER MOTHER-IN-LAW;"
Matthew,10,36,and A MAN’S ENEMIES WILL BE THE MEMBERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD.
Matthew,10,37,“He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.
Matthew,10,38,And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.
Matthew,10,39,"He who has found his life will lose it, and he who has lost his life for My sake will find it."
Matthew,10,40,"“He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me."
Matthew,10,41,He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.
Matthew,10,42,"And whoever in the name of a disciple gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water to drink, truly I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.”"
Matthew,11,1,"When Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He departed from there to teach and preach in their cities."
Matthew,11,2,"Now when John, while imprisoned, heard of the works of Christ, he sent word by his disciples"
Matthew,11,3,"and said to Him, “Are You the Expected One, or shall we look for someone else?”"
Matthew,11,4,"Jesus answered and said to them, “Go and report to John what you hear and see:"
Matthew,11,5,"the BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM."
Matthew,11,6,And blessed is he who does not take offense at Me.”
Matthew,11,7,"As these men were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
Matthew,11,8,But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Those who wear soft clothing are in kings’ palaces!
Matthew,11,9,"But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and one who is more than a prophet."
Matthew,11,10,"This is the one about whom it is written, ‘BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER AHEAD OF YOU, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU.’"
Matthew,11,11,"Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist! Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
Matthew,11,12,"From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and violent men take it by force."
Matthew,11,13,For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
Matthew,11,14,"And if you are willing to accept it, John himself is Elijah who was to come."
Matthew,11,15,"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
Matthew,11,16,"“But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the market places, who call out to the other children,"
Matthew,11,17,"and say, ‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.’"
Matthew,11,18,"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’"
Matthew,11,19,"The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.”"
Matthew,11,20,"Then He began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles were done, because they did not repent."
Matthew,11,21,"“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had occurred in Tyre and Sidon which occurred in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
Matthew,11,22,"Nevertheless I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you."
Matthew,11,23,"And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will descend to Hades; for if the miracles had occurred in Sodom which occurred in you, it would have remained to this day."
Matthew,11,24,"Nevertheless I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for you.”"
Matthew,11,25,"At that time Jesus said, “I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Matthew,11,26,"Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight."
Matthew,11,27,"All things have been handed over to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him."
Matthew,11,28,"“Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest."
Matthew,11,29,"Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and YOU WILL FIND REST FOR YOUR SOULS."
Matthew,11,30,For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”
Matthew,12,1,"At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples became hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat."
Matthew,12,2,"But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to Him, “Look, Your disciples do what is not lawful to do on a Sabbath.”"
Matthew,12,3,"But He said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, he and his companions,"
Matthew,12,4,"how he entered the house of God, and they ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those with him, but for the priests alone?"
Matthew,12,5,"Or have you not read in the Law, that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and are innocent?"
Matthew,12,6,But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here.
Matthew,12,7,"But if you had known what this means, ‘I DESIRE COMPASSION, AND NOT A SACRIFICE,’ you would not have condemned the innocent."
Matthew,12,8,For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
Matthew,12,9,"Departing from there, He went into their synagogue."
Matthew,12,10,"And a man was there whose hand was withered. And they questioned Jesus, asking, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”—so that they might accuse Him."
Matthew,12,11,"And He said to them, “What man is there among you who has a sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it and lift it out?"
Matthew,12,12,"How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep! So then, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”"
Matthew,12,13,"Then He *said to the man, “Stretch out your hand!” He stretched it out, and it was restored to normal, like the other."
Matthew,12,14,"But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Him, as to how they might destroy Him."
Matthew,12,15,"But Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. Many followed Him, and He healed them all,"
Matthew,12,16,and warned them not to tell who He was.
Matthew,12,17,This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet:
Matthew,12,18,"“BEHOLD, MY SERVANT WHOM I HAVE CHOSEN; MY BELOVED IN WHOM MY SOUL is WELL-PLEASED; I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT UPON HIM, AND HE SHALL PROCLAIM JUSTICE TO THE GENTILES."
Matthew,12,19,"“HE WILL NOT QUARREL, NOR CRY OUT; NOR WILL ANYONE HEAR HIS VOICE IN THE STREETS."
Matthew,12,20,"“A BATTERED REED HE WILL NOT BREAK OFF, AND A SMOLDERING WICK HE WILL NOT PUT OUT, UNTIL HE LEADS JUSTICE TO VICTORY."
Matthew,12,21,“AND IN HIS NAME THE GENTILES WILL HOPE.”
Matthew,12,22,"Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Jesus, and He healed him, so that the mute man spoke and saw."
Matthew,12,23,"All the crowds were amazed, and were saying, “This man cannot be the Son of David, can he?”"
Matthew,12,24,"But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “This man casts out demons only by Beelzebul the ruler of the demons.”"
Matthew,12,25,"And knowing their thoughts Jesus said to them, “Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and any city or house divided against itself will not stand."
Matthew,12,26,"If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?"
Matthew,12,27,"If I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? For this reason they will be your judges."
Matthew,12,28,"But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you."
Matthew,12,29,"Or how can anyone enter the strong man’s house and carry off his property, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house."
Matthew,12,30,He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me scatters.
Matthew,12,31,"“Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven."
Matthew,12,32,"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come."
Matthew,12,33,"“Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit."
Matthew,12,34,"You brood of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak what is good? For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart."
Matthew,12,35,The good man brings out of his good treasure what is good; and the evil man brings out of his evil treasure what is evil.
Matthew,12,36,"But I tell you that every careless word that people speak, they shall give an accounting for it in the day of judgment."
Matthew,12,37,"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”"
Matthew,12,38,"Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.”"
Matthew,12,39,"But He answered and said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation craves for a sign; and yet no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet;"
Matthew,12,40,"for just as JONAH WAS THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE BELLY OF THE SEA MONSTER, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."
Matthew,12,41,"The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment, and will condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here."
Matthew,12,42,"The Queen of the South will rise up with this generation at the judgment and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here."
Matthew,12,43,"“Now when the unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and does not find it."
Matthew,12,44,"Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came’; and when it comes, it finds it unoccupied, swept, and put in order."
Matthew,12,45,"Then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. That is the way it will also be with this evil generation.”"
Matthew,12,46,"While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and brothers were standing outside, seeking to speak to Him."
Matthew,12,47,"Someone said to Him, “Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside seeking to speak to You.”"
Matthew,12,48,"But Jesus answered the one who was telling Him and said, “Who is My mother and who are My brothers?”"
Matthew,12,49,"And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, “Behold My mother and My brothers!"
Matthew,12,50,"For whoever does the will of My Father who is in heaven, he is My brother and sister and mother.”"
Matthew,13,1,That day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting by the sea.
Matthew,13,2,"And large crowds gathered to Him, so He got into a boat and sat down, and the whole crowd was standing on the beach."
Matthew,13,3,"And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, “Behold, the sower went out to sow;"
Matthew,13,4,"and as he sowed, some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate them up."
Matthew,13,5,"Others fell on the rocky places, where they did not have much soil; and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of soil."
Matthew,13,6,"But when the sun had risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away."
Matthew,13,7,"Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them out."
Matthew,13,8,"And others fell on the good soil and *yielded a crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty."
Matthew,13,9,"He who has ears, let him hear.”"
Matthew,13,10,"And the disciples came and said to Him, “Why do You speak to them in parables?”"
Matthew,13,11,"Jesus answered them, “To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted."
Matthew,13,12,"For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him."
Matthew,13,13,"Therefore I speak to them in parables; because while seeing they do not see, and while hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand."
Matthew,13,14,"In their case the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, ‘YOU WILL KEEP ON HEARING, BUT WILL NOT UNDERSTAND; YOU WILL KEEP ON SEEING, BUT WILL NOT PERCEIVE;"
Matthew,13,15,"FOR THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE HAS BECOME DULL, WITH THEIR EARS THEY SCARCELY HEAR, AND THEY HAVE CLOSED THEIR EYES, OTHERWISE THEY WOULD SEE WITH THEIR EYES, HEAR WITH THEIR EARS, AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART AND RETURN, AND I WOULD HEAL THEM.’"
Matthew,13,16,"But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear."
Matthew,13,17,"For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it."
Matthew,13,18,“Hear then the parable of the sower.
Matthew,13,19,"When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is the one on whom seed was sown beside the road."
Matthew,13,20,"The one on whom seed was sown on the rocky places, this is the man who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;"
Matthew,13,21,"yet he has no firm root in himself, but is only temporary, and when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away."
Matthew,13,22,"And the one on whom seed was sown among the thorns, this is the man who hears the word, and the worry of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful."
Matthew,13,23,"And the one on whom seed was sown on the good soil, this is the man who hears the word and understands it; who indeed bears fruit and brings forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.”"
Matthew,13,24,"Jesus presented another parable to them, saying, “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field."
Matthew,13,25,"But while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away."
Matthew,13,26,"But when the wheat sprouted and bore grain, then the tares became evident also."
Matthew,13,27,"The slaves of the landowner came and said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?’"
Matthew,13,28,"And he said to them, ‘An enemy has done this!’ The slaves *said to him, ‘Do you want us, then, to go and gather them up?’"
Matthew,13,29,"But he *said, ‘No; for while you are gathering up the tares, you may uproot the wheat with them."
Matthew,13,30,"Allow both to grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, “First gather up the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up; but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”"
Matthew,13,31,"He presented another parable to them, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;"
Matthew,13,32,"and this is smaller than all other seeds, but when it is full grown, it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that THE BIRDS OF THE AIR come and NEST IN ITS BRANCHES.”"
Matthew,13,33,"He spoke another parable to them, “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three pecks of flour until it was all leavened.”"
Matthew,13,34,"All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and He did not speak to them without a parable."
Matthew,13,35,This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: “I WILL OPEN MY MOUTH IN PARABLES; I WILL UTTER THINGS HIDDEN SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.”
Matthew,13,36,"Then He left the crowds and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.”"
Matthew,13,37,"And He said, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,"
Matthew,13,38,"and the field is the world; and as for the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one;"
Matthew,13,39,"and the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are angels."
Matthew,13,40,"So just as the tares are gathered up and burned with fire, so shall it be at the end of the age."
Matthew,13,41,"The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks, and those who commit lawlessness,"
Matthew,13,42,and will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew,13,43,"Then THE RIGHTEOUS WILL SHINE FORTH AS THE SUN in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear."
Matthew,13,44,"“The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field."
Matthew,13,45,"“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls,"
Matthew,13,46,"and upon finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it."
Matthew,13,47,"“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet cast into the sea, and gathering fish of every kind;"
Matthew,13,48,"and when it was filled, they drew it up on the beach; and they sat down and gathered the good fish into containers, but the bad they threw away."
Matthew,13,49,"So it will be at the end of the age; the angels will come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous,"
Matthew,13,50,and will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew,13,51,"“Have you understood all these things?” They *said to Him, “Yes.”"
Matthew,13,52,"And Jesus said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a head of a household, who brings out of his treasure things new and old.”"
Matthew,13,53,"When Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there."
Matthew,13,54,"He came to His hometown and began teaching them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?"
Matthew,13,55,"Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?"
Matthew,13,56,"And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this man get all these things?”"
Matthew,13,57,"And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household.”"
Matthew,13,58,And He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.
Matthew,14,1,"At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus,"
Matthew,14,2,"and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”"
Matthew,14,3,"For when Herod had John arrested, he bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip."
Matthew,14,4,"For John had been saying to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”"
Matthew,14,5,"Although Herod wanted to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they regarded John as a prophet."
Matthew,14,6,"But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod,"
Matthew,14,7,so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
Matthew,14,8,"Having been prompted by her mother, she *said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.”"
Matthew,14,9,"Although he was grieved, the king commanded it to be given because of his oaths, and because of his dinner guests."
Matthew,14,10,He sent and had John beheaded in the prison.
Matthew,14,11,"And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother."
Matthew,14,12,His disciples came and took away the body and buried it; and they went and reported to Jesus.
Matthew,14,13,"Now when Jesus heard about John, He withdrew from there in a boat to a secluded place by Himself; and when the people heard of this, they followed Him on foot from the cities."
Matthew,14,14,"When He went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and felt compassion for them and healed their sick."
Matthew,14,15,"When it was evening, the disciples came to Him and said, “This place is desolate and the hour is already late; so send the crowds away, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.”"
Matthew,14,16,"But Jesus said to them, “They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat!”"
Matthew,14,17,"They *said to Him, “We have here only five loaves and two fish.”"
Matthew,14,18,"And He said, “Bring them here to Me.”"
Matthew,14,19,"Ordering the people to sit down on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed the food, and breaking the loaves He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds,"
Matthew,14,20,"and they all ate and were satisfied. They picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve full baskets."
Matthew,14,21,"There were about five thousand men who ate, besides women and children."
Matthew,14,22,"Immediately He made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away."
Matthew,14,23,"After He had sent the crowds away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray; and when it was evening, He was there alone."
Matthew,14,24,"But the boat was already a long distance from the land, battered by the waves; for the wind was contrary."
Matthew,14,25,"And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea."
Matthew,14,26,"When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, “It is a ghost!” And they cried out in fear."
Matthew,14,27,"But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid.”"
Matthew,14,28,"Peter said to Him, “Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.”"
Matthew,14,29,"And He said, “Come!” And Peter got out of the boat, and walked on the water and came toward Jesus."
Matthew,14,30,"But seeing the wind, he became frightened, and beginning to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!”"
Matthew,14,31,"Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him, and *said to him, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?”"
Matthew,14,32,"When they got into the boat, the wind stopped."
Matthew,14,33,"And those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, “You are certainly God’s Son!”"
Matthew,14,34,"When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret."
Matthew,14,35,"And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent word into all that surrounding district and brought to Him all who were sick;"
Matthew,14,36,and they implored Him that they might just touch the fringe of His cloak; and as many as touched it were cured.
Matthew,15,1,"Then some Pharisees and scribes *came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said,"
Matthew,15,2,“Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.”
Matthew,15,3,"And He answered and said to them, “Why do you yourselves transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?"
Matthew,15,4,"For God said, ‘HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER,’ and, ‘HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH.’"
Matthew,15,5,"But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother, “Whatever I have that would help you has been given to God,”"
Matthew,15,6,he is not to honor his father or his mother.’ And by this you invalidated the word of God for the sake of your tradition.
Matthew,15,7,"You hypocrites, rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you:"
Matthew,15,8,"‘THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME."
Matthew,15,9,"‘BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.’”"
Matthew,15,10,"After Jesus called the crowd to Him, He said to them, “Hear and understand."
Matthew,15,11,"It is not what enters into the mouth that defiles the man, but what proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”"
Matthew,15,12,"Then the disciples *came and *said to Him, “Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?”"
Matthew,15,13,"But He answered and said, “Every plant which My heavenly Father did not plant shall be uprooted."
Matthew,15,14,"Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”"
Matthew,15,15,"Peter said to Him, “Explain the parable to us.”"
Matthew,15,16,"Jesus said, “Are you still lacking in understanding also?"
Matthew,15,17,"Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is eliminated?"
Matthew,15,18,"But the things that proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and those defile the man."
Matthew,15,19,"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders."
Matthew,15,20,These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.”
Matthew,15,21,"Jesus went away from there, and withdrew into the district of Tyre and Sidon."
Matthew,15,22,"And a Canaanite woman from that region came out and began to cry out, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is cruelly demon-possessed.”"
Matthew,15,23,"But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, “Send her away, because she keeps shouting at us.”"
Matthew,15,24,"But He answered and said, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”"
Matthew,15,25,"But she came and began to bow down before Him, saying, “Lord, help me!”"
Matthew,15,26,"And He answered and said, “It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”"
Matthew,15,27,"But she said, “Yes, Lord; but even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”"
Matthew,15,28,"Then Jesus said to her, “O woman, your faith is great; it shall be done for you as you wish.” And her daughter was healed at once."
Matthew,15,29,"Departing from there, Jesus went along by the Sea of Galilee, and having gone up on the mountain, He was sitting there."
Matthew,15,30,"And large crowds came to Him, bringing with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, mute, and many others, and they laid them down at His feet; and He healed them."
Matthew,15,31,"So the crowd marveled as they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel."
Matthew,15,32,"And Jesus called His disciples to Him, and said, “I feel compassion for the people, because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry, for they might faint on the way.”"
Matthew,15,33,"The disciples *said to Him, “Where would we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd?”"
Matthew,15,34,"And Jesus *said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” And they said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”"
Matthew,15,35,And He directed the people to sit down on the ground;
Matthew,15,36,"and He took the seven loaves and the fish; and giving thanks, He broke them and started giving them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people."
Matthew,15,37,"And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven large baskets full."
Matthew,15,38,"And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children."
Matthew,15,39,"And sending away the crowds, Jesus got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan."
Matthew,16,1,"The Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and testing Jesus, they asked Him to show them a sign from heaven."
Matthew,16,2,"But He replied to them, “When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’"
Matthew,16,3,"And in the morning, ‘There will be a storm today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ Do you know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but cannot discern the signs of the times?"
Matthew,16,4,"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and a sign will not be given it, except the sign of Jonah.” And He left them and went away."
Matthew,16,5,"And the disciples came to the other side of the sea, but they had forgotten to bring any bread."
Matthew,16,6,"And Jesus said to them, “Watch out and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”"
Matthew,16,7,"They began to discuss this among themselves, saying, “He said that because we did not bring any bread.”"
Matthew,16,8,"But Jesus, aware of this, said, “You men of little faith, why do you discuss among yourselves that you have no bread?"
Matthew,16,9,"Do you not yet understand or remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets full you picked up?"
Matthew,16,10,"Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many large baskets full you picked up?"
Matthew,16,11,How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
Matthew,16,12,"Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
Matthew,16,13,"Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, He was asking His disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”"
Matthew,16,14,"And they said, “Some say John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.”"
Matthew,16,15,"He *said to them, “But who do you say that I am?”"
Matthew,16,16,"Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”"
Matthew,16,17,"And Jesus said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven."
Matthew,16,18,"I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it."
Matthew,16,19,"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.”"
Matthew,16,20,Then He warned the disciples that they should tell no one that He was the Christ.
Matthew,16,21,"From that time Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day."
Matthew,16,22,"Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, “God forbid it, Lord! This shall never happen to You.”"
Matthew,16,23,"But He turned and said to Peter, “Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on God’s interests, but man’s.”"
Matthew,16,24,"Then Jesus said to His disciples, “If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me."
Matthew,16,25,For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.
Matthew,16,26,For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
Matthew,16,27,"For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and WILL THEN REPAY EVERY MAN ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS."
Matthew,16,28,"“Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.”"
Matthew,17,1,"Six days later Jesus *took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and *led them up on a high mountain by themselves."
Matthew,17,2,"And He was transfigured before them; and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as light."
Matthew,17,3,"And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him."
Matthew,17,4,"Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”"
Matthew,17,5,"While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud said, “This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased; listen to Him!”"
Matthew,17,6,"When the disciples heard this, they fell face down to the ground and were terrified."
Matthew,17,7,"And Jesus came to them and touched them and said, “Get up, and do not be afraid.”"
Matthew,17,8,"And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone."
Matthew,17,9,"As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, “Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”"
Matthew,17,10,"And His disciples asked Him, “Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”"
Matthew,17,11,"And He answered and said, “Elijah is coming and will restore all things;"
Matthew,17,12,"but I say to you that Elijah already came, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.”"
Matthew,17,13,Then the disciples understood that He had spoken to them about John the Baptist.
Matthew,17,14,"When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, falling on his knees before Him and saying,"
Matthew,17,15,"“Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic and is very ill; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water."
Matthew,17,16,"I brought him to Your disciples, and they could not cure him.”"
Matthew,17,17,"And Jesus answered and said, “You unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to Me.”"
