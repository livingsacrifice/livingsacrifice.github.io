Proverbs,30,1,THE WORDS of Agur son of Jakeh of Massa: The man says to Ithiel to Ithiel and to Ucal:
Proverbs,30,2,Surely I am too brutish and stupid to be called a man and I have not the understanding of a man [for all my secular learning is as nothing].
Proverbs,30,3,I have not learned skillful and godly Wisdom that I should have the knowledge or burden of the Holy One.
Proverbs,30,4,Who has ascended into heaven and descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the waters in His garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name and what is His Son's name if you know?
Proverbs,30,5,Every word of God is tried and purified; He is a shield to those who trust and take refuge in Him.
Proverbs,30,6,Add not to His words lest He reprove you and you be found a liar.
Proverbs,30,7,Two things have I asked of You [O Lord]; deny them not to me before I die:
Proverbs,30,8,Remove far from me falsehood and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me
Proverbs,30,9,Lest I be full and deny You and say Who is the Lord? Or lest I be poor and steal and so profane the name of my God.

Proverbs,30,20,This is the way of an adulterous woman: she eats and wipes her mouth and says I have done no wickedness.

Ecclesiastes,1,1,THE WORDS of the Preacher the son of David and king in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes,1,2,Vapor of vapors and futility of futilities says the Preacher. Vapor of vapors and futility of futilities! All is vanity (emptiness falsity and vainglory).
Ecclesiastes,1,3,What profit does man have left from all his toil at which he toils under the sun? [Is life worth living?]
Ecclesiastes,1,4,One generation goes and another generation comes but the earth remains forever.
Ecclesiastes,1,5,The sun also rises and the sun goes down and hastens to the place where it rises.
Ecclesiastes,1,6,The wind goes to the south and circles about to the north; it circles and circles about continually and on its circuit the wind returns again.
Ecclesiastes,1,7,All the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full. To the place from which the rivers come to there and from there they return again.
Ecclesiastes,1,8,All things are weary with toil and all words are feeble; man cannot utter it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing.
Ecclesiastes,1,9,The thing that has been--it is what will be again and that which has been done is that which will be done again; and there is nothing new under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,1,10,Is there a thing of which it may be said See this is new? It has already been in the vast ages of time [recorded or unrecorded] which were before us.
Ecclesiastes,1,11,There is no remembrance of former happenings or men neither will there be any remembrance of happenings of generations that are to come by those who are to come after them.
Ecclesiastes,1,12,I the Preacher have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes,1,13,And I applied myself by heart and mind to seek and search out by [human] wisdom all human activity under heaven. It is a miserable business which God has given to the sons of man with which to busy themselves.
Ecclesiastes,1,14,I have seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is vanity a striving after the wind and a feeding on wind.
Ecclesiastes,1,15,What is crooked cannot be made straight and what is defective and lacking cannot be counted.
Ecclesiastes,1,16,I entered into counsel with my own mind saying Behold I have acquired great [human] wisdom yes more than all who have been over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has had great experience of [moral] wisdom and [scientific] knowledge.
Ecclesiastes,1,17,And I gave my mind to know [practical] wisdom and to discern [the character of] madness and folly [in which men seem to find satisfaction]; I perceived that this also is a searching after wind and a feeding on it.
Ecclesiastes,1,18,For in much [human] wisdom is much vexation and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
Ecclesiastes,2,1,I SAID in my mind Come now I will prove you with mirth and test you with pleasure; so have a good time [enjoy pleasure]. But this also was vanity (emptiness falsity and futility)!
Ecclesiastes,2,2,I said of laughter It is mad and of pleasure What does it accomplish?
Ecclesiastes,2,3,I searched in my mind how to cheer my body with wine--yet at the same time having my mind hold its course and guide me with [human] wisdom--and how to lay hold of folly till I might see what was good for the sons of men to do under heaven all the days of their lives.
Ecclesiastes,2,4,I made great works; I built myself houses I planted vineyards.
Ecclesiastes,2,5,I made for myself gardens and orchards and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.
Ecclesiastes,2,6,I made for myself pools of water from which to water the forest and make the trees bud.
Ecclesiastes,2,7,I bought menservants and maidservants and had servants born in my house. Also I had great possessions of herds and flocks more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes,2,8,I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got for myself men singers and women singers and the delights of the sons of men--concubines very many.
Ecclesiastes,2,9,So I became great and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me and stood by me.
Ecclesiastes,2,10,And whatever my eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any pleasure for my heart rejoiced in all my labor and this was my portion and reward for all my toil.
Ecclesiastes,2,11,Then I looked on all that my hands had done and the labor I had spent in doing it and behold all was vanity and a striving after the wind and a feeding on it and there was no profit under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,2,12,So I turned to consider [human] wisdom and madness and folly; for what can the man do who succeeds the king? Nothing but what has been done already.
Ecclesiastes,2,13,Then I saw that even [human] wisdom [that brings sorrow] is better than [the pleasures of] folly as far as light is better than darkness.
Ecclesiastes,2,14,The wise man's eyes are in his head but the fool walks in darkness; and yet I perceived that [in the end] one event happens to them both.
Ecclesiastes,2,15,Then said I in my heart As it happens to the fool so it will happen even to me. And of what use is it then for me to be more wise? Then I said in my heart This also is vanity (emptiness vainglory and futility)!
Ecclesiastes,2,16,For of the wise man the same as of the fool there is no permanent remembrance since in the days to come all will be long forgotten. And how does the wise man die? Even as the fool!
Ecclesiastes,2,17,So I hated life because what is done under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a striving after the wind and a feeding on it.
Ecclesiastes,2,18,And I hated all my labor in which I had toiled under the sun seeing that I must leave it to the man who will succeed me.
Ecclesiastes,2,19,And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have dominion over all my labor in which I have toiled and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity (emptiness falsity and futility)!
Ecclesiastes,2,20,So I turned around and gave my heart up to despair over all the labor of my efforts under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,2,21,For here is a man whose labor is with wisdom and knowledge and skill; yet to a man who has not toiled for it he must leave it all as his portion. This also is vanity (emptiness falsity and futility) and a great evil!
Ecclesiastes,2,22,For what has a man left from all his labor and from the striving and vexation of his heart in which he has toiled under the sun?
Ecclesiastes,2,23,For all his days are but pain and sorrow and his work is a vexation and grief; his mind takes no rest even at night. This is also vanity (emptiness falsity and futility)!
Ecclesiastes,2,24,There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink and make himself enjoy good in his labor. Even this I have seen is from the hand of God.
Ecclesiastes,2,25,For who can eat or who can have enjoyment any more than I can--apart from Him?
Ecclesiastes,2,26,For to the person who pleases Him God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy; but to the sinner He gives the work of gathering and heaping up that he may give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after the wind and a feeding on it.
Ecclesiastes,3,1,TO EVERYTHING there is a season and a time for every matter or purpose under heaven:
Ecclesiastes,3,2,A time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up what is planted
Ecclesiastes,3,3,A time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up
Ecclesiastes,3,4,A time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance
Ecclesiastes,3,5,A time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing
Ecclesiastes,3,6,A time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away
Ecclesiastes,3,7,A time to rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak
Ecclesiastes,3,8,A time to love and a time to hate a time for war and a time for peace.
Ecclesiastes,3,9,What profit remains for the worker from his toil?
Ecclesiastes,3,10,I have seen the painful labor and exertion and miserable business which God has given to the sons of men with which to exercise and busy themselves.
Ecclesiastes,3,11,He has made everything beautiful in its time. He also has planted eternity in men's hearts and minds [a divinely implanted sense of a purpose working through the ages which nothing under the sun but God alone can satisfy] yet so that men cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.
Ecclesiastes,3,12,I know that there is nothing better for them than to be glad and to get and do good as long as they live;
Ecclesiastes,3,13,And also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor--it is the gift of God.
Ecclesiastes,3,14,I know that whatever God does it endures forever; nothing can be added to it nor anything taken from it. And God does it so that men will [reverently] fear Him [revere and worship Him knowing that He is].
Ecclesiastes,3,15,That which is now already has been and that which is to be already has been; and God seeks that which has passed by [so that history repeats itself ].
Ecclesiastes,3,16,Moreover I saw under the sun that in the place of justice there was wickedness and that in the place of righteousness wickedness was there also.
Ecclesiastes,3,17,I said in my heart God will judge the righteous and the wicked for there is a time [appointed] for every matter and purpose and for every work.
Ecclesiastes,3,18,I said in my heart regarding the subject of the sons of men God is trying (separating and sifting) them that they may see that by themselves [under the sun without God] they are but like beasts.
Ecclesiastes,3,19,For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts; even [in the end] one thing befalls them both. As the one dies so dies the other. Yes they all have one breath and spirit so that a man has no preeminence over a beast; for all is vanity (emptiness falsity and futility)!
Ecclesiastes,3,20,All go to one place; all are of the dust and all turn to dust again.
Ecclesiastes,3,21,Who knows the spirit of man whether it goes upward and the spirit of the beast whether it goes downward to the earth?
Ecclesiastes,3,22,So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works for that is his portion. For who shall bring him back to see what will happen after he is gone?
Ecclesiastes,4,1,THEN I returned and considered all the oppressions that are practiced under the sun: And I beheld the tears of the oppressed and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors was power but they [too] had no comforter.
Ecclesiastes,4,2,So I praised and thought more fortunate those who have been long dead than the living who are still alive.
Ecclesiastes,4,3,But better than them both [I thought] is he who has not yet been born who has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,4,4,Then I saw that all painful effort in labor and all skill in work comes from man's rivalry with his neighbor. This is also vanity a vain striving after the wind and a feeding on it.
Ecclesiastes,4,5,The fool folds his hands together and eats his own flesh [destroying himself by indolence].
Ecclesiastes,4,6,Better is a handful with quietness than both hands full with painful effort a vain striving after the wind and a feeding on it.
Ecclesiastes,4,7,Then I returned and I saw vanity under the sun [in one of its peculiar forms].
Ecclesiastes,4,8,Here is one alone--no one with him; he neither has child nor brother. Yet there is no end to all his labor neither is his eye satisfied with riches neither does he ask For whom do I labor and deprive myself of good? This is also vanity (emptiness falsity and futility); yes it is a painful effort and an unhappy business.
Ecclesiastes,4,9,Two are better than one because they have a good [more satisfying] reward for their labor;
Ecclesiastes,4,10,For if they fall the one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up!
Ecclesiastes,4,11,Again if two lie down together then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone?
Ecclesiastes,4,12,And though a man might prevail against him who is alone two will withstand him. A threefold cord is not quickly broken.
Ecclesiastes,4,13,Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to receive counsel (friendly reproof and warning)--
Ecclesiastes,4,14,Even though [the youth] comes out of prison to reign while the other born a king becomes needy.
Ecclesiastes,4,15,I saw all the living who walk under the sun with the youth who was to stand up in the king's stead.
Ecclesiastes,4,16,There was no end to all the people; he was over all of them. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity (emptiness falsity vainglory) and a striving after the wind and a feeding on it.
Ecclesiastes,5,1,KEEP YOUR foot [give your mind to what you are doing] when you go [as Jacob to sacred Bethel] to the house of God. For to draw near to hear and obey is better than to give the sacrifice of fools [carelessly irreverently] too ignorant to know that they are doing evil.
Ecclesiastes,5,2,Be not rash with your mouth and let not your heart be hasty to utter a word before God. For God is in heaven and you are on earth; therefore let your words be few.
Ecclesiastes,5,3,For a dream comes with much business and painful effort and a fool's voice with many words.
Ecclesiastes,5,4,When you vow a vow or make a pledge to God do not put off paying it; for God has no pleasure in fools (those who witlessly mock Him). Pay what you vow.
Ecclesiastes,5,5,It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.
Ecclesiastes,5,6,Do not allow your mouth to cause your body to sin and do not say before the messenger [the priest] that it was an error or mistake. Why should God be [made] angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?
Ecclesiastes,5,7,For in a multitude of dreams there is futility and worthlessness and ruin in a flood of words. But [reverently] fear God [revere and worship Him knowing that He is].
Ecclesiastes,5,8,If you see the oppression of the poor and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in the state or province do not marvel at the matter. [Be sure that there are those who will attend to it] for a higher [official] than the high is observing and higher ones are over them.
Ecclesiastes,5,9,Moreover the profit of the earth is for all; the king himself is served by the field and in all a king is an advantage to a land with cultivated fields.
Ecclesiastes,5,10,He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver nor he who loves abundance with gain. This also is vanity (emptiness falsity and futility)!
Ecclesiastes,5,11,When goods increase they who eat them increase also. And what gain is there to their owner except to see them with his eyes?
Ecclesiastes,5,12,The sleep of a laboring man is sweet whether he eats little or much but the fullness of the rich will not let him sleep.
Ecclesiastes,5,13,There is a serious and severe evil which I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt.
Ecclesiastes,5,14,But those riches are lost in a bad venture; and he becomes the father of a son and there is nothing in his hand [with which to support the child].
Ecclesiastes,5,15,As [the man] came forth from his mother's womb so he will go again naked as he came; and he will take away nothing for all his labor which he can carry in his hand.
Ecclesiastes,5,16,And this also is a serious and severe evil--that in all points as he came so shall he go; and what gain has he who labors for the wind?
Ecclesiastes,5,17,All his days also he eats in darkness [cheerlessly with no sweetness and light in them] and much sorrow and sickness and wrath are his.
Ecclesiastes,5,18,Behold what I have seen to be good and fitting is for one to eat and drink and to find enjoyment in all the labor in which he labors under the sun all the days which God gives him--for this is his [allotted] part.
Ecclesiastes,5,19,Also every man to whom God has given riches and possessions and the power to enjoy them and to accept his appointed lot and to rejoice in his toil--this is the gift of God [to him].
Ecclesiastes,5,20,For he shall not much remember [seriously] the days of his life because God [Himself] answers and corresponds to the joy of his heart [the tranquillity of God is mirrored in him].
Ecclesiastes,6,1,THERE IS an evil which I have seen under the sun and it lies heavily upon men:
Ecclesiastes,6,2,A man to whom God has given riches possessions and honor so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he might desire yet God does not give him the power or capacity to enjoy them [things which are gifts from God] but a stranger [in whom he has no interest succeeds him and] consumes and enjoys them. This is vanity (emptiness falsity and futility); it is a sore affliction!
Ecclesiastes,6,3,If a man begets a hundred children and lives many years so that the days of his years are many but his life is not filled with good and also he is given no burial [honors nor is laid to rest in the sepulcher of his fathers] I say that [he who had] an untimely birth [resulting in death] is better off than he
Ecclesiastes,6,4,For [the untimely one] comes in futility and goes into darkness and in darkness his name is covered.
Ecclesiastes,6,5,Moreover he has not seen the sun nor had any knowledge yet he [the stillborn child] has rest rather than he [who is aware of all that he has missed and all that he would not have had to suffer].
Ecclesiastes,6,6,Even though he lives a thousand years twice over and yet has seen no good and experienced no enjoyment--do not all go to one place [the place of the dead]?
Ecclesiastes,6,7,All the labor of man is for his mouth [for self-preservation and enjoyment] and yet his desire is not satisfied.
Ecclesiastes,6,8,For what advantage has the wise man over the fool [being worldly-wise is not the secret to happiness]? What advantage has the poor man who has learned how to walk before the living [publicly with men's eyes upon him; being poor is not the secret to happiness either]?
Ecclesiastes,6,9,Better is the sight of the eyes [the enjoyment of what is available to one] than the cravings of wandering desire. This is also vanity (emptiness falsity and futility) and a striving after the wind and a feeding on it!
Ecclesiastes,6,10,Whatever [man] is he has been named that long ago and it is known that it is man [Adam]; nor can he contend with Him who is mightier than he [whether God or death].
Ecclesiastes,6,11,Seeing that there are [all these and] many other things and words that increase the emptiness falsity vainglory and futility [of living] what profit and what outcome is there for man?
Ecclesiastes,6,12,For who [ limited to human wisdom] knows what is good for man in his life all the days of his vain life which he spends as a shadow [going through the motions but accomplishing nothing]? For who can tell a man what will happen [to his work his treasure his plans] under the sun after he is gone?
Ecclesiastes,7,1,A GOOD name is better than precious perfume and the day of death better than the day of one's birth.
Ecclesiastes,7,2,It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to heart.
Ecclesiastes,7,3,Sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better and gains gladness.
Ecclesiastes,7,4,The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth and sensual joy.
Ecclesiastes,7,5,It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise than to hear the song of fools.
Ecclesiastes,7,6,For like the crackling of thorns under a pot so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity (emptiness falsity and futility)!
Ecclesiastes,7,7,Surely oppression and extortion make a wise man foolish and a bribe destroys the understanding and judgment.
Ecclesiastes,7,8,Better is the end of a thing than the beginning of it and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
Ecclesiastes,7,9,Do not be quick in spirit to be angry or vexed for anger and vexation lodge in the bosom of fools.
Ecclesiastes,7,10,Do not say Why were the old days better than these? For it is not wise or because of wisdom that you ask this.
Ecclesiastes,7,11,Wisdom is as good as an inheritance yes more excellent it is for those [the living] who see the sun.
Ecclesiastes,7,12,For wisdom is a defense even as money is a defense but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom shields and preserves the life of him who has it.
Ecclesiastes,7,13,Consider the work of God: who can make straight what He has made crooked?
Ecclesiastes,7,14,In the day of prosperity be joyful but in the day of adversity consider that God has made the one side by side with the other so that man may not find out anything that shall be after him.
Ecclesiastes,7,15,I have seen everything in the days of my vanity (my emptiness falsity vainglory and futility): there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in [spite of] his evildoing.
Ecclesiastes,7,16,Be not [morbidly exacting and externally] righteous overmuch neither strive to make yourself [pretentiously appear] overwise--why should you [get puffed up and] destroy yourself [with presumptuous self-sufficiency]?
Ecclesiastes,7,17,[Although all have sinned] be not wicked overmuch or willfully neither be foolish--why should you die before your time?
Ecclesiastes,7,18,It is good that you should take hold of this and from that withdraw not your hand; for he who [reverently] fears and worships God will come forth from them all.
Ecclesiastes,7,19,[True] wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers or valiant generals who are in the city.
Ecclesiastes,7,20,Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth who does good and never sins.
Ecclesiastes,7,21,Do not give heed to everything that is said lest you hear your servant cursing you--
Ecclesiastes,7,22,For often your own heart knows that you have likewise cursed others.
Ecclesiastes,7,23,All this have I tried and proved by wisdom. I said I will be wise [independently of God]--but it was far from me.
Ecclesiastes,7,24,That which is is far off and that which is deep is very deep--who can find it out [true wisdom independent of the fear of God]?
Ecclesiastes,7,25,I turned about [penitent] and my heart was set to know and to search out and to seek [true] wisdom and the reason of things and to know that wickedness is folly and that foolishness is madness [and what had led me into such wickedness and madness].
Ecclesiastes,7,26,And I found that [of all sinful follies none has been so ruinous in seducing one away from God as idolatrous women] more bitter than death is the woman whose heart is snares and nets and whose hands are bands. Whoever pleases God shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by her.
Ecclesiastes,7,27,Behold this I have found says the Preacher while weighing one thing after another to find out the right estimate [and the reason]--
Ecclesiastes,7,28,Which I am still seeking but have not found--one upright man among a thousand have I found but an upright woman among all those [one thousand in my harem] have I not found.
Ecclesiastes,7,29,Behold this is the only [reason for it that] I have found: God made man upright but they [men and women] have sought out many devices [for evil].
Ecclesiastes,8,1,WHO IS like the wise man? And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face shine and the hardness of his countenance is changed.
Ecclesiastes,8,2,I counsel you to keep the king's command and that in regard to the oath of God [by which you swore to him loyalty].
Ecclesiastes,8,3,Be not panic-stricken and hasty to get out of his presence. Persist not in an evil thing for he does whatever he pleases.
Ecclesiastes,8,4,For the word of a king is authority and power and who can say to him What are you doing?
Ecclesiastes,8,5,Whoever observes the [king's] command will experience no harm and a wise man's mind will know both when and what to do.
Ecclesiastes,8,6,For every purpose and matter has its [right] time and judgment although the misery and wickedness of man lies heavily upon him [who rebels against the king].
Ecclesiastes,8,7,For he does not know what is to be for who can tell him how and when it will be?
Ecclesiastes,8,8,There is no man who has power over the spirit to retain the breath of life neither has he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in battle [against death] neither will wickedness deliver those who are its possessors and given to it.
Ecclesiastes,8,9,All this have I seen while applying my mind to every work that is done under the sun. There is a time in which one man has power over another to his own hurt or to the other man's.
Ecclesiastes,8,10,And so I saw the wicked buried--those who had come and gone out of the holy place [but did not thereby escape their doom] and they are [praised and] forgotten in the city where they had done such things. This also is vanity (emptiness falsity vainglory and futility)!
Ecclesiastes,8,11,Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily the hearts of the sons of men are fully set to do evil.
Ecclesiastes,8,12,Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and his days [seemingly] are prolonged [in his wickedness] yet surely I know that it will be well with those who [reverently] fear God who revere and worship Him realizing His continual presence.
Ecclesiastes,8,13,But it will not be well with the wicked neither will he prolong his days like a shadow because he does not [reverently] fear and worship God.
Ecclesiastes,8,14,Here also is a futility that goes on upon the earth: there are righteous men who fare as though they were wicked and wicked men who fare as though they were righteous. I say that this also is vanity (emptiness falsity and futility)!
Ecclesiastes,8,15,Then I commended enjoyment because a man has no better thing under the sun [without God] than to eat and to drink and to be joyful for that will remain with him in his toil through the days of his life which God gives him under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,8,16,When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to see the business activity and the painful effort that take place upon the earth--how neither day nor night some men's eyes sleep--
Ecclesiastes,8,17,Then I saw all the work of God that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun--because however much a man may toil in seeking yet he will not find it out; yes more than that though a wise man thinks and claims he knows yet will he not be able to find it out.
Ecclesiastes,9,1,FOR ALL this I took to heart exploring and examining it all how the righteous (the upright in right standing with God) and the wise and their works are in the hands of God. Whether it is to be love or hatred no man knows; all that is before them.
Ecclesiastes,9,2,All things come alike to all. There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him who sacrifices and to him who does not sacrifice. As is the good man so is the sinner; and he who swears is as he who fears and shuns an oath.
Ecclesiastes,9,3,This evil is in all that is done under the sun: one fate comes to all. Also the hearts of men are full of evil and madness is in their hearts while they live and after that they go to the dead.
Ecclesiastes,9,4,[There is no exemption] but he who is joined to all the living has hope--for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
Ecclesiastes,9,5,For the living know that they will die but the dead know nothing; and they have no more reward [here] for the memory of them is forgotten.
Ecclesiastes,9,6,Their love and their hatred and their envy have already perished; neither have they any more a share in anything that is done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,9,7,Go your way eat your bread with joy and drink your wine with a cheerful heart [if you are righteous wise and in the hands of God] for God has already accepted your works.
Ecclesiastes,9,8,Let your garments be always white [with purity] and let your head not lack [the] oil [of gladness].
Ecclesiastes,9,9,Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life which He has given you under the sun--all the days of futility. For that is your portion in this life and in your work at which you toil under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,9,10,Whatever your hand finds to do do it with all your might for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol (the place of the dead) where you are going.
Ecclesiastes,9,11,I returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong neither is bread to the wise nor riches to men of intelligence and understanding nor favor to men of skill; but time and chance happen to them all.
Ecclesiastes,9,12,For man also knows not his time [of death]: as the fishes are taken in an evil net and as the birds are caught in the snare so are the sons of men snared in an evil time when [calamity] falls suddenly upon them.
Ecclesiastes,9,13,This [illustration of] wisdom have I seen also under the sun and it seemed great to me:
Ecclesiastes,9,14,There was a little city with few men in it. And a great king came against it and besieged it and built great bulwarks against it.
Ecclesiastes,9,15,But there was found in it a poor wise man and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no man [seriously] remembered that poor man.
Ecclesiastes,9,16,But I say that wisdom is better than might though the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heeded.
Ecclesiastes,9,17,The words of wise men heard in quiet are better than the shouts of him who rules among fools.
Ecclesiastes,9,18,Wisdom is better than weapons of war but one sinner destroys much good.
Ecclesiastes,10,1,DEAD FLIES cause the ointment of the perfumer to putrefy [and] send forth a vile odor; so does a little folly [in him who is valued for wisdom] outweigh wisdom and honor.
Ecclesiastes,10,2,A wise man's heart turns him toward his right hand but a fool's heart toward his left.
Ecclesiastes,10,3,Even when he who is a fool walks along the road his heart and understanding fail him and he says of everyone and to everyone that he is a fool.
Ecclesiastes,10,4,If the temper of the ruler rises up against you do not leave your place [or show a resisting spirit]; for gentleness and calmness prevent or put a stop to great offenses.
Ecclesiastes,10,5,There is an evil which I have seen under the sun like an error which proceeds from the ruler:
Ecclesiastes,10,6,Folly is set in great dignity and in high places and the rich sit in low places.
Ecclesiastes,10,7,I have seen slaves on horses and princes walking like slaves on the earth.
Ecclesiastes,10,8,He who digs a pit [for others] will fall into it and whoever breaks through a fence or a [stone] wall a serpent will bite him.
Ecclesiastes,10,9,Whoever removes [landmark] stones or hews out [new ones with similar intent] will be hurt with them and he who fells trees will be endangered by them.
Ecclesiastes,10,10,If the ax is dull and the man does not whet the edge he must put forth more strength; but wisdom helps him to succeed.
Ecclesiastes,10,11,If the serpent bites before it is charmed then it is no use to call a charmer [and the slanderer is no better than the uncharmed snake].
Ecclesiastes,10,12,The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious and win him favor but the lips of a fool consume him.
Ecclesiastes,10,13,The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness and the end of his talk is wicked madness.
Ecclesiastes,10,14,A fool also multiplies words though no man can tell what will be--and what will happen after he is gone who can tell him?
Ecclesiastes,10,15,The labor of fools wearies every one of them because [he is so ignorant of the ordinary matters that] he does not even know how to get to town.
Ecclesiastes,10,16,Woe to you O land when your king is a child or a servant and when your officials feast in the morning!
Ecclesiastes,10,17,Happy (fortunate and to be envied) are you O land when your king is a free man and of noble birth and character and when your officials feast at the proper time--for strength and not for drunkenness!
Ecclesiastes,10,18,Through indolence the rafters [of state affairs] decay and the roof sinks in and through idleness of the hands the house leaks.
Ecclesiastes,10,19,[Instead of repairing the breaches the officials] make a feast for laughter serve wine to cheer life and [depend on tax] money to answer for all of it.
Ecclesiastes,10,20,Curse not the king no not even in your thoughts and curse not the rich in your bedchamber for a bird of the air will carry the voice and a winged creature will tell the matter.
Ecclesiastes,11,1,CAST YOUR bread upon the waters for you will find it after many days.
Ecclesiastes,11,2,Give a portion to seven yes even [divide it] to eight for you know not what evil may come upon the earth.
Ecclesiastes,11,3,If the clouds are full of rain they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree falls toward the south or toward the north in the place where the tree falls there it will lie.
Ecclesiastes,11,4,He who observes the wind [and waits for all conditions to be favorable] will not sow and he who regards the clouds will not reap.
Ecclesiastes,11,5,As you know not what is the way of the wind or how the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a pregnant woman even so you know not the work of God Who does all.
Ecclesiastes,11,6,In the morning sow your seed and in the evening withhold not your hands for you know not which shall prosper whether this or that or whether both alike will be good.
Ecclesiastes,11,7,Truly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.
Ecclesiastes,11,8,Yes if a man should live many years let him rejoice in them all; yet let him [seriously] remember the days of darkness for they will be many. All that comes is vanity (emptiness falsity vainglory and futility)!
Ecclesiastes,11,9,Rejoice O young man in your adolescence and let your heart cheer you in the days of your [full-grown] youth. And walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.
Ecclesiastes,11,10,Therefore remove [the lusts that end in] sorrow and vexation from your heart and mind and put away evil from your body for youth and the dawn of life are vanity [transitory idle empty and devoid of truth].
Ecclesiastes,12,1,REMEMBER [earnestly] also your Creator [that you are not your own but His property now] in the days of your youth before the evil days come or the years draw near when you will say [of physical pleasures] I have no enjoyment in them--
Ecclesiastes,12,2,Before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened [sight is impaired] and the clouds [of depression] return after the rain [of tears];
Ecclesiastes,12,3,In the day when the keepers of the house [the hands and the arms] tremble and the strong men [the feet and the knees] bow themselves and the grinders [the molar teeth] cease because they are few and those who look out of the windows [the eyes] are darkened;
Ecclesiastes,12,4,When the doors [the lips] are shut in the streets and the sound of the grinding [of the teeth] is low and one rises up at the voice of a bird and the crowing of a cock and all the daughters of music [the voice and the ear] are brought low;
Ecclesiastes,12,5,Also when [the old] are afraid of danger from that which is high and fears are in the way and the almond tree [their white hair] blooms and the grasshopper [a little thing] is a burden and desire and appetite fail because man goes to his everlasting home and the mourners go about the streets or marketplaces.
Ecclesiastes,12,6,[Remember your Creator earnestly now] before the silver cord [of life] is snapped apart or the golden bowl is broken or the pitcher is broken at the fountain or the wheel broken at the cistern [and the whole circulatory system of the blood ceases to function];
Ecclesiastes,12,7,Then shall the dust [out of which God made man's body] return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return to God Who gave it.
Ecclesiastes,12,8,Vapor of vapors and futility of futilities says the Preacher. All is futility (emptiness falsity vainglory and transitoriness)!
Ecclesiastes,12,9,And furthermore because the Preacher was wise he [Solomon] still taught the people knowledge; and he pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs.
Ecclesiastes,12,10,The Preacher sought acceptable words even to write down rightly words of truth or correct sentiment.
Ecclesiastes,12,11,The words of the wise are like prodding goads and firmly fixed [in the mind] like nails are the collected sayings which are given [as proceeding] from one Shepherd.
Ecclesiastes,12,12,But about going further [than the words given by one Shepherd] my son be warned. Of making many books there is no end [so do not believe everything you read] and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
Ecclesiastes,12,13,All has been heard; the end of the matter is: Fear God [revere and worship Him knowing that He is] and keep His commandments for this is the whole of man [the full original purpose of his creation the object of God's providence the root of character the foundation of all happiness the adjustment to all inharmonious circumstances and conditions under the sun] and the whole [duty] for every man.
Ecclesiastes,12,14,For God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it is good or evil.
Song of Solomon,1,1,THE SONG of songs [the most excellent of them all] which is Solomon's.
Song of Solomon,1,2,Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! [she cries. Then realizing that Solomon has arrived and has heard her speech she turns to him and adds] For your love is better than wine!
Song of Solomon,1,3,[And she continues] The odor of your ointments is fragrant; your name is like perfume poured out. Therefore do the maidens love you.
Song of Solomon,1,4,Draw me! We will run after you! The king brings me into his apartments! We will be glad and rejoice in you! We will recall [when we were favored with] your love more fragrant than wine. The upright [are not offended at your choice but sincerely] love you.
Song of Solomon,1,5,I am so black; but [you are] lovely and pleasant [the ladies assured her]. O you daughters of Jerusalem [I am as dark] as the tents of [the Bedouin tribe] Kedar like the [beautiful] curtains of Solomon!
Song of Solomon,1,6,[Please] do not look at me [she said for] I am swarthy. [I have worked out] in the sun and it has left its mark upon me. My stepbrothers were angry with me and they made me keeper of the vineyards; but my own vineyard [my complexion] I have not kept.
Song of Solomon,1,7,[Addressing her shepherd she said] Tell me O you whom my soul loves where you pasture your flock where you make it lie down at noon. For why should I [as I think of you] be as a veiled one straying beside the flocks of your companions?
Song of Solomon,1,8,If you do not know [where your lover is] O you fairest among women run along follow the tracks of the flock and [amuse yourself by] pasturing your kids beside the shepherds' tents.
Song of Solomon,1,9,O my love [he said as he saw her] you remind me of my [favorite] mare in the chariot spans of Pharaoh.
Song of Solomon,1,10,Your cheeks are comely with ornaments your neck with strings of jewels.
Song of Solomon,1,11,We will make for you chains and ornaments of gold studded with silver.
Song of Solomon,1,12,While the king sits at his table [she said] my spikenard [my absent lover] sends forth [his] fragrance [over me].
Song of Solomon,1,13,My beloved [shepherd] is to me like a [scent] bag of myrrh that lies in my bosom.
Song of Solomon,1,14,My beloved [shepherd] is to me a cluster of henna flowers in the vineyards of En-gedi [famed for its fragrant shrubs].
Song of Solomon,1,15,Behold you are beautiful my love! Behold you are beautiful! You have doves' eyes.
Song of Solomon,1,16,[She cried] Behold you are beautiful my beloved [shepherd] yes delightful! Our arbor and couch are green and leafy.
Song of Solomon,1,17,The beams of our house are cedars and our rafters and panels are cypresses or pines.
Song of Solomon,2,1,[SHE SAID] I am only a little rose or autumn crocus of the plain of Sharon or a [humble] lily of the valleys [that grows in deep and difficult places].
Song of Solomon,2,2,But Solomon replied Like the lily among thorns so are you my love among the daughters.
Song of Solomon,2,3,Like an apple tree among the trees of the wood so is my beloved [shepherd] among the sons [cried the girl]! Under his shadow I delighted to sit and his fruit was sweet to my taste.
Song of Solomon,2,4,He brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was love [for love waved as a protecting and comforting banner over my head when I was near him].
Song of Solomon,2,5,Sustain me with raisins refresh me with apples for I am sick with love.
Song of Solomon,2,6,[I can feel] his left hand under my head and his right hand embraces me!
Song of Solomon,2,7,[He said] I charge you O you daughters of Jerusalem by the gazelles or by the hinds of the field [which are free to follow their own instincts] that you not try to stir up or awaken [my] love until it pleases.
Song of Solomon,2,8,[Vividly she pictured it] The voice of my beloved [shepherd]! Behold he comes leaping upon the mountains bounding over the hills.
Song of Solomon,2,9,My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart. Behold he stands behind the wall of our house he looks in through the windows he glances through the lattice.
Song of Solomon,2,10,My beloved speaks and says to me Rise up my love my fair one and come away.
Song of Solomon,2,11,For behold the winter is past; the rain is over and gone.
Song of Solomon,2,12,The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing [of birds] has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
Song of Solomon,2,13,The fig tree puts forth and ripens her green figs and the vines are in blossom and give forth their fragrance. Arise my love my fair one and come away.
Song of Solomon,2,14,[So I went with him and when we were climbing the rocky steps up the hillside my beloved shepherd said to me] O my dove [while you are here] in the seclusion of the clefts in the solid rock in the sheltered and secret place of the cliff let me see your face let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely.
Song of Solomon,2,15,[My heart was touched and I fervently sang to him my desire] Take for us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vineyards [of our love] for our vineyards are in blossom.
Song of Solomon,2,16,[She said distinctly] My beloved is mine and I am his! He pastures his flocks among the lilies.
Song of Solomon,2,17,[Then longingly addressing her absent shepherd she cried] Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away return hastily O my beloved and be like a gazelle or a young hart as you cover the mountains [which separate us].
Song of Solomon,3,1,IN THE night I dreamed that I sought the one whom I love. [She said] I looked for him but could not find him.
Song of Solomon,3,2,So I decided to go out into the city into the streets and broad ways [which are so confusing to a country girl] and seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him but I could not find him.
Song of Solomon,3,3,The watchmen who go about the city found me to whom I said Have you seen him whom my soul loves?
Song of Solomon,3,4,I had gone but a little way past them when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mother's house and into the chamber of her who conceived me.
Song of Solomon,3,5,I adjure you O daughters of Jerusalem by the gazelles or by the hinds of the field that you stir not up nor awaken love until it pleases.
Song of Solomon,3,6,Who or what is this [she asked] that comes gliding out of the wilderness like stately pillars of smoke perfumed with myrrh frankincense and all the fragrant powders of the merchant?
Song of Solomon,3,7,[Someone answered] Behold it is the traveling litter (the bridal car) of Solomon. Sixty mighty men are around it of the mighty men of Israel.
Song of Solomon,3,8,They all handle the sword and are expert in war; every man has his sword upon his thigh that fear be not excited in the night.
Song of Solomon,3,9,King Solomon made himself a car or a palanquin from the [cedar] wood of Lebanon.
Song of Solomon,3,10,He made its posts of silver its back of gold its seat of purple the inside of it lovingly and intricately wrought in needlework by the daughters of Jerusalem.
Song of Solomon,3,11,Go forth O you daughters of Zion and gaze upon King Solomon wearing the crown with which his mother [Bathsheba] crowned him on the day of his wedding on the day of his gladness of heart.
Song of Solomon,4,1,HOW FAIR you are my love [he said] how very fair! Your eyes behind your veil [remind me] of those of a dove; your hair [makes me think of the black wavy fleece] of a flock of [the Arabian] goats which one sees trailing down Mount Gilead [beyond the Jordan on the frontiers of the desert].
Song of Solomon,4,2,Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes which have come up from the washing of which all are in pairs and none is missing among them.
Song of Solomon,4,3,Your lips are like a thread of scarlet and your mouth is lovely. Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil.
Song of Solomon,4,4,Your neck is like the tower of David built for an arsenal whereon hang a thousand bucklers all of them shields of warriors.
Song of Solomon,4,5,Your two breasts are like two fawns like twins of a gazelle that feed among the lilies.
Song of Solomon,4,6,Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away [in my thoughts] I will get to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense [to him whom my soul adores].
Song of Solomon,4,7,[He exclaimed] O my love how beautiful you are! There is no flaw in you!
Song of Solomon,4,8,Come away with me from Lebanon my [promised] bride come with me from Lebanon. Depart from the top of Amana from the peak of Senir and Hermon from the lions' dens from the mountains of the leopards.
Song of Solomon,4,9,You have ravished my heart and given me courage my sister my [promised] bride; you have ravished my heart and given me courage with one look from your eyes with one jewel of your necklace.
Song of Solomon,4,10,How beautiful is your love my sister my [promised] bride! How much better is your love than wine! And the fragrance of your ointments than all spices!
Song of Solomon,4,11,Your lips O my [promised] bride drop honey as the honeycomb; honey and milk are under your tongue. And the odor of your garments is like the odor of Lebanon.
Song of Solomon,4,12,A garden enclosed and barred is my sister my [promised] bride--a spring shut up a fountain sealed.
Song of Solomon,4,13,Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates or a paradise with precious fruits henna with spikenard plants
Song of Solomon,4,14,Spikenard and saffron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all the chief spices.
Song of Solomon,4,15,You are a fountain [springing up] in a garden a well of living waters and flowing streams from Lebanon.
Song of Solomon,4,16,[You have called me a garden she said] Oh I pray that the [cold] north wind and the [soft] south wind may blow upon my garden that its spices may flow out [in abundance for you in whom my soul delights]. Let my beloved come into his garden and eat its choicest fruits.
Song of Solomon,5,1,I HAVE come into my garden my sister my [promised] bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my balsam and spice [from your sweet words I have gathered the richest perfumes and spices]. I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat O friends [feast on O revelers of the palace; you can never make my lover disloyal to me]! Drink yes drink abundantly of love O precious one [for now I know you are mine irrevocably mine! With his confident words still thrilling her heart through the lattice she saw her shepherd turn away and disappear into the night].
Song of Solomon,5,2,I went to sleep but my heart stayed awake. [I dreamed that I heard] the voice of my beloved as he knocked [at the door of my mother's cottage]. Open to me my sister my love my dove my spotless one [he said] for I am wet with the [heavy] night dew; my hair is covered with it.
Song of Solomon,5,3,[But weary from a day in the vineyards I had already sought my rest] I had put off my garment--how could I [again] put it on? I had washed my feet--how could I [again] soil them?
Song of Solomon,5,4,My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door and my heart was moved for him.
Song of Solomon,5,5,I rose up to open for my beloved and my hands dripped with myrrh and my fingers with liquid [sweet-scented] myrrh [which he had left] upon the handles of the bolt.
Song of Solomon,5,6,I opened for my beloved but my beloved had turned away and withdrawn himself and was gone! My soul went forth [to him] when he spoke but it failed me [and now he was gone]! I sought him but I could not find him; I called him but he gave me no answer.
Song of Solomon,5,7,The watchmen who go about the city found me. They struck me they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took my veil and my mantle from me.
Song of Solomon,5,8,I charge you O daughters of Jerusalem if you find my beloved that you tell him that I am sick from love [simply sick to be with him].
Song of Solomon,5,9,What is your beloved more than another beloved O you fairest among women [taunted the ladies]? What is your beloved more than another beloved that you should give us such a charge?

Song of Solomon,6,3,[But weary from a day in the vineyards I had already sought my rest] I had put off my garment--how could I [again] put it on? I had washed my feet--how could I [again] soil them?

Song of Solomon,7,5,Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel and the hair of your head like purple. [Then seeing the king watching the girl in absorbed admiration the speaker added] The king is held captive by its tresses.
Song of Solomon,7,6,[The king came forward saying] How fair and how pleasant you are O love with your delights!
Song of Solomon,7,7,Your stature is like that of a palm tree and your bosom like its clusters [of dates declared the king].

Song of Solomon,8,5,Who is this who comes up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved? [And as they sighted the home of her childhood the bride said] Under the apple tree I awakened you; there your mother gave you birth there she was in travail and bore you.
Song of Solomon,8,6,Set me like a seal upon your heart like a seal upon your arm; for love is as strong as death jealousy is as hard and cruel as Sheol (the place of the dead). Its flashes are flashes of fire a most vehement flame [the very flame of the Lord]!
Song of Solomon,8,7,Many waters cannot quench love neither can floods drown it. If a man would offer all the goods of his house for love he would be utterly scorned and despised.
Song of Solomon,8,8,[Gathered with her family and the wedding guests in her mother's cottage the bride said to her stepbrothers When I was a little girl you said] We have a little sister and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day when she is spoken for in marriage?
Song of Solomon,8,9,If she is a wall [discreet and womanly] we will build upon her a turret [a dowry] of silver; but if she is a door [bold and flirtatious] we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
Song of Solomon,8,10,[Well] I am a wall [with battlements] and my breasts are like the towers of it. Then was I in [the king's] eyes as one [to be respected and to be allowed] to find peace.
Song of Solomon,8,11,Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; everyone was to bring him a thousand pieces of silver for its fruit.

Isaiah,7,4,And say to him Take heed and be quiet; fear not neither be fainthearted because of these two stumps of smoking firebrands--at the fierce anger of [the Syrian King] Rezin and Syria and of the son of Remaliah [Pekah usurper of the throne of Israel].
Isaiah,7,5,Because Syria Ephraim [Israel] and the son of Remaliah have purposed evil against you [Judah] saying
Isaiah,7,6,Let us go up against Judah and harass and terrify it; and let us cleave it asunder [each of us taking a portion] and set a [vassal] king in the midst of it namely the son of Tabeel
Isaiah,7,7,Thus says the Lord God: It shall not stand neither shall it come to pass.
Isaiah,7,8,For the head [the capital] of Syria is Damascus and the head of Damascus is [King] Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be broken to pieces so that it will no longer be a people.
Isaiah,7,9,And the head (the capital) of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son [Pekah]. If you will not believe and trust and rely [on God and on the words of God's prophet instead of Assyria] surely you will not be established nor will you remain.
Isaiah,7,10,Moreover the Lord spoke again to King Ahaz saying
Isaiah,7,11,Ask for yourself a sign (a token or proof) of the Lord your God [one that will convince you that God has spoken and will keep His word]; ask it either in the depth below or in the height above [let it be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven].
Isaiah,7,12,But Ahaz said I will not ask neither will I tempt the Lord.
Isaiah,7,13,And [Isaiah] said Hear then O house of David! Is it a small thing for you to weary and try the patience of men but will you weary and try the patience of my God also?
Isaiah,7,14,Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: Behold the young woman who is unmarried and a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Immanuel [God with us].
Isaiah,7,15,Butter and curds and wild honey shall he eat when he knows [enough] to refuse the evil and choose the good.
Isaiah,7,16,For before the child shall know [enough] to refuse the evil and choose the good the land [Canaan] whose two kings you abhor and of whom you are in sickening dread shall be forsaken [both Ephraim and Syria].
Isaiah,7,17,The Lord shall bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father's house such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim [the ten northern tribes] departed from Judah--even the king of Assyria.
Isaiah,7,18,And in that day the Lord shall whistle for the fly [the numerous and troublesome foe] that is in the whole extent of the canal country of Egypt and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
Isaiah,7,19,And these [enemies like flies and bees] shall come and shall rest all of them in the desolate and rugged valleys and deep ravines and in the clefts of the rocks and on all the thornbushes and on all the pastures.
Isaiah,7,20,In the same day [will the people of Judah be utterly stripped of belongings] the Lord will shave with the razor that is hired from the parts beyond the River [Euphrates]--even with the king of Assyria--[that razor will shave] the head and the hair of the legs and it shall also consume the beard [leaving Judah with open shame and scorn].
Isaiah,7,21,And [because of the desolation brought on by the invaders] in that day a man will [be so poor that he will] keep alive only a young milk cow and two sheep.
Isaiah,7,22,And because of the abundance of milk that they will give he will eat butter and curds for [only] butter and curds and [wild] honey [no vegetables] shall everyone eat who is left in the land [these products provided from the extensive pastures and the plentiful wild flowers upon which the bees depend].
Isaiah,7,23,And in that day in every place where there used to be a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels there will be briers and thorns.
Isaiah,7,24,With arrows and with bows shall a man come [to hunt] there because all the land will be briers and thorns.
Isaiah,7,25,And as for all the hills that were formerly cultivated with mattock and hoe you will not go there for fear of briers and thorns; but they will become a place where oxen are let loose to pasture and where sheep tread.
Isaiah,8,1,THEN THE Lord said to me Take a large tablet [of wood metal or stone] and write upon it with a graving tool and in ordinary characters [which the humblest man can read]: Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz [they (the Assyrians) hasten to the spoil (of Syria and Israel) they speed to the prey].
Isaiah,8,2,And I took faithful witnesses to record and attest [this prophecy] for me Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah.
Isaiah,8,3,And I approached [my wife] the prophetess and when she had conceived and borne a son the Lord said to me Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz [as a continual reminder to the people of the prophecy]
Isaiah,8,4,For before the child knows how to say My father or my mother the riches of Damascus [Syria's capital] and the spoil of Samaria [Israel's capital] shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.
Isaiah,8,5,The Lord spoke to me yet again and said
Isaiah,8,6,Because this people [Israel and Judah] have refused and despised the waters of Shiloah [Siloam the only perennial fountain of Jerusalem and symbolic of God's protection and sustaining power] that go gently and rejoice in and with Rezin [the king of Syria] and Remaliah's son [Pekah the king of Israel]
Isaiah,8,7,Now therefore behold the Lord brings upon them the waters of the River [Euphrates] strong and many--even the king of Assyria and all the glory [of his gorgeous retinue]; and it will rise over all its channels brooks valleys and canals and extend far beyond its banks;
Isaiah,8,8,And it will sweep on into Judah; it will overflow and go over [the hills] reaching even [but only] to the neck [of which Jerusalem is the head] and the outstretched wings [of the armies of Assyria] shall fill the breadth of Your land O Immanuel [Messiah God is with us]!
Isaiah,8,9,Make an uproar and be broken in pieces O you peoples [rage raise the war cry do your worst and be utterly dismayed]! Give ear all you [our enemies] of far countries. Gird yourselves [for war] and be thrown into consternation! Gird yourselves and be [utterly] dismayed!
Isaiah,8,10,Take counsel together [against Judah] but it shall come to nought; speak the word but it will not stand for God is with us [Immanuel]!
Isaiah,8,11,For the Lord spoke thus to me with His strong hand [upon me] and warned and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people saying
Isaiah,8,12,Do not call conspiracy [or hard or holy] all that this people will call conspiracy [or hard or holy]; neither be in fear of what they fear nor [make others afraid and] in dread.
Isaiah,8,13,The Lord of hosts--regard Him as holy and honor His holy name [by regarding Him as your only hope of safety] and let Him be your fear and let Him be your dread [lest you offend Him by your fear of man and distrust of Him].
Isaiah,8,14,And He shall be a sanctuary [a sacred and indestructible asylum to those who reverently fear and trust in Him]; but He shall be a Stone of stumbling and a Rock of offense to both the houses of Israel a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Isaiah,8,15,And many among them shall stumble thereon; and they shall fall and be broken and be snared and taken.

Isaiah,8,17,And I will wait for the Lord Who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob; and I will look for and hope in Him.
Isaiah,8,18,Behold I and the children whom the Lord has given me are signs and wonders [that are to take place] in Israel from the Lord of hosts Who dwells on Mount Zion.
Isaiah,8,19,And when the people [instead of putting their trust in God] shall say to you Consult for direction mediums and wizards who chirp and mutter should not a people seek and consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?
Isaiah,8,20,[Direct such people] to the teaching and to the testimony! If their teachings are not in accord with this word it is surely because there is no dawn and no morning for them.
Isaiah,8,21,And they [who consult mediums and wizards] shall pass through [the land] sorely distressed and hungry; and when they are hungry they will fret and will curse by their king and their God; and whether they look upward
Isaiah,8,22,Or look to the earth they will behold only distress and darkness the gloom of anguish and into thick darkness and widespread obscure night they shall be driven away.
Isaiah,9,1,BUT [in the midst of judgment there is the promise and the certainty of the Lord's deliverance and] there shall be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time [the Lord] brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali but in the latter time He will make it glorious by the way of the Sea [of Galilee the land] beyond the Jordan Galilee of the nations.
Isaiah,9,2,The people who walked in darkness have seen a great Light; those who dwelt in the land of intense darkness and the shadow of death upon them has the Light shined.
Isaiah,9,3,You [O Lord] have multiplied the nation and increased their joy; they rejoice before You like the joy in harvest as men rejoice when they divide the spoil [of battle].

Isaiah,9,8,The Lord has sent a word against Jacob [the ten tribes] and it has lighted upon Israel [the ten tribes the kingdom of Ephraim].
Isaiah,9,9,And all the people shall know it--even Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria [its capital]--who said in pride and stoutness of heart
Isaiah,9,10,The bricks have fallen but we will build [all the better] with hewn stones; the sycamores have been cut down but we will put [costlier] cedars in their place.
Isaiah,9,11,Therefore the Lord has stirred up the adversaries [the Assyrians] of Rezin [king of Syria] against [Ephraim] and He will stir up their enemies and arm and join them together
Isaiah,9,12,The Syrians [compelled to fight with their enemies going] before [on the east] and the Philistines behind [on the west]; and they will devour Israel with open mouth. For all this [God's] anger is not [then] turned away but His hand is still stretched out [in judgment].
Isaiah,9,13,Yet the people turn not to Him Who smote them neither do they seek [inquire for or require as their vital need] the Lord of hosts.
Isaiah,9,14,Therefore the Lord will cut off from Israel head and tail [the highest and the lowest]--[high] palm branch and [low] rush in one day;
Isaiah,9,15,The elderly and honored man he is the head; and the prophet who teaches lies he is the tail.
Isaiah,9,16,For they who lead this people cause them to err and they who are led [astray] by them are swallowed up (destroyed).
Isaiah,9,17,Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men neither will He have compassion on their fatherless and widows for everyone is profane and an evildoer and every mouth speaks folly. For all this [God's] anger is not turned away but His hand is still stretched out [in judgment].
Isaiah,9,18,For wickedness burns like a fire; it devours the briers and thorns and it kindles in the thickets of the forest; they roll upward in a column of smoke.
Isaiah,9,19,Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts the land is darkened and burned up and the people are like fuel for the fire; no man spares his brother.
Isaiah,9,20,They snatch in discord on the right hand but are still hungry [their cruelty not diminished]; and they devour and destroy on the left hand but are not satisfied. Each devours and destroys his own flesh [and blood] or his neighbor's.
Isaiah,9,21,Manasseh [thirsts for the blood of his brother] Ephraim and Ephraim [for that of] Manasseh; but together they are against Judah. For all this [God's] anger is not turned away but His hand is still stretched out [in judgment].
Isaiah,10,1,WOE TO those [judges] who issue unrighteous decrees and to the magistrates who keep causing unjust and oppressive decisions to be recorded

Isaiah,10,5,Woe to the Assyrian the rod of My anger the staff in whose hand is My indignation and fury [against Israel's disobedience]!
Isaiah,10,6,I send [the Assyrian] against a hypocritical and godless nation and against the people of My wrath; I command him to take the spoil and to seize the prey and to tread them down like the mire in the streets.
Isaiah,10,7,However this is not his intention [nor is the Assyrian aware that he is doing this at My bidding] neither does his mind so think and plan; but it is in his mind to destroy and cut off many nations.
Isaiah,10,8,For [the Assyrian] says Are not my officers all either [subjugated] kings or their equal?
Isaiah,10,9,Is not Calno [of Babylonia conquered] like Carchemish [on the Euphrates]? Is not Hamath [in Upper Syria] like Arpad [her neighbor]? Is not Samaria [in Israel] like Damascus [in Syria]? [Have any of these cities been able to resist Assyria? Not one!]
Isaiah,10,10,As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols [which were unable to defend them] whose graven images were more to be feared and dreaded and more mighty than those of Jerusalem and of Samaria--
Isaiah,10,11,Shall I not be able to do to Jerusalem and her images as I have done to Samaria and her idols? [says the Assyrian]
Isaiah,10,12,Therefore when the Lord has completed all His work [of chastisement and purification to be executed] on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem it shall be that He will inflict punishment on the fruit [the thoughts words and deeds] of the stout and arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the haughtiness of his pride.
Isaiah,10,13,For [the Assyrian king] has said I have done it solely by the power of my own hand and wisdom for I have insight and understanding. I have removed the boundaries of the peoples and have robbed their treasures; and like a bull I have brought down those who sat on thrones and the inhabitants.
Isaiah,10,14,And my hand has found like a nest the wealth of the people; and as one gathers eggs that are forsaken so I have gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved its wing or that opened its mouth or chirped.
Isaiah,10,15,Shall the ax boast itself against him who chops with it? Or shall the saw magnify itself against him who wields it back and forth? As if a rod should wield those who lift it up or as if a staff should lift itself up as if it were not wood [but a man of God]!
Isaiah,10,16,Therefore will the Lord the Lord of hosts send leanness among [the Assyrian's] fat ones; and instead of his glory or under it He will kindle a burning like the burning of fire.
Isaiah,10,17,And the Light of Israel shall become a fire and His Holy One a flame and it will burn and devour [the Assyrian's] thorns and briers in one day.
Isaiah,10,18,[The Lord] will consume the glory of the [Assyrian's] forest and of his fruitful field both soul and body; and it shall be as when a sick man pines away or a standard-bearer faints.
Isaiah,10,19,And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few so that a child may make a list of them.

Isaiah,24,17,Terror and pit [of destruction] and snare are upon you O inhabitant of the earth!
Isaiah,24,18,And he who flees at the noise of the terror will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the pit will be caught in the snare. For the windows of the heavens are opened [as in the deluge] and the foundations of the earth tremble and shake.

Isaiah,25,3,Therefore [many] a strong people will glorify You [many] a city of terrible and ruthless nations will [reverently] fear You.
Isaiah,25,4,For You have been a stronghold for the poor a stronghold for the needy in his distress a shelter from the storm a shade from the heat; for the blast of the ruthless ones is like a rainstorm against a wall.
Isaiah,25,5,As the heat in a dry land [is reduced by the shadow of a cloud so] You will bring down the noise of aliens [exultant over their enemies]; and as the heat is brought low by the shadow of a cloud so the song of the ruthless ones is brought low.
Isaiah,25,6,And on this Mount [Zion] shall the Lord of hosts make for all peoples a feast of rich things [symbolic of His coronation festival inaugurating the reign of the Lord on earth in the wake of a background of gloom judgment and terror] a feast of wines on the lees--of fat things full of marrow of wines on the lees well refined.

Isaiah,25,11,And though [Moab] stretches forth his hands in the midst of [the filthy water] as a swimmer stretches out his hands to swim the Lord will bring down [Moab's] pride in spite of the skillfulness of his hands and together with the spoils of his hands.

Isaiah,26,19,Your dead shall live [O Lord]; the bodies of our dead [saints] shall rise. You who dwell in the dust awake and sing for joy!

Isaiah,27,9,Only on this condition shall the iniquity of Jacob (Israel) be forgiven and purged and this shall be the full fruit [God requires] for taking away his sin: that [Israel] should make all the stones of the [idol] altars like chalk stones crushed to pieces so that the Asherim and the sun-images shall not remain standing or rise again.
Isaiah,27,10,For the fortified city is solitary a habitation deserted and forsaken like the wilderness; there the calf grazes and there he lies down; he strips its branches and eats its twigs.
Isaiah,27,11,When its boughs are withered and dry they are broken off; the women come and set them afire. For they are a people of no understanding or discernment--witless folk; therefore He Who made them will not have compassion on them and He Who formed them will show them no favor.

Isaiah,28,1,WOE TO [Samaria] the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim [the ten tribes] and to the fading flower of its glorious beauty which is on the head of the rich valley of those overcome and smitten down with wine!

Isaiah,28,3,With [alien] feet [Samaria] the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden down.
Isaiah,28,4,And the fading flower of its glorious beauty which is on the head of the rich valley will be like the early fig before the fruit harvest which when anyone sees it he snatches and eats it up greedily at once. [So in an amazingly short time will the Assyrians devour Samaria Israel's capital.]
Isaiah,28,5,[But] in that [future Messianic] day the Lord of hosts shall become a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty to the [converted] remnant of His people
Isaiah,28,6,And a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment and administers the law and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
Isaiah,28,7,But even these reel from wine and stagger from strong drink: the priest and the prophet reel from strong drink; they are confused from wine they stagger and are gone astray through strong drink; they err in vision they stumble when pronouncing judgment.
Isaiah,28,8,For all the tables are full of filthy vomit so that there is no place that is clean.
Isaiah,28,9,To whom will He teach knowledge? [Ask the drunkards.] And whom will He make to understand the message? Those who are babies just weaned from the milk and taken from the breasts? [Is that what He thinks we are?]
Isaiah,28,10,For it is [His prophets repeating over and over]: precept upon precept precept upon precept rule upon rule rule upon rule; here a little there a little.
Isaiah,28,11,No but [the Lord will teach the rebels in a more humiliating way] by men with stammering lips and another tongue will He speak to this people [says Isaiah and teach them His lessons].
Isaiah,28,12,To these [complaining Jews the Lord] had said This is the true rest [the way to true comfort and happiness] that you shall give to the weary and This is the [true] refreshing--yet they would not listen [to His teaching].
Isaiah,28,13,Therefore the word of the Lord will be to them [merely monotonous repeatings of]: precept upon precept precept upon precept rule upon rule rule upon rule; here a little there a little--that they may go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken.
Isaiah,28,14,Therefore hear the word of the Lord you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem!
Isaiah,28,15,Because you have said We have made a covenant with death and with Sheol (the place of the dead) we have an agreement--when the overflowing scourge passes through it will not come to us for we have made lies our refuge and in falsehood we have taken shelter.
Isaiah,28,16,Therefore thus says the Lord God Behold I am laying in Zion for a foundation a Stone a tested Stone a precious Cornerstone of sure foundation; he who believes (trusts in relies on and adheres to that Stone) will not be ashamed or give way or hasten away [in sudden panic].
Isaiah,28,17,I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plummet; and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies and waters will overwhelm the hiding place (the shelter).
Isaiah,28,18,And your covenant with death shall be annulled and your agreement with Sheol (the place of the dead) shall not stand; when the overwhelming scourge passes through then you will be trodden down by it.
Isaiah,28,19,As often as it passes through it [the enemy's scourge] will take you; for morning by morning will it pass through by day and by night. And it will be utter terror merely to hear and comprehend the report and the message of it [but only hard treatment and dispersion will make you understand God's instruction].
Isaiah,28,20,For [they will find that] the bed is too short for a man to stretch himself on and the covering too narrow for him to wrap himself in. [All their sources of confidence will fail them.]
Isaiah,28,21,For the Lord will rise up as on Mount Perazim He will be wrathful as in the Valley of Gibeon that He may do His work His strange work and bring to pass His act His strange act.

Isaiah,28,23,Give ear and hear my [Isaiah's] voice; listen and hear my words.
Isaiah,28,24,Does he who plows for sowing plow continually? Does he continue to plow and harrow the ground after it is smooth?
Isaiah,28,25,When he has leveled its surface does he not cast abroad [the seed of] dill or fennel and scatter cummin [a seasoning] and put the wheat in rows and barley in its intended place and spelt [an inferior kind of wheat] as the border?
Isaiah,28,26,[And he trains each of them correctly] for his God instructs him correctly and teaches him.
Isaiah,28,27,For dill is not threshed with a sharp threshing instrument nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin; but dill is beaten off with a staff and cummin with a rod [by hand].
Isaiah,28,28,Does one crush bread grain? No he does not thresh it continuously. But when he has driven his cartwheel and his horses over it he scatters it [tossing it up to the wind] without having crushed it.
Isaiah,28,29,This also comes from the Lord of hosts Who is wonderful in counsel [and] excellent in wisdom and effectual working.
Isaiah,29,1,WOE TO Ariel [Jerusalem] to Ariel the city where David encamped! Add yet another year; let the feasts run their round [but only one year more].
Isaiah,29,2,Then will I distress Ariel; and there shall be mourning and lamentation yet she shall be to Me like an Ariel [an altar hearth a hearth of burning the altar of God].
Isaiah,29,3,And I will encamp against you round about; and I will hem you in with siege works and I will set up fortifications against you.
Isaiah,29,4,And you shall be laid low [Jerusalem] speaking from beneath the ground and your speech shall come humbly from the dust. And your voice shall be like that of a ghost [produced by a medium] coming from the earth and your speech shall whisper and squeak as it chatters from the dust.
Isaiah,29,5,But the multitude of your [enemy] strangers that assail you shall be like small dust and the multitude of the ruthless and terrible ones like chaff that blows away. And in an instant suddenly
Isaiah,29,6,You shall be visited and delivered by the Lord of hosts with thunder and earthquake and great noise with whirlwind and tempest and the flame of a devouring fire.
Isaiah,29,7,And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel [Jerusalem] even all that fight against her and her stronghold and that distress her shall be as a dream a vision of the night.
Isaiah,29,8,It shall be as when a hungry man dreams that he is eating but he wakens with his craving not satisfied; or as when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking but he wakens and is faint and his thirst is not quenched. So shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.
Isaiah,29,9,Stop and wonder [at this prophecy if you choose whether you understand it or not; soon you will witness the actual event] and be confounded [reluctantly]! Blind yourselves [now if you choose; take your pleasure] and then be blinded [at the actual occurrence]. They are drunk but not from wine; they stagger but not from strong drink [but from spiritual stupor].
Isaiah,29,10,For the Lord has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep. And He has closed your eyes the prophets; and your heads the seers He has covered and muffled.
Isaiah,29,11,And the vision of all this has become for you like the words of a book that is sealed. When men give it to one who can read saying Read this I pray you he says I cannot for it is sealed.
Isaiah,29,12,And when the book is given to him who is not learned saying Read this I pray you he says I cannot read.
Isaiah,29,13,And the Lord said Forasmuch as this people draw near Me with their mouth and honor Me with their lips but remove their hearts and minds far from Me and their fear and reverence for Me are a commandment of men that is learned by repetition [without any thought as to the meaning]
Isaiah,29,14,Therefore behold! I will again do marvelous things with this people marvelous and astonishing things; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish and the understanding of their discerning men will vanish or be hidden.
Isaiah,29,15,Woe to those who [seek to] hide deep from the Lord their counsel whose deeds are in the dark and who say Who sees us? Who knows us?
Isaiah,29,16,[Oh your perversity!] You turn things upside down! Shall the potter be considered of no more account than the clay? Shall the thing that is made say of its maker He did not make me; or the thing that is formed say of him who formed it He has no understanding?
Isaiah,29,17,Is it not yet a very little while until Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and the fruitful field esteemed as a forest?
Isaiah,29,18,And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book and out of obscurity and gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see.
Isaiah,29,19,The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord and the poor among men shall rejoice and exult in the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah,29,20,For the terrible one [the Assyrian enemy] shall come to nought and the scoffer shall cease and all those who watch for iniquity [as an occasion for accusation] shall be cut off--
Isaiah,29,21,Those who make a man an offender and bring condemnation upon him with a word and lay a trap for him who upholds justice at the city gate and thrust aside the innocent and truly righteous with an empty plea.
Isaiah,29,22,Therefore thus says the Lord Who redeemed Abraham [out of Ur and idolatry] concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not then be ashamed; not then shall his face become pale [with fear and disappointment because of his children's degeneracy].
Isaiah,29,23,For when he sees his children [walking in the way of piety and virtue] the work of My hands in his midst they will revere My name; they will revere the Holy One of Jacob and reverently fear the God of Israel.
Isaiah,29,24,Those who err in spirit will come to understanding and those who murmur [discontentedly] will accept instruction.
Isaiah,30,1,WOE TO the rebellious children says the Lord who take counsel and carry out a plan but not Mine and who make a league and pour out a drink offering but not of My Spirit thus adding sin to sin;
Isaiah,30,2,Who set out to go down into Egypt and have not asked Me--to flee to the stronghold of Pharaoh and to strengthen themselves in his strength and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!
Isaiah,30,3,Therefore shall the strength and protection of Pharaoh turn to your shame and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt be to your humiliation and confusion.
Isaiah,30,4,For though [Pharaoh's] officials are at Zoan and his ambassadors arrive at Hanes [in Egypt]
Isaiah,30,5,Yet will all be ashamed because of a people [the Egyptians] who cannot profit them who are not a help or benefit but a shame and disgrace.
Isaiah,30,6,A mournful inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning the beasts of the South (the Negeb): Oh the heavy burden the load of treasures going to Egypt! Through a land of trouble and anguish in which are lioness and lion viper and fiery flying serpent they carry their riches upon the shoulders of young donkeys and their treasures upon the humps of camels to a people that will not and cannot profit them.
Isaiah,30,7,For Egypt's help is worthless and toward no purpose. Therefore I have called her Rahab Who Sits Still.
Isaiah,30,8,Now go write it before them on a tablet and inscribe it in a book that it may be as a witness for the time to come forevermore.
Isaiah,30,9,For this is a rebellious people faithless and lying sons children who will not hear the law and instruction of the Lord;
Isaiah,30,10,Who [virtually] say to the seers [by their conduct] See not! and to the prophets Prophesy not to us what is right! Speak to us smooth things prophesy deceitful illusions.
Isaiah,30,11,Get out of the true way turn aside out of the path cease holding up before us the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah,30,12,Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel: Because you despise and spurn this [My] word and trust in cunning and oppression in crookedness and perverseness and rely on them
Isaiah,30,13,Therefore this iniquity and guilt will be to you like a broken section of a high wall bulging out and ready [at some distant day] to fall whose crash will [then] come suddenly and swiftly in an instant.
Isaiah,30,14,And he shall break it as a potter's vessel is broken breaking it in pieces without sparing so that there cannot be found among its pieces one large enough to carry coals of fire from the hearth or to dip water out of the cistern.
Isaiah,30,15,For thus said the Lord God the Holy One of Israel: In returning [to Me] and resting [in Me] you shall be saved; in quietness and in [trusting] confidence shall be your strength. But you would not
Isaiah,30,16,And you said No! We will speed [our own course] on horses! Therefore you will speed [in flight from your enemies]! You said We will ride upon swift steeds [doing our own way]! Therefore will they who pursue you be swift [so swift that]
Isaiah,30,17,One thousand of you will flee at the threat of one of them; at the threat of five you will flee till you are left like a beacon or a flagpole on the top of a mountain and like a signal on a hill.
Isaiah,30,18,And therefore the Lord [earnestly] waits [expecting looking and longing] to be gracious to you; and therefore He lifts Himself up that He may have mercy on you and show loving-kindness to you. For the Lord is a God of justice. Blessed (happy fortunate to be envied) are all those who [earnestly] wait for Him who expect and look and long for Him [for His victory His favor His love His peace His joy and His matchless unbroken companionship]!
Isaiah,30,19,O people who dwell in Zion at Jerusalem you will weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when He hears it He will answer you.
Isaiah,30,20,And though the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction yet your Teacher will not hide Himself any more but your eyes will constantly behold your Teacher.
Isaiah,30,21,And your ears will hear a word behind you saying This is the way; walk in it when you turn to the right hand and when you turn to the left.
Isaiah,30,22,Then you will defile your carved images overlaid with silver and your molten images plated with gold; you will cast them away as a filthy bloodstained cloth and you will say to them Be gone!
Isaiah,30,23,Then will He give you rain for the seed with which you sow the soil and bread grain from the produce of the ground and it will be rich and plentiful. In that day your cattle will feed in large pastures.
Isaiah,30,24,The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savory and salted fodder which has been winnowed with shovel and with fork.
Isaiah,30,25,And upon every high mountain and upon every high hill there will be brooks and streams of water in the day of the great slaughter [the day of the Lord] when the towers fall [and all His enemies are destroyed].
Isaiah,30,26,Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun and the light of the sun will be sevenfold like the light of seven days [concentrated in one] in the day that the Lord binds up the hurt of His people and heals their wound [inflicted by Him because of their sins].
Isaiah,30,27,Behold the Name of the Lord comes from afar burning with His anger and in thick rising smoke. His lips are full of indignation and His tongue is like a consuming fire.

Isaiah,30,29,You shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept and gladness of heart as when one marches in procession with a flute to go to the temple on the mountain of the Lord to the Rock of Israel.
Isaiah,30,30,And the Lord shall cause His glorious voice to be heard and the descending blow of His arm to be seen coming down with indignant anger and with the flame of a devouring fire amid crashing blast and cloudburst tempest and hailstones.
Isaiah,30,31,At the voice of the Lord the Assyrians will be stricken with dismay and terror when He smites them with His rod.
Isaiah,30,32,And every passing stroke of the staff of punishment and doom which the Lord lays upon them shall be to the sound of [Israel's] timbrels and lyres when in battle He attacks [Assyria] with swinging and menacing arms.
Isaiah,30,33,For Topheth [a place of burning and abomination] has already been laid out and long ago prepared; yes for the [Assyrian] king and [the god] Molech it has been made ready its pyre made deep and large with fire and much wood; the breath of the Lord like a stream of brimstone kindles it.
Isaiah,31,1,WOE TO the rebellious children says the Lord who take counsel and carry out a plan but not Mine and who make a league and pour out a drink offering but not of My Spirit thus adding sin to sin;
Isaiah,31,2,Who set out to go down into Egypt and have not asked Me--to flee to the stronghold of Pharaoh and to strengthen themselves in his strength and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!
Isaiah,31,3,Therefore shall the strength and protection of Pharaoh turn to your shame and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt be to your humiliation and confusion.
Isaiah,31,4,For though [Pharaoh's] officials are at Zoan and his ambassadors arrive at Hanes [in Egypt]
Isaiah,31,5,Yet will all be ashamed because of a people [the Egyptians] who cannot profit them who are not a help or benefit but a shame and disgrace.
Isaiah,31,6,A mournful inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning the beasts of the South (the Negeb): Oh the heavy burden the load of treasures going to Egypt!

Isaiah,31,8,Now go write it before them on a tablet and inscribe it in a book that it may be as a witness for the time to come forevermore.
Isaiah,31,9,For this is a rebellious people faithless and lying sons children who will not hear the law and instruction of the Lord;
Isaiah,32,1,BEHOLD A King will reign in righteousness and princes will rule with justice.
Isaiah,32,2,And each one of them shall be like a hiding place from the wind and a shelter from the storm like streams of water in a dry place like the shade of a great rock in a weary land [to those who turn to them].

Isaiah,32,5,The fool (the unbeliever and the ungodly) will no more be called noble nor the crafty and greedy [for gain] said to be bountiful and princely.

Isaiah,32,7,The instruments and methods of the fraudulent and greedy [for gain] are evil; he devises wicked devices to ruin the poor and the lowly with lying words even when the plea of the needy is just and right.
Isaiah,32,8,But the noble openhearted and liberal man devises noble things; and he stands for what is noble openhearted and generous.
Isaiah,32,9,Rise up you women who are at ease! Hear my [Isaiah's] voice you confident and careless daughters! Listen to what I am saying!

Isaiah,32,11,Tremble you women who are at ease! Shudder with fear you complacent ones! Strip yourselves bare and gird sackcloth upon your loins [in grief]!
Isaiah,32,12,They shall beat upon their breasts for the pleasant fields for the fruitful vine
Isaiah,32,13,For the land of my people growing over with thorns and briers--yes for all the houses of joy in the joyous city.

Isaiah,36,1,NOW IN the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.
Isaiah,36,2,And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh [the military official] from Lachish [the Judean fortress commanding the road from Egypt] to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem with a great army. And he stood by the canal of the Upper Pool on the highway to the Fuller's Field.
Isaiah,36,3,Then came out to meet him Eliakim son of Hilkiah who was over the [royal] household and Shebna the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recording historian.
Isaiah,36,4,And the Rabshakeh said to them Say to Hezekiah Thus says the great king the king of Assyria: What reason for confidence is this in which you trust?
Isaiah,36,5,Do you suppose that mere words of the lips can pass for warlike counsel and strength? Now in whom do you trust and on whom do you rely that you rebel against me?
Isaiah,36,6,Behold you trust in the staff of this bruised and broken reed Egypt which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust and rely on him.
Isaiah,36,7,But if you say to me We trust in and rely on the Lord our God--is it not He Whose high places and Whose altars Hezekiah has taken away saying to Judah and to Jerusalem You shall worship before this altar?
Isaiah,36,8,Now therefore I pray you make a wager with my master the king of Assyria and give him pledges and I will give you two thousand horses--if you are able on your part to put riders on them.
Isaiah,36,9,How then can you repulse the attack of a single captain of the least of my master's servants when you put your reliance on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
Isaiah,36,10,Moreover is it without the Lord that I have now come up against this land to destroy it? The Lord said to me Go up against this land and destroy it.
Isaiah,36,11,Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the Rabshakeh We pray you speak to your servants in the Aramaic or Syrian language for we understand it; and do not speak to us in the language of the Jews in the hearing of the people on the wall.
Isaiah,36,12,But the Rabshakeh said Has my master sent me to speak these words only to your master and to you? Has he not sent me to the men sitting on the wall who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?
Isaiah,36,13,Then the Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the language of the Jews: Hear the words of the great king the king of Assyria!
Isaiah,36,14,Thus says the king: Let not Hezekiah deceive you for he will not be able to deliver you.
Isaiah,36,15,Nor let Hezekiah make you trust in and rely on the Lord saying The Lord will surely deliver us; this city will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Isaiah,36,16,Do not listen to Hezekiah for thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me and come out to me; and eat every one from his own vine and every one from his own fig tree and drink every one the water of his own cistern
Isaiah,36,17,Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of grain and wine a land of bread and vineyards.
Isaiah,36,18,Beware lest Hezekiah persuade and mislead you by saying The Lord will deliver us. Has any one of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
Isaiah,36,19,Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad [in Syria]? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim [a place from which the Assyrians brought colonists to inhabit evacuated Samaria]? And have [the gods] delivered Samaria [capital of the ten northern tribes of Israel] out of my hand?
Isaiah,36,20,Who among all the gods of these lands has delivered his land out of my hand that [you should think that] the Lord can deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
Isaiah,36,21,But they kept still and answered him not a word for the king's [Hezekiah's] command was Do not answer him.
Isaiah,36,22,Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah who was over the household and Shebna the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recording historian came to Hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of the Rabshakeh [the Assyrian military official].
Isaiah,37,1,AND WHEN King Hezekiah heard it he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the Lord.
Isaiah,37,2,And he sent Eliakim who was over the [royal] household and Shebna the secretary and the older priests clothed with sackcloth to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
Isaiah,37,3,And they said to him Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble and distress and of rebuke and of disgrace; for children have come to the birth and there is no strength to bring them forth.
Isaiah,37,4,It may be that the Lord your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to mock reproach insult and defy the living God and will rebuke the words which the Lord your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant [of His people] that is left.
Isaiah,37,5,So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
Isaiah,37,6,And Isaiah said to them You shall say to your master Thus says the Lord: Do not be afraid because of the words which you have heard with which the servants of the king of Assyria have reviled and blasphemed Me.
Isaiah,37,7,Behold I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
Isaiah,37,8,So the Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah [a fortified city of Judah]; for he had heard that the king had departed from Lachish.
Isaiah,37,9,And [Sennacherib king of Assyria] heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia He has come forth to make war with you. And when he heard it he sent messengers to Hezekiah saying
Isaiah,37,10,Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: Let not your God in Whom you trust deceive you by saying Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Isaiah,37,11,Behold you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands destroying them utterly. And shall you be delivered?
Isaiah,37,12,Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my predecessors have destroyed as Gozan Haran [of Mesopotamia] Rezeph and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?
Isaiah,37,13,Where is the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad [of northern Syria] and the king of the city of Sepharvaim the king of Hena or the king of Ivvah?
Isaiah,37,14,And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. And Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord and spread it before the Lord.
Isaiah,37,15,And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord:
Isaiah,37,16,O Lord of hosts God of Israel Who [in symbol] are enthroned above the cherubim [of the ark in the temple] You are the God You alone of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.
Isaiah,37,17,Incline Your ear O Lord and hear; open Your eyes O Lord and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib which he has sent to mock reproach insult and defy the living God.
Isaiah,37,18,It is true Lord that the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands
Isaiah,37,19,And have cast the gods of those peoples into the fire for they were not gods but the work of men's hands wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them.
Isaiah,37,20,Now therefore O Lord our God save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know (understand and realize) that You are the Lord even You only.
Isaiah,37,21,Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying Thus says the Lord the God of Israel: Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria
Isaiah,37,22,This is the word which the Lord has spoken concerning him: The Virgin Daughter of Zion has despised you and laughed you to scorn; the Daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head behind you.
Isaiah,37,23,Whom have you mocked and reviled [insulted and blasphemed]? And against Whom have you raised your voice and haughtily lifted your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!
Isaiah,37,24,By your servants you have mocked reproached insulted and defied the Lord and you have said With my many chariots I have gone up to the height of the mountains to the inner recesses of Lebanon. I cut down its tallest cedars and its choicest cypress trees; I came to its remotest height its most luxuriant and dense forest;
Isaiah,37,25,I dug wells and drank foreign waters and with the sole of my feet I have dried up all the rivers [the Nile streams] of Egypt.
Isaiah,37,26,[But says the God of Israel] have you not heard that I purposed to do it long ago that I planned it in ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass that you [king of Assyria] should [be My instrument to] lay waste fortified cities making them ruinous heaps.
Isaiah,37,27,Therefore their inhabitants had little power they were dismayed and confounded; they were like the grass of the field and like the green herb like the grass on the housetops and like a field of grain blasted before it is grown or is in stalk.
Isaiah,37,28,But I [the Lord] know your sitting down and your going out and your coming in and your raging against Me.
Isaiah,37,29,Because your raging against Me and your arrogance and careless ease have come to My ears therefore will I put My hook in your nose and My bridle in your lips and I will turn you back by the way you came.
Isaiah,37,30,And [now Hezekiah says the Lord] this shall be the sign [of these things] to you: you shall eat this year what grows of itself and in the second year that which springs from the same. And in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.
Isaiah,37,31,And the remnant that has survived of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
Isaiah,37,32,For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant and a band that survives out of Mount Zion. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.
Isaiah,37,33,Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow here or come before it with shield or cast up a siege mound against it.
Isaiah,37,34,By the way that he came by the same way he shall return and he shall not come into this city says the Lord.
Isaiah,37,35,For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for the sake of My servant David.
Isaiah,37,36,And the Angel of the Lord went forth and slew 185000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when [the living] arose early in the morning behold all these were dead bodies.
Isaiah,37,37,So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned and dwelt at Nineveh.
Isaiah,37,38,And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons killed him with the sword and they escaped into the land of Armenia or Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
Isaiah,38,1,IN THOSE days King Hezekiah of Judah became ill and was at the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said Thus says the Lord: Set your house in order for you shall die and not live.
Isaiah,38,2,Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord
Isaiah,38,3,And said Remember [earnestly] now O Lord I beseech You how I have walked before You in faithfulness and in truth with a whole heart [absolutely devoted to You] and have done what is good in Your sight. And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
Isaiah,38,4,Then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah saying
Isaiah,38,5,Go and say to Hezekiah Thus says the Lord the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer I have seen your tears; behold I will add to your life fifteen years.
Isaiah,38,6,And I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city [Jerusalem].
Isaiah,38,7,And this will be the sign to you from the Lord that the Lord will do this thing that He has spoken:
Isaiah,38,8,Behold I will turn the shadow [denoting the time of day] on the steps or degrees which has gone down on the steps or sundial of Ahaz backward ten steps or degrees. And the sunlight turned back ten steps on the steps on which it had gone down.
Isaiah,38,9,This is the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:
Isaiah,38,10,I said In the noontide and tranquillity of my days I must depart; I am to pass through the gates of Sheol (the place of the dead) deprived of the remainder of my years.
Isaiah,38,11,I said I shall not see the Lord even the Lord in the land of the living; I shall behold man no more among the inhabitants of the world.
Isaiah,38,12,My [fleshly] dwelling is plucked up and is removed from me like a shepherd's tent. I have rolled up my life as a weaver [rolls up the finished web]; [the Lord] cuts me free from the loom; from day to night You bring me to an end.
Isaiah,38,13,I thought and quieted myself until morning. Like a lion He breaks all my bones; from day to night You bring me to an end.
Isaiah,38,14,Like a twittering swallow or a crane so do I chirp and chatter; I moan like a dove. My eyes are weary and dim with looking upward. O Lord I am oppressed; take my side and be my security [as of a debtor being sent to prison].
Isaiah,38,15,But what can I say? For He has both spoken to me and He Himself has done it. I must go softly [as in solemn procession] all my years and my sleep has fled because of the bitterness of my soul.
Isaiah,38,16,O Lord by these things men live; and in all these is the life of my spirit. O give me back my health and make me live!
Isaiah,38,17,Behold it was for my peace that I had intense bitterness; but You have loved back my life from the pit of corruption and nothingness for You have cast all my sins behind Your back.
Isaiah,38,18,For Sheol (the place of the dead) cannot confess and reach out the hand to You death cannot praise and rejoice in You; they who go down to the pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness [to Your promises; their probation is at an end their destiny is sealed].
Isaiah,38,19,The living the living--they shall thank and praise You as I do this day; the father shall make known to the children Your faithfulness and Your truth.
Isaiah,38,20,The Lord is ready to save (deliver) me; therefore we will sing my songs with [my] stringed instruments all the days of our lives in the house of the Lord.
Isaiah,38,21,Now Isaiah had said Let them take a cake of figs and lay it for a plaster upon the boil that he may recover.
Isaiah,38,22,Hezekiah also had said What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the Lord?
Isaiah,39,1,AT THAT time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent [messengers with] letters and a present to Hezekiah for he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered.
Isaiah,39,2,And Hezekiah was glad and welcomed them and showed them the house of his spices and precious things--the silver the gold the spices the precious ointment all the house of his armor and his jewels and all that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.
Isaiah,39,3,Then came Isaiah the prophet to King Hezekiah and said to him What did these men say? From where did they come to you? And Hezekiah said They came to me from a far country even from Babylon.
Isaiah,39,4,Then Isaiah said What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah answered They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.
Isaiah,39,5,Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah Hear the word of the Lord of hosts:
Isaiah,39,6,Behold the days are coming when all that is in your house and that which your predecessors have stored up till this day shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left says the Lord.
Isaiah,39,7,And some of your own sons who are born to you shall be taken away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
Isaiah,39,8,Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah The word of the Lord which you have spoken is good. And he added For there will be peace and faithfulness [to His promises to us] in my days.
Isaiah,40,1,COMFORT COMFORT My people says your God.
Isaiah,40,2,Speak tenderly to the heart of Jerusalem and cry to her that her time of service and her warfare are ended that [her punishment is accepted and] her iniquity is pardoned that she has received [punishment] from the Lord's hand double for all her sins.

Isaiah,40,17,All the nations are as nothing before Him; they are regarded by Him as less than nothing and emptiness (waste futility and worthlessness).
Isaiah,40,18,To whom then will you liken God? Or with what likeness will you compare Him?
Isaiah,40,19,The graven image! A workman casts it and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and casts silver chains for it.
Isaiah,40,20,He who is so impoverished that he has no offering or oblation or rich gift to give [to his god is constrained to make a wooden offering an idol; so he] chooses a tree that will not rot; he seeks out a skillful craftsman to carve and set up an image that will not totter or deteriorate.
Isaiah,40,21,[You worshipers of idols you are without excuse.] Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? [These things ought to convince you of God's omnipotence and of the folly of bowing to idols.] Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?

Isaiah,57,13,When you cry out let your [rabble] collection of idols deliver you! But the wind shall take them all a breath shall carry them away.

Isaiah,59,5,They hatch adders' eggs and weave the spider's web; he who eats of their eggs dies and [from an egg] which is crushed a viper breaks out [for their nature is ruinous deadly evil].

Isaiah,65,21,They shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.
Isaiah,65,22,They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat [the fruit]. For as the days of a tree so shall be the days of My people and My chosen and elect shall long make use of and enjoy the work of their hands.
Isaiah,65,23,They shall not labor in vain or bring forth [children] for sudden terror or calamity; for they shall be the descendants of the blessed of the Lord and their offspring with them.
Isaiah,65,24,And it shall be that before they call I will answer; and while they are yet speaking I will hear.
Isaiah,65,25,The wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt or destroy in all My holy Mount [Zion] says the Lord.
Isaiah,66,1,THUS SAYS the Lord: Heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool. What kind of house would you build for Me? And what kind can be My resting-place?
Isaiah,66,2,For all these things My hand has made and so all these things have come into being [by and for Me] says the Lord. But this is the man to whom I will look and have regard: he who is humble and of a broken or wounded spirit and who trembles at My word and reveres My commands.
Isaiah,66,3,[The acts of the hypocrite's worship are as abominable to God as if they were offered to idols.] He who kills an ox [then] will be as guilty as if he slew and sacrificed a man; he who sacrifices a lamb or a kid as if he broke a dog's neck and sacrificed him; he who offers a cereal offering as if he offered swine's blood; he who burns incense [to God] as if he blessed an idol. [Such people] have chosen their own ways and they delight in their abominations;
Isaiah,66,4,So I also will choose their delusions and mockings their calamities and afflictions and I will bring their fears upon them--because when I called no one answered; when I spoke they did not listen or obey. But they did what was evil in My sight and chose that in which I did not delight.
Isaiah,66,5,Hear the word of the Lord you who tremble at His word: Your brethren who hate you who cast you out for My name's sake have said Let the Lord be glorified that we may see your joy! But it is they who shall be put to shame.
Isaiah,66,6,[Hark!] An uproar from the city! A voice from the temple! The voice of the Lord rendering recompense to His enemies!
Isaiah,66,7,Before [Zion] travailed she gave birth; before her pain came upon her she was delivered of a male child.
Isaiah,66,8,Who has heard of such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Or shall a nation be brought forth in a moment? For as soon as Zion was in labor she brought forth her children.
Isaiah,66,9,Shall I bring to the [moment of] birth and not cause to bring forth? says the Lord. Shall I Who causes to bring forth shut the womb? says your God.
Isaiah,66,10,Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her all you who love her; rejoice for joy with her all you who mourn over her
Isaiah,66,11,That you may nurse and be satisfied from her consoling breasts that you may drink deeply and be delighted with the abundance and brightness of her glory.
Isaiah,66,12,For thus says the Lord: Behold I will extend peace to her like a river and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; then you will be nursed you will be carried on her hip and trotted [lovingly bounced up and down] on her [God's maternal] knees.
Isaiah,66,13,As one whom his mother comforts so will I comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
Isaiah,66,14,When you see this your heart shall rejoice; your bones shall flourish like green and tender grass. And the [powerful] hand of the Lord shall be revealed and known to be with His servants but His indignation [shown] to be against His enemies.
Isaiah,66,15,For behold the Lord will come in fire and His chariots will be like the stormy wind to render His anger with fierceness and His rebuke with flames of fire.
Isaiah,66,16,For by fire and by His sword will the Lord execute judgment upon all flesh and the slain of the Lord will be many.
Isaiah,66,17,Those who [attempt to] sanctify themselves and cleanse themselves to enter [and sacrifice to idols] in the gardens following after one in the midst eating hog's flesh and the abomination [creeping things] and the [mouse--their works and their thoughts] shall come to an end together says the Lord.
Isaiah,66,18,For I know their works and their thoughts. And the time is coming when I will gather all nations and tongues and they will come and see My glory.
Isaiah,66,19,And I will set up a [miraculous] sign among them and from them I will send survivors to the nations--to Tarshish Pul (Put) and Lud who draw the bow to Tubal and Javan to the isles and coastlands afar off that have not heard of My fame nor seen My glory. And they will declare and proclaim My glory among the nations.
Isaiah,66,20,And they shall bring all your brethren from all the nations as an offering to the Lord--upon horses and in chariots and in litters and upon mules and upon camels--to My holy mountain Jerusalem says the Lord just as the children of Israel bring their cereal offering in a clean vessel to the house of the Lord.
Isaiah,66,21,And I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites says the Lord.
Isaiah,66,22,For as the new heavens and the new earth which I make shall remain before Me says the Lord so shall your offspring and your name remain.
Isaiah,66,23,And it shall be that from one New Moon to another New Moon and from one Sabbath to another Sabbath all flesh shall come to worship before Me says the Lord.
Isaiah,66,24,And they shall go forth and gaze upon the dead bodies of the [rebellious] men who have stepped over against Me; for their worm shall not die their fire shall not be quenched and they shall be an abhorrence to all mankind.
Jeremiah,1,1,THE WORDS of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin [two or three miles north of Jerusalem]
Jeremiah,1,2,To whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah in the thirteenth year of his reign.
Jeremiah,1,3,It came also in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah until the carrying away of Jerusalem into captivity in the fifth month.
Jeremiah,1,4,Then the word of the Lord came to me [Jeremiah] saying
Jeremiah,1,5,Before I formed you in the womb I knew [and] approved of you [as My chosen instrument] and before you were born I separated and set you apart consecrating you; [and] I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.
Jeremiah,1,6,Then said I Ah Lord God! Behold I cannot speak for I am only a youth.
Jeremiah,1,7,But the Lord said to me Say not I am only a youth; for you shall go to all to whom I shall send you and whatever I command you you shall speak.
Jeremiah,1,8,Be not afraid of them [their faces] for I am with you to deliver you says the Lord.
Jeremiah,1,9,Then the Lord put forth His hand and touched my mouth. And the Lord said to me Behold I have put My words in your mouth.
Jeremiah,1,10,See I have this day appointed you to the oversight of the nations and of the kingdoms to root out and pull down to destroy and to overthrow to build and to plant.
Jeremiah,1,11,Moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying Jeremiah what do you see? And I said I see a branch or shoot of an almond tree [the emblem of alertness and activity blossoming in late winter].
Jeremiah,1,12,Then said the Lord to me You have seen well for I am alert and active watching over My word to perform it.
Jeremiah,1,13,And the word of the Lord came to me the second time saying What do you see? And I said I see a boiling pot and the face of it is [tipped away] from the north [its mouth about to pour forth on the south on Judea].
Jeremiah,1,14,Then the Lord said to me Out of the north the evil [which the prophets had foretold as the result of national sin] shall disclose itself and break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
Jeremiah,1,15,For behold I will call all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north says the Lord; and they will come and set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem against all its walls round about and against all the cities of Judah [as God's judicial act a consequence of Judah's wickedness].
Jeremiah,1,16,And I will utter My judgments against them for all the wickedness of those who have forsaken Me burned incense to other gods and worshiped the works of their own hands [idols].
Jeremiah,1,17,But you [Jeremiah] gird up your loins! Arise and tell them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed and break down at the sight of their faces lest I confound you before them and permit you to be overcome.
Jeremiah,1,18,For I behold I have made you this day a fortified city and an iron pillar and bronze walls against the whole land--against the [successive] kings of Judah against its princes against its priests and against the people of the land [giving you divine strength which no hostile power can overcome].
Jeremiah,1,19,And they shall fight against you but they shall not [finally] prevail against you for I am with you says the Lord to deliver you.
Jeremiah,2,1,AND THE word of the Lord came to me [Jeremiah] saying
Jeremiah,2,2,Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem saying Thus says the Lord: I [earnestly] remember the kindness and devotion of your youth your love after your betrothal [in Egypt] and marriage [at Sinai] when you followed Me in the wilderness in a land not sown.
Jeremiah,2,3,Israel was holiness [something set apart from ordinary purposes dedicated] to the Lord the firstfruits of His harvest [of which no stranger was allowed to partake]; all who ate of it [injuring Israel] offended and became guilty; evil came upon them says the Lord.
Jeremiah,2,4,Hear the word of the Lord O house of Jacob and all the families of the house of Israel.
Jeremiah,2,5,Thus says the Lord: What unrighteousness did your fathers find in Me that they went far from Me and [habitually] went after emptiness falseness and futility and themselves became fruitless and worthless?
Jeremiah,2,6,Nor did they say Where is the Lord Who brought us up out of the land of Egypt Who led us through the wilderness through a land of deserts and pits through a land of drought and of the shadow of death and deep darkness through a land that no man passes through and where no man dwells?
Jeremiah,2,7,And I brought you into a plentiful land to enjoy its fruits and good things. But when you entered you defiled My land and made My heritage an abomination [detestable and loathsome].
Jeremiah,2,8,[Even] the priests did not say Where is the Lord? And those who handle the law [given by God to Moses] knew Me not. The rulers and secular shepherds also transgressed against Me and the prophets prophesied by [the authority and in the name of] Baal and followed after things that do not profit.
Jeremiah,2,9,Therefore I will still contend with you [by inflicting further judgments on you] says the Lord and with your children's children will I contend.
Jeremiah,2,10,For cross over to the coasts of Cyprus [to the west] and see send also to Kedar [to the east] and carefully consider; and see whether there has been such a thing as this:
Jeremiah,2,11,Has a nation [ever] changed its gods even though they are not gods? But My people have changed their Glory [God] for that which does not profit.
Jeremiah,2,12,Be astonished and appalled O heavens at this; be shocked and shrivel up with horror says the Lord [at the behavior of the people].
Jeremiah,2,13,For My people have committed two evils: they have forsaken Me the Fountain of living waters and they have hewn for themselves cisterns broken cisterns which cannot hold water.
Jeremiah,2,14,Is Israel a servant? Is he a homeborn slave? Why has he become a captive and a prey?
Jeremiah,2,15,The young lions have roared over him and made their voices heard. And they have made his land a waste; his cities are burned ruins without inhabitant.
Jeremiah,2,16,Moreover the children of Memphis and Tahpanhes (Egypt) [have in times past shown their power as a foe; they] have broken and fed on the crown of your head [Israel]--so do not rely on them as an ally now.
Jeremiah,2,17,Have you not brought this upon yourself by forsaking the Lord your God when He led you in the way?
Jeremiah,2,18,And now what have you to gain by allying yourself with Egypt and going her way to drink the [black and roiled] waters of the Nile? Or what have you to gain in going the way of Assyria to drink the waters of the Euphrates?
Jeremiah,2,19,Your own wickedness shall chasten and correct you and your backslidings and desertion of faith shall reprove you. Know therefore and recognize that this is an evil and bitter thing: [first] you have forsaken the Lord your God; [second] you are indifferent to Me and the fear of Me is not in you says the Lord of hosts.
Jeremiah,2,20,For long ago [in Egypt] I broke your yoke and burst your bonds [not that you might be free but that you might serve Me] and long ago you shattered the yoke and snapped the bonds [of My law which I put upon you]; you said I will not serve and obey You! For upon every high hill and under every green tree you [eagerly] prostrated yourself [in idolatrous worship] playing the harlot.
Jeremiah,2,21,Yet I had planted you [O house of Israel] a choice vine wholly of pure seed. How then have you turned into degenerate shoots of wild vine alien to Me?
Jeremiah,2,22,For though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap yet your iniquity and guilt are still [upon you; you are] spotted dirty and stained before Me says the Lord.
Jeremiah,2,23,How can you say I am not defiled; I have not gone after the Baals [other gods]? Look at your way in the valley; know what you have done. You are a restive young female camel [in the uncontrollable violence of her brute passion eagerly] running hither and thither
Jeremiah,2,24,Or [you have the untamed and reckless nature of] a wild donkey used to the desert in her heat sniffing the wind [for the scent of a male]. In her mating season who can restrain her? No males seeking her need weary themselves; in her month they will find her [seeking them].
Jeremiah,2,25,[Cease from your mad running after idols from which you get nothing but bitter injury.] Keep your feet from being unshod and your throat from thirst. But you said It is hopeless! For I have loved strangers and foreigners and after them I will go.
Jeremiah,2,26,As the thief is brought to shame when he is caught so shall the house of Israel be brought to shame--they their kings their princes their priests and their prophets--
Jeremiah,2,27,[Inasmuch as] they say to a tree You are my father and to a stone You gave me birth. For they have turned their backs to Me and not their faces; but in the time of their trouble they say Arise [O Lord] and save us!
Jeremiah,2,28,But where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them arise if they can save you in the time of your trouble! For [as many as] the number of your cities are your gods O Judah. [Surely so many handmade idols should be able to help you!]
Jeremiah,2,29,Why do you complain and remonstrate against My wrath? You all have rebelled and revolted against Me says the Lord.
Jeremiah,2,30,In vain have I stricken your children (your people); they received no discipline (no correction). Your own sword devoured your prophets like a destroying lion.
Jeremiah,2,31,O generation [that you are]! Behold consider and regard the word of the Lord: Have I been a wilderness to Israel [like a land without food]? A land of deep darkness [like a way without light]? Why do My people say We have broken loose [we are free and will roam at large]; we will come no more to You?
Jeremiah,2,32,Can a maid forget and neglect [to wear] her ornaments or a bride her [marriage] girdle [with its significance like that of a wedding ring]? Yet My people have forgotten Me days without number.
Jeremiah,2,33,How you deck yourself and direct your way to procure [adulterous] love! Because of it even wicked women have learned [indecent] ways from you.
Jeremiah,2,34,Also on your skirts is found the lifeblood of the persons of the innocent poor; you did not find them housebreaking nor have I found it out by secret search. But it is because of [your lust for idolatry that you have done] all these things--[that is everywhere evident.]
Jeremiah,2,35,Yet you keep saying I am innocent; surely His anger has turned away from Me. Behold I will bring you to judgment and will plead against you because you say I have not sinned.
Jeremiah,2,36,Why do you gad or wander about so much to change your way? You shall be put to shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria.
Jeremiah,2,37,From [Egypt] also you will come away with your hands upon your head for the Lord has rejected those in whom you confide and you will not prosper with [respect to] them.
Jeremiah,3,1,THAT IS to say If a man puts away his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man's will he return to her again? [Of course not!] Would not that land [where such a thing happened] be greatly polluted? But you have played the harlot [against Me] with many lovers--yet would you now return to Me? says the Lord [or do you even think to return to Me?]
Jeremiah,3,2,Lift up your eyes to the bare heights and see. Where have you not been adulterously lain with? By the wayside you have sat waiting for lovers [eager for idolatry] like an Arabian [desert tribesman who waits to plunder] in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your vile harlotry and your wickedness (unfaithfulness and disobedience to God).
Jeremiah,3,3,Therefore the showers have been withheld and there has been no spring rain. Yet you have the brow of a prostitute; you refuse to be ashamed.
Jeremiah,3,4,Have you not just now cried to Me: My Father You were the guide and companion of my youth?
Jeremiah,3,5,Will He retain His anger forever? Will He keep it to the end? Behold you have so spoken but you have done all the evil things you could and have had your way and have carried them through.
Jeremiah,3,6,Moreover the Lord said to me [Jeremiah] in the days of Josiah the king [of Judah] Have you seen what that faithless and backsliding Israel has done--how she went up on every high hill and under every green tree and there played the harlot?
Jeremiah,3,7,And I said After she has done all these things she will return to Me; but she did not return and her faithless and treacherous sister Judah saw it.
Jeremiah,3,8,And I saw even though [Judah knew] that for this very cause of committing adultery (idolatry) I [the Lord] had put faithless Israel away and given her a bill of divorce; yet her faithless and treacherous sister Judah was not afraid but she also went and played the harlot [following after idols].
Jeremiah,3,9,And through the infamy and unseemly frivolity of Israel's whoredom [because her immorality mattered little to her] she polluted and defiled the land [by her idolatry] committing adultery with [idols of] stones and trees.
Jeremiah,3,10,But in spite of all this her faithless and treacherous sister Judah did not return to Me in sincerity and with her whole heart but only in sheer hypocrisy [has she feigned obedience to King Josiah's reforms] says the Lord.
Jeremiah,3,11,And the Lord said to me Backsliding and faithless Israel has shown herself less guilty than false and treacherous Judah.
Jeremiah,3,12,Go and proclaim these words toward the north [where the ten tribes have been taken as captives] and say Return faithless Israel says the Lord and I will not cause My countenance to fall and look in anger upon you for I am merciful says the Lord; I will not keep My anger forever.
Jeremiah,3,13,Only know understand and acknowledge your iniquity and guilt--that you have rebelled and transgressed against the Lord your God and have scattered your favors among strangers under every green tree and you have not obeyed My voice says the Lord.
Jeremiah,3,14,Return O faithless children [of the whole twelve tribes] says the Lord for I am Lord and Master and Husband to you and I will take you [not as a nation but individually]--one from a city and two from a tribal family--and I will bring you to Zion.
Jeremiah,3,15,And I will give you [spiritual] shepherds after My own heart [in the final time] who will feed you with knowledge and understanding and judgment.
Jeremiah,3,16,And it shall be that when you have multiplied and increased in the land in those days says the Lord they shall no more say The ark of the covenant of the Lord. It shall not come to mind nor shall they [seriously] remember it nor shall they miss or visit it nor shall it be repaired or made again [for instead of the ark which represented God's presence He will show Himself to be present throughout the city].
Jeremiah,3,17,At that time they shall call Jerusalem The Throne of the Lord and all the nations shall be gathered to it in the renown and name of the Lord to Jerusalem; nor shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their own evil hearts.
Jeremiah,3,18,In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel and together they shall come out of the land of the north to the land that I gave as an inheritance to your fathers.
Jeremiah,3,19,And I thought how [gloriously and honorably] I would set you among My children and give you a pleasant land a goodly heritage the most beautiful and best [inheritance] among all nations! And I thought you would call Me My Father and would not turn away from following Me.
Jeremiah,3,20,Surely as a wife treacherously and faithlessly departs from her husband so have you dealt treacherously and faithlessly with Me O house of Israel says the Lord.
Jeremiah,3,21,A voice is heard on the bare heights the weeping and pleading of the sons of Israel because they have perverted their ways they have [eagerly] forgotten the Lord their God.
Jeremiah,3,22,Return O faithless sons [says the Lord and] I will heal your faithlessness. [And they answer] Behold we come to You for You are the Lord our God.
Jeremiah,3,23,Truly in vain is the hope of salvation from the hills and from the tumult and noisy throng on the mountains; truly in and with the Lord our God rests the salvation of Israel.
Jeremiah,3,24,[We have been ruined as a nation by our faithlessness and idolatry] for the shameful thing has consumed all for which our fathers toiled from our youth--their flocks and their herds their sons and their daughters.
Jeremiah,3,25,Let us lie prostrate in our shame and let our dishonor and confusion cover us; for we have sinned against the Lord our God we and our fathers; from our youth even to this day we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.
Jeremiah,4,1,IF YOU will return O Israel says the Lord if you will return to Me and if you will put away your abominable false gods out of My sight and not stray or waver
Jeremiah,4,2,And if you swear As the Lord lives in truth in judgment and justice and in righteousness (uprightness in every area and relation) then the nations will bless themselves in Him and in Him will they glory.
Jeremiah,4,3,For thus says the Lord to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem: Break up your ground left uncultivated for a season so that you may not sow among thorns.
Jeremiah,4,4,Circumcise yourselves to the Lord and take away the foreskins of your hearts you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem lest My wrath go forth like fire [consuming all that gets in its way] and burn so that no one can quench it because of the evil of your doings.
Jeremiah,4,5,Declare in Judah and publish in Jerusalem and say: Blow the trumpet in the land; cry aloud and say: Assemble yourselves and let us go into the fortified cities.
Jeremiah,4,6,Raise a standard toward Zion [to mark out the safest route to those seeking safety within Jerusalem's walls]! Flee for safety stay not for I bring evil from the north and great destruction.
Jeremiah,4,7,A lion has gone up from his thicket and a destroyer of nations is on his way. He has gone forth from his place to make your land a desolate waste; and your cities shall be left in ruins without an inhabitant.
Jeremiah,4,8,For this gird yourselves with sackcloth lament and wail for the fierce anger of the Lord has not turned back from us.
Jeremiah,4,9,And it shall be in that day says the Lord that the understanding and courage of the king shall fail (be paralyzed) and also that of the princes; the priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded and dazed with horror.
Jeremiah,4,10,Then I [Jeremiah] said Alas Lord God! Surely You have greatly deceived and misled this people and Jerusalem [for the prophets represented You as] saying [to Your people] You shall have peace whereas the sword has reached to [their very] life.
Jeremiah,4,11,At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness [comes at My command] against the daughter of My people--not [a wind] to fan or cleanse [from chaff as when threshing but]
Jeremiah,4,12,A wind too strong and full for winnowing comes at My word. Now I will also speak in judgment against [My people].
Jeremiah,4,13,Behold [the enemy] comes up like clouds his chariots like the whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us for we are ruined (destroyed)!
Jeremiah,4,14,O Jerusalem wash your heart from wickedness that you may be saved! How long shall your iniquitous and grossly offensive thoughts lodge within you?
Jeremiah,4,15,For a voice declares from Dan [in the north] and proclaims evil from Mount Ephraim [the range dividing Israel from Judah].
Jeremiah,4,16,Warn the [neighboring] nations [that our adversary is coming]; announce to Jerusalem that besiegers are coming from a far country and they shout against the cities of Judah.
Jeremiah,4,17,Like keepers of a field they are against her round about because she has been rebellious against Me says the Lord.
Jeremiah,4,18,Your ways and your doings have brought these things upon you. This is your calamity and doom; surely it is bitter for surely it reaches your very heart!
Jeremiah,4,19,[It is not only the prophet but also the people who cry out in their thoughts] My anguish my anguish! I writhe in pain! Oh the walls of my heart! My heart is disquieted and throbs aloud within me; I cannot be silent! For I have heard the sound of the trumpet the alarm of war.
Jeremiah,4,20,News of one violent disaster and calamity comes close after another for the whole land is laid waste; suddenly are my tents spoiled and destroyed and my [tent] curtains ruined in a moment.
Jeremiah,4,21,[O Lord] how long must I see the flag [marking the route for flight] and hear the sound of the trumpet [urging the people to flee for refuge]?
Jeremiah,4,22,[Their chastisement will continue until it has accomplished its purpose] for My people are stupid says the Lord [replying to Jeremiah]; they do not know and understand Me. They are thickheaded children and they have no understanding. They are wise to do evil but to do good they have no knowledge [and know not how].
Jeremiah,4,23,[In a vision Jeremiah sees Judah laid waste by conquest and captivity.] I looked at the land and behold it was [as at the time of creation] waste and vacant (void); and at the heavens and they had no light.
Jeremiah,4,24,I looked at the mountains and behold they trembled and all the hills moved lightly to and fro.
Jeremiah,4,25,I looked and behold there was no man and all the birds of the air had fled.
Jeremiah,4,26,I looked and behold the fruitful land was a desert and all its cities were laid waste before the Lord's presence before His fierce anger.
Jeremiah,4,27,For thus says the Lord: The whole land will be a desolation yet I will not make a full and complete end of it.
Jeremiah,4,28,For this will the earth mourn and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken I have purposed and I will not relent nor will I turn back [from it].
Jeremiah,4,29,Every city flees because of the noise of the horsemen and bowmen. They go into the thickets and climb among the rocks; every city is forsaken and not a man dwells in them.
Jeremiah,4,30,And you [plundered one] when you are made desolate what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet though you deck yourself with ornaments of gold though you paint your eyelids and make them look farther apart in vain you beautify yourself. Your lovers (allies) despise you; they seek your life.
Jeremiah,4,31,For I have heard a cry as of a woman in travail the anguish as of one who brings forth her first child--the cry of the Daughter of Zion who gasps for breath who spreads her hands saying Woe is me now! I am fainting before the murderers.
Jeremiah,5,1,RUN TO and fro through the streets of Jerusalem and see now and take notice! Seek in her broad squares to see if you can find a man [as Abraham sought in Sodom] one who does justice who seeks truth sincerity and faithfulness; and I will pardon [Jerusalem--for one uncompromisingly righteous person].
Jeremiah,5,2,And though they say As the Lord lives surely they swear falsely.
Jeremiah,5,3,O Lord do not your eyes look on the truth? [They have meant to please You outwardly but You look on their hearts.] You have stricken them but they have not grieved; You have consumed them but they have refused to take correction or instruction. They have made their faces harder than a rock they have refused to repent and return to You.
Jeremiah,5,4,Then I said Surely these are only the poor; they are [sinfully] foolish and have no understanding for they know not the way of the Lord the judgment (the just and righteous law) of their God.
Jeremiah,5,5,I will go to the great men and will speak to them for they must know the way of the Lord the judgment (the just and righteous law) of their God. But [I found the very reverse to be true] these had all alike broken the yoke [of God's law] and had burst the bonds [of obedience to Him].
Jeremiah,5,6,Therefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them a wolf of the desert shall destroy them a leopard or panther shall lie in wait against their cities. Everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces because their transgressions are many their backslidings and total desertion of faith are increased and have become great and mighty.
Jeremiah,5,7,Why should I and how can I pass over this and forgive you for it? Your children have forsaken Me and sworn by those that are no gods. When I had fed them to the full and bound them to Me by oath they committed [spiritual] adultery assembling themselves in troops at the houses of [idol] harlots.
Jeremiah,5,8,They were like fed stallions roaming at large; each one neighed after his neighbor's wife.
Jeremiah,5,9,Shall I not punish them for these things? says the Lord; and shall I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?
Jeremiah,5,10,Go up within [Jerusalem's] walls and destroy [her vines] but do not make a full and complete end. Trim away the tendrils [of her vines] for they are not the Lord's.
Jeremiah,5,11,For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very faithlessly and treacherously against Me says the Lord.
Jeremiah,5,12,They have lied about and denied the Lord by saying It is not He [Who speaks through His prophets]! Evil shall not come upon us; nor shall we see war or famine.
Jeremiah,5,13,And [say they] the prophets will become wind [what they prophesy will not come to pass] and the word [of God] is not in them. Thus shall it be done to them [as they threatened would be done to us].
Jeremiah,5,14,Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts: Because you [the people] have spoken this word behold I will make My words fire in your mouth [Jeremiah] and this people wood and it will devour them.
Jeremiah,5,15,Behold I am bringing a nation upon you from afar O house of Israel says the Lord. It is a mighty and enduring nation it is an ancient nation a nation whose language you do not know nor can you understand what they say.
Jeremiah,5,16,Their quiver is [filled with deadly missiles] like an open sepulcher [filled with dead bodies; the foes] are all mighty men (heroes).
Jeremiah,5,17,They shall consume your harvest and your food; they shall consume your sons and your daughters; they shall consume your flocks and your herds; they shall consume your vines and your fig trees. They shall break down and impoverish your fortified cities in which you trust with the sword [they shall destroy them].
Jeremiah,5,18,But even in those days says the Lord I will not make a full and complete end of you.
Jeremiah,5,19,And when your people say Why has the Lord our God done all these things to us? then you shall answer them As you have forsaken Me says the Lord and have served strange gods in your land so shall you serve strangers (gods) in a land that is not yours.
Jeremiah,5,20,Declare this in the house of Jacob and publish it in Judah:
Jeremiah,5,21,Hear now this O foolish people without understanding or heart who have eyes and see not who have ears and hear not:
Jeremiah,5,22,Do you not fear and reverence Me? says the Lord. Do you not tremble before Me? I placed the sand for the boundary of the sea a perpetual barrier beyond which it cannot pass and by an everlasting ordinance beyond which it cannot go? And though the waves of the sea toss and shake themselves yet they cannot prevail [against the feeble grains of sand which God has ordained by nature to be sufficient for His purpose]; though [the billows] roar yet they cannot pass over that [barrier]. [Is not such a God to be reverently feared and worshiped?]
Jeremiah,5,23,But these people have hearts that draw back from God and wills that rebel against Him; they have revolted and quit His service and have gone away [into idolatry].
Jeremiah,5,24,Nor do they say in their hearts Let us now reverently fear and worship the Lord our God Who gives rain both the autumn and the spring rain in its season Who reserves and keeps for us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
Jeremiah,5,25,Your iniquities have turned these blessings away and your sins have kept good [harvests] from you.
Jeremiah,5,26,For among My people are found wicked men; they watch like fowlers who lie in wait; they set a trap they catch men.
Jeremiah,5,27,As a cage is full of birds so are their houses full of deceit and treachery; therefore they have become great and grown rich
Jeremiah,5,28,They have grown fat and sleek. Yes they surpass in deeds of wickedness; they do not judge and plead with justice the cause of the fatherless that they may prosper and they do not defend the rights of the needy.
Jeremiah,5,29,Shall I not punish them for these things? says the Lord. Shall I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?
Jeremiah,5,30,An appalling and horrible thing [bringing desolation and destruction] has come to pass in the land:
Jeremiah,5,31,The prophets prophesy falsely and the priests exercise rule at their own hands and by means of the prophets. And My people love to have it so! But what will you do when the end comes?
Jeremiah,6,1,FLEE FOR safety you children of Benjamin out of the midst of Jerusalem! And blow the trumpet in Tekoa [a town far south in Judah] and raise a [fire] signal over Beth-haccherem [a town near Jerusalem]! For evil is looking forth with eagerness from the north and great destruction.
Jeremiah,6,2,The comely and delicate one [Jerusalem] the Daughter of Zion I will destroy. [To a pasturage yes a luxurious pasturage have I likened her.]
Jeremiah,6,3,Shepherds with their flocks shall come against her; they shall pitch their tents round about her; they shall pasture each one in his place [eating up all her luxurious herbage on every side].
Jeremiah,6,4,Prepare yourselves for war against her [they cry]; up let us attack her at noon! But alas the day declines the evening shadows lengthen.
Jeremiah,6,5,Arise let us go by night and destroy her palaces!
Jeremiah,6,6,For the Lord of hosts has said Hew down her trees and cast up a siege mound against Jerusalem. This is the city which must be punished; there is nothing but oppression within her.
Jeremiah,6,7,As a fountain wells up and casts forth its waters and keeps them fresh so she is [continually] casting forth [fresh] wickedness. Violence and destruction are heard within her; sickness and wounds are continually before Me.
Jeremiah,6,8,Be corrected reformed instructed and warned O Jerusalem lest I be alienated and parted from you lest I make you a desolation an uninhabited land.
Jeremiah,6,9,Thus says the Lord of hosts: They shall thoroughly glean as a vine what is left of Israel; turn back your hand again and again [O minister of destruction] into the baskets like a grape gatherer and strip the tendrils [of the vine].
Jeremiah,6,10,To whom shall I [Jeremiah] speak and give warning that they may hear? Behold their ears are uncircumcised [never brought into covenant with God or consecrated to His service] and they cannot hear or obey. Behold the word of the Lord has become to them a reproach and the object of their scorn; they have no delight in it.
Jeremiah,6,11,Therefore I am full of the wrath of the Lord; I am weary of restraining it. I will pour it out on the children in the street and on the gathering of young men together; for even the husband with the wife will be taken the aged with the very old.
Jeremiah,6,12,And their houses will be turned over to others their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out My hand against the inhabitants of the land says the Lord.
Jeremiah,6,13,For from the least of them even to the greatest of them everyone is given to covetousness (to greed for unjust gain); and from the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.
Jeremiah,6,14,They have healed also the wound of the daughter of My people lightly and neglectfully saying Peace peace when there is no peace.
Jeremiah,6,15,Were they brought to shame because they had committed abominations (extremely disgusting and vile things)? No they were not at all ashamed nor could they blush [at their idolatry]. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I punish them they shall be overthrown says the Lord.
Jeremiah,6,16,Thus says the Lord: Stand by the roads and look; and ask for the eternal paths where the good old way is; then walk in it and you will find rest for your souls. But they said We will not walk in it!
Jeremiah,6,17,Also I set watchmen over you saying Hear and obey the sound of the trumpet! But they said We will not listen or obey.
Jeremiah,6,18,Therefore hear O [Gentile] nations and know O congregation [of believing ones] what [great things I will do] to them.
Jeremiah,6,19,Hear O earth: behold I am bringing evil upon this people the fruit of their thoughts (their schemes and devices) because they have not listened and obeyed My words and as for My law they have rejected it.
Jeremiah,6,20,To what purpose does frankincense come to Me from Sheba [in southwestern Arabia] and the sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable nor are your sacrifices sweet or pleasing to Me.
Jeremiah,6,21,Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold I will lay stumbling blocks before this people. And the fathers and the sons together will stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend will perish.
Jeremiah,6,22,Thus says the Lord: Behold a people is coming from the north country and a great nation is arousing itself from the ends of the earth.
Jeremiah,6,23,They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel (ruthless and inhuman) and have no mercy. Their voice sounds like the roaring sea; they ride on horses every one set in array as a man for battle against you O Daughter of Zion!
Jeremiah,6,24,We have heard the report of it; our hands become feeble and helpless. Anguish has taken hold of us pangs like that of a woman in childbirth.
Jeremiah,6,25,Go not out into the field nor walk on the road for the enemy is armed with the sword; terror is on every side.
Jeremiah,6,26,O daughter of my people [says Jeremiah] gird yourself with sackcloth and wallow in ashes; make mourning as for an only son a most bitter lamentation for the destroyer will suddenly come upon us [on prophet and people].
Jeremiah,6,27,I [says the Lord] have set you [Jeremiah] as an assayer and a prover of ore among My people that you may know and try their doings and be like a watchtower.
Jeremiah,6,28,They are all the worst [kind] of rebels and utter and total revolters against God going about publishing slander. They are [not gold and silver ore but] bronze and iron; they are all corrupters.
Jeremiah,6,29,The bellows blow fiercely the lead is consumed by the fire; in vain do they continue refining for the wicked [the dross] are not removed.
Jeremiah,6,30,Men will call them reprobate and rejected silver [only dross without good metal] because the Lord has rejected them.
Jeremiah,7,1,THE WORD that came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying
Jeremiah,7,2,Stand in the gate of the Lord's house and proclaim there this word and say Hear the word of the Lord all you of Judah who enter in at these gates to worship the Lord.
Jeremiah,7,3,Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your doings and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
Jeremiah,7,4,Trust not in the lying words [of the false prophets who maintain that God will protect Jerusalem because His temple is there] saying This is the temple of the Lord the temple of the Lord the temple of the Lord.
Jeremiah,7,5,For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings if you thoroughly and truly execute justice between every man and his neighbor
Jeremiah,7,6,If you do not oppress the transient and the alien the fatherless and the widow or shed innocent blood [by oppression and by judicial murders] in [Jerusalem] or go after other gods to your own hurt
Jeremiah,7,7,Then I will cause you to dwell in this place in the land that I gave of old to your fathers to dwell in forever.
Jeremiah,7,8,Behold you trust in lying words that cannot benefit [so that you do not profit].
Jeremiah,7,9,Will you steal murder commit adultery swear falsely burn incense to Baal and go after other gods that you have not known
Jeremiah,7,10,And [then dare to] come and stand before Me in this house which is called by My Name and say [By the discharge of this religious formality] we are set free!--only to go on with this wickedness and these abominations?
Jeremiah,7,11,Has this house which is called by My Name become a den of robbers in your eyes [a place of retreat for you between acts of violence]? Behold I Myself have seen it says the Lord.
Jeremiah,7,12,But go now to My place which was in Shiloh [in Ephraim] where I set My Name at the first and see what I did to it for the wickedness of My people Israel.
Jeremiah,7,13,And now because you have done all these things says the Lord and [because] when I spoke to you persistently [even rising up early and speaking] you did not listen and when I called you you did not answer
Jeremiah,7,14,Therefore will I do to this house (the temple) which is called by My Name and in which you trust to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers as I did to Shiloh.
Jeremiah,7,15,And I will cast you out of My sight as I have cast out all your brethren even the whole posterity of Ephraim.
Jeremiah,7,16,Therefore do not pray for this people [of Judah] or lift up a cry or entreaty for them or make intercession to Me for I will not listen to or hear you.
Jeremiah,7,17,Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
Jeremiah,7,18,The children gather wood the fathers kindle the fire and the women knead the dough to make cakes for the queen of heaven; and they pour out drink offerings to other gods that they may provoke Me to anger!
Jeremiah,7,19,Am I the One Whom they provoke to anger? says the Lord. Is it not themselves [whom they provoke] to their own confusion and vexation and to their own shame?
Jeremiah,7,20,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold My anger and My wrath will be poured out on this place on man and beast on the trees of the field and the fruit of the ground; it will burn and not be quenched.
Jeremiah,7,21,Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat the flesh [if you will. It will avail you nothing].
Jeremiah,7,22,For in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices.
Jeremiah,7,23,But this thing I did command them: Listen to and obey My voice and I will be your God and you will be My people; and walk in the whole way that I command you that it may be well with you.
Jeremiah,7,24,But they would not listen to and obey Me or bend their ear [to Me] but followed the counsels and the stubborn promptings of their own evil hearts and minds and they turned their backs and went in reverse instead of forward.
Jeremiah,7,25,Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day I have persistently sent to you all My servants the prophets sending them daily early and late.
Jeremiah,7,26,Yet the people would not listen to and obey Me or bend their ears [to Me] but stiffened their necks and behaved worse than their fathers.
Jeremiah,7,27,Speak all these words to them but they will not listen to and obey you; also call to them but they will not answer you.
Jeremiah,7,28,Yet you shall say to them This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the Lord their God or receive instruction and correction and warning; truth and faithfulness have perished and have completely vanished from their mouths.
Jeremiah,7,29,Cut off your hair [your crown O Jerusalem] and cast it away and take up a lamentation on the bare heights for the Lord has rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.
Jeremiah,7,30,For the children of Judah have done evil in My sight says the Lord; they have set their abominations (extremely disgusting and shamefully vile things) in the house which is called by My Name to defile it.
Jeremiah,7,31,And they have built the high places of Topheth which is in the Valley of Ben-hinnom [son of Hinnom] to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire [in honor of Molech the fire god]--which I did not command nor did it come into My mind or heart.
Jeremiah,7,32,Therefore behold the days are coming says the Lord when it shall no more be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben-hinnom [son of Hinnom] but the Valley of Slaughter for [in bloody warfare] they will bury in Topheth till there is no more room and no place else to bury.
Jeremiah,7,33,And the dead bodies of this people will be meat for the fowls of the air and for the beasts of the earth and none will frighten them away.
Jeremiah,7,34,Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a waste.
Jeremiah,8,1,AT THAT time says the Lord [the Babylonian army will break open the sepulchers and] they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah the bones of its princes the bones of the priests the bones of the prophets and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem from their graves.
Jeremiah,8,2,And they will [carelessly] scatter [the corpses] before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven which [the dead] have loved and which they have served and after which they have walked and which they have sought inquired of and required and which they have worshiped. They shall not be gathered or be buried; they shall be like dung upon the face of the earth.
Jeremiah,8,3,And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of those who remain of this evil family (nation) who remain in all the places to which I have driven them says the Lord of hosts.
Jeremiah,8,4,Moreover you [Jeremiah] shall say to them Thus says the Lord: Shall men fall and not rise up again? Shall one turn away [from God] and not repent and return [to Him]?
Jeremiah,8,5,Why then is this people of Jerusalem turned away with a perpetual turning away [from Me]? They hold fast to deceit (idolatry); they refuse to repent and return [to God].
Jeremiah,8,6,I have listened and heard but they have not spoken aright; no man repents of his wickedness saying What have I done? Everyone turns to his [individual] course as the horse rushes like a torrent into battle.
Jeremiah,8,7,[Even the migratory birds are punctual to their seasons.] Yes the stork [excelling in the great height of her flight] in the heavens knows her appointed times [of migration] and the turtledove the swallow and the crane observe the time of their return. But My people do not know the law of the Lord [which the lower animals instinctively recognize in so far as it applies to them].
Jeremiah,8,8,How can you say We are wise and we have the written law of the Lord [and are learned in its language and teachings]? Behold the truth is the lying pen of the scribes has made of the law a falsehood (a mere code of ceremonial observances).
Jeremiah,8,9,The wise men shall be put to shame; they shall be dismayed and taken [captive]. Behold they have rejected the word of the Lord and what wisdom and broad full intelligence is in them?
Jeremiah,8,10,Therefore will I give their wives to others and their fields to those who gain possession of them; for everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness (is greedy for unjust gain); from the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.
Jeremiah,8,11,For they have healed the wound of the daughter of My people only lightly and slightingly saying Peace peace when there is no peace.
Jeremiah,8,12,They are brought to shame because they have committed abominations (extremely disgusting and shamefully vile things). And yet they were not at all ashamed nor could they blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time of their punishment they shall be overthrown says the Lord.
Jeremiah,8,13,I will gather and sweep them away utterly consuming them says the Lord. [I will find] no grapes on the vine nor figs on the fig tree and even the leaf is withered; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them [for I have appointed to them those who shall pass over them].
Jeremiah,8,14,[Then say the people to each other] Why do we sit still? Assemble yourselves and let us enter into the fortified cities and be silent or perish there! For the Lord our God has decreed our ruin and given us bitter and poisonous water to drink because we have sinned against the Lord.
Jeremiah,8,15,We looked for peace and completeness but no good came and for a time of healing but behold dismay trouble and terror!
Jeremiah,8,16,The snorting of [Nebuchadnezzar's] horses is heard from Dan [on the northern border of Palestine]. At the sound of the neighing of his strong war-horses the whole land quakes; for they come and devour the land and all that is in it the city and those who dwell in it.
Jeremiah,8,17,For behold I am sending among you serpents adders which cannot be charmed and they shall bite you says the Lord.
Jeremiah,8,18,Oh that I [Jeremiah] could comfort myself against sorrow [for my grief is beyond healing] my heart is sick and faint within me!
Jeremiah,8,19,Behold [says the prophet listen to the voice of] the cry of the daughter of my people [for help] because of those who dwell in a far country: Is not the Lord in Zion? Is not her King in her? [But the Lord answers] Why have they provoked Me to anger with their carved images and with foreign idols?
Jeremiah,8,20,The harvest is past the summer has ended and the gathering of fruit is over yet we are not saved! [comes again the voice of the people.]
Jeremiah,8,21,For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I [Jeremiah] hurt; I go around mourning; dismay has taken hold on me.
Jeremiah,8,22,Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people restored? [Because Zion no longer enjoyed the presence of the Great Physician!]
Jeremiah,9,1,OH THAT my head were waters and my eyes a reservoir of tears that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
Jeremiah,9,2,Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place (a mere shelter) for wayfaring men that I might leave my people and go away from them! For they are all adulterers [rendering worship to idols instead of to the Lord Who has espoused the people to Himself]; they are a gang of treacherous men [faithless even to each other].
Jeremiah,9,3,And they bend their tongue [which is] their bow for the lies [they shoot]. And not according to faithfulness do they rule and become strong in the land; for they proceed from evil to evil and they do not know and understand and acknowledge Me says the Lord.
Jeremiah,9,4,Let everyone beware of his neighbor and put no trust in any brother. For every brother is an utter and complete supplanter (one who takes by the heel and trips up a deceiver a Jacob) and every neighbor goes about as a slanderer.
Jeremiah,9,5,And they deceive and mock every one his neighbor and do not speak the truth. They have taught their tongues to speak lies; they weary themselves committing iniquity.
Jeremiah,9,6,Your habitation is in the midst of deceit [oppression upon oppression and deceit upon deceit]; through deceit they refuse to know and understand Me says the Lord.
Jeremiah,9,7,Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold I will melt them [by the process of affliction to remove the dross] and test them for how else should I deal with the daughter of My people?
Jeremiah,9,8,Their tongue is a murderous arrow; it speaks deceitfully; one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth but in his heart he lays snares and waits in ambush for him.
Jeremiah,9,9,Shall I not punish them for these things? says the Lord. Shall I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?
Jeremiah,9,10,For the mountains I will take up a weeping and wailing and for the pastures of the wilderness a lament because they are burned up and desolated so that no one passes through [them]; neither can men hear [any longer] the lowing of cattle. Both the fowls of the air and the beasts have fled they are gone!
Jeremiah,9,11,I will make Jerusalem heaps [of ruins] a dwelling place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.
Jeremiah,9,12,Who is the wise man who may understand this? To whom has the mouth of the Lord spoken that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined and laid waste like a wilderness so that no one passes through it?
Jeremiah,9,13,And the Lord says Because they have forsaken My law which I set before them and have not listened to and obeyed My voice or walked in accordance with it
Jeremiah,9,14,But have walked stubbornly after their own hearts and after the Baals as their fathers taught them
Jeremiah,9,15,Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will feed them even this people with wormwood and give them bitter and poisonous water to drink.
Jeremiah,9,16,I will scatter them also among nations that neither they nor their fathers have known and I will send the sword among them and after them until I have consumed them.
Jeremiah,9,17,Thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider and call for the mourning women to come; send for the skillful women to come.
Jeremiah,9,18,Let them make haste and raise a wailing over us and for us that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush with water.
Jeremiah,9,19,For a sound of wailing is heard [coming] out of Zion: How we are plundered and ruined! We are greatly confounded and utterly put to shame because we have forsaken the land because they have cast down our dwellings [our dwellings that have cast us out].
Jeremiah,9,20,Yet hear the word of the Lord O you women and let your ears receive the word of His mouth; teach your daughters a lament and each one [teach] her neighbor a dirge.
Jeremiah,9,21,For death has come up into our windows; it has entered into our palaces cutting off the children from outdoors and the young men from the streets.
Jeremiah,9,22,Speak Thus says the Lord: The dead bodies of men shall fall like dung on the open field and like sheaves [of grain] behind the reaper and none shall gather them.
Jeremiah,9,23,Thus says the Lord: Let not the wise and skillful person glory and boast in his wisdom and skill; let not the mighty and powerful person glory and boast in his strength and power; let not the person who is rich [in physical gratification and earthly wealth] glory and boast in his [temporal satisfactions and earthly] riches;
Jeremiah,9,24,But let him who glories glory in this: that he understands and knows Me [personally and practically directly discerning and recognizing My character] that I am the Lord Who practices loving-kindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for in these things I delight says the Lord.
Jeremiah,9,25,Behold the days are coming says the Lord when I will punish all who though circumcised [outwardly in the flesh] are still uncircumcised [in corresponding inward purity]--
Jeremiah,9,26,Egypt Judah Edom the children of Ammon Moab [all of whom are related except Egypt] and all who live in the desert and who clip off the corners of their hair and beards; for all these nations are uncircumcised [in heart] and all the house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.
Jeremiah,10,1,HEAR THE word which the Lord speaks to you O house of Israel.
Jeremiah,10,2,Thus says the Lord: Learn not the way of the [heathen] nations and be not dismayed at the signs of the heavens though they are dismayed at them
Jeremiah,10,3,For the customs and ordinances of the peoples are false empty and futile; it is but a tree which one cuts out of the forest [to make for himself a god] the work of the hands of the craftsman with the ax or other tool.
Jeremiah,10,4,They deck [the idol] with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers so it will not fall apart or move around.
Jeremiah,10,5,[Their idols] are like pillars of turned work [as upright and stationary and immobile as a palm tree] like scarecrows in a cucumber field; they cannot speak; they have to be carried for they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them for they cannot do evil neither is it possible for them to do good [and it is not in them].
Jeremiah,10,6,None at all is like You O Lord; You are great and Your name is great in might.
Jeremiah,10,7,Who would not fear You O King of the nations? For it is fitting to You and Your due! For among all the wise [men or gods] of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is none like You.
Jeremiah,10,8,But they are altogether irrational and stupid and foolish. Their instruction is given by idols who are but wood [it is a teaching of falsity emptiness futility]!
Jeremiah,10,9,Silver beaten [into plates] is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz the work of the craftsman and of the hands of the goldsmith; the [idols'] clothing is violet and purple--they are all the work of skillful men.
Jeremiah,10,10,But the Lord is the true God and the God of truth (the God Who is Truth). He is the living God and the everlasting King. At His wrath the earth quakes and the nations are not able to bear His indignation.
Jeremiah,10,11,Thus shall you say to them: The gods who did not make the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens.
Jeremiah,10,12,God made the earth by His power; He established the world by His wisdom and by His understanding and skill stretched out the heavens.
Jeremiah,10,13,When He utters His voice there is a tumult of waters in the heavens and He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings for the rain and brings forth the wind out from His treasuries and from His storehouses.
Jeremiah,10,14,Every man has become like a brute irrational and stupid without knowledge [of God]; every goldsmith is brought to shame by his graven idols; for his molten images are frauds and falsehood and there is no breath in them.
Jeremiah,10,15,They are devoid of worth usefulness or truth a work of delusion and mockery; in their time of trial and punishment they shall [helplessly] perish.
Jeremiah,10,16,The Portion of Jacob [the true God on Whom Israel has a claim] is not like these for He is the Fashioner and Maker of all things and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance--the Lord of hosts is His name.
Jeremiah,10,17,Gather up your bundle [of baggage] from the ground O you who dwell under siege.
Jeremiah,10,18,For thus says the Lord: Behold I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time and will bring distress on them that they may feel it and find it [to be as I have said and turn to Me].
Jeremiah,10,19,Woe is me because of my hurt! [says Jeremiah speaking for the nation.] My wound is grievous and incurable. But I said Surely this sickness and suffering and grief are mine and I must endure tolerate and bear them.
Jeremiah,10,20,My tent (home) is taken by force and plundered and all my [tent] cords are broken. My children have gone forth [as captives] from me and they are no more; there is no one to stretch forth my tent any more and to set up my [tent] curtains.
Jeremiah,10,21,For the shepherds [of the people] have become like brutes irrational and stupid and have not sought the Lord or inquired of Him or required Him [by necessity and by right of His word]. Therefore they have not dealt prudently and have not prospered and all their flocks are scattered.
Jeremiah,10,22,Hark the sound of a rumor! [The invading army] comes!--a great commotion out of the north country--to make the cities of Judah a desolation a dwelling place of jackals.
Jeremiah,10,23,O Lord [pleads Jeremiah in the name of the people] I know that [the determination of] the way of a man is not in himself; it is not in man [even in a strong man or in a man at his best] to direct his [own] steps.
Jeremiah,10,24,O Lord correct instruct and chastise me but with judgment and in just measure--not in Your anger lest You diminish me and bring me to nothing.
Jeremiah,10,25,Pour out Your wrath upon the nations that do not know or recognize You and upon the peoples that do not call upon Your name. For they have devoured Jacob yes devoured him and consumed him and made his habitation a desolate waste.
Jeremiah,11,1,THE WORD that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
Jeremiah,11,2,Hear the words of this covenant or solemn pledge and speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,11,3,Say to them Thus says the Lord the God of Israel: Cursed is the man who does not heed the words of this covenant or solemn pledge
Jeremiah,11,4,Which I commanded your fathers at the time that I brought them out of the land of Egypt from the iron furnace saying Listen to My voice and do according to all that I command you. So will you be My people and I will be your God
Jeremiah,11,5,That I may perform the oath which I swore to your fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey as it is this day. Then I answered Amen (so be it) O Lord.
Jeremiah,11,6,And the Lord said to me Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant or solemn pledge and do them.
Jeremiah,11,7,For I earnestly protested to and warned your fathers at the time that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt even to this day protesting to and warning them persistently saying Obey My voice.
Jeremiah,11,8,Yet they did not obey or incline their ear [to Me] but everyone walked in the stubbornness of his own evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all [the calamities threatened in] the words of this covenant or solemn pledge which I had commanded but they did not do.
Jeremiah,11,9,And the Lord said to me A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,11,10,They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers who refused to hear My words; they have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant or solemn pledge which I made with their fathers.
Jeremiah,11,11,Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold I am bringing evil and calamity upon them which they will not be able to escape; though they cry to Me I will not listen to them.
Jeremiah,11,12,Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they offer incense but they cannot save them at all in the time of their evil trouble.
Jeremiah,11,13,For [as many as] the number of your cities are your gods O Judah; and [as many as] the number of the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing even altars to burn incense to Baal.
Jeremiah,11,14,Therefore do not pray for this people or lift up a cry or prayer for them for I will not listen when they cry out to Me in the time of their evil trouble.
Jeremiah,11,15,What right has My beloved [to be] in My house when she has wrought lewdness and done treacherously many times? Can vows and the holy flesh [of your sacrifices] remove from you your wickedness and avert your calamity? Can you by these [escape your doom and] rejoice exultantly?
Jeremiah,11,16,The Lord [acknowledged you once to be worthy to be] called a green olive tree fair and of good fruit; but with the roar of a great tempest He will set fire to it and its branches will be consumed.
Jeremiah,11,17,For the Lord of hosts Who planted you has pronounced evil and calamity against you because of the evil which the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done against themselves in provoking Me to anger by offering incense to Baal.
Jeremiah,11,18,And the Lord gave me [Jeremiah] knowledge of it [their plot] and I knew it; then You [O Lord] showed me their doings.
Jeremiah,11,19,But I was like a tame lamb that is brought to the slaughter; I did not know that they had devised inventions and schemes against me saying Let us destroy the tree with its fruit; let us cut him off from the land of the living that his name may be no more remembered.
Jeremiah,11,20,But O Lord of hosts Who judges rightly and justly Who tests the heart and the mind let me see Your vengeance on them for to You I have revealed and committed my cause [rolling it upon You].
Jeremiah,11,21,Therefore thus says the Lord about the men of Anathoth [Jeremiah's hometown] who seek your life [Jeremiah] and say Prophesy not in the name of the Lord that you die not by our hands--
Jeremiah,11,22,Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold I will punish them. Their young men will die by the sword their sons and their daughters will die by famine;
Jeremiah,11,23,And there will be no remnant [of the conspirators] left for I will bring evil and calamity upon the men of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.
Jeremiah,12,1,UNCOMPROMISINGLY RIGHTEOUS and rigidly just are You O Lord when I complain against and contend with You. Yet let me plead and reason the case with You: Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why are all they at ease and thriving who deal very treacherously and deceitfully?
Jeremiah,12,2,You have planted them yes they have taken root; they grow yes they bring forth fruit. You are near in their mouths but far from their hearts.
Jeremiah,12,3,But You O Lord know and understand me and my devotion to You; You see me and try my heart toward You. [O Lord] pull [these rebellious ones] out like sheep for the slaughter and devote and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
Jeremiah,12,4,How long must the land mourn and the grass and herbs of the whole country wither? Through the wickedness of those who dwell in it the beasts and the birds are consumed and are swept away [by the drought] because men [mocked] me saying He shall not [live to] see our final end.
Jeremiah,12,5,[But the Lord rebukes Jeremiah's impatience saying] If you have raced with men on foot and they have tired you out then how can you compete with horses? And if [you take to flight] in a land of peace where you feel secure then what will you do [when you tread the tangled maze of jungle haunted by lions] in the swelling and flooding of the Jordan?
Jeremiah,12,6,For even your brethren and the house of your father--even they have dealt treacherously with you; yes even they are [like a pack of hounds] in full cry after you. Believe them not though they speak fair words and promise good things to you.
Jeremiah,12,7,I have forsaken My house I have cast off My heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of My life into the hands of her enemies.
Jeremiah,12,8,My heritage has become to Me like a lion in the forest; she has uttered her voice against Me; therefore I have [treated her as if I] hated her.
Jeremiah,12,9,Is My heritage to Me like a speckled bird of prey? Are the birds of prey against her round about? Go assemble all the wild beasts of the field; bring them to devour.
Jeremiah,12,10,Many shepherds [of an invading host] have destroyed My vineyard they have trampled My portion underfoot; they have made My pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
Jeremiah,12,11,They have made it a desolation and desolate it mourns before Me; the whole land has been made desolate but no man lays it to heart.
Jeremiah,12,12,Destroyers have come upon all the bare heights in the desert for the sword of the Lord devours from one end of the land even to the other; no flesh has peace or can find the means to escape.
Jeremiah,12,13,They have sown wheat but have reaped thorns; they have worn themselves out but without profit. And they shall be ashamed of your [lack of] harvests and revenues because of the fierce and glowing anger of the Lord.
Jeremiah,12,14,Thus says the Lord against all My evil neighbor [nations] who touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit: Behold I will pluck them up from their land and I will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
Jeremiah,12,15,And after I have plucked them up I will return and have compassion on them and will bring them back again every man to his heritage and every man to his land.
Jeremiah,12,16,And if these [neighbor nations] will diligently learn the ways of My people to swear by My name saying As the Lord lives--even as they taught My people to swear by Baal--then will they be built up in the midst of My people.
Jeremiah,12,17,But if any nation will not hear and obey I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation says the Lord.
Jeremiah,13,1,THUS THE Lord said to me: Go and buy yourself a linen girdle and put it on your loins but do not put it in water.
Jeremiah,13,2,So I bought a girdle or waistcloth according to the word of the Lord and put it on my loins.
Jeremiah,13,3,And the word of the Lord came to me the second time saying
Jeremiah,13,4,Take the girdle which you have bought which is on your loins and arise go to the [river] Euphrates and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.
Jeremiah,13,5,So I went and hid it by the Euphrates as the Lord commanded me.
Jeremiah,13,6,And after many days the Lord said to me Arise go to the Euphrates and take from there the girdle which I commanded you to hide there.
Jeremiah,13,7,Then I went to the Euphrates and dug and took the girdle or waistcloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold the girdle was decayed and spoiled; it was good for nothing.
Jeremiah,13,8,Then the word of the Lord came to me saying
Jeremiah,13,9,Thus says the Lord: After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,13,10,These evil people who refuse to hear My words who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and have gone after other gods to serve them and to worship them shall even be like this girdle or waistcloth which is profitable for nothing.
Jeremiah,13,11,For as the girdle clings to the loins of a man so I caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to Me says the Lord that they might be for Me a people a name a praise and a glory; but they would not listen or obey.
Jeremiah,13,12,Therefore you shall speak to them this word: Thus says the Lord the God of Israel: Every bottle and jar should be filled with wine. [The people] will say to you Do we not certainly know that every bottle and jar should be filled with wine?
Jeremiah,13,13,Then say to them Thus says the Lord: Behold I will fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land even the kings who sit upon David's throne the priests the prophets and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,13,14,And I will dash them one against another even the fathers and the sons together says the Lord. I will not pity or spare or have compassion that I should not destroy them.
Jeremiah,13,15,Hear and give ear do not be proud for the Lord has spoken [says Jeremiah].
Jeremiah,13,16,Give glory to the Lord your God before He brings darkness and before your feet stumble upon the dark and twilit mountains and [before] while you are looking for light He turns it into the shadow of death and makes it thick darkness.
Jeremiah,13,17,But if you will not hear and obey I will weep in secret for your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears because the Lord's flock has been taken captive.
Jeremiah,13,18,Say to the king and the queen mother Humble yourselves and take a lowly seat for down from your head has come your beautiful crown (the crown of your glory).
Jeremiah,13,19,The cities of the South (the Negeb) have been shut up and there is no one to open them; all Judah has been carried away captive it has been wholly taken captive and into exile.
Jeremiah,13,20,Lift up your eyes and behold those [the eruption of a hostile army] who come from the north. Where is the flock that was given to you [to shepherd] your beautiful flock?
Jeremiah,13,21,What will you say [O Jerusalem] when He [the Lord] sets over you as head those [tyrannical foreign nations] whom you yourselves [at intervals] have taught to be lovers (allies) with you [instructing them even your friends to be head over you]? Will not pangs take hold of you like that of a woman in travail?
Jeremiah,13,22,And if you say in your heart Why have these things come upon me?--[the answer is] Because of the greatness of your iniquity has your long robe been pulled aside [showing you in the garb of a menial] and have you [barefooted and treated like a slave] suffered violence.
Jeremiah,13,23,Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also can you do good who are accustomed and taught [even trained] to do evil.
Jeremiah,13,24,Therefore I will scatter you like chaff driven away by the wind from the desert.
Jeremiah,13,25,This is your lot the portion measured to you from Me says the Lord because you have forgotten Me and trusted in falsehood [false gods and alliances with idolatrous nations].
Jeremiah,13,26,Therefore I Myself will [retaliate] throwing your skirts up over your face that your shame [of being clad like a slave] may be exposed.
Jeremiah,13,27,I have seen your detestable acts even your adulteries and your lustful neighings [after idols] and the lewdness of your harlotry on the hills in the field. Woe to you O Jerusalem! For how long a time yet will you not [meet My conditions and] be made clean?
Jeremiah,14,1,THE WORD of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:
Jeremiah,14,2,Judah mourns and her gates languish; [her people] sit in black [mourning garb] upon the ground and the cry of Jerusalem goes up.
Jeremiah,14,3,And their nobles send their little ones and their inferiors for water; they come to the cisterns and find no water. They return with empty vessels; they are put to shame and confounded and cover their heads.
Jeremiah,14,4,Because the ground is cracked and the tillers are dismayed since there has been no rain on the land the plowmen are put to shame and they cover their heads.
Jeremiah,14,5,Yes even the hind gives birth to her calf in the field and forsakes it because there is no grass or herbage.
Jeremiah,14,6,And the wild donkeys stand on the bare heights; they pant for air like jackals or crocodiles; their eyesight fails because there is no grass.
Jeremiah,14,7,O Lord though our iniquities testify against us [prays Jeremiah] deal and work with us for Your own name's sake [that the heathen may witness Your might and faithfulness]! For our backslidings are many; we have sinned against You.
Jeremiah,14,8,O Hope of Israel her Savior in time of trouble why should You be like a sojourner in the land and like a wayfaring man who turns aside and spreads his tent to tarry [only] for a night?
Jeremiah,14,9,Why should You be [hesitant and inactive] like a man stunned and confused like a mighty man who cannot save? Yet You O Lord are in the midst of us and we are called by Your name; do not leave us!
Jeremiah,14,10,[And the Lord replied to Jeremiah] Thus says the Lord to this people [Judah]: In the manner and to the degree already pointed out have they loved to wander; they have not restrained their feet. Therefore the Lord does not accept them; He will now [seriously] remember their iniquity and punish them for their sins.
Jeremiah,14,11,The Lord said to me Do not pray for this people for their good.
Jeremiah,14,12,Though they fast I will not hear their cry; and though they offer burnt offering and cereal offering [without heartfelt surrender to Me or by offering it too late] I will not accept them. But I will consume them by the sword by famine and by pestilence.
Jeremiah,14,13,Then said I Alas Lord God! Behold the [false] prophets say to them You will not see the sword nor will you have famine; but I [the Lord] will give you assured peace (peace that lasts the peace of truth) in this place.
Jeremiah,14,14,Then the Lord said to me The [false] prophets prophesy lies in My name. I sent them not neither have I commanded them nor have I spoken to them. They prophesy to you a false or pretended vision a worthless divination [conjuring or practicing magic trying to call forth the responses supposed to be given by idols] and the deceit of their own minds.
Jeremiah,14,15,Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the [false] prophets who prophesy in My name--although I did not send them--and who say Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
Jeremiah,14,16,And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem victims of famine and sword; and they shall have none to bury them--them their wives their sons and their daughters. For I will pour out their wickedness upon them [and not on their false teachers only for the people could not have been deceived except by their own consent].
Jeremiah,14,17,Therefore [Jeremiah] you shall say to them Let my eyes run down with tears night and day and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people has been smitten with a great wound with a very grievous blow.
Jeremiah,14,18,If I go out into the field then behold those slain with the sword! And if I enter the city then behold those tormented with the diseases of famine! For both prophet and priest go about not knowing what to do or as beggars [exiled] in a land that they know not and they have no knowledge.
Jeremiah,14,19,[O Lord] have You utterly rejected Judah? Do You loathe Zion? Why have You smitten us so that there is no healing for us? We looked for peace and completeness but no good came and for a time of healing but behold dismay disaster and terror!
Jeremiah,14,20,We know and acknowledge O Lord our wickedness and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against You.
Jeremiah,14,21,Do not abhor condemn and spurn us for Your name's sake; do not dishonor debase and lightly esteem Your glorious throne; [earnestly] remember break not Your covenant or solemn pledge with us.
Jeremiah,14,22,Are there any among the false gods of the nations who can cause rain? Or can the heavens [of their own will] give showers? Are You [alone] not He O Lord our God? Therefore we will wait [expectantly] for You for You have made all these things [the heavens and the rain].
Jeremiah,15,1,THEN THE Lord said to me Though Moses and Samuel stood [interceding for them] before Me yet My mind could not be turned with favor toward this people [Judah]. Send them out of My sight and let them go!
Jeremiah,15,2,And if they say to you Where shall we go? then tell them Thus says the Lord: Such as are [destined] for death to death; and such as are for the sword to the sword; and such as are for famine to famine; and such as are for captivity to captivity.
Jeremiah,15,3,And I will appoint over them four kinds [of destroyers] says the Lord: the sword to slay the dogs to tear and drag away and the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth to devour and to destroy.
Jeremiah,15,4,And I will cause them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth and to be made a horror to all nations because of Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah for [the horrible wickedness] which he did in Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,15,5,For who will have pity on you O Jerusalem? Or who will bemoan you? Or who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?
Jeremiah,15,6,You have rejected and forsaken Me says the Lord. You keep going in reverse. Therefore I will stretch out My hand against you and destroy you; I am weary of relenting [concerning your punishment].
Jeremiah,15,7,I will winnow them with a fan and a winnowing fork in the gates of the land; I will bereave them [of children] I will destroy My people; from their [evil] ways they did not return.
Jeremiah,15,8,I will increase the number of their widows more than the sand of the seas. I will bring upon them [both] against the mother of young men and the young men [themselves] a destroyer at noonday. I will cause anguish and terrors to fall upon her [Jerusalem] suddenly.
Jeremiah,15,9,She who has borne seven languishes; she has expired. Her sun has gone down while it was yet day; she has been put to shame confounded and disgraced. And the rest of them I will deliver to the sword before their enemies says the Lord.
Jeremiah,15,10,Woe is me my mother that you bore me to be a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither loaned nor have men loaned to me yet everyone curses me.
Jeremiah,15,11,The Lord said Truly your release affliction and strengthening will be for good [purposes]; surely [Jeremiah] I will intercede for you with the enemy and I will cause the enemy to ask for your aid in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
Jeremiah,15,12,Can iron break the iron from the north and the bronze?
Jeremiah,15,13,Your [nation's] substance and your treasures will I give as spoil without price and that for all your sins even in all your territory.
Jeremiah,15,14,And I will make [your possessions] to pass with your enemies into a land which you do not know and I will make you to serve [your conquerors] there for a fire is kindled in My anger which will burn upon you [Israel].
Jeremiah,15,15,[Jeremiah said] O Lord You know and understand; [earnestly] remember me and visit me and avenge me on my persecutors. Take me not away [from joy or from life itself] in Your long-suffering [to my enemies]; know that for Your sake I suffer and bear reproach.
Jeremiah,15,16,Your words were found and I ate them; and Your words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart for I am called by Your name O Lord God of hosts.
Jeremiah,15,17,I sat not in the assembly of those who make merry nor did I rejoice; I sat alone because Your [powerful] hand was upon me for You had filled me with indignation.
Jeremiah,15,18,Why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable refusing to be healed? Will you indeed be to me like a deceitful brook like waters that fail and are uncertain?
Jeremiah,15,19,Therefore thus says the Lord [to Jeremiah]: If you return [and give up this mistaken tone of distrust and despair] then I will give you again a settled place of quiet and safety and you will be My minister; and if you separate the precious from the vile [cleansing your own heart from unworthy and unwarranted suspicions concerning God's faithfulness] you shall be My mouthpiece. [But do not yield to them.] Let them return to you--not you to [the people].
Jeremiah,15,20,And I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall; they will fight against you but they will not prevail over you for I am with you to save and deliver you says the Lord.
Jeremiah,15,21,And I will deliver you out of the hands of the wicked and I will redeem you out of the palms of the terrible and ruthless tyrants.
Jeremiah,16,1,THE WORD of the Lord came also to me saying
Jeremiah,16,2,You shall not take a wife or have sons and daughters in this place [Jerusalem].
Jeremiah,16,3,For thus says the Lord concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place and concerning the mothers who bore them and the fathers who begot them in this land:
Jeremiah,16,4,They shall die of deadly diseases. They shall not be lamented nor shall they be buried but they shall be like dung upon the face of the ground. They shall perish and be consumed by the sword and by famine and their dead bodies shall be food for the fowls of the air and for the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah,16,5,For thus says the Lord: Enter not into the house of mourning nor go to lament or bemoan [the dead] for I have taken away My peace from this people says the Lord even My steadfast love and loving-kindness and tender mercy.
Jeremiah,16,6,Both the great and the small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried neither shall men lament for them or cut themselves or make themselves bald for them.
Jeremiah,16,7,Neither shall men prepare food for the mourners to comfort them for the dead; nor shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
Jeremiah,16,8,And you [Jeremiah] shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them to eat and drink.
Jeremiah,16,9,For thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will cause to cease from this place before your very eyes and in your days the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
Jeremiah,16,10,And when you tell these people all these words and they inquire of you Why has the Lord decreed all this enormous evil against us? Or What is our iniquity? Or What is the sin that we have committed against the Lord our God?
Jeremiah,16,11,Then you shall say to them [It is] because your fathers have forsaken Me says the Lord and have walked after other gods and have served and worshiped them and have forsaken Me and have not kept My law
Jeremiah,16,12,And because you have done worse than your fathers. For behold every one of you walks after the stubbornness of his own evil heart so that you do not listen to and obey Me.
Jeremiah,16,13,Therefore I will cast you out of this land [of Judah] into the land [of the Babylonians] neither you nor your fathers have known and there you will serve other gods day and night for I will show you no favor there.
Jeremiah,16,14,Therefore behold the days are coming says the Lord when it shall no more be said As the Lord lives Who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt
Jeremiah,16,15,But As the Lord lives Who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north and from all the countries to which He had driven them. And I will bring them again to their land which I gave to their fathers.
Jeremiah,16,16,Behold I will send for many fishers says the Lord and they will fish them out; and afterward I will send for many hunters and they will hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the clefts of the rocks.
Jeremiah,16,17,For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face neither is their iniquity concealed from My eyes.
Jeremiah,16,18,First [before I bring them back to their land] I will doubly recompense and punish them for their iniquity and their sin because they have polluted My land with the carcasses of their detestable idols and with the abominable things offered to false gods with which they have filled My inheritance.
Jeremiah,16,19,[Then said Jeremiah] O Lord my Strength and my Stronghold and my Refuge in the day of affliction to You shall the nations come from the ends of the earth and shall say Surely our fathers have inherited nothing but lies emptiness and futility worthless things in which there is no profit!
Jeremiah,16,20,Can a man make gods for himself? Such are not gods!
Jeremiah,16,21,Therefore [says the Lord] behold I will make them know--[yes] this once I will make them know My power and My might; and they will know and recognize that My name is the Lord.
Jeremiah,17,1,THE SIN of Judah is written with a pen or stylus of iron and with the point of a diamond; it is engraved on the tablets of their hearts and on the horns of their altars
Jeremiah,17,2,While their children [earnestly] remember their [heathen] altars and their Asherim [wooden symbols of the goddess Asherah] beside the green trees upon the high hills.
Jeremiah,17,3,O [Jerusalem] My mountain in the field I will give your wealth and all your treasures to the spoil and your high places for sin [as the price of your sin] throughout all your territory.
Jeremiah,17,4,And you through your own fault will loosen your hand and discontinue from your heritage which I gave you; and I will cause you to serve your enemies in a land which you do not know for you have kindled a fire in My anger which will burn throughout the ages.
Jeremiah,17,5,Thus says the Lord: Cursed [with great evil] is the strong man who trusts in and relies on frail man making weak [human] flesh his arm and whose mind and heart turn aside from the Lord.
Jeremiah,17,6,For he shall be like a shrub or a person naked and destitute in the desert; and he shall not see any good come but shall dwell in the parched places in the wilderness in an uninhabited salt land.
Jeremiah,17,7,[Most] blessed is the man who believes in trusts in and relies on the Lord and whose hope and confidence the Lord is.
Jeremiah,17,8,For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters that spreads out its roots by the river; and it shall not see and fear when heat comes; but its leaf shall be green. It shall not be anxious and full of care in the year of drought nor shall it cease yielding fruit.
Jeremiah,17,9,The heart is deceitful above all things and it is exceedingly perverse and corrupt and severely mortally sick! Who can know it [perceive understand be acquainted with his own heart and mind]?
Jeremiah,17,10,I the Lord search the mind I try the heart even to give to every man according to his ways according to the fruit of his doings.
Jeremiah,17,11,Like the partridge that gathers a brood which she did not hatch and sits on eggs which she has not laid so is he who gets riches by unjust means and not by right. He will leave them or they will leave him in the midst of his days and at his end he will be a fool.
Jeremiah,17,12,A glorious throne set on high from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary (the temple).
Jeremiah,17,13,O Lord the Hope of Israel all who forsake You shall be put to shame. They who depart from You and me [Your prophet] shall [disappear like] writing upon the ground because they have forsaken the Lord the Fountain of living waters.
Jeremiah,17,14,Heal me O Lord and I shall be healed; save me and I shall be saved for You are my praise.
Jeremiah,17,15,Behold they say to me Where is the word of the Lord [predicting the disaster that you said would befall us]? Let it come now!
Jeremiah,17,16,But as for me I have not sought to escape from being a shepherd after You nor have I desired the woeful day [of judgment]; You know that. Whatever I said was spoken in Your presence and was from You.
Jeremiah,17,17,Be not a terror to me; You are my refuge and my hope in the day of evil.
Jeremiah,17,18,Let those be put to shame who persecute me but let me not be put to shame; let them be dismayed but let me not be dismayed. Bring on them the day of evil and destroy them with double destruction.
Jeremiah,17,19,Thus said the Lord to me: Go and stand in the gate of the sons of the people through which the kings of Judah enter and through which they go out and also [stand] in all the gates of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,17,20,Say to them Hear the word of the Lord you kings of Judah and all Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem who enter through these gates.
Jeremiah,17,21,Thus says the Lord: Take heed to yourselves and for the sake of your lives bear no burden on the Sabbath day or bring it in through the gates of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,17,22,And do not carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day or do any work but keep the Sabbath day holy (set apart to the worship of God) as I commanded your fathers.
Jeremiah,17,23,Yet they would not listen and obey or incline their ears; but they stiffened their necks that they might not hear and might not receive instruction.
Jeremiah,17,24,But if you diligently listen to and obey Me says the Lord and bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day but keep the Sabbath day holy (set apart to the worship of God) to do no work on it
Jeremiah,17,25,Then there will enter through the gates of this city kings and princes who will sit upon the throne of David riding in chariots and on horses--the kings and their princes the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city will be inhabited and last throughout the ages.
Jeremiah,17,26,And people shall come from the cities of Judah and the places round about Jerusalem from the land of Benjamin from the lowland from the hill country and from the South (the Negeb) bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices cereal offerings and frankincense and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving to the house of the Lord.
Jeremiah,17,27,But if you will not listen to Me to keep the Sabbath day holy (set apart to the worship of God) and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem [with one] on the Sabbath day then I will kindle a fire in her gates and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem and it shall not be quenched.
Jeremiah,18,1,THE WORD which came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
Jeremiah,18,2,Arise and go down to the potter's house and there I will cause you to hear My words.
Jeremiah,18,3,Then I went down to the potter's house and behold he was working at the wheel.
Jeremiah,18,4,And the vessel that he was making from clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter; so he made it over reworking it into another vessel as it seemed good to the potter to make it.
Jeremiah,18,5,Then the word of the Lord came to me:
Jeremiah,18,6,O house of Israel can I not do with you as this potter does? says the Lord. Behold as the clay is in the potter's hand so are you in My hand O house of Israel.
Jeremiah,18,7,At one time I will suddenly speak concerning a nation or kingdom that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it;
Jeremiah,18,8,And if [the people of] that nation concerning which I have spoken turn from their evil I will relent and reverse My decision concerning the evil that I thought to do to them.
Jeremiah,18,9,At another time I will suddenly speak concerning a nation or kingdom that I will build up and plant it;
Jeremiah,18,10,And if they do evil in My sight obeying not My voice then I will regret and reverse My decision concerning the good with which I said I would benefit them.
Jeremiah,18,11,Now therefore say to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem Thus says the Lord: Behold I am shaping evil against you and devising a plan against you. Return now each one from his evil way; reform your [accustomed] ways and make your [individual] actions good and right.
Jeremiah,18,12,But they will say That is in vain! For we will walk after our own devices and we will each do as the stubbornness of his own evil heart dictates.
Jeremiah,18,13,Therefore thus says the Lord: Ask now among the nations: Who has heard such things? Virgin Israel has done a very vile and horrible thing.
Jeremiah,18,14,Will the snow of Mount Lebanon fail and vanish from its rocks [which tower above the land of Israel]? Will the cold rushing waters of strange lands [that dash down from afar] be dried up?
Jeremiah,18,15,Yet My people have forgotten Me; they burn incense to false gods they have been caused to stumble in their ways and in the ancient roads to walk in bypaths in a way not graded and built up [not on a highway]
Jeremiah,18,16,Making their land a desolation and a horror a thing to be hissed at perpetually; everyone who passes by shall be astounded and horrified and shake his head.
Jeremiah,18,17,I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them My back and not My face in the day of their calamity [says the Lord].
Jeremiah,18,18,Then [my enemies] said Come and let us devise schemes against Jeremiah; for the law [of Moses] shall not perish from the priest [as this false prophet Jeremiah predicts] nor will counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophet. Come let us smite him with the tongue [making a charge against him to the king] and let us not pay any attention to his words.
Jeremiah,18,19,Give heed to me Lord; listen to [what] my adversaries [are plotting to do to me--and intercede].
Jeremiah,18,20,Shall evil be recompensed for good? Yet they have dug a pit for my life. [Earnestly] remember that I stood before You to speak good for them to turn away Your anger from them.
Jeremiah,18,21,Therefore deliver up their children to the famine; give them over to the power of the sword. And let their wives become childless and widows; let their men meet death by pestilence their young men be slain by the sword in battle.
Jeremiah,18,22,Let a cry be heard from their houses when You suddenly bring a troop upon them for they have dug a pit to take me and have hidden snares for my feet.
Jeremiah,18,23,Yet Lord You know all their plotting against me to slay me. Forgive not their iniquity nor blot out their sin from Your sight. But let them be overthrown before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger.
Jeremiah,19,1,THUS SAYS the Lord: Go and get a potter's earthen bottle and take some of the old people and some of the elderly priests
Jeremiah,19,2,And go out to the Valley of Ben-hinnom [son of Hinnom] which is by the entrance of the Potsherd Gate; and proclaim there the words that I shall tell you
Jeremiah,19,3,And say Hear the word of the Lord O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I am going to bring such evil upon this place that the ears of whoever hears of it will tingle.
Jeremiah,19,4,Because the people have forsaken Me and have estranged and profaned this place [Jerusalem] by burning incense in it to other gods that neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah ever knew and because they have filled this place with the blood of innocents
Jeremiah,19,5,And have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal which I commanded not nor spoke of it nor did it come into My mind and heart--
Jeremiah,19,6,Therefore behold the days are coming says the Lord when this place shall no more be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben-hinnom [son of Hinnom] but the Valley of Slaughter.
Jeremiah,19,7,And I will pour out and make void the counsel and the plans of [the men of] Judah and Jerusalem in this place and I will cause their people to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of those who seek their lives and their dead bodies I will give to be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah,19,8,And I will make this city an astonishment and a horror and a hissing; everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss [in scorn] because of all its plagues and disasters.
Jeremiah,19,9,And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters and they shall eat each one the flesh of his neighbor and friend in the siege and in the distress with which their enemies and those who seek their lives distress them.
Jeremiah,19,10,Then you shall break the bottle in the sight of the men who accompany you
Jeremiah,19,11,And say to them Thus said the Lord of hosts: Even so will I break this people and this city as one breaks a potter's vessel so that it cannot be mended. Men will bury in Topheth because there will be no other place for burial and until there is no more room to bury.
Jeremiah,19,12,Thus will I do to this place says the Lord and to its inhabitants; and I will even make this city like Topheth.
Jeremiah,19,13,And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah which are defiled shall be like the place of Topheth--even all the houses upon whose roofs incense has been burned to all the host of the heavens and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods.
Jeremiah,19,14,Then came Jeremiah from Topheth where the Lord had sent him to prophesy and he stood in the court of the Lord's house and said to all the people
Jeremiah,19,15,Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will bring upon this city and upon all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it because they have stiffened their necks refusing to hear My words.
Jeremiah,20,1,NOW PASHHUR son of Immer the priest who was [also] chief officer in the house of the Lord heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
Jeremiah,20,2,Then Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate by the house of the Lord.
Jeremiah,20,3,And the next day Pashhur brought Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him The Lord does not call your name Pashhur but Magor-missabib [terror on every side].
Jeremiah,20,4,For thus says the Lord: Behold I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; they will fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon; he will carry them captive to Babylon and will slay them with the sword.
Jeremiah,20,5,Moreover I will deliver all the riches of this city--all the results of its labors all its precious things and all the treasures of the kings of Judah--into the hand of their enemies who will make them a prey and plunder them and seize them and carry them to Babylon.
Jeremiah,20,6,And you Pashhur and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity; you shall go to Babylon and there you shall die and be buried you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied falsely.
Jeremiah,20,7,[But Jeremiah said] O Lord You have persuaded and deceived me and I was persuaded and deceived; You are stronger than I am and You have prevailed. I am a laughingstock all the day; everyone mocks me.
Jeremiah,20,8,For whenever I speak I must cry out and complain; I shout Violence and destruction! For the word of the Lord has become to me a reproach and a derision and has brought me insult all day long.
Jeremiah,20,9,If I say I will not make mention of [the Lord] or speak any more in His name in my mind and heart it is as if there were a burning fire shut up in my bones. And I am weary of enduring and holding it in; I cannot [contain it any longer].
Jeremiah,20,10,For I have heard many whispering and defaming [There is] terror on every side! Denounce him! Let us denounce him! Say all my familiar friends they who watch for my fall Perhaps he will be persuaded and deceived; then we will prevail against him and we will get our revenge on him.
Jeremiah,20,11,But the Lord is with me as a mighty and terrible One; therefore my persecutors will stumble and they will not overcome [me]. They will be utterly put to shame for they will not deal wisely or prosper [in their schemes]; their eternal dishonor will never be forgotten.
Jeremiah,20,12,But O Lord of hosts You Who try the righteous Who see the heart and the mind let me see Your vengeance on them for to You have I revealed and committed my cause.
Jeremiah,20,13,Sing to the Lord! Praise the Lord! For He has delivered the life of the poor and needy from the hands of evildoers.
Jeremiah,20,14,Cursed be the day on which I was born! Let not the day on which my mother bore me be blessed!
Jeremiah,20,15,Cursed be the man who brought the tidings to my father saying A son is born to you!--making him very glad.
Jeremiah,20,16,And let that man be like the cities which the Lord overthrew and did not relent. Let him hear the [war] cry in the morning and the shouting of alarm at noon
Jeremiah,20,17,Because he did not slay me in the womb so that my mother might have been my grave and her womb always great.
Jeremiah,20,18,Why did I come out of the womb to see labor and sorrow that my days should be consumed in shame?
Jeremiah,21,1,THE WORD which came to Jeremiah from the Lord when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malchiah and Zephaniah the priest the son of Maaseiah saying
Jeremiah,21,2,Inquire I pray you of the Lord for us for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon is making war against us. Perhaps the Lord will deal with us according to all His wonderful works forcing him to withdraw from us.
Jeremiah,21,3,Then said Jeremiah to them Say this to Zedekiah:
Jeremiah,21,4,Thus says the Lord the God of Israel: Behold I will turn back and dull the edge of the weapons of war that are in your hands with which you fight against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the walls; and I will bring them into the midst of this city [Jerusalem].
Jeremiah,21,5,And I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm in anger in fury and in great indignation and wrath.
Jeremiah,21,6,And I will smite the inhabitants of this city both man and beast; they will die of a great pestilence.
Jeremiah,21,7,And afterward says the Lord I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people in this city who survive the pestilence the sword and the famine into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hands of their enemies into the hands of those who seek their lives. And he will smite them with the edge of the sword; he will not spare them nor have pity or mercy and compassion upon them.
Jeremiah,21,8,And to this people you [Jeremiah] shall say Thus says the Lord: Behold I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
Jeremiah,21,9,He who remains in this city [Jerusalem] shall die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence. But he who goes out and passes over to the Chaldeans who besiege you he shall live and his life shall be to him his only booty [as a prize of war].
Jeremiah,21,10,For I have set My face against this city for evil and not for good says the Lord. It shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall burn it with fire.
Jeremiah,21,11,And concerning the royal house of the king of Judah hear the word of the Lord:
Jeremiah,21,12,O house of David thus says the Lord: Execute justice in the morning and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed lest My wrath go forth like fire and burn so that none can quench it--because of the evil of your doings.
Jeremiah,21,13,Behold I am against you O inhabitant of the valley O rock of the plain says the Lord--you who say Who shall come down against us? Or Who shall enter into our dwelling places?
Jeremiah,21,14,And I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings says the Lord. I will kindle a fire in your forest and it will devour all that is round about you.
Jeremiah,22,1,THUS SAYS the Lord: Go down to the house of the king of Judah and speak there this word:
Jeremiah,22,2,Hear the word of the Lord O king of Judah you who sit upon the throne of David--you and your servants and your people who enter by these gates.
Jeremiah,22,3,Thus says the Lord: Execute justice and righteousness and deliver out of the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed. And do no wrong; do no violence to the stranger or temporary resident the fatherless or the widow nor shed innocent blood in this place.
Jeremiah,22,4,For if you will indeed obey this word then will there enter in through the gates of this [the king's] house kings sitting [for David] upon David's throne riding in chariots and on horses--they and their servants and their people.
Jeremiah,22,5,But if you will not hear these words I swear by Myself says the Lord that this house will become a desolation.
Jeremiah,22,6,For thus says the Lord concerning the house of the king of Judah: [If you will not listen to Me though] you are [as valuable] to Me as [the fat pastures of] Gilead [east of the Jordan] or as the [plentiful] summit of Lebanon [west of the Jordan] yet surely I will make you a wilderness and uninhabited cities.
Jeremiah,22,7,And I will prepare solemnly set apart and appoint [to execute My judgments against you] destroyers each with his weapons and they will cut down your [palaces built of] choicest cedars and cast them into the fire.
Jeremiah,22,8,And many nations will pass by this city and every man will say to his neighbor Why has the Lord done this to this great city?
Jeremiah,22,9,Then they will answer Because [the people] forsook the covenant or solemn pledge with the Lord their God and worshiped other gods and served them.
Jeremiah,22,10,Weep not for him who is dead nor bemoan him; but weep bitterly for him who goes away [into captivity] for he shall return no more nor see his native country [again].
Jeremiah,22,11,For thus says the Lord concerning Shallum son of Josiah king of Judah who reigned instead of Josiah his father and who went forth out of this place: [Shallum] shall not return here any more;
Jeremiah,22,12,But he shall die in the place where they have led him captive and he shall see this land no more.
Jeremiah,22,13,Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness and his [upper] chambers by injustice who uses his neighbor's service without wages and does not give him his pay [for his work]
Jeremiah,22,14,Who says I will build myself a wide house with large rooms and he cuts himself out windows and it is ceiled or paneled with cedar and painted with vermilion.
Jeremiah,22,15,Do you think that being a king [merely] means [self-indulgent] vying [with Solomon] and striving to excel in cedar [palaces]? Did not your father [Josiah] as he ate and drank do justice and righteousness [being upright and in right standing with God]? Then it was well with him.
Jeremiah,22,16,He judged and defended the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Was not [all] this [what it means] to know and recognize Me? says the Lord.
Jeremiah,22,17,But your eyes and your heart are only for your covetousness and dishonest gain for shedding innocent blood for oppression and doing violence.
Jeremiah,22,18,Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: [Relatives] shall not lament for him saying Ah my brother! or Ah sister [how great our loss! Subjects] shall not lament for him saying Ah lord! or Ah his majesty! or Ah [how great was] his glory!
Jeremiah,22,19,[No] he shall be buried with the burial of a donkey--dragged out and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,22,20,Go up [north] to Lebanon and cry out and raise your voice in [the hills] of Bashan [across the Jordan] and cry out from Abarim [a range of mountains southeast of Palestine] for all your lovers (the king's chosen allies) are destroyed.
Jeremiah,22,21,I spoke to you in your [times of] prosperity but you said I will not listen! This has been your attitude from your youth; you have not obeyed My voice.
Jeremiah,22,22,The wind [of adversity] shall pasture upon and consume all your shepherds (your princes and statesmen) and your lovers (allies) shall go into captivity. Surely then shall you be ashamed and confounded and dismayed because of all your wickedness.
Jeremiah,22,23,O inhabitant of Lebanon [Jerusalem whose palaces are made of Lebanon's trees] you who make your nest among the cedars how you will groan and how pitiable you will be when pangs come upon you pain like that of a woman in childbirth!
Jeremiah,22,24,As I live says the Lord though Coniah [also called Jeconiah and Jehoiachin] son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet [ring] upon My right hand yet would I tear you off.
Jeremiah,22,25,And I will give you into the hands of those who seek your life and into the hand of those of whom you are afraid even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hands of the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah,22,26,And I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country where you were not born and there you will die.
Jeremiah,22,27,But to the land to which they will yearn to return there they will not return.
Jeremiah,22,28,Is this man [King] Coniah a despised broken pot? Is he a vessel in which no one takes pleasure? Why are they hurled out he and his royal offspring and cast into a land which they do not know understand or recognize?
Jeremiah,22,29,O land land land hear the word of the Lord!
Jeremiah,22,30,Thus says the Lord: Write this man [Coniah] down as childless a man who shall not prosper in his days for no man of his offspring shall succeed in sitting upon the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah.
Jeremiah,23,1,WOE TO the shepherds (the civil leaders) who destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasturing! says the Lord.
Jeremiah,23,2,Therefore thus says the Lord the God of Israel concerning the shepherds who care for and feed My people: You have scattered My flock and driven them away and have not visited and attended to them; behold I will visit and attend to you for the evil of your doings says the Lord.
Jeremiah,23,3,And I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries to which I have driven them and will bring them again to their folds and pastures; and they will be fruitful and multiply.
Jeremiah,23,4,And I will set up shepherds over them who will feed them. And they will fear no more nor be dismayed neither will any be missing or lost says the Lord.
Jeremiah,23,5,Behold the days are coming says the Lord when I will raise up to David a righteous Branch (Sprout) and He will reign as King and do wisely and will execute justice and righteousness in the land.
Jeremiah,23,6,In His days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is His name by which He shall be called: The Lord Our Righteousness.
Jeremiah,23,7,Therefore behold the days are coming says the Lord when they shall no more say As the Lord lives Who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt
Jeremiah,23,8,But As the Lord lives Who brought up and led the offspring of the house of Israel from the north country and from all the countries to which I had driven them. And they shall dwell in their own land..
Jeremiah,23,9,Concerning the prophets: My heart [says Jeremiah] is broken within me all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man a man whom wine has overcome because of the Lord and because of His holy words [which He has pronounced against unfaithful leaders].
Jeremiah,23,10,For the land is full of adulterers (forsakers of God Israel's true Husband). Because of the curse [of God upon it] the land mourns the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. They [both false prophets and people] rush into wickedness; and their course is evil their might is not right.
Jeremiah,23,11,For both [false] prophet and priest are ungodly and profane; even in My house have I found their wickedness says the Lord.
Jeremiah,23,12,Therefore their way will be to them like slippery paths in the dark; they will be driven on and fall into them. For I will bring evil upon them in the year of their punishment says the Lord.
Jeremiah,23,13,And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria: they prophesied by Baal and caused My people Israel to err and go astray.
Jeremiah,23,14,I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem a horrible thing: they commit adultery and walk in lies; they encourage and strengthen the hands of evildoers so that none returns from his wickedness. They have all of them become to Me like Sodom and her inhabitants like Gomorrah.
Jeremiah,23,15,Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold I will feed them with [the bitterness of] wormwood and make them drink the [poisonous] water of gall for from the [false] prophets of Jerusalem profaneness and ungodliness have gone forth into all the land.
Jeremiah,23,16,Thus says the Lord of hosts: Do not listen to the words of the [false] prophets who prophesy to you. They teach you vanity (emptiness falsity and futility) and fill you with vain hopes; they speak a vision of their own minds and not from the mouth of the Lord.
Jeremiah,23,17,They are continually saying to those who despise Me and the word of the Lord The Lord has said: You shall have peace; and they say to everyone who walks after the stubbornness of his own mind and heart No evil shall come upon you.
Jeremiah,23,18,For who among them has stood in the council of the Lord that he should perceive and hear His word? Who has marked His word [noticing and observing and giving attention to it] and has [actually] heard it?
Jeremiah,23,19,Behold the tempest of the Lord has gone forth in wrath a whirling tempest; it shall whirl and burst upon the heads of the wicked.
Jeremiah,23,20,The anger of the Lord shall not turn back until He has executed and accomplished the thoughts and intents of His mind and heart. In the latter days you shall consider and understand it perfectly.
Jeremiah,23,21,I did not send these [false] prophets yet they ran; I did not speak to them yet they prophesied.
Jeremiah,23,22,But if they had stood in My council then they would have caused My people to hear My words then they would have turned them [My people] from their evil way and from the evil of their doings.
Jeremiah,23,23,Am I a God at hand says the Lord and not a God afar off?
Jeremiah,23,24,Can anyone hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? says the Lord. Do not I fill heaven and earth? says the Lord.
Jeremiah,23,25,I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in My name saying I have dreamed I have dreamed [visions on my bed at night].
Jeremiah,23,26,[How long shall this state of things continue?] How long yet shall it be in the minds of the prophets who prophesy falsehood even the prophets of the deceit of their own hearts
Jeremiah,23,27,Who think that they can cause My people to forget My name by their dreams which every man tells to his neighbor just as their fathers forgot My name because of Baal?
Jeremiah,23,28,The prophet who has a dream let him tell his dream; but he who has My word let him speak My word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat [for nourishment]? says the Lord.
Jeremiah,23,29,Is not My word like fire [that consumes all that cannot endure the test]? says the Lord and like a hammer that breaks in pieces the rock [of most stubborn resistance]?
Jeremiah,23,30,Therefore behold I am against the [false] prophets says the Lord [I am even now descending upon them with punishment these prophets] who steal My words from one another [imitating the phrases of the true prophets].
Jeremiah,23,31,Behold I am against the prophets says the Lord who use their [own deceitful] tongues and say Thus says the Lord.
Jeremiah,23,32,Behold I am against those who prophesy lying dreams says the Lord and tell them and cause My people to err and go astray by their lies and by their vain boasting and recklessness--when I did not send them or command them; nor do they profit these people at all says the Lord.
Jeremiah,23,33,And when these people or a prophet or a priest ask you What is the burden of the Lord [the thing to be lifted up now]? then you shall say to them What burden [indeed]! [You are the burden!] And I will disburden Myself of you and I will cast you off says the Lord.
Jeremiah,23,34,And as for the prophet the priest or [any of these] the people whoever [in mockery calls the word of the Lord a burden and] says The burden of the Lord I will even visit in wrath and punish that man and his house.
Jeremiah,23,35,[For the future in speaking of the utterances of the Lord] thus shall you say every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother: What has the Lord answered? or What has the Lord spoken?
Jeremiah,23,36,But the burden of the Lord you must mention no more for every man's burden is his own response and word [for as they mockingly call all prophecies burdens whether good or bad so will it prove to be to them; God will take them at their own word]; for you pervert the words [not of a lifeless idol but] of the living God the Lord of hosts our God!
Jeremiah,23,37,Thus shall you [reverently] say to the prophet: What has the Lord answered you? Or What has the Lord spoken?
Jeremiah,23,38,But if you say The burden of the Lord therefore thus says the Lord: Because you said these words The burden of the Lord when I sent to you saying You shall not say The burden of the Lord
Jeremiah,23,39,Therefore behold I even I will assuredly take you up and cast you away from My presence you and the city [Jerusalem] which I gave to you and to your fathers.
Jeremiah,23,40,And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you and a perpetual shame which will not be forgotten.
Jeremiah,24,1,AFTER NEBUCHADREZZAR king of Babylon had taken into exile Jeconiah [also called Coniah and Jehoiachin] son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and the princes of Judah with the craftsmen and smiths from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon the Lord showed me [in a vision] two baskets of figs set before the temple of the Lord.
Jeremiah,24,2,One basket had very good figs like the figs that are first ripe; but the other basket had very bad figs so bad that they could not be eaten.
Jeremiah,24,3,Then the Lord said to me What do you see Jeremiah? And I said Figs--the good figs very good and the bad very bad so bad that they cannot be eaten.
Jeremiah,24,4,Again the word of the Lord came to me saying
Jeremiah,24,5,Thus says the Lord the God of Israel: Like these good figs so will I regard the captives of Judah whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.
Jeremiah,24,6,For I will set My eyes upon them for good and I will bring them again to this land; and I will build them up and not pull them down and I will plant them and not pluck them up.
Jeremiah,24,7,And I will give them a heart to know (recognize understand and be acquainted with) Me that I am the Lord; and they will be My people and I will be their God for they will return to Me with their whole heart.
Jeremiah,24,8,And as for the bad figs which are so bad that they cannot be eaten surely thus says the Lord So will I give up Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes and the residue of Jerusalem who remains in this land and those who dwell in the land of Egypt.
Jeremiah,24,9,I will even give them up to be a dismay and a horror and to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil to be a reproach a byword or proverb a taunt and a curse in all places where I will drive them.
Jeremiah,24,10,And I will send the sword famine and pestilence among them until they are consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.
Jeremiah,25,1,THE WORD that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah--which was the first year of the reign of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon--
Jeremiah,25,2,Which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
Jeremiah,25,3,For these twenty-three years--from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah even to this day--the word of the Lord has come to me and I have spoken to you persistently early and late but you have not listened and obeyed.
Jeremiah,25,4,Although the Lord persistently sent you all the prophets His servants yet you have not listened and obeyed or [even] inclined your ear to hear.
Jeremiah,25,5,[The prophets came on My behalf] saying Turn again now every one from his evil way and wrongdoing; [that you may not forfeit the right to] dwell in the land that the Lord gave to you and to your fathers from of old and forevermore.
Jeremiah,25,6,Do not go after other gods to serve and worship them and do not provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.
Jeremiah,25,7,Yet you have not listened to and obeyed Me says the Lord that you might provoke Me to anger with the works (idols) made by your hands to your own hurt.
Jeremiah,25,8,Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Because you have not heard and obeyed My words
Jeremiah,25,9,Behold I will send for all the tribes of the north says the Lord and I will send for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon My servant [or agent to fulfill My designs] and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all these nations round about; and I will devote them [to God] and utterly destroy them and make them an amazement a hissing and perpetual and agelong desolations.
Jeremiah,25,10,Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the sound of the millstones [grinding out the meal] and the light of the candle [which every home burned throughout the night].
Jeremiah,25,11,And this whole land shall be a waste and an astonishment and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
Jeremiah,25,12,Then when seventy years are completed I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation the land of the Chaldeans says the Lord for their iniquity and will make the land [of the Chaldeans] a perpetual waste.
Jeremiah,25,13,And I will bring upon that land all My words which I have pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
Jeremiah,25,14,For many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them even them [the Chaldeans who enslaved other nations]; and I will recompense [all of] them according to their deeds and according to the work of their [own] hands.
Jeremiah,25,15,For thus says the Lord the God of Israel to me: Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand and cause all the nations to whom I send you to drink it.
Jeremiah,25,16,They shall drink and reel to and fro and be crazed because of the sword that I will send among them.
Jeremiah,25,17,Then I [Jeremiah] took the cup from the Lord's hand and made all the nations drink it to whom the Lord had sent me: [that is]
Jeremiah,25,18,Jerusalem and the cities of Judah [being most guilty because their privileges were greatest] its kings and princes to make them a desolation an astonishment a hissing and a curse as it is to this day;
Jeremiah,25,19,Pharaoh king of Egypt his servants his princes all his people
Jeremiah,25,20,And all the mixed foreign population; all the kings of the land of Uz; and all the kings of the land of the Philistines and [their cities of] Ashkelon Gaza Ekron and the remnant of Ashdod;
Jeremiah,25,21,Edom Moab and the children of Ammon;
Jeremiah,25,22,All the kings of Tyre all the kings of Sidon and the kings of the islands and the coastlands across the [Mediterranean] Sea;
Jeremiah,25,23,Dedan Tema Buz [neighboring tribes north of Arabia] and all who clip off the corners of their hair and beards;
Jeremiah,25,24,All the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed foreign people who dwell in the desert;
Jeremiah,25,25,All the kings of Zimri all the kings of Elam (Persia) and all the kings of Media;
Jeremiah,25,26,All the kings of the north far and near one after another--and all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth. And after them the king of Sheshach (Babel or Babylon) shall drink.
Jeremiah,25,27,Then you shall say to them Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Drink be drunk vomit and fall to rise no more because of the sword which I am sending among you.
Jeremiah,25,28,And if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink then you shall say to them Thus says the Lord of hosts: You shall surely drink!
Jeremiah,25,29,For behold I am beginning to work evil in the city which is called by My Name and shall you go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished for I am calling for a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth says the Lord of hosts.
Jeremiah,25,30,Therefore prophesy against them all these words and say to them: The Lord shall roar from on high and utter His voice from His holy habitation; He shall roar mightily against His fold and pasture. He shall give a shout like those who tread grapes [in the winepress but His shout will be] against all the inhabitants of the earth.
Jeremiah,25,31,A noise will come even to the ends of the earth for the Lord has a controversy and an indictment against the nations; He will enter into judgment with all mankind; as for the wicked He will give them to the sword says the Lord.
Jeremiah,25,32,Thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold evil will go forth from nation to nation and a great whirling tempest will rise from the uttermost parts of the earth.
Jeremiah,25,33,And those slain by the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. They shall not be lamented or gathered or buried; their [dead bodies] shall be dung upon the ground.
Jeremiah,25,34,Wail you shepherds and cry; and roll in ashes you principal ones of the flock. For the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions have fully come and you shall fall and be dashed into pieces like a choice vessel.
Jeremiah,25,35,And the shepherds shall have no way to flee nor the principal ones of the flock any means of escape.
Jeremiah,25,36,A voice! The cry of the shepherds and the wailing of the principal ones of the flock! For the Lord is laying waste and destroying their pasture.
Jeremiah,25,37,And the peaceable folds are devastated and brought to silence because of the fierce anger of the Lord.
Jeremiah,25,38,He has left His shelter like the lion; for their land has become a waste and an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppressor and because of [the Lord's] fierce anger.
Jeremiah,26,1,IN THE beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the Lord:
Jeremiah,26,2,Thus says the Lord: Stand in the court of the Lord's house [Jeremiah] and speak to all [the people of] the cities of Judah who come to worship in the Lord's house all the words that I command you to speak to them; subtract not a word.
Jeremiah,26,3,It may be that they will listen and turn every man from his evil way that I may relent and reverse My decision concerning the evil which I purpose to do to them because of their evil doings.
Jeremiah,26,4,And you will say to them Thus says the Lord: If you will not listen to and obey Me to walk in My law which I have set before you
Jeremiah,26,5,And to hear and obey the words of My servants the prophets whom I have sent to you urgently and persistently--though you have not listened and obeyed--
Jeremiah,26,6,Then will I make this house [the temple] like Shiloh [the home of the Tent of Meeting abandoned and later destroyed after the ark was captured by the Philistines] and I will make this city subject to the curses of all nations of the earth [so vile in their sight will it be].
Jeremiah,26,7,And the priests and the [false] prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the Lord.
Jeremiah,26,8,Now when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak to all the people the priests and the [false] prophets and all the people seized him saying You shall surely die!
Jeremiah,26,9,Why have you prophesied in the name of the Lord saying This house shall be like Shiloh [after the ark of the Lord had been taken by our enemies] and this city [Jerusalem] shall be desolate without inhabitant? And all the people were gathered around Jeremiah in the [outer area of the] house of the Lord.
Jeremiah,26,10,When the princes of Judah heard these things they came up from the king's house to the house of the Lord and sat down in the entry of the New Gate of the house of the Lord.
Jeremiah,26,11,Then the priests and the prophets said to the princes and to all the people This man is deserving of death for he has prophesied against this city as you have heard with your own ears.
Jeremiah,26,12,Then Jeremiah said to all the princes and to all the people: The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.
Jeremiah,26,13,Therefore now amend your ways and your doings and obey the voice of the Lord your God; then the Lord will relent and reverse the decision concerning the evil which He has pronounced against you.
Jeremiah,26,14,As for me behold I am in your hands; do with me as seems good and suitable to you.
Jeremiah,26,15,But know for certain that if you put me to death you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon its inhabitants for in truth the Lord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.
Jeremiah,26,16,Then said the princes and all the people to the priests and to the prophets: This man is not deserving of death for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.
Jeremiah,26,17,Then certain of the elders of the land arose and said to all the assembly of the people
Jeremiah,26,18,Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah and said to all the people of Judah Thus says the Lord of hosts: Zion shall be plowed like a field and Jerusalem shall become heaps [of ruins] and the mountain of the house [of the Lord--Mount Moriah on which stands the temple shall become covered not with buildings but] like a densely wooded height.
Jeremiah,26,19,Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put [Micah] to death? Did he not [reverently] fear the Lord and entreat the Lord? And did not the Lord relent and reverse the decision concerning the evil which He had pronounced against them? But [here] we are thinking of committing what will be a great evil against ourselves.
Jeremiah,26,20,And there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the Lord Uriah son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim who prophesied against this city and against this land in words similar to those of Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,26,21,And when Jehoiakim the king with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words the king sought to put [Uriah] to death; but when Uriah heard of it he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt.
Jeremiah,26,22,And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt namely Elnathan son of Achbor and certain other men [who went] with him into Egypt.
Jeremiah,26,23,And they fetched Uriah from Egypt and brought him to Jehoiakim the king who slew him [God's spokesman] with the sword and cast his dead body among the graves of the common people.
Jeremiah,26,24,But the hand of Ahikam son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah that he might not be given into the hands of the people to put him [also] to death.
Jeremiah,27,1,IN THE beginning of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
Jeremiah,27,2,Thus says the Lord to me: Make for yourself thongs and yoke bars and put them on your neck
Jeremiah,27,3,And send them to the king of Edom to the king of Moab to the king of the Ammonites to the king of Tyre and to the king of Sidon by the hand of the messengers who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.
Jeremiah,27,4,And command them to say to their masters Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to your masters:
Jeremiah,27,5,I have made the earth the men and the beasts that are upon the face of the earth by My great power and by My outstretched arm and I give it to whomever it seems right and suitable to Me.
Jeremiah,27,6,And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon My servant and instrument and the beasts of the field also I have given him to serve him.
Jeremiah,27,7,And all nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson until the [God-appointed] time [of punishment] of his own land comes; and then many nations and great kings shall make him their slave.
Jeremiah,27,8,But any nation or kingdom that will not serve this same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon that nation will I punish says the Lord with the sword with famine and with pestilence until I have consumed it by [Nebuchadnezzar's] hand.
Jeremiah,27,9,So do not listen to your [false] prophets your diviners your dreamers [and your dreams whether your own or others'] your soothsayers your sorcerers who say to you You shall not serve the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah,27,10,For they prophesy a lie to you which will cause you to be removed far from your land; and I will drive you out and you will perish.
Jeremiah,27,11,But any nation that brings its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him that nation will I let remain on its own land says the Lord to cultivate it and dwell in it.
Jeremiah,27,12,I spoke also to Zedekiah king of Judah in the same way: Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people and live.
Jeremiah,27,13,Why will you and your people die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence as the Lord has spoken concerning any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
Jeremiah,27,14,Do not listen to and believe the words of the [false] prophets who are saying to you You shall not serve the king of Babylon for it is a lie that they prophesy to you.
Jeremiah,27,15,For I have not sent them says the Lord; but they are prophesying falsely in My name. [It will only end when] I will drive you out to perish together with the [false] prophets who prophesy to you.
Jeremiah,27,16,Also I said to the priests and to all these people Thus says the Lord: Do not listen to the words of your [false] prophets who are prophesying to you saying Behold the vessels of the Lord's house shall now shortly be brought back from Babylon; for they are prophesying a lie to you.
Jeremiah,27,17,Do not listen to them or heed them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city be laid waste?
Jeremiah,27,18,But if they are true prophets and if the word of the Lord is really spoken by them let them now make intercession to the Lord of hosts that the vessels which are [still] left in the house of the Lord in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon.
Jeremiah,27,19,For thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the [bronze] pillars [each twenty-seven feet high] the [bronze] Sea [the laver at which the priests cleansed their hands and feet before ministering at the altar] the [bronze] bases [of the ten lavers in Solomon's temple used for washing animals to be offered as sacrifices] and the remainder of the vessels which are left in this city [Jerusalem]
Jeremiah,27,20,Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon Jeconiah [also called Coniah and Jehoiachin] son of Jehoiakim king of Judah with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem--
Jeremiah,27,21,Yes thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel concerning the vessels which [still] remain in the house of the Lord in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem:
Jeremiah,27,22,They will be carried to Babylon and there will they be until the day that I visit them [with My favor] says the Lord. Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.
Jeremiah,28,1,IN THAT same year in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year and the fifth month Hananiah son of Azzur the [false] prophet who was from Gibeon [one of the priests' cities] said [falsely] to me in the house of the Lord in the presence of the priests and all the people:
Jeremiah,28,2,Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah,28,3,Within two [full] years will I bring back into this place all the vessels of the Lord's house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon.
Jeremiah,28,4,And I will also bring back to this place Jeconiah [also called Coniah and Jehoiachin] son of Jehoiakim king of Judah with all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon says the Lord for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah,28,5,Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people who stood in the house of the Lord.
Jeremiah,28,6,The prophet Jeremiah said Amen! May the Lord do so; may the Lord perform your words which you have prophesied to bring back to this place from Babylon the vessels of the Lord's house and all who were carried away captive.
Jeremiah,28,7,Nevertheless listen now to and hear this word which I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people:
Jeremiah,28,8,The prophets who were before me and before you from of old prophesied against many countries and against great kingdoms of war of evil and of pestilence.
Jeremiah,28,9,But as for the prophet who [on the contrary] prophesies of peace when that prophet's word comes to pass [only] then will it be known that the Lord has truly sent him.
Jeremiah,28,10,Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke bar off the prophet Jeremiah's neck and smashed it.
Jeremiah,28,11,And Hananiah said in the presence of all the people Thus says the Lord: Even so will I break the yoke bars of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within the space of two [full] years. But the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
Jeremiah,28,12,The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet [some time] after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke bar from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,28,13,Go tell Hananiah Thus says the Lord: You have broken yoke bars of wood but you have made in their stead bars of iron.
Jeremiah,28,14,For thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: I have put upon the neck of all these nations the iron yoke of servitude of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and they shall serve him. For I have given him even the beasts of the field.
Jeremiah,28,15,Then said the prophet Jeremiah to Hananiah the prophet Listen now Hananiah The Lord has not sent you but you have made this people trust in a lie.
Jeremiah,28,16,Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold I will cast you from the face of the earth. This year you will die because you have uttered and taught rebellion against the Lord.
Jeremiah,28,17,So Hananiah the prophet died [two months later] the same year in the seventh month.
Jeremiah,29,1,NOW THESE are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders in exile and to the priests the prophets and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon.
Jeremiah,29,2,This was after King Jeconiah [also called Coniah and Jehoiachin] and the queen mother the eunuchs the princes of Judah and Jerusalem the craftsmen and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,29,3,[The letter was sent] by the hand of Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. It said:
Jeremiah,29,4,Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel to all the captives whom I have caused to be carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:
Jeremiah,29,5,Build yourselves houses and dwell in them; plant gardens and eat the fruit of them.
Jeremiah,29,6,Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there and do not be diminished.
Jeremiah,29,7,And seek (inquire for require and request) the peace and welfare of the city to which I have caused you to be carried away captive; and pray to the Lord for it for in the welfare of [the city in which you live] you will have welfare.
Jeremiah,29,8,For thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Let not your [false] prophets and your diviners who are in your midst deceive you; pay no attention and attach no significance to your dreams which you dream or to theirs
Jeremiah,29,9,For they prophesy falsely to you in My name. I have not sent them says the Lord.
Jeremiah,29,10,For thus says the Lord When seventy years are completed for Babylon I will visit you and keep My good promise to you causing you to return to this place.
Jeremiah,29,11,For I know the thoughts and plans that I have for you says the Lord thoughts and plans for welfare and peace and not for evil to give you hope in your final outcome.
Jeremiah,29,12,Then you will call upon Me and you will come and pray to Me and I will hear and heed you.
Jeremiah,29,13,Then you will seek Me inquire for and require Me [as a vital necessity] and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.
Jeremiah,29,14,I will be found by you says the Lord and I will release you from captivity and gather you from all the nations and all the places to which I have driven you says the Lord and I will bring you back to the place from which I caused you to be carried away captive.
Jeremiah,29,15,[But as for those still in Jerusalem] because you have said The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon
Jeremiah,29,16,Thus says the Lord concerning the king who sits upon the throne of David and concerning all the people who dwell in this city your brethren who did not go forth with you into captivity--
Jeremiah,29,17,Thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold I am sending on them the sword famine and pestilence and I will make them like vile figs which are so bad they cannot be eaten.
Jeremiah,29,18,And I will pursue them with the sword famine and pestilence and will give them up to be tossed to and fro and to be a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth to be a curse an astonishment and a terror a hissing and a reproach among all the nations to which I have driven them
Jeremiah,29,19,Because they have not listened to and heeded My words says the Lord which I sent to them persistently by My servants the prophets; but you [exiles] would not listen [either] says the Lord.
Jeremiah,29,20,Hear therefore the word of the Lord all you exiles whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
Jeremiah,29,21,Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel concerning Ahab son of Kolaiah and concerning Zedekiah son of Maaseiah who are prophesying lies to you in My name: Behold I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and he will slay them [those false prophets whom you say I have raised up for you in Babylon] before your eyes!
Jeremiah,29,22,And because of them this curse shall be taken up and used by all from Judah who are in captivity in Babylon: The Lord make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire--
Jeremiah,29,23,Because they have committed folly in Israel and have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives and have spoken words in My name falsely which I had not commanded them. I am the One Who knows and I am witness says the Lord.
Jeremiah,29,24,Also you shall say this concerning and to Shemaiah of Nehelam [among the exiles in Babylon]:
Jeremiah,29,25,Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Because you have sent letters in your [own] name to all the people who are in Jerusalem and to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest and to all the priests saying
Jeremiah,29,26,The Lord has made you [Zephaniah] priest instead of Jehoiada the [deputy] priest that you should have oversight in the house of the Lord over every madman who makes himself a prophet that you should put him in the stocks and collar.
Jeremiah,29,27,Now therefore [continued the letter from Shemaiah in Babylon to Zephaniah in Jerusalem] why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who makes himself a prophet to you?
Jeremiah,29,28,For he has sent to us in Babylon saying [This captivity of yours] is to be long; build houses and dwell in them; plant gardens and eat the fruit of them.
Jeremiah,29,29,And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,29,30,Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,29,31,Send [this message] to all those in captivity saying Thus says the Lord concerning Shemaiah of Nehelam: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you though I did not send him and has caused you to trust in a lie
Jeremiah,29,32,Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold I will punish Shemaiah of Nehelam and his offspring. He will not have anyone [born] to dwell among this people nor will he see the good that I will do to My people says the Lord because he has spoken and taught rebellion against the Lord.
Jeremiah,30,1,THE WORD that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
Jeremiah,30,2,Thus says the Lord the God of Israel: Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.
Jeremiah,30,3,For note well the days are coming says the Lord when I will release from captivity My people Israel and Judah says the Lord and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers and they will possess it.
Jeremiah,30,4,And these are the words the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah:
Jeremiah,30,5,Thus says the Lord: We have heard a voice of trembling and panic--of terror and not peace.
Jeremiah,30,6,Ask now and see whether a man can give birth to a child? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his loins like a woman in labor? Why are all faces turned pale?
Jeremiah,30,7,Alas! for that day will be great so that none will be like it; it will be the time of Jacob's [unequaled] trouble but he will be saved out of it.
Jeremiah,30,8,For it will come to pass in that day says the Lord of hosts that I will break [the oppressor's] yoke from your neck and I will burst your bonds; and strangers will no more make slaves of [the people of Israel].
Jeremiah,30,9,But they will serve the Lord their God and David's [descendant] their King Whom I will raise up for them.
Jeremiah,30,10,Therefore fear not O My servant Jacob says the Lord nor be dismayed or cast down O Israel; for behold I will save you out of a distant land [of exile] and your posterity from the land of their captivity. Jacob will return and will be quiet and at ease and none will make him afraid or cause him to be terrorized and to tremble.
Jeremiah,30,11,For I am with you says the Lord to save you; for I will make a full and complete end of all the nations to which I have scattered you but I will not make a full and complete end of you. But I will correct you in measure and with judgment and will in no sense hold you guiltless or leave you unpunished.
Jeremiah,30,12,For thus says the Lord: Your hurt is incurable and your wound is grievous.
Jeremiah,30,13,There is none to plead your cause; for [the pressing together of] your wound you have no healing [device] no binding plaster.
Jeremiah,30,14,All your lovers (allies) have forgotten you; they neither seek inquire of or require you. For I have hurt you with the wound of an enemy with the chastisement of a cruel and merciless foe because of the greatness of your perversity and guilt because your sins are glaring and innumerable.
Jeremiah,30,15,Why do you cry out because of your hurt [the natural result of your sins]? Your pain is deadly (incurable). Because of the greatness of your perversity and guilt because your sins are glaring and innumerable I have done these things to you.
Jeremiah,30,16,Therefore all who devour you will be devoured; and all your adversaries every one of them will go into captivity. And they who despoil you will become a spoil and all who prey upon you will I give for a prey.
Jeremiah,30,17,For I will restore health to you and I will heal your wounds says the Lord because they have called you an outcast saying This is Zion whom no one seeks after and for whom no one cares!
Jeremiah,30,18,Thus says the Lord: Behold I will release from captivity the tents of Jacob and have mercy on his dwelling places; the city will be rebuilt on its own [old] moundlike site and the palace will be dwelt in after its former fashion.
Jeremiah,30,19,Out of them [city and palace] will come songs of thanksgiving and the voices of those who make merry. And I will multiply them and they will not be few; I will also glorify them and they will not be small.
Jeremiah,30,20,Their children too shall be as in former times and their congregation shall be established before Me and I will punish all who oppress them.
Jeremiah,30,21,And their prince will be one of them and their ruler will come from the midst of them. I will cause him to draw near and he will approach Me for who is he who would have the boldness and would dare [on his own initiative] to approach Me? says the Lord.
Jeremiah,30,22,Then you will be My people and I will be your God.
Jeremiah,30,23,Behold the tempest of the Lord has gone forth with wrath a sweeping and gathering tempest; it shall whirl and burst upon the heads of the wicked.
Jeremiah,30,24,The fierce anger and indignation of the Lord shall not turn back until He has executed and accomplished the thoughts and intents of His mind and heart. In the latter days you shall understand this.
Jeremiah,31,1,AT THAT time says the Lord will I be the God of all the families of Israel and they will be My people.
Jeremiah,31,2,Thus says the Lord: The people who survived the sword found favor in the wilderness [place of exile]--when Israel sought to find rest.
Jeremiah,31,3,The Lord appeared from of old to me [Israel] saying Yes I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn you and continued My faithfulness to you.
Jeremiah,31,4,Again I will build you and you will be built O Virgin Israel! You will again be adorned with your timbrels [small one-headed drums] and go forth in the dancing [chorus] of those who make merry.
Jeremiah,31,5,Again you shall plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant and make the fruit common and enjoy it [undisturbed].
Jeremiah,31,6,For there shall be a day when the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim shall cry out Arise and let us go up to Zion to the Lord our God.
Jeremiah,31,7,For thus says the Lord: Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob and shout for the head of the nations [on account of the chosen people Israel]. Proclaim praise and say The Lord has saved His people the remnant of Israel!
Jeremiah,31,8,Behold I will bring them from the north country and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth and among them will be the blind and the lame the woman with child and she who labors in childbirth together; a great company they will return here to Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,31,9,They will come with weeping [in penitence and for joy] pouring out prayers [for the future]. I will lead them back; I will cause them to walk by streams of water and bring them in a straight way in which they will not stumble for I am a Father to Israel and Ephraim [Israel] is My firstborn.
Jeremiah,31,10,Hear the word of the Lord O you nations and declare it in the isles and coastlands far away and say He Who scattered Israel will gather him and will keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock.
Jeremiah,31,11,For the Lord has ransomed Jacob and has redeemed him from the hand of him who was too strong for him.
Jeremiah,31,12,They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion and shall flow together and be radiant with joy over the goodness of the Lord--for the corn for the juice [of the grape] for the oil and for the young of the flock and the herd. And their life shall be like a watered garden and they shall not sorrow or languish any more at all.
Jeremiah,31,13,Then will the maidens rejoice in the dance and the young men and old together. For I will turn their mourning into joy and will comfort them and make them rejoice after their sorrow.
Jeremiah,31,14,I will satisfy fully the life of the priests with abundance [of offerings shared with them] and My people will be satisfied with My goodness says the Lord.
Jeremiah,31,15,Thus says the Lord: A voice is heard in Ramah lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children because they are no more.
Jeremiah,31,16,Thus says the Lord: Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears for your work shall be rewarded says the Lord; and [your children] shall return from the enemy's land.
Jeremiah,31,17,And there is hope for your future says the Lord; your children shall come back to their own country.
Jeremiah,31,18,I have surely heard Ephraim [Israel] moaning thus: You have chastised me and I was chastised like a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke; bring me back that I may be restored for You are the Lord my God.
Jeremiah,31,19,Surely after I [Ephraim] was turned [from You] I repented; and after I was instructed I penitently smote my thigh. I was ashamed yes even confounded because I bore the disgrace of my youth [as a nation].
Jeremiah,31,20,Is Ephraim My dear son? Is he a darling child and beloved? For as often as I speak against him I do [earnestly] remember him still. Therefore My affection is stirred and My heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy pity and loving-kindness for him says the Lord.
Jeremiah,31,21,Set up for yourselves highway markers [back to Canaan] make for yourselves guideposts; turn your thoughts and attention to the way by which you went [into exile]. Retrace your steps O Virgin Israel return to these your cities.
Jeremiah,31,22,How long will you waver and hesitate [to return] O you backsliding daughter? For the Lord has created a new thing in the land [of Israel]: a female shall compass (woo win and protect) a man.
Jeremiah,31,23,Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Once more they shall use these words in the land of Judah and in her cities when I release them from exile: The Lord bless you O habitation of justice and righteousness O holy mountain!
Jeremiah,31,24,And [the people of] Judah and all its cities shall dwell there together--[nomad] farmers and those who wander about with their flocks.
Jeremiah,31,25,For I will [fully] satisfy the weary soul and I will replenish every languishing and sorrowful person.
Jeremiah,31,26,Thereupon I [Jeremiah] awoke and looked and my [trancelike] sleep was sweet [in the assurance it gave] to me.
Jeremiah,31,27,Behold the days are coming says the Lord when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed (offspring) of man and of beast.
Jeremiah,31,28,And it will be that as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow destroy and afflict [with evil] so will I watch over them to build and to plant [with good] says the Lord.
Jeremiah,31,29,In those days they shall say no more The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge.
Jeremiah,31,30,But everyone shall die for his own iniquity [only]; every man who eats sour grapes--his [own] teeth shall be set on edge.
Jeremiah,31,31,Behold the days are coming says the Lord when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah
Jeremiah,31,32,Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt My covenant which they broke although I was their Husband says the Lord.
Jeremiah,31,33,But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel: After those days says the Lord I will put My law within them and on their hearts will I write it; and I will be their God and they will be My people.
Jeremiah,31,34,And they will no more teach each man his neighbor and each man his brother saying Know the Lord for they will all know Me [recognize understand and be acquainted with Me] from the least of them to the greatest says the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity and I will [seriously] remember their sin no more.
Jeremiah,31,35,Thus says the Lord Who gives the sun for a light by day and the fixed order of the moon and of the stars for a light by night Who stirs up the sea's roaring billows or stills the waves when they roar--the Lord of hosts is His name:
Jeremiah,31,36,If these ordinances [of fixed order] depart from before Me says the Lord then the posterity of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before Me throughout the ages.
Jeremiah,31,37,Thus says the Lord: If the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath then I will cast off all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done says the Lord.
Jeremiah,31,38,Behold the days are coming says the Lord when the city [of Jerusalem] shall be built [again] for the Lord from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.
Jeremiah,31,39,And the measuring line shall go out farther straight onward to the hill Gareb and shall then turn to Goah [exact location unknown].
Jeremiah,31,40,And the whole valley [Hinnom] of the dead bodies and [the hill] of the ashes [long dumped there from the temple sacrifices] and all the fields as far as the brook Kidron to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east shall be holy to the Lord. It [the city] shall not be plucked up or overthrown any more to the end of the age.
Jeremiah,32,1,THE WORD that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
Jeremiah,32,2,For the king of Babylon's army was then besieging Jerusalem and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard which was in the house of the king of Judah.
Jeremiah,32,3,For Zedekiah king of Judah had locked him up saying Why do you prophesy and say Thus says the Lord: Behold I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall take it;
Jeremiah,32,4,And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hands of the Chaldeans but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon and shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye;
Jeremiah,32,5,And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon and there shall he be until I visit him [for evil] says the Lord; and though you fight against the Chaldeans you shall not prosper [why do you thus prophesy]?
Jeremiah,32,6,And Jeremiah said The word of the Lord came to me saying
Jeremiah,32,7,Behold Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you and say Buy my field that is in Anathoth for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.
Jeremiah,32,8,So Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard in accordance with the word of the Lord and he said to me I pray you buy my field that is in Anathoth which is in the land of Benjamin for the right of inheritance is yours and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord.
Jeremiah,32,9,And I bought the field that was in Anathoth from Hanamel my uncle's son and weighed out for him the money--seventeen shekels of silver.
Jeremiah,32,10,And I signed the deed and sealed it called witnesses and weighed out for him the money on the scales.
Jeremiah,32,11,So I took the deed of the purchase--both that which was sealed containing the terms and conditions and the copy which was unsealed--
Jeremiah,32,12,And I gave the purchase deed to Baruch son of Neriah the son of Mahseiah in the sight of Hanamel my uncle's son and the witnesses who signed the purchase deed in the presence of all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard.
Jeremiah,32,13,And I charged Baruch before them saying
Jeremiah,32,14,Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Take these deeds both this purchase deed which is sealed and this unsealed deed and put them in an earthen vessel that they may last a long time.
Jeremiah,32,15,For thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall be purchased yet again in this land.
Jeremiah,32,16,Now when I had delivered the purchase deed to Baruch son of Neriah I prayed to the Lord saying:
Jeremiah,32,17,Alas Lord God! Behold You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! There is nothing too hard or too wonderful for You--
Jeremiah,32,18,You Who show loving-kindness to thousands but recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosoms of their children after them. The great the mighty God; the Lord of hosts is His name--
Jeremiah,32,19,Great [are You] in counsel and mighty in deeds Whose eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men to reward or repay each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings
Jeremiah,32,20,Who wrought signs and wonders in the land of Egypt and even to this day [continues to do so] both in Israel and among other men and made for Yourself a name as at this day.
Jeremiah,32,21,And You brought forth Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders with a strong hand and outstretched arm and with great terror;
Jeremiah,32,22,And You gave them this land which You swore to their fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey;
Jeremiah,32,23,And they entered and took possession of it but they obeyed not Your voice nor walked in Your law; they have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do. Therefore You have caused all this evil to come upon them.
Jeremiah,32,24,See the siege mounds [of earth which the foe has heaped against the walls]; they have come up to the city to take it. And the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it because [the people are overcome] by the sword and the famine and the pestilence. What You have spoken has come to pass and behold You see it.
Jeremiah,32,25,Yet O Lord God You said to me Buy the field with money and get witnesses even though the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah,32,26,Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah saying
Jeremiah,32,27,Behold I am the Lord the God of all flesh; is there anything too hard for Me?
Jeremiah,32,28,Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold I am giving this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and he shall take it;
Jeremiah,32,29,And the Chaldeans who are fighting against this city shall come in and set this city on fire and burn it along with the houses on whose roofs incense has been offered to Baal and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods to provoke Me to anger.
Jeremiah,32,30,For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only evil before Me from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked Me to anger with the work of their hands [the idols] says the Lord.
Jeremiah,32,31,For this city has been to Me a [such a] provocation of My anger and My wrath from the day that they [finished] building it [in the time of Solomon who was the first Israelite king who turned to idolatry] even to this day that I must remove it from before My face--
Jeremiah,32,32,Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah which they have done to provoke Me to anger--they their kings their princes their priests their prophets the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,32,33,And they have turned their backs to Me and not their faces; though I taught them persistently yet they would not listen and receive instruction.
Jeremiah,32,34,But they set their abominations [of idol worship] in the house which is called by My Name to defile it.
Jeremiah,32,35,And they built the high places [for worship] of Baal in the Valley of Ben-hinnom [son of Hinnom] to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire [in worship also of and] to Molech--which I did not command them nor did it come into My mind or heart that they should do this abomination to cause Judah to sin.
Jeremiah,32,36,And now therefore thus says the Lord the God of Israel concerning this city of which you say It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword and by famine and by pestilence:
Jeremiah,32,37,Behold I will gather them out of all countries to which I drove them in My anger and in My wrath and in great indignation; I will bring them again to this place and I will make them dwell safely.
Jeremiah,32,38,And they will be My people and I will be their God.
Jeremiah,32,39,And I will give them one heart and one way that they may [reverently] fear Me forever for the good of themselves and of their children after them.
Jeremiah,32,40,And I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will not turn away from following them to do them good and I will put My [reverential] fear in their hearts so that they will not depart from Me.
Jeremiah,32,41,Yes I will rejoice over them to do them good and I will plant them in this land assuredly and in truth with My whole heart and with My whole being.
Jeremiah,32,42,For thus says the Lord: As I have brought all this great evil upon this people so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.
Jeremiah,32,43,And fields shall be bought in this land of which you say It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah,32,44,Men shall buy fields for money and shall sign deeds seal them and call witnesses in the land of Benjamin in the places around Jerusalem in the cities of Judah in the cities of the hill country in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the South (the Negeb) for I will cause them to be released from their exile says the Lord.
Jeremiah,33,1,MOREOVER THE word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the second time while he was still shut up in the court of the guard saying
Jeremiah,33,2,Thus says the Lord Who made [the earth] the Lord Who formed it to establish it--the Lord is His name:
Jeremiah,33,3,Call to Me and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things fenced in and hidden which you do not know (do not distinguish and recognize have knowledge of and understand).
Jeremiah,33,4,For thus says the Lord the God of Israel concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah which are torn down to make a defense against the siege mounds and before the sword:
Jeremiah,33,5,They [the besieged Jews] are coming in to fight against the Chaldeans and they [the houses] will be filled with the dead bodies of men whom I shall slay in My anger and My wrath; for I have hidden My face [in indignation] from this city because of all their wickedness.
Jeremiah,33,6,Behold [in the future restored Jerusalem] I will lay upon it health and healing and I will cure them and will reveal to them the abundance of peace (prosperity security stability) and truth.
Jeremiah,33,7,And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to be reversed and will rebuild them as they were at first.
Jeremiah,33,8,And I will cleanse them from all the guilt and iniquity by which they have sinned against Me and I will forgive all their guilt and iniquities by which they have sinned and rebelled against Me.
Jeremiah,33,9,And [Jerusalem] shall be to Me a name of joy a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth that hear of all the good I do for it and they shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the peace prosperity security and stability I provide for it.
Jeremiah,33,10,Thus says the Lord: Yet again there shall be heard in this place of which you say It is a desolate waste without man and without beast--even in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without man and without inhabitant and without beast--
Jeremiah,33,11,[There shall be heard again] the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voices of those who sing as they bring sacrifices of thanksgiving into the house of the Lord Give praise and thanks to the Lord of hosts for the Lord is good; for His mercy and kindness and steadfast love endure forever! For I will cause the captivity of the land to be reversed and return to be as it was at first says the Lord.
Jeremiah,33,12,Thus says the Lord of hosts: In this place which is desolate without man and without beast and in all its cities there shall again be dwellings and pastures of shepherds resting their flocks.
Jeremiah,33,13,In the cities of the hill country in the cities of the lowland in the cities of the South (the Negeb) in the land of Benjamin in the places around Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah shall flocks pass again under the hands of him who counts them says the Lord.
Jeremiah,33,14,Behold the days are coming says the Lord when I will fulfill the good promise I have made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
Jeremiah,33,15,In those days and at that time will I cause a righteous Branch [the Messiah] to grow up to David; and He shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
Jeremiah,33,16,In those days Judah shall be saved and Jerusalem shall dwell safely. And this is the name by which it will be called The Lord is Our Righteousness (our Rightness our Justice).
Jeremiah,33,17,For thus says the Lord: David shall never fail [to have] a man [descendant] to sit on the throne of the house of Israel
Jeremiah,33,18,Nor shall the Levitical priests fail [to have] a man [descendant] to offer burnt offerings before Me and to burn cereal offerings and to make sacrifices continually (all day long).
Jeremiah,33,19,And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah saying
Jeremiah,33,20,Thus says the Lord: If you can break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night so that there should not be day and night in their season
Jeremiah,33,21,Then can also My covenant be broken with David My servant so that he shall not have a son to reign upon his throne and [My league be broken also] with the Levitical priests My ministers.
Jeremiah,33,22,As the host of [the stars of] the heavens cannot be numbered nor the sand of the sea be measured so will I multiply the offspring of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.
Jeremiah,33,23,Moreover the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah saying
Jeremiah,33,24,Have you not noticed that these people [the Jews] are saying The Lord has cast off the two families [Israel and Judah] which He chose? Thus My people have despised [themselves in relation to God as His covenant people] so that they are no more a nation in their [own] sight.
Jeremiah,33,25,Thus says the Lord: If My covenant with day and night does not stand and if I have not appointed the ordinances of the heavens and the earth [the whole order of nature]
Jeremiah,33,26,Then will I also cast away the descendants of Jacob and David My servant and will not choose one of his offspring to be ruler over the descendants of Abraham Isaac and Jacob. For I will cause their captivity to be reversed and I will have mercy kindness and steadfast love on and for them.
Jeremiah,34,1,MOREOVER THE word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the second time while he was still shut up in the court of the guard saying
Jeremiah,34,2,Thus says the Lord Who made [the earth] the Lord Who formed it to establish it--the Lord is His name:

For I will cause the captivity of the land to be reversed and return to be as it was at first says the Lord.

Jeremiah,35,1,THE WORD that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:
Jeremiah,35,2,Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to them and bring them into the house of the Lord into one of the chambers; then give them [who are pledged to drink no wine] some wine to drink.
Jeremiah,35,3,So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah the son of Habazziniah and his brothers and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites
Jeremiah,35,4,And I brought them into the house of the Lord into the chamber of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah the man of God which was by the chamber of the princes above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum the keeper of the door.
Jeremiah,35,5,And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pitchers full of wine and cups and I said to them Drink wine.
Jeremiah,35,6,But they said We will drink no wine for Jonadab son of Rechab our father commanded us: You shall not drink wine neither you nor your sons forever.
Jeremiah,35,7,Neither shall you build a house or sow seed or plant a vineyard or have them; but you shall dwell all your days in tents that you may live many days in the land where you are temporary residents.
Jeremiah,35,8,And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab son of Rechab our father in all that he charged us to drink no wine all our days--we our wives our sons and our daughters--
Jeremiah,35,9,And not to build ourselves houses to live in; nor do we have vineyard or field or seed.
Jeremiah,35,10,But we have dwelt in tents and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our ancestor commanded us.
Jeremiah,35,11,But when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up against the land we said Come and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Syrians. So we are living in Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,35,12,Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,35,13,Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem Will you not receive instruction and listen to My words and obey them? says the Lord.
Jeremiah,35,14,The command which Jonadab son of Rechab gave to his sons not to drink wine has been carried out and established [as a custom for more than two hundred years]. To this day they drink no wine but they have obeyed their father's command. But I even I have persistently spoken to you but you have not listened to and obeyed Me.
Jeremiah,35,15,I have sent also to you all My servants the prophets earnestly and persistently saying Return now every man from his evil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to serve them; and then you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers. But you did not submit and consent to Me or listen to and obey Me.
Jeremiah,35,16,Since the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab have fulfilled and established the command of their father which he commanded them but these people have not listened to and obeyed Me
Jeremiah,35,17,Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I am bringing upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them because I have spoken to them but they have not listened and I have called to them but they have not answered.
Jeremiah,35,18,And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father and have kept all his precepts and have done according to all that he commanded you
Jeremiah,35,19,Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Jonadab son of Rechab shall never fail [to have] a man [descendant] to stand before Me.
Jeremiah,36,1,IN THE fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
Jeremiah,36,2,Take a scroll [of parchment] for a book and write on it all the words I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations from the day I spoke to you in the days of [King] Josiah until this day.
Jeremiah,36,3,It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them so that each one may turn from his evil way that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
Jeremiah,36,4,Then Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah and Baruch wrote upon the scroll of the book all the words which Jeremiah dictated [words] that the Lord had spoken to him.
Jeremiah,36,5,And Jeremiah commanded Baruch saying I am [in hiding virtually] restrained and shut up; I cannot go into the house of the Lord.
Jeremiah,36,6,Therefore you go and on a day of fasting in the hearing of all the people in the Lord's house you shall read the words of the Lord which you have written on the scroll at my dictation. Also you shall read them in the hearing of all who come out of the cities of Judah.
Jeremiah,36,7,It may be that they will make their supplication [for mercy] before the Lord and each one will turn back from his evil way for great is the anger and the wrath that the Lord has pronounced against this people.
Jeremiah,36,8,And Baruch son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him reading from [Jeremiah's] book the words of the Lord in the Lord's house.
Jeremiah,36,9,And in the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah in the ninth month a fast was proclaimed before the Lord for all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came to Jerusalem from the cities of Judah.
Jeremiah,36,10,Then Baruch read in the hearing of all the people the words of Jeremiah from the scroll of the book in the house of the Lord in the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe in the upper court at the entry of the New Gate of the Lord's house.
Jeremiah,36,11,When Micaiah son of Gemariah the son of Shaphan had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord
Jeremiah,36,12,He went down to the king's house into the scribe's chamber and behold all the princes were sitting there: Elishama the scribe Delaiah son of Shemaiah Elnathan son of Achbor Gemariah son of Shaphan Zedekiah son of Hananiah and all the [other] princes.
Jeremiah,36,13,Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the hearing of the people.
Jeremiah,36,14,Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah the son of Shelemiah the son of Cushi to Baruch saying Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read in the hearing of the people and come [to us]. So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.
Jeremiah,36,15,And they said to him Sit down now and read it in our hearing. So Baruch read it in their hearing.
Jeremiah,36,16,Now when they had heard all the words they turned one to another in fear and said to Baruch We must surely tell the king of all these words.
Jeremiah,36,17,And they asked Baruch Tell us now how did you write all these words? At [Jeremiah's] dictation?
Jeremiah,36,18,Then Baruch answered them He dictated all these words to me and I wrote them with ink in the book.
Jeremiah,36,19,Then the princes said to Baruch Go and hide you and Jeremiah and let no one know where you are.
Jeremiah,36,20,Then they went into the court to the king but they [first] put the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; then they reported all the words to the king.
Jeremiah,36,21,So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king and of all the princes who stood beside the king.
Jeremiah,36,22,Now it was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter house and a fire was burning there before him in the brazier.
Jeremiah,36,23,And [each time] when Jehudi had read three or four columns [of the scroll] he [King Jehoiakim] would cut them off with a penknife and cast them into the fire that was in the brazier until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.
Jeremiah,36,24,Yet they were not afraid nor did they rend their garments--neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words.
Jeremiah,36,25,Even though Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah tried to persuade the king not to burn the scroll he would not listen to them.
Jeremiah,36,26,And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son and Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet but the Lord hid them.
Jeremiah,36,27,Now the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll with the words which Baruch wrote at the dictation of Jeremiah [and the Lord] said:
Jeremiah,36,28,Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned.
Jeremiah,36,29,And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say Thus says the Lord: You have burned this scroll saying Why have you written on it that the king of Babylon shall surely come and destroy this land and shall cut off man and beast from it?
Jeremiah,36,30,Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have no [heir] to sit upon the throne of David and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and to the frost by night.
Jeremiah,36,31,And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the men of Judah all the evil that I have pronounced against them--but they would not hear.
Jeremiah,36,32,Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe the son of Neriah who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and besides them many similar words were added.
Jeremiah,37,1,AND ZEDEKIAH son of Josiah whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah reigned instead of Coniah [also called Jeconiah and Jehoiachin] son of Jehoiakim.
Jeremiah,37,2,But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to and obeyed the words of the Lord which He spoke through the prophet Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,37,3,Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah with Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah saying Pray now to the Lord our God for us.
Jeremiah,37,4,Now Jeremiah was coming in and going out among the people for they had not [yet] put him in prison.
Jeremiah,37,5,And Pharaoh's army had come forth out of Egypt and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard the news about them they withdrew from Jerusalem and departed.
Jeremiah,37,6,Then came the word of the Lord to the prophet Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,37,7,Thus says the Lord the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Judah who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: Behold Pharaoh's army which has come forth to help you will return to Egypt to their own land.
Jeremiah,37,8,And the Chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city and they shall take it and burn it with fire.
Jeremiah,37,9,Thus says the Lord: Do not deceive yourselves saying The Chaldeans will surely stay away from us--for they will not stay away.
Jeremiah,37,10,For though you should defeat the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you and there remained only the wounded and men stricken through among them every man confined to his tent yet they would rise up and burn this city with fire.
Jeremiah,37,11,And when the army of the Chaldeans had departed from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's approaching army
Jeremiah,37,12,Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin [to slip away during the brief lull in the Chaldean invasion] to receive [the title to] his portion [of land which the Lord had promised would eventually be valuable] there among the people.
Jeremiah,37,13,And when he was at the Gate of Benjamin a sentry was [on guard] there whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet saying You are deserting to the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah,37,14,Then said Jeremiah It is false! I am not deserting to the Chaldeans. But the sentry would not listen to him. So Irijah took Jeremiah and brought him to the princes.
Jeremiah,37,15,Therefore the princes were enraged with Jeremiah and beat him and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe--for they had made that the prison.
Jeremiah,37,16,When Jeremiah had come into the cells in the dungeon and had remained there many days
Jeremiah,37,17,Zedekiah the king sent and brought him out; and the king asked him secretly in his house Is there any word from the Lord? And Jeremiah said There is! And he said also You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah,37,18,Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah In what have I sinned against you or against your servants or against this people that you have put me in prison?
Jeremiah,37,19,Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you saying The king of Babylon shall not come against you or against this land?
Jeremiah,37,20,Therefore hear now I pray you O my lord the king. Let my supplication I pray you come before you and be acceptable that you do not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe lest I die there.
Jeremiah,37,21,Then Zedekiah the king commanded and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard and a round loaf of bread from the bakers' street was given to him daily until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained [imprisoned] in the court of the guard.
Jeremiah,38,1,NOW SHEPHATIAH son of Mattan Gedaliah son of Pashhur Jucal [also called Jehucal] son of Shelemiah and Pashhur son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people saying
Jeremiah,38,2,Thus says the Lord: He who remains in this city shall die by the sword by famine and by pestilence but he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life as his only booty [as a prize of war] and he shall live.
Jeremiah,38,3,Thus says the Lord: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and he shall take it.
Jeremiah,38,4,Therefore the princes said to the king We beseech you let this man [Jeremiah] be put to death; for [talking] thus he weakens the hands of the soldiers who remain in this city and the hands of all the people by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of these people but [to do them] harm.
Jeremiah,38,5,Then Zedekiah the king said Behold he is in your hands; for the king is in no position to do anything against you.
Jeremiah,38,6,So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon or cistern pit [in the charge] of Malchiah the king's son which was in the court of the guard; and they let Jeremiah down [into the pit] with ropes. And in the dungeon or cistern pit there was no water but only mire and Jeremiah sank in the mire.
Jeremiah,38,7,Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian [a Cushite] one of the eunuchs who was in the king's house heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon or cistern pit; and while the king was then sitting in the Gate of Benjamin
Jeremiah,38,8,Ebed-melech went out of the king's house and spoke to the king saying
Jeremiah,38,9,My lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon or cistern pit; and he is liable to die of hunger and is [as good as] dead in the place where he is for there is no more bread left in the city.
Jeremiah,38,10,Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian saying Take from here thirty men with you and raise Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon or cistern pit before he dies.
Jeremiah,38,11,So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went into the house of the king [to a room] under the treasury and took along from there old rags and worn-out garments and let them down by ropes into the dungeon or cistern pit to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,38,12,And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah Put now these old rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the ropes. And Jeremiah did so.
Jeremiah,38,13,So they drew up Jeremiah with the ropes and took him up out of the dungeon or cistern pit; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
Jeremiah,38,14,Then Zedekiah the king sent and brought Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entrance that is in the house of the Lord. And the king said to Jeremiah I am going to ask you something; hide nothing from me.
Jeremiah,38,15,Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah If I tell you will you not surely put me to death? And even if I did give you counsel you would not listen to me.
Jeremiah,38,16,So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah As the Lord lives Who made our lives I will not put you to death or give you into the hands of these men who seek your life.
Jeremiah,38,17,Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah Thus says the Lord God of hosts the God of Israel: If you will go forth and surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon then you will live and this city will not be burned with fire; and you will live--you and your house.
Jeremiah,38,18,But if you will not go forth and surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon then this city will be given into the hands of the Chaldeans and they will burn it with fire; and you will not escape out of their hands.
Jeremiah,38,19,And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah I am afraid of the Jews who have deserted to the Chaldeans lest the enemy deliver me into their [these former subjects'] hands and they mock me and abuse me.
Jeremiah,38,20,But Jeremiah said They will not deliver you [to them]. Obey I beg of you the voice of the Lord Who speaks to you through me. Then it will be well with you and you will live.
Jeremiah,38,21,But if you refuse to go forth and surrender to them this is the word [the vision] that the Lord has shown me:
Jeremiah,38,22,Behold [in it] all the women who are left in the house of the king of Judah will be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes and will say [to you King Zedekiah] Your friends have prevailed against your better judgment and have deceived you. Now when your feet are sunk in the mire [of trouble] they have turned their backs.
Jeremiah,38,23,All your wives and your children will be brought out to the Chaldeans; and you [yourself] will not escape out of their hands but you will be seized by the king of Babylon and you will cause this city [Jerusalem] to be burned with fire.
Jeremiah,38,24,Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah Let no man know of this conversation and you will not die.
Jeremiah,38,25,But if the princes hear that I have talked with you and they come to you and say Tell us what you said to the king and what he said to you; hide it not from us and we will not put you to death
Jeremiah,38,26,Then you shall say to them I was presenting to the king my humble plea that he would not send me back to Jonathan's house to die there.
Jeremiah,38,27,Then came all the princes to Jeremiah and asked him [just what King Zedekiah had anticipated they would ask] and he told them all that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him for what the conversation [with the king] had been was not discovered.
Jeremiah,38,28,So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken [by the Chaldeans].
Jeremiah,39,1,IN THE ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah in the tenth month Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it.
Jeremiah,39,2,And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah in the fourth month on the ninth day of the month they broke into the city.
Jeremiah,39,3,[ When Jerusalem was taken] all the princes of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer Samgar-nebo Sarsechim [the Rabsaris] a chief of the eunuchs and Nergal-sharezer [II the Rabmag] a chief of the magicians with all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah,39,4,And when Zedekiah king of Judah and all the men of war saw them they fled and went forth out of the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls and [the king] went out toward the Arabah (the Jordan Valley).
Jeremiah,39,5,But the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And when they had taken him they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the [Syrian] land of Hamath where he pronounced sentence upon him.
Jeremiah,39,6,Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes; also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.
Jeremiah,39,7,Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes and bound him with shackles to take him to Babylon.
Jeremiah,39,8,And the Chaldeans burned the king's house and the houses of the people and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,39,9,Then Nebuzaradan the [chief executioner and] captain of the guard carried away captive to Babylon the rest of the people who remained in the city along with those who deserted to him and the remainder of the [so-called better class of] people who were left.
Jeremiah,39,10,But Nebuzaradan the [Babylonian] captain of the guard left in the land of Judah some of the poor of the people who had nothing giving them vineyards and fields at the same time.
Jeremiah,39,11,Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard saying
Jeremiah,39,12,Take him and look after him well; do him no harm but deal with him as he may ask of you.
Jeremiah,39,13,So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard Nebushasban [the Rabsaris] a chief of the eunuchs Nergal-sharezer [II the Rabmag] a chief of the magicians and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon
Jeremiah,39,14,Sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard and entrusted him to Gedaliah [a prominent man whose father had once saved the prophet's life] son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan that he should take him home [with him to Mizpah]. So Jeremiah was released and dwelt among the people.
Jeremiah,39,15,Now the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah while he was [still] shut up in the court of the guard saying
Jeremiah,39,16,Go and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will bring to pass My words against this city for evil and not for good; and they will be accomplished before you on that day.
Jeremiah,39,17,But I will deliver you [Ebed-melech] on that day says the Lord and you will not be given into the hands of the men of whom you are afraid.
Jeremiah,39,18,For I will surely deliver you; and you will not fall by the sword but your life will be [as your only booty and] as a reward of battle to you because you have put your trust in Me says the Lord.
Jeremiah,40,1,THE WORD that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah when he had taken him bound in chains among all who were carried away captive from Jerusalem and Judah who were taken as exiles to Babylon.
Jeremiah,40,2,And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him The Lord your God pronounced evil upon this place.
Jeremiah,40,3,Now the Lord has brought it about and has done as He said: [It is] because you [of Judah] have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed His voice therefore this thing has come upon you.
Jeremiah,40,4,Now see I am freeing you today [Jeremiah] from the chains upon your hands. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon come and I will keep an eye on you and look after you well. But if it seems bad to you to come with me to Babylon then do not do it. Behold all the land is before you; wherever it seems good right and convenient for you to go go there.
Jeremiah,40,5,While [Jeremiah] was hesitating [the captain of the guard] said Go back then to Gedaliah son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan whom the king of Babylon made governor over the cities of Judah and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right for you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present and let him go.
Jeremiah,40,6,Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and dwelt with him among the people who were left in the land.
Jeremiah,40,7,Now when all the captains of the forces that were in the open country [of Judah] and their men heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah son of Ahikam governor in the land [of Judah] and had committed to him men women and children those of the poorest of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon
Jeremiah,40,8,They went to Gedaliah at Mizpah--Ishmael son of Nethaniah Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the sons of Ephai the Netophathite and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite they and their men.
Jeremiah,40,9,And Gedaliah son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and their men saying Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans; dwell in [this] land and serve the king of Babylon and it shall be well with you.
Jeremiah,40,10,As for me I will dwell at Mizpah to stand [for you] before the Chaldeans who come to us [ministering to them and looking after the king's interests]; but as for you gather the juice [of the grape] summer fruits and oil and store them in your utensils [chosen for such purposes] and dwell in your cities that you have seized.
Jeremiah,40,11,Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab and among the people of Ammon and in Edom and who were in all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had set over them [as governor] Gedaliah son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan
Jeremiah,40,12,Then all the Jews returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came to the land of Judah to Gedaliah at Mizpah and gathered a great abundance of juice [of the grape] and summer fruits.
Jeremiah,40,13,Moreover Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
Jeremiah,40,14,And said to him Do you know that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life? But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them.
Jeremiah,40,15,Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly saying Let me go I pray you and I will slay Ishmael son of Nethaniah and no man will know it. Why should he slay you and cause all the Jews who are gathered to you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah to perish?
Jeremiah,40,16,But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah You shall not do this thing for you speak falsely of Ishmael.
Jeremiah,41,1,NOW IN the seventh month [of that year] Ishmael son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama of the royal descendants and one of the princes of the king came [at the instigation of the Ammonites] with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam in Mizpah. As they were eating a meal together there in Mizpah
Jeremiah,41,2,Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him arose and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword and killed him the one whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
Jeremiah,41,3,Ishmael [manipulated by the Ammonites] also slew all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah and the Chaldean soldiers who were found there.
Jeremiah,41,4,And the second day after the slaying of Gedaliah before anyone knew about it
Jeremiah,41,5,There came eighty men from Shechem from Shiloh and from Samaria having their beards shaved off and their clothes torn and having cut themselves bringing cereal offerings and incense going up [to Jerusalem] to present them in the house of the Lord.
Jeremiah,41,6,And Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them weeping all the way as he went. As he met them he said to them Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.
Jeremiah,41,7,And when they came into the city Ishmael son of Nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst of the [city] cistern pit--he and the men with him.
Jeremiah,41,8,But ten men were among them who said to Ishmael Do not kill us! For we have stores hidden in the field--of wheat and barley and oil and honey. So he refrained and did not slay them with their brethren.
Jeremiah,41,9,Now the cistern pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain in addition to Gedaliah was the one which Asa the king [of Judah] had once made for fear of Baasha king of Israel [should Baasha lay siege to Mizpah]. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were slain.
Jeremiah,41,10,Then Ishmael carried away captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah--even the king's daughters and all the people who remained in Mizpah whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to cross over [the Jordan] to the Ammonites.
Jeremiah,41,11,But when Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done
Jeremiah,41,12,They took all their men and went to fight with Ishmael son of Nethaniah and found him by the great pool that is in Gibeon.
Jeremiah,41,13,Now when all the people who were [captives] with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him they were glad.
Jeremiah,41,14,So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back and went to Johanan son of Kareah.
Jeremiah,41,15,But Ishmael son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the Ammonites.
Jeremiah,41,16,Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him took from Mizpah all the remainder of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after he had slain Gedaliah son of Ahikam: [they were] the soldiers the women the children and the eunuchs whom [Johanan] had brought back from Gibeon.
Jeremiah,41,17,And they departed and stayed at the lodging place of Chimham which is near Bethlehem [intending] to go to Egypt
Jeremiah,41,18,Because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah son of Ahikam whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land [and whose death the king could avenge without much discrimination].
Jeremiah,42,1,THEN ALL the captains of the forces and Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah [Azariah] son of Hoshaiah and all the people from the least even to the greatest came near
Jeremiah,42,2,And said to Jeremiah the prophet We beseech you that you will let our supplication be presented before you and that you will pray to the Lord your God for us even for all this remnant [of the people of Judah]; for whereas we were once many there are but a few of us left as you see with your [own] eyes.
Jeremiah,42,3,[Pray] that the Lord your God may show us the way in which we should walk and the thing that we should do.
Jeremiah,42,4,Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them I have heard you. Behold I will pray to the Lord your God according to your words; and it will be that whatever thing the Lord will answer you I will declare it to you; I will keep nothing back from you.
Jeremiah,42,5,Then they said to Jeremiah May the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we fail to do according to all the things that the Lord your God sends you to tell us.
Jeremiah,42,6,Whether it is good or evil we will obey the voice of the Lord our God to Whom we are sending you [to inquire] that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the Lord our God.
Jeremiah,42,7,And after ten days the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,42,8,Then he called Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him and all the people from the least even to the greatest
Jeremiah,42,9,And said to them Thus says the Lord the God of Israel to Whom you sent me to present your supplication before Him:
Jeremiah,42,10,If you will remain in this land then I will build you up and not pull you down and I will plant you and not pull you up; for I will relent and comfort and ease Myself concerning the evil that [in chastisement] I have done to you [and I will substitute mercy and loving-kindness for judgment].
Jeremiah,42,11,Be not afraid of the king of Babylon of whom you are fearful [with the profound and reverent dread inspired by deity]; be not afraid of him says the Lord for [he is a mere man while I am the all-wise all-powerful and ever-present God] I [the Lord] am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand.
Jeremiah,42,12,And I will grant mercy to you that he may have mercy on you and permit you to remain in your own land.
Jeremiah,42,13,But if you say We will not dwell in this land and so disobey the voice of the Lord your God
Jeremiah,42,14,Saying No but we will go to the land of Egypt where we will not see war or hear the sound of the trumpet or be hungry for bread and we will dwell there
Jeremiah,42,15,Then hear the word of the Lord O remnant of Judah. Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: If you are fully determined to go to Egypt and you do go to dwell there temporarily
Jeremiah,42,16,Then the sword which you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow close after you to Egypt and in it and there you shall die.
Jeremiah,42,17,So will it be with all the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to dwell there temporarily; they will die by the sword by famine and by pestilence; none of them will remain or survive the evil that I will bring upon them.
Jeremiah,42,18,For thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: As My anger and My wrath have been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem so shall My wrath be poured forth upon you when you enter Egypt. You shall be a detested thing an astonishment and horror a curse a thing lightly esteemed and a taunt and a reproach; you shall see this place no more.
Jeremiah,42,19,The Lord has said to you O remnant of Judah Do not go to Egypt. Know for a certainty that I [Jeremiah] have warned and testified to you this day
Jeremiah,42,20,That you have dealt deceitfully against your own lives; for you sent me [Jeremiah] to the Lord your God saying Pray for us to the Lord our God; and whatever the Lord our God says declare it to us and we will do it.
Jeremiah,42,21,And I have this day declared it to you but you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God in anything that He sent me to tell you.
Jeremiah,42,22,Now therefore know for a certainty that you shall die by the sword by famine and by pestilence in the place [Egypt] where you desire to go to dwell temporarily.
Jeremiah,43,1,AND WHEN Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all these words of the Lord their God--everything for which the Lord their God had sent him to them--
Jeremiah,43,2,Then Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the proud and insolent men said to Jeremiah You are not telling the truth! The Lord our God has not sent you to say Do not go into Egypt to dwell there temporarily.
Jeremiah,43,3,But Baruch son of Neriah is setting you against us to deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans so they may put us to death or carry us away captive to Babylon.
Jeremiah,43,4,So Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces and all the people did not obey the voice of the Lord to remain in the land of Judah.
Jeremiah,43,5,But Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of Judah who had returned to dwell in the land of Judah from all the nations to which they had been driven--
Jeremiah,43,6,Even men women and children the king's daughters and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan; also he took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah.
Jeremiah,43,7,So they came into the land of Egypt--for they obeyed not the voice of the Lord. And they came to Tahpanhes.
Jeremiah,43,8,Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes saying
Jeremiah,43,9,Take large stones in your hands and hide them in the mortar in the pavement of brick which is at the entrance of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes in the sight of the men of Judah;
Jeremiah,43,10,And say to them Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon My servant [because he works for Me] and I [through him] will set his throne upon these stones that I have hidden; and his [glittering royal] canopy will be stretched over them.
Jeremiah,43,11,And he shall come and smite the land of Egypt giving such as are [destined] for death to death and such as are [destined] for captivity to captivity and such as are [destined] for the sword to the sword.
Jeremiah,43,12,And I [through him] will kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt; and he will burn [the houses] and carry [the people] away captive. And he will array himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd puts on his garment [as he wills and when he chooses]; and he will go away from there in peace.
Jeremiah,43,13,[Nebuchadrezzar] shall break also the images and obelisks of Heliopolis [called On or Beth-shemesh--house of the sun] in the land of Egypt and the temples of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.
Jeremiah,44,1,THE WORD that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who were dwelling in the land of Egypt--at Migdol at Tahpanhes at Memphis--and in the country of Pathros saying
Jeremiah,44,2,Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: You have seen all the evil that I brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah; and see this day they are a desolation and no man dwells in them
Jeremiah,44,3,Because of the wickedness which they committed provoking Me to anger in that they went to burn incense to serve other gods that they did not know--neither they nor you nor your fathers.
Jeremiah,44,4,Yet I sent to you all My servants the prophets earnestly and persistently saying Oh do not do this loathsome and shamefully vile thing that I hate and abhor!
Jeremiah,44,5,But they did not listen and obey or submit and consent to turn from their wickedness and burn no incense to other gods.
Jeremiah,44,6,Therefore My wrath and My anger were poured out and were kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they became wasted and desolate as it is this day.
Jeremiah,44,7,Therefore now thus says the Lord God of hosts the God of Israel: Why do you commit this great evil against yourselves that will cut off from you man and woman infant and weaned child out of Judah to leave yourselves with none remaining?
Jeremiah,44,8,Why do you provoke Me to anger with the works (idols) of your own hands burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you [of your own accord] have come to dwell temporarily that you might be cut off and become a curse and a reproach (an object of reviling and taunts) among all the nations of the earth?
Jeremiah,44,9,Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers the wickedness of the kings of Judah the wickedness of their wives [who clung to their foreign gods] your own wickedness and the wickedness of your wives [who imitated their queens] which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
Jeremiah,44,10,They are not humbled (contrite penitent and bruised for their guilt and iniquities) even to this day neither have they feared and revered [Me] nor walked in My law or My statutes which I set before you and before your fathers.
Jeremiah,44,11,Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will set My face against you for evil--even to cut off all Judah [from the land].
Jeremiah,44,12,And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to come into the land of Egypt to dwell here temporarily [fleeing to Egypt instead of surrendering to the Chaldeans as directed by the Lord through Jeremiah] and they will all be consumed and will fall in the land of Egypt; they will be consumed by the sword and by famine. From the least even to the greatest they shall die by the sword and by famine. And they will be a detestable thing an astonishment a curse and a reproach (an object of horror reviling and taunts).
Jeremiah,44,13,For I will punish all the inhabitants of the land of Egypt as I have punished Jerusalem--by the sword by famine and by pestilence--
Jeremiah,44,14,So that none of the remnant of Judah who have come to the land of Egypt to dwell temporarily shall escape or survive or return to the land of Judah to which they desire and lift up their souls to return to dwell there; for none shall return except [a few] fugitives.
Jeremiah,44,15,Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods and all the women who stood by--a great assembly--even all the people who dwelt in Pathros in the land of Egypt answered Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,44,16,As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord we will not listen to or obey you.
Jeremiah,44,17,But we will certainly perform every word of the vows we have made: to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her as we have done--we and our fathers our kings and our princes--in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food and were well off and prosperous and saw no evil.
Jeremiah,44,18,But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.
Jeremiah,44,19,[And the wives said] When we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her did we make cakes [in the shape of a star] to represent and honor her and pour out drink offerings to her without [the knowledge and approval of] our husbands?
Jeremiah,44,20,Then Jeremiah said to all the people--to the men and to the women and to all the people who had given him that answer--
Jeremiah,44,21,The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem--you and your fathers your kings and your princes and the people of the land--did not the Lord [earnestly] remember [your idolatrous wickedness] and did it not come into His mind?
Jeremiah,44,22,The Lord could no longer endure the evil of your doings and the abominations which you have committed; because of them therefore has your land become a desolation and an [astonishing] waste and a curse without inhabitants as it is this day.
Jeremiah,44,23,Because you have burned incense [to idols] and because you have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord or walked in His law and in His statutes and in His testimonies therefore this evil has fallen upon you as it is this day.
Jeremiah,44,24,Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people including all the women Hear the word of the Lord all you of Judah who are in the land of Egypt
Jeremiah,44,25,Thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: You and your wives have both declared with your mouths and fulfilled it with your hands saying We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her. [Surely] then confirm your vows and [surely] perform your vows! [If you will defy all My warnings to you then by all means go ahead!]
Jeremiah,44,26,Therefore hear the word of the Lord all [you people of] Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold I have sworn by My great name says the Lord that My name shall no more be invoked by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt saying As the Lord God lives.
Jeremiah,44,27,Behold I am watching over them for evil and not for good; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine until there is an end of them and they are all destroyed.
Jeremiah,44,28,Yet a small number who escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt to the land of Judah; and all the remnant of Judah who came to the land of Egypt to dwell temporarily shall know whose words shall stand Mine or theirs.
Jeremiah,44,29,And this will be the sign to you says the Lord that I will punish you in this place so that you may know that My words will surely stand against you for evil.
Jeremiah,44,30,Thus says the Lord: Behold I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of his enemies and into the hands of those who seek his life just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon who was his enemy and was seeking his life.
Jeremiah,45,1,THE WORD that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch son of Neriah when he had written these words in a book at the dictation of Jeremiah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah saying
Jeremiah,45,2,Thus says the Lord the God of Israel unto you O Baruch:
Jeremiah,45,3,You said Woe is me now! For the Lord has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning and sighing and I find no rest.

Jeremiah,46,3,Put in order the buckler and shield and advance for battle!
Jeremiah,46,4,Harness the horses and mount you horsemen! Stand forth with your helmets! Polish the spears put on the coats of mail!

Jeremiah,46,7,Who is this that rises up like the Nile [River] like the branches [of the Nile in the delta of Egypt] whose waters surge and toss?
Jeremiah,46,8,Egypt rises like the Nile like the rivers whose waters surge and toss. She says I will rise I will cover the earth; I will destroy cities and their inhabitants.
Jeremiah,46,9,Go up you horses and drive furiously you chariots! Let the warriors go forth--men of Ethiopia and Put who handle the shield men of Lud who are skilled in handling and stringing the bow.
Jeremiah,46,10,But that day is a day of the Lord the Lord of hosts--a day of vengeance that He may avenge Himself on His adversaries. And the sword shall devour and it shall be satiated and shall drink its fill of their blood; for the Lord the Lord of hosts has a sacrifice [like that of a great sin offering] in the north country by the river Euphrates.
Jeremiah,46,11,Go up into Gilead and take [healing] balm O Virgin Daughter of Egypt! In vain do you use many medicines; for you there is no healing or remedy.

Jeremiah,46,20,Egypt is a very fair heifer [like Apis the bull-god to which the country is so to speak espoused] but destruction [a gadfly] is coming--out of the north it is coming [against her]!
Jeremiah,46,21,Also her hired troops in the midst of her are like fatted calves [in the stall] for they also are turned back and are fleeing together; they do not stand because the day of their calamity is coming upon them the time of their visitation (their inspection and punishment).
Jeremiah,46,22,The sound [of Egypt fleeing from the enemy] is like the rustling of an escaping serpent for her foes advance with a mighty army and come against her with axes like those who fell trees and cut wood.

Jeremiah,46,26,And I will deliver them into the hands of those who seek their lives and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hands of his servants. Afterward [Egypt] will be inhabited as in the days of old says the Lord.
Jeremiah,46,27,But fear not O My servant Jacob and be not dismayed O Israel. For behold I will save you from afar and your offspring from the land of their exile; and Jacob will return and be quiet and at ease and none will make him afraid.

Jeremiah,48,2,The glory of Moab is no more; in Heshbon [a border town between Reuben and Gad east of the Jordan River] they planned evil against her saying Come let us cut her off from being a nation. You also O [town of] Madmen shall be brought to silence; the sword shall pursue you.

Jeremiah,48,10,Cursed be he who does the work of the Lord negligently [with slackness deceitfully]; and cursed be he who keeps back his sword from blood [in executing judgment pronounced by the Lord].
Jeremiah,48,11,Moab has been at ease from his youth and he has settled on his lees [like wine] and has not been drawn off from one vessel to another neither has he gone into exile. Therefore his taste remains in him and his scent has not changed.
Jeremiah,48,12,Therefore behold the days are coming says the Lord when I shall send to [Moab] tilters who shall tilt him up and shall empty his vessels and break his bottles (earthenware) in pieces.

Jeremiah,48,26,Make him drunk for he has magnified himself against the Lord [by resisting Reuben's occupation of the land the Lord had assigned him]. Moab also shall splash in his vomit and he too shall be held in derision.

Jeremiah,48,31,Therefore I will wail over Moab and I will cry out over the whole of Moab. Over the men of Kir-heres (Kir-hareseth) there will be sighing and mourning.
Jeremiah,48,32,O vines of Sibmah I weep for you more than the weeping of Jazer [over its ruins and wasted vineyards]. Your tendrils [of influence] have gone over the sea reaching even to Jazer. The destroyer has fallen upon your summer fruit harvest and your [season's] crop of grapes.
Jeremiah,48,33,Joy and gladness are taken away from the fruitful orchards and fields and from the land of Moab. And I have made the juice [of the grape] to fail from what is pressed out in the vats; no one treads [the grapes] with shouting. Their shouting is no shouting [of joy but is a battle cry].
Jeremiah,48,34,From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh even to Jahaz have they uttered their voice from Zoar even to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah [like a three-year-old heifer] for even the waters of Nimrim have become desolations.

Jeremiah,48,45,In the shadow of Heshbon the fugitives stand powerless (stopped in their tracks helpless and without strength) for a fire has gone forth from Heshbon a flame from the midst of Sihon; it has destroyed the corner of Moab and the crowns of the heads of the ones in tumult [the proud Moabites].
Jeremiah,48,46,Woe to you O Moab! The people of [the god] Chemosh are undone; for your sons are taken away captive and your daughters into captivity.
Jeremiah,48,47,Yet will I reverse the captivity and restore the fortunes of Moab in the latter days says the Lord. Thus far is the judgment on Moab.
Jeremiah,49,1,CONCERNING and against the Ammonites: Thus says the Lord: Has Israel no sons [to return after their captivity and claim the territory of Gad east of the Jordan which the Ammonites have taken over]? Has [Israel's Gad] no heir? Why then has Milcom [the god the Ammonites call their king] dispossessed and inherited Gad and [why do] his people dwell in Gad's cities?
Jeremiah,49,2,Therefore behold the days are coming says the Lord when I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it [the high ground on which it stands] will become a desolate heap and its daughter [villages] will be burned with fire. Then will Israel dispossess those who dispossessed him says the Lord.
Jeremiah,49,3,Wail O Heshbon [in Moab just south of Ammon] for Ai [in Ammon] is laid waste! Cry out you daughter [villages] of Rabbah!

And I will appoint over him the one whom I choose. For who is like Me? And who will appoint for Me the time and prosecute Me for this proceeding? And what [earthly national] shepherd can stand before Me and defy Me?
Jeremiah,49,20,Therefore hear the plan of the Lord which He has made against Edom and His purposes which He has formed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall be dragged away [by Nebuchadnezzar] even the little ones of the flock; surely He shall make their habitation desolate because of them and their fold shocked at their fate.

Jeremiah,52,18,The pots [for carrying away ashes] also and the shovels and the snuffers and the bowls and the spoons and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service they took away.
Jeremiah,52,19,Also the small bowls and the firepans and the basins and the pots and the lampstands and the incense cups and the bowls for the drink offerings--whatever was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold and whatever was of silver as silver.
Jeremiah,52,20,The two pillars one Sea or huge laver and twelve bronze bulls or oxen under the Sea which King Solomon had made in the house of the Lord--the bronze of all these things was beyond weighing.
Jeremiah,52,21,Concerning the pillars the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits (twenty-seven feet) and an ornamental molding of twelve cubits (eighteen feet) went around its circumference; it was four fingers thick and it [the pillar] was hollow.
Jeremiah,52,22,An upper part or capital of bronze was on top of it. The height of one capital was five cubits (seven and one-half feet) with a network and pomegranates around it all of bronze. The second pillar also with its pomegranates was similar to these.
Jeremiah,52,23,And there were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; and all the pomegranates upon the network were a hundred round about.
Jeremiah,52,24,And the captain of the guard took [as prisoners] Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door.
Jeremiah,52,25,He took also out of the city a court officer who had been overseer of the soldiers and seven men of them who were next to the king [as advisers] and saw his face who were found in the city and the scribe of the prince or captain of the army who mustered the people of the land and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city.
Jeremiah,52,26,And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.

Lamentations,1,1,HOW SOLITARY and lonely sits the city [Jerusalem] that was [once] full of people! How like a widow has she become! She who was great among the nations and princess among the provinces has become a tributary [in servitude]!
Lamentations,1,2,She weeps bitterly in the night and her tears are [constantly] on her cheeks. Among all her lovers (allies) she has no one to comfort her. All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they have become her enemies.
Lamentations,1,3,Judah has gone into exile [to escape] from the affliction and laborious servitude [of the homeland]. She dwells among the [heathen] nations but she finds no rest; all her persecutors overtook her amid the [dire] straits [of her distress].
Lamentations,1,4,The roads to Zion mourn because no one comes to the solemn assembly or the appointed feasts. All her gates are desolate her priests sigh and groan her maidens are grieved and vexed and she herself is in bitterness.
Lamentations,1,5,Her adversaries have become the head; her enemies prosper. For the Lord has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions; her young children have gone into captivity before the enemy.
Lamentations,1,6,From the Daughter of Zion all her beauty and majesty have departed. Her princes have become like harts that find no pasture; they have fled without strength before the pursuer.
Lamentations,1,7,Jerusalem [earnestly] remembers in the days of her affliction in the days of her [compulsory] wanderings and her bitterness all the pleasant and precious things that she had from the days of old. When her people fell into and at the hands of the adversary and there was none to help her the enemy [gloated as they] looked at her and they mocked at her desolations and downfall.
Lamentations,1,8,Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she has become an unclean thing and has been removed. All who honored her despise her because they have seen her nakedness; yes she herself groans and sighs and turns [her face] away.
Lamentations,1,9,Her filthiness was in and on her skirts; she did not [seriously and earnestly] consider her final end. Therefore she has come down [from throne to slavery] singularly and astonishingly; she has no comforter. O Lord [cries Jerusalem] look at my affliction for the enemy has magnified himself [in triumph]!
Lamentations,1,10,The adversary has spread out his hand upon all her precious and desirable things; for she has seen the nations enter her sanctuary [of the temple]--when You commanded that they should not even enter Your congregation [in the outer courts].
Lamentations,1,11,All her people groan and sigh seeking for bread; they have given their desirable and precious things [in exchange] for food to revive their strength and bring back life. See O Lord and consider how wretched and lightly esteemed how vile and abominable I have become!
Lamentations,1,12,Is it nothing to you all you who pass by? Look and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow which was dealt out to me with which the Lord has afflicted me in the day of His fierce anger!
Lamentations,1,13,From above He has sent fire into my bones and it prevailed against them. He has spread a net for my feet; He has turned me back. He has made me hopelessly miserable and faint all the day long.
Lamentations,1,14,The yoke of my transgressions is bound by His hand; they were twined together; they were set upon my neck. He has made my strength fail and [me to] stumble; the Lord has delivered me into the hands of those I am unable to resist or withstand.
Lamentations,1,15,The Lord has made of no account all my [Jerusalem's] mighty men in the midst of me; He has proclaimed a set time against me to crush my young men. The Lord has trodden as in a winepress the Virgin Daughter of Judah.
Lamentations,1,16,For these things I weep; my eyes overflow with tears because a comforter one who could refresh and restore my soul is far from me. My children are desolate and perishing for the enemy has prevailed.
Lamentations,1,17,Zion stretches forth her hands but there is no comforter for her. The Lord has commanded concerning and against Jacob that his neighbors should be his adversaries; Jerusalem has become a filthy thing among them [an object of contempt].
Lamentations,1,18,The Lord is righteous (just and in the right); for I have rebelled against His commandment (His word). Hear I pray you all you peoples and look at my sorrow and suffering; my maidens and my young men have gone into captivity.
Lamentations,1,19,I [Jerusalem] called to my lovers [allies] but they deceived me. My priests and my elders expired in the city while they sought food to save their lives.
Lamentations,1,20,Behold O Lord how distressed I am! My vital parts (emotions) are in tumult and are deeply disturbed; my heart cannot rest and is violently agitated within me for I have grievously rebelled. Outside the house the sword bereaves at home there is [famine pestilence] death!
Lamentations,1,21,[My foes] have heard that I [Jerusalem] sigh and groan that I have no comforter [in You]. All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad [O Lord] that You have done it. You will bring the day [of Judah's punishment] that you have foretold and proclaimed; [it involves also my foes' punishment] and they will become like me.
Lamentations,1,22,Let all their wickedness come before You; and deal with them as You have dealt with me because of all my transgressions; for my sighs and groans are many and my heart is faint.
Lamentations,2,1,HOW THE Lord has covered the Daughter of Zion with a cloud in His anger! He has cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty and splendor of Israel and has not [earnestly] remembered His footstool in the day of His anger!
Lamentations,2,2,The Lord has swallowed up all the country places and habitations of Jacob and has spared not nor pitied; He has demolished in His wrath the strongholds of the Daughter of Judah. He has cast down to the ground the kingdom and its rulers polluting them and depriving them of their sanctity.
Lamentations,2,3,He has broken off in His fierce anger every horn (means of defense) of Israel. He has drawn back His right hand from before the enemy. And He has burned amidst Jacob like a flaming fire consuming all around.
Lamentations,2,4,He has bent His bow like an enemy; He has stood with His right hand set like a foe and has slain all the delights and pride of the eye; on and in the tent of the Daughter of Zion He has poured out His wrath like fire.
Lamentations,2,5,The Lord has become like an enemy; He has destroyed Israel. He has destroyed all its palaces has laid in ruins its strongholds and has multiplied in the Daughter of Judah groaning and moaning and lamentation.
Lamentations,2,6,And He has violently broken down His temple like a booth or hedge of a garden; He has destroyed the place of His appointed assembly. The Lord has caused the solemn appointed feasts and Sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion and has spurned and rejected in the indignation of His anger the king and the priest.
Lamentations,2,7,The Lord has scorned rejected and cast off His altar; He has abhorred and disowned His sanctuary. He has given into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces [and high buildings]; they have raised a clamor in the house of the Lord as on a day of a solemn appointed feast.
Lamentations,2,8,The Lord purposed to lay in ruins the [city] wall of the Daughter of Zion. He marked it off by measuring line; He restrained not His hand from destroying. He made rampart and wall lament; they languished together.
Lamentations,2,9,Her gates have sunk into the ground; He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her princes are [exiled] among the nations; the law is no more; her prophets also obtain no vision from the Lord.
Lamentations,2,10,The elders of the Daughter of Zion sit on the ground keeping silent; they have cast dust on their heads they have girded themselves with sackcloth. The maidens of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground [says Jeremiah].
Lamentations,2,11,My eyes fail from weeping my emotions are deeply disturbed my heart is poured out upon the ground [in grief] because of the destruction of the daughter of my people because infants and nurslings faint in the streets of the city.
Lamentations,2,12,They keep crying to their mothers Where is corn and wine [food and drink]? as they faint like wounded men in the streets of the city as their lives ebb away on their mothers' bosom.
Lamentations,2,13,What [example of suffering in the past] is sufficient for me to remind you for your [comfort]? To what shall I liken you O Daughter of Jerusalem? With what shall I compare you that I may comfort you O Virgin Daughter of Zion? For your ruin is as measureless as the sea! Who can heal you?
Lamentations,2,14,Your prophets have predicted for you falsehood and delusion and foolish things; and they have not exposed your iniquity and guilt to avert your captivity [by causing you to repent]. But they have divined and declared to you false and deceptive prophecies worthless and misleading.
Lamentations,2,15,All who pass by clap their hands at you; they hiss and wag their heads at the Daughter of Jerusalem saying Is this the city which was called the perfection of beauty the joy of all the earth?
Lamentations,2,16,All your enemies have opened wide their mouths against you; they scornfully hiss and gnash their teeth. They cry We have swallowed her up! Certainly this is the day we have looked for; we have it we see it!
Lamentations,2,17,The Lord has done what He planned; He has carried out and finished His word which He threatened and decreed in the days of old. He has demolished without pity; He has made the enemy rejoice over you and has exalted the might of your foes.
Lamentations,2,18,The hearts [of the inhabitants of Jerusalem] cried to the Lord. [Then to the congregation I Jeremiah cried addressing the wall as its symbol] O wall of the Daughter of Zion let tears run down like a river day and night; give yourself no rest let not your eyes stop [shedding tears].
Lamentations,2,19,Arise [from your bed] cry out in the night at the beginning of the watches; pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord. Lift up your hands toward Him for the lives of your young children who faint from hunger at the head of every street.
Lamentations,2,20,Behold O Lord and consider [carefully] to whom You have done this. Should and shall women eat the fruit of their own bodies the children whom they have tended and swaddled with their hands? Should and shall priest and prophet be slain in the place set apart [for the worship] of the Lord?
Lamentations,2,21,The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets; my maidens and my young men have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of Your anger slaughtering them without pity.
Lamentations,2,22,You [Lord] called together as on an appointed feast day of solemn assembly my terrors (dangers) from every side. And there was not one in the day of God's wrath who escaped or survived; those I have nursed and brought up my enemy has destroyed.
Lamentations,3,1,I AM [Jeremiah] the man who has seen affliction under the rod of His wrath.
Lamentations,3,2,He has led me and brought me into darkness and not light.
Lamentations,3,3,Surely He has turned away from me; His hand is against me all the day.
Lamentations,3,4,My flesh and my skin has He worn out and made old; He has shattered my bones.
Lamentations,3,5,He has built up [siege mounds] against me and surrounded me with bitterness tribulation and anguish.
Lamentations,3,6,He has caused me to dwell in dark places like those long dead.
Lamentations,3,7,He walled me in so that I cannot get out; He has weighted down my chain.
Lamentations,3,8,Even when I cry and shout for help He shuts out my prayer.
Lamentations,3,9,He has enclosed my ways with hewn stone; He has made my paths crooked.
Lamentations,3,10,He is to me like a bear lying in wait and like a lion [hiding] in secret places.
Lamentations,3,11,He has turned me off my ways and pulled me in pieces; He has made me desolate.
Lamentations,3,12,He has bent His bow and set me as a mark for the arrow.
Lamentations,3,13,He has caused the arrows of His quiver to enter into my heart [the seat of my affections and desires].
Lamentations,3,14,I have become a derision to all my people and [the subject of] their singsong all the day.
Lamentations,3,15,He has filled me with bitterness; He has made me drink to excess and until drunken with wormwood [bitterness].
Lamentations,3,16,He has also broken my teeth with gravel (stones); He has covered me with ashes.
Lamentations,3,17,And You have bereaved my soul and cast it off far from peace; I have forgotten what good and happiness are.
Lamentations,3,18,And I say Perished is my strength and my expectation from the Lord.
Lamentations,3,19,[O Lord] remember [earnestly] my affliction and my misery my wandering and my outcast state the wormwood and the gall.
Lamentations,3,20,My soul has them continually in remembrance and is bowed down within me.
Lamentations,3,21,But this I recall and therefore have I hope and expectation:
Lamentations,3,22,It is because of the Lord's mercy and loving-kindness that we are not consumed because His [tender] compassions fail not.
Lamentations,3,23,They are new every morning; great and abundant is Your stability and faithfulness.
Lamentations,3,24,The Lord is my portion or share says my living being (my inner self); therefore will I hope in Him and wait expectantly for Him.
Lamentations,3,25,The Lord is good to those who wait hopefully and expectantly for Him to those who seek Him [inquire of and for Him and require Him by right of necessity and on the authority of God's word].
Lamentations,3,26,It is good that one should hope in and wait quietly for the salvation (the safety and ease) of the Lord.
Lamentations,3,27,It is good for a man that he should bear the yoke [of divine disciplinary dealings] in his youth.
Lamentations,3,28,Let him sit alone uncomplaining and keeping silent [in hope] because [God] has laid [the yoke] upon him [for his benefit].
Lamentations,3,29,Let him put his mouth in the dust [in abject recognition of his unworthiness]--there may yet be hope.
Lamentations,3,30,Let him give his cheek to the One Who smites him [even through His human agents]; let him be filled [full] with [men's] reproach [in meekness].
Lamentations,3,31,For the Lord will not cast off forever!
Lamentations,3,32,But though He causes grief yet will He be moved to compassion according to the multitude of His loving-kindness and tender mercy.
Lamentations,3,33,For He does not willingly and from His heart afflict or grieve the children of men.
Lamentations,3,34,To trample and crush underfoot all the prisoners of the earth
Lamentations,3,35,To turn aside and deprive a man of his rights before the face of the Most High or a superior [acting as God's representative]
Lamentations,3,36,To subvert a man in his cause--[of these things] the Lord does not approve.
Lamentations,3,37,Who is he who speaks and it comes to pass if the Lord has not authorized and commanded it?
Lamentations,3,38,Is it not out of the mouth of the Most High that evil and good both proceed [adversity and prosperity physical evil or misfortune and physical good or happiness]?
Lamentations,3,39,Why does a living man sigh [one who is still in this life's school of discipline]? [And why does] a man complain for the punishment of his sins?
Lamentations,3,40,Let us test and examine our ways and let us return to the Lord!
Lamentations,3,41,Let us lift up our hearts and our hands [and then with them mount up in prayer] to God in heaven:
Lamentations,3,42,We have transgressed and rebelled and You have not pardoned.
Lamentations,3,43,You have covered Yourself with wrath and pursued and afflicted us; You have slain without pity.
Lamentations,3,44,You have covered Yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through.
Lamentations,3,45,You have made us offscouring and refuse among the nations.
Lamentations,3,46,All our enemies have gaped at us and railed against us.
Lamentations,3,47,Fear and pitfall have come upon us devastation and destruction.
Lamentations,3,48,My eyes overflow with streams of tears because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.
Lamentations,3,49,My eyes overflow continually and will not cease
Lamentations,3,50,Until the Lord looks down and sees from heaven.
Lamentations,3,51,My eyes cause me grief at the fate of all the maidens [and the daughter-towns] of my city [Jerusalem].
Lamentations,3,52,I have been hunted down like a bird by those who were my enemies without cause.
Lamentations,3,53,They [thought they had] destroyed my life in the dungeon (pit) and cast a stone [over it] above me.
Lamentations,3,54,The waters ran down on my head; I said I am gone.
Lamentations,3,55,I called upon Your name O Lord out of the depths [of the mire] of the dungeon.
Lamentations,3,56,You heard my voice [then]: [Oh] hide not Your ear [now] at my prayer for relief.
Lamentations,3,57,You drew near on the day I called to You; You said Fear not.
Lamentations,3,58,O Lord You have pleaded the causes of my soul [You have managed my affairs and You have protected my person and my rights]; You have rescued and redeemed my life!
Lamentations,3,59,O Lord You have seen my wrong [done to me]; judge and maintain my cause.
Lamentations,3,60,You have seen all their vengeance all their devices against me.
Lamentations,3,61,You have heard their reproach and revilings O Lord and all their devices against me--
Lamentations,3,62,The lips and thoughts of my assailants are against me all day long.
Lamentations,3,63,Look at their sitting down and their rising up [their movements doings and secret counsels]; I am their singsong [the subject of their derision and merriment].
Lamentations,3,64,Render to them a recompense O Lord according to the work of their hands.
Lamentations,3,65,You will give them hardness and blindness of heart; Your curse will be upon them.
Lamentations,3,66,You will pursue and afflict them in anger and destroy them from under Your heavens O Lord.
Lamentations,4,1,HOW THE gold has become dim! How the most pure gold has changed! The hallowed stones [of the temple] are poured out at the head of every street.
Lamentations,4,2,The noble and precious sons of Zion [once] worth their weight in fine gold--how they are esteemed [merely] as earthen pots or pitchers the work of the hands of the potter!
Lamentations,4,3,Even the jackals draw out the breast they give suck to their young ones but the daughter of my people has become cruel like ostriches in the wilderness [that desert their young].
Lamentations,4,4,The tongue of the nursing babe cleaves to the roof of its mouth because of thirst; the young children beg for food but no one gives it to them.
Lamentations,4,5,Those who feasted on dainties are perishing in the streets; those who were brought up in purple lie cleaving to refuse and ash heaps.
Lamentations,4,6,For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom which was overthrown in a moment and no hands had come against her or been laid on her.
Lamentations,4,7,[In physical appearance] her princes were purer than snow they were whiter than milk; they were more ruddy in body than rubies or corals their shapely figures [suggested a carefully cut] sapphire.
Lamentations,4,8,[Prolonged famine has made] them look blacker than soot and darkness; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin clings to their bones; it is withered and it has become [dry] like a stick.
Lamentations,4,9,Those who are slain with the sword are more fortunate than those who are the victims of hunger [slain by the famine]; for they [the hungry] pine and ebb away stricken through for want of the fruits of the field.
Lamentations,4,10,The hands of [heretofore] compassionate women have boiled their own children; they were their food during the destruction of the daughter of my people [Judah].
Lamentations,4,11,The Lord has fulfilled His wrath; He has poured out His fierce anger and has kindled a fire in Zion that has consumed her foundations.
Lamentations,4,12,The kings of the earth did not believe nor did any of the inhabitants of the earth that the oppressor and enemy could enter the gates of Jerusalem.
Lamentations,4,13,[But this happened] because of the sins of her [false] prophets and the iniquities of her priests who shed the blood of the just and righteous in the midst of her.
Lamentations,4,14,[The false prophets and priests] wandered [staggering] in the streets as if blind; they had so polluted themselves with blood it was not [lawful] for men to touch their garments.
Lamentations,4,15,[People] cried to them Go away! Unclean! Depart! Depart! Touch not! When they fled away then they wandered [as fugitives]; men said among the nations They shall not stay here any longer.
Lamentations,4,16,The anger of the Lord has scattered [and divided them among the nations]; He will no longer look after them. They did not respect the persons of the priests; they did not favor the elders.
Lamentations,4,17,As for us our eyes yet failed and wasted away in looking for our worthless help. In our watching [on our watchtower] we have watched and waited expectantly for a nation [Egypt or some other one to come to our rescue] that could not save us.
Lamentations,4,18,[The missiles of the enemy] dog our steps so that we cannot go into our streets; our end is near our days are fulfilled--yes our end has come.
Lamentations,4,19,Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky; they pursued us on the mountains they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.
Lamentations,4,20,The breath of our nostrils the anointed of the Lord [our king] was taken in their snares--he of whom we said Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.
Lamentations,4,21,Rejoice and be glad O Daughter of Edom you who dwell in the land of Uz. But the cup [of the wine of God's wrath] also shall pass to you; you shall become drunk and make yourself naked.
Lamentations,4,22,The punishment of your iniquity will be accomplished and completed O Daughter of Zion; [the Lord] will no more carry you away or keep you in exile. But He will inspect and punish your iniquity and guilt O Daughter of Edom; He will uncover your sins.
Lamentations,5,1,O LORD [earnestly] remember what has come upon us! Look down and see our reproach (our national disgrace)!
Lamentations,5,2,Our inheritance has fallen over to strangers our houses to foreigners.
Lamentations,5,3,We have become orphans and fatherless; our mothers are like widows.
Lamentations,5,4,We have had to pay money to drink the water that belongs to us; our [own] wood is sold to us.
Lamentations,5,5,Our pursuers are upon our necks [like a yoke]; we are weary and are allowed no rest.
Lamentations,5,6,We have given the hand [as a pledge of fidelity and submission] to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians [merely] to get food to satisfy [our hunger].
Lamentations,5,7,Our fathers sinned and are no more and we have borne their iniquities.
Lamentations,5,8,Servants and slaves rule over us; there is none to deliver us out of their hands.
Lamentations,5,9,We get our bread at the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness [the wild Arabs who may attack if we venture into the fields to reap our harvests].
Lamentations,5,10,Our skin glows and is parched as from [the heat of] an oven because of the burning heat of [the fever of] famine.
Lamentations,5,11,They ravished the women in Zion the virgins in the cities of Judah.
Lamentations,5,12,They hung princes by their hands; the persons of elders were not respected.
Lamentations,5,13,Young men carried millstones and boys fell [staggering] under [burdens of] wood.
Lamentations,5,14,The elders have ceased from [congregating at] the city's gate the young men from their music.
Lamentations,5,15,Ceased is the joy of our hearts; our dancing has turned into mourning.
Lamentations,5,16,The crown has fallen from our head [our honor is brought to the dust]! Woe to us for we have sinned!
Lamentations,5,17,Because of this our hearts are faint and sick; because of these things our eyes are dim and see darkly.
Lamentations,5,18,As for Mount Zion which lies desolate the jackals prowl over it!
Lamentations,5,19,But You O Lord remain and reign forever; Your throne endures from generation to [all] generations.
Lamentations,5,20,Why do You forget us forever? Why do You forsake us so long?
Lamentations,5,21,Turn us to Yourself O Lord and we shall be turned and restored! Renew our days as of old!--
Lamentations,5,22,Or have You utterly rejected us? Or are You exceedingly angry with us [still]?
Ezekiel,1,1,NOW [when I was] in [my] thirtieth year in the fourth month in the fifth day of the month as I was in the midst of captivity beside the river Chebar [in Babylonia] the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.
Ezekiel,1,2,On the fifth day of the month which was in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity
Ezekiel,1,3,The word of the Lord came expressly to Ezekiel the priest the son of Buzi in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was there upon him.
Ezekiel,1,4,As I looked behold a stormy wind came out of the north and a great cloud with a fire enveloping it and flashing continually; a brightness was about it and out of the midst of it there seemed to glow amber metal out of the midst of the fire.
Ezekiel,1,5,And out of the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures [or cherubim]. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man
Ezekiel,1,6,But each one had four faces and each one had four wings.
Ezekiel,1,7,And their legs were straight legs and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot and they sparkled like burnished bronze.
Ezekiel,1,8,And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides. And the four of them had their faces and their wings thus:
Ezekiel,1,9,Their wings touched one another; they turned not when they went but went every one straight forward.
Ezekiel,1,10,As for the likeness of their faces they each had the face of a man [in front] and each had the face of a lion on the right side and the face of an ox on the left side; the four also had the face of an eagle [at the back of their heads].
Ezekiel,1,11,Such were their faces. And their wings were stretched out upward [each creature had four wings]; two wings of each one were touching the [adjacent] wing of the creatures on either side of it and [the remaining] two wings of each creature covered its body.
Ezekiel,1,12,And they went every one straight forward; wherever the spirit would go they went and they turned not when they went.
Ezekiel,1,13,In the midst of the living creatures there was what looked like burning coals of fire like torches moving to and fro among the living creatures; the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning.
Ezekiel,1,14,And the living creatures darted back and forth like a flash of lightning.
Ezekiel,1,15,Now as I was still looking at the living creatures I saw one wheel upon the ground beside each of the living creatures with its four faces.
Ezekiel,1,16,As to the appearance of the wheels and their construction: in appearance they gleamed like chrysolite; and the four were formed alike and their construction work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.
Ezekiel,1,17,When they went they went in one of their four directions without turning [for they were faced that way].
Ezekiel,1,18,As for their rims they were so high that they were dreadful and the four had their rims full of eyes round about.
Ezekiel,1,19,And when the living creatures went the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up.
Ezekiel,1,20,Wherever the spirit went the creatures went and the wheels rose along with them for the spirit or life of the [four living creatures acting as one] living creature was in the wheels.
Ezekiel,1,21,When those went these went; and when those stood these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up high beside them for the spirit or life of the [combined] living creature was in the wheels.
Ezekiel,1,22,Over the head of the [combined] living creature there was the likeness of a firmament looking like the terrible and awesome [dazzling of shining] crystal or ice stretched across the expanse of sky over their heads.
Ezekiel,1,23,And under the firmament their wings were stretched out straight one toward another. Every living creature had two wings which covered its body on this side and two which covered it on that side.
Ezekiel,1,24,And when they went I heard the sound of their wings like the noise of great waters like the voice of the Almighty the sound of tumult like the noise of a host. When they stood they let down their wings.
Ezekiel,1,25,And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads; when they stood they let down their wings.
Ezekiel,1,26,And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne in appearance like a sapphire stone and seated above the likeness of a throne was a likeness with the appearance of a Man.
Ezekiel,1,27,From what had the appearance of His waist upward I saw a lustre as it were glowing metal with the appearance of fire enclosed round about within it; and from the appearance of His waist downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire and there was brightness [of a halo] round about Him.
Ezekiel,1,28,Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it I fell upon my face and I heard a voice of One speaking.
Ezekiel,2,1,AND HE said to me [Ezekiel] Son of man stand upon your feet and I will speak to you.
Ezekiel,2,2,And the Spirit entered into me when He spoke to me and set me upon my feet and I heard Him speaking to me.
Ezekiel,2,3,And He said to me I send you son of man to the children of Israel two rebellious nations that have rebelled against Me. They and their fathers have transgressed against Me even to this very day.
Ezekiel,2,4,And the children are impudent and hard of heart. I send you to them and you shall say to them Thus says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,2,5,And they whether they will hear or refuse to hear--for they are a rebellious house--yet shall they know and realize that there has been a prophet among them.
Ezekiel,2,6,And you son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words; though briers and thorns are all around you and you dwell and sit among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel,2,7,And you shall speak My words to them whether they will hear or refuse to hear for they are most rebellious.
Ezekiel,2,8,As for you son of man hear what I say to you; be not rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you.
Ezekiel,2,9,And when I looked behold a hand was stretched out to me and behold a scroll of a book was in it.
Ezekiel,2,10,And He spread it before me and it was written within and on the back and written on it were words of lamentation and mourning and woe.
Ezekiel,3,1,HE SAID to me Son of man eat what you find [in this book]; eat this scroll; then go and speak to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,3,2,So I opened my mouth and He caused me to eat the scroll.
Ezekiel,3,3,And He said to me Son of man eat this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it. Then I ate it and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.
Ezekiel,3,4,And He said to me Son of man go get you to the house of Israel and speak to them with My words.
Ezekiel,3,5,For you are not sent to a people of a foreign speech and of a difficult language but to the house of Israel;
Ezekiel,3,6,Not to many peoples of foreign speech and of a hard language whose words you cannot understand. Surely had I sent you to such people they would have listened to you and heeded My words.
Ezekiel,3,7,But the house of Israel will not listen to you and obey you since they will not listen to Me and obey Me for all the house of Israel are impudent and stubborn of heart.
Ezekiel,3,8,Behold I have made your face strong and hard against their faces and your forehead strong and hard against their foreheads.
Ezekiel,3,9,Like an adamant harder than flint or a diamond point have I made your forehead; fear them not neither be dismayed at their looks for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel,3,10,Moreover He said to me Son of man all My words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart and hear with your ears.
Ezekiel,3,11,And go get you to the [Jewish] captives [in Babylon] to the children of your people and speak to them and tell them Thus says the Lord God whether they will hear or refuse to hear.
Ezekiel,3,12,Then the Spirit lifted me up and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing [saying] Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place [above the firmament].
Ezekiel,3,13,I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched and joined each one the other [its sister wing] and I heard the noise of the wheels beside them and the noise of a great rushing.
Ezekiel,3,14,So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away [in the vision] and I went in bitterness [of discouragement] in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of the Lord was strong upon me.
Ezekiel,3,15,Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib who sat and dwelt by the river of Chebar and I sat where they sat and remained there among them seven days overwhelmed with astonishment and silent.
Ezekiel,3,16,And at the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me:
Ezekiel,3,17,Son of man I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at My mouth and give them warning from Me.
Ezekiel,3,18,If I say to the wicked You shall surely die and you do not give him warning or speak to warn the wicked to turn from his wicked way to save his life the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at your hand.
Ezekiel,3,19,Yet if you warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness or from his wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but you have delivered yourself.
Ezekiel,3,20,Again if a righteous man turns from his righteousness (right doing and right standing with God) and some gift or providence which I lay before him he perverts into an occasion to sin and he commits iniquity he shall die; because you have not given him warning he shall die in his sin and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered but his blood will I require at your hand.
Ezekiel,3,21,Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man not to sin and he does not sin he shall surely live because he is warned; also you have delivered yourself from guilt.
Ezekiel,3,22,And the hand of the Lord was there upon me and He said to me Arise go forth into the plain and I will talk with you there.
Ezekiel,3,23,Then I arose and went forth into the plain and behold the glory of the Lord stood there like the glory I had seen by the river Chebar and I fell on my face.
Ezekiel,3,24,Then the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet; He spoke and said to me Go shut yourself up in your house.
Ezekiel,3,25,But you O son of man behold ropes will be put upon you and you will be bound with them and you cannot go out among people.
Ezekiel,3,26,And I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth so that you cannot talk and be a reprover of the people for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel,3,27,But when I speak with you I will open your mouth and you shall say to the people Thus says the Lord God; he who hears let him hear and he who refuses to hear let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel,4,1,AND YOU son of man take a tile and lay it before you and make upon it a drawing of a city even Jerusalem.
Ezekiel,4,2,And put siege works against it build a siege wall against it and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it and set battering rams against it round about.
Ezekiel,4,3,Moreover take a plate of iron and place it for an iron wall between you and the city; and set your face toward it and it shall be besieged and you shall press the siege against it. This is a sign to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,4,4,Then [bound as you are] lie upon your left [and north] side to bear symbolically the iniquity of the house of the ten tribes of Israel upon that side. According to the number of days that you shall lie upon it you shall bear their iniquity.
Ezekiel,4,5,For I have laid upon you the years of their iniquity according to the number of the days 390 days [representing 390 years]; so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,4,6,And when you have fulfilled the days for Israel lie again but on your right [and south] side and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have appointed you one day for each year.
Ezekiel,4,7,Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem and your arm shall be uncovered [ready for battle] and you shall prophesy against [the city].
Ezekiel,4,8,And behold I will lay bands upon you and you shall not turn yourself from one side to another till you have ended the days of your siege.
Ezekiel,4,9,Also take wheat barley beans lentils millet and spelt and put them into one vessel and make bread of them. According to the number of the days that you shall lie upon your side 390 days you shall eat of it.
Ezekiel,4,10,And the food you eat shall be by weight twenty shekels or a full half pound a day to be eaten at a fixed time each day.
Ezekiel,4,11,You shall drink water by measure also about one quart or the sixth part of a hin; you shall drink at a fixed time each day.
Ezekiel,4,12,And you shall eat your food as barley cakes and you shall bake it with human dung as fuel in the sight of the people.
Ezekiel,4,13,And the Lord said Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the nations to whom I will drive them.
Ezekiel,4,14,Then said I Ah Lord God! Behold I have never defiled myself. From my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dies of itself or is torn in pieces; neither did there ever come abominable flesh into my mouth.
Ezekiel,4,15,Then He said to me Behold I will let you use cow's dung instead of human dung and you shall prepare your food with it.
Ezekiel,4,16,Moreover He said to me Son of man behold I will break the staff of bread [by which life is supported] in Jerusalem; and they shall eat bread rationed by weight and with fearfulness and they shall drink water rationed by measure and with dismay (silent speechless grief caused by the impending starvation)
Ezekiel,4,17,In order that they may lack bread and water and look at one another in dismay and waste away [in their punishment] for their iniquity.
Ezekiel,5,1,AND YOU son of man [Ezekiel] take a sharp sword and use it as a barber's razor and shave your head and your beard. Then take balances for weighing and divide the hair into three parts.
Ezekiel,5,2,You shall burn one part with fire in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and you shall take a second part and strike with the sword round about it; and a third part you shall scatter to the wind and I will draw out a sword after them.
Ezekiel,5,3,You shall also take from these a small number of hairs and bind them in the skirts of your robe.
Ezekiel,5,4,And of these again take some hairs and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire; from there a fire shall come forth into all the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,5,5,Thus says the Lord God: This is Jerusalem; in the center of the nations I have set her and countries are round about her.
Ezekiel,5,6,And she has changed and rebelled against My ordinances more wickedly than the [heathen] nations and against My statutes more than the countries that are round about her; for [Israel] rejected My ordinances and as for My statutes they have not walked in them.
Ezekiel,5,7,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Because you were more turbulent and raged [against Me] more than the nations that are round about you and have not walked in My statutes neither have kept My ordinances nor have done according to the ordinances [concerning] the nations that are round about you;
Ezekiel,5,8,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold I even I am against you and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations.
Ezekiel,5,9,And because of all your abominations I will do in you that which I have not done and the like of which I will never do again.
Ezekiel,5,10,Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in your midst and sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments on you and all who are left of you I will scatter to all the winds.
Ezekiel,5,11,Therefore as I live says the Lord God surely because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations therefore will I also diminish you and withdraw My eye that it shall not spare you. And I also will have no pity.
Ezekiel,5,12,And a third of you shall die of pestilence and be consumed by famine in the midst of you; a third shall fall by the sword round about you; and I will scatter a third to all the winds and will draw out a sword after them.
Ezekiel,5,13,Thus shall My anger be spent and I will cause My wrath toward them to rest and I will be eased and comforted. And they shall know understand and realize that I the Lord have spoken in My zeal when I have accomplished My wrath upon them.
Ezekiel,5,14,Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about you and in the sight of all who pass by.
Ezekiel,5,15,So it shall be a reproach and a taunt a warning and a horror and an astonishment to the [heathen] nations around you when I shall execute judgments upon you in anger and in wrath and in furious chastisements and rebukes--I the Lord have spoken it.
Ezekiel,5,16,When I shall loose against them the evil arrows of hunger that are for destruction which I will send to destroy you then I will increase the famine upon you and will break your staff of bread.
Ezekiel,5,17,And I will send upon you hunger and wild beasts and they shall bereave you [of your loved ones]; and pestilence and blood shall pass through you and I will bring the sword upon you. I the Lord have spoken it.
Ezekiel,6,1,AND THE word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,6,2,Son of man set your face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them
Ezekiel,6,3,And say You mountains of Israel hear the word of the Lord God! Thus says the Lord God to the mountains and the hills to the river ravines and the valleys: Behold I even I will bring a sword upon you and I will destroy your high places [of idolatrous worship]
Ezekiel,6,4,And your altars shall be made desolate and your sun-pillars shall be broken in pieces and I will cast down your slain before your idols.
Ezekiel,6,5,And I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.
Ezekiel,6,6,In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste and the high places shall be made desolate that your altars may bear their guilt and be laid waste and made desolate your idols may be broken and destroyed your sun-images may be hewn down and your handiworks may be wiped away and blotted out.
Ezekiel,6,7,And the slain shall fall in the midst of you and you shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,6,8,Yet will I leave some of you alive. When you have some that shall escape the sword among the nations when you shall be scattered through the countries
Ezekiel,6,9,Then those of you who escape shall [earnestly] remember Me among the nations to which they shall be carried captive how that I have been broken by their lewdness and have Myself broken their wanton heart which has departed from Me and blinded their eyes which turn after their idols wantonly; and they shall be loathsome in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.
Ezekiel,6,10,And they shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord. I have not said in vain that I would bring this evil calamity [in punishment] upon them.
Ezekiel,6,11,Thus says the Lord God: Strike with your fist stamp with your foot and say Alas! over all the vile abominations of the house of Israel for which [Israel] shall fall by sword by famine and by pestilence.
Ezekiel,6,12,He who is far off shall die of the pestilence and he that is near shall fall by the sword and he who remains and is preserved shall die by the famine. Thus will I accomplish My wrath upon them.
Ezekiel,6,13,Then shall you know understand and realize that I am the Lord when their slain shall lie among their idols round about their altars upon every high hill on all the tops of the mountains under every green tree and under every thickly leafed oak the places where they were accustomed to offer sweet incense to all their idols.
Ezekiel,6,14,And I will stretch out My hand upon them and make the land desolate and waste yes more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblah [a Moabite city] throughout all their dwelling places; and they shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,7,1,MOREOVER THE word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,7,2,Also son of man thus says the Lord God to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.
Ezekiel,7,3,Now is the end upon you and I will send My anger upon you and will judge you according to your ways and will bring upon you retribution for all your abominations.
Ezekiel,7,4,And My eye will not spare you neither will I have pity; but I will bring recompense for your evil ways upon you while your abominations are in the midst of you [calling down punishment from a righteous God]; and you shall know (recognize understand and realize) that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,7,5,Thus says the Lord God: Behold an evil is coming [an evil so destructive and injurious so sudden and violent that it stands alone not as a succession but as] only one evil.
Ezekiel,7,6,An end has come! The end has come! [The end--after sleeping so long] awakes against you. See it has come!
Ezekiel,7,7,Your turn (your doom) has come upon you O inhabitant of the land; the time has come the day is near a day not of joyful shouting but a day of tumult upon the mountains.
Ezekiel,7,8,Now will I shortly pour out My wrath upon you and finish spending My anger against you and I will judge you according to your ways and will recompense you with punishment for all your abominations.
Ezekiel,7,9,And My eye will not spare nor will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways while your abominations are right in the midst of you. And you shall know understand and realize that it is I the Lord Who smites you.
Ezekiel,7,10,Behold the day! Behold it has come! Your doom has gone forth the rod has blossomed pride has budded.
Ezekiel,7,11,Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness; none of [Israel] shall remain none of their abundance none of their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them or wailing for them.
Ezekiel,7,12,The time has come the day draws near. Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn for wrath is upon all their multitude.
Ezekiel,7,13,For the seller shall not return to that which is sold even were they yet alive. For the vision [of punishment] is touching [Israel's] whole multitude; he shall not come back neither shall any strengthen himself whose life is in his iniquity.
Ezekiel,7,14,They have blown the trumpet and have made all ready but none goes to the battle for My wrath is upon all their multitude.
Ezekiel,7,15,The sword is without and pestilence and famine are within. He who is in the field shall die by the sword and him who is in the city shall famine and pestilence devour.
Ezekiel,7,16,But those of them that escape shall escape but shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys all of them moaning every one in his iniquity's [punishment].
Ezekiel,7,17,All hands shall be feeble and all knees shall be weak as water.
Ezekiel,7,18,They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth; horror and dismay shall cover them and shame shall be upon all faces and baldness upon all their heads [as evidence of grief].
Ezekiel,7,19,They shall cast their silver into the streets and their gold shall be [discarded] like an unclean thing or rubbish; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord; they shall not satisfy their animal cravings nor fill their stomachs with them for [wealth] has been the stumbling block of their iniquity.
Ezekiel,7,20,As for the beauty of gold for ornament they turned it to pride and made of it the images of their abominations (idols) and of their detestable things. Therefore I will make it to them as an unclean thing.
Ezekiel,7,21,And I will give it for plunder into the hands of strangers and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil and they shall profane it.
Ezekiel,7,22,Also I will turn My face from them and they shall profane My secret treasure [the temple]; and robbers shall enter into it and profane it.
Ezekiel,7,23,Prepare the chain [of imprisonment] for the land is full of bloodguiltiness [murders committed with pretended formalities of justice] and the city is full of violence.
Ezekiel,7,24,Therefore I will bring in the worst of the [heathen] nations who will take possession of the houses [of the people of Judah]; I will also silence their strongholds and put an end to their proud might and their holy places and those who sanctify them shall be profaned.
Ezekiel,7,25,Distress panic and destruction shall come and they [of Judah] shall seek peace and there shall be none.
Ezekiel,7,26,Calamity shall come upon calamity and rumor shall be upon rumor and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; and the law and instruction shall cease from the [distracted] priest and counsel from the [dismayed] elders.
Ezekiel,7,27,The king [of Judah] shall wear mourning and the prince shall clothe himself with garments of despair and desolation while the hands of the people of the land shall tremble [palsied by terror]; for I will do to them in accordance with their ways and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know recognize and realize that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,8,1,AND IN the sixth year [of the capitivity of King Jehoiachin] in the sixth month on the fifth day of the month as I sat in my house [a captive of the Babylonians] with the elders of Judah sitting before me the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me.
Ezekiel,8,2,Then I beheld and lo a likeness of a Man with the appearance of fire; from His waist downward He was like fire and from His waist upward He had the appearance of brightness like gleaming bronze.
Ezekiel,8,3,And He put forth the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heavens and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem to the entrance of the door of the inner [court] which faces toward the north where was the seat of the idol (image) of jealousy which provokes to jealousy.
Ezekiel,8,4,And behold there was the glory of the God of Israel [Who had loved and chosen them] like the vision I saw in the plain.
Ezekiel,8,5,Then He [the Spirit] said to me Son of man now lift up your eyes toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes toward the north and behold on the north of the altar gate was that idol (image) of jealousy in the entrance.
Ezekiel,8,6,Furthermore [the Spirit] said to me Son of man do you see what they are doing? The great abominations that the house of Israel is committing here to drive Me far from My sanctuary? But you shall again see greater abominations.
Ezekiel,8,7,And He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked behold there was a hole in the wall.
Ezekiel,8,8,Then He said to me Son of man dig now in the wall. And when I had dug in the wall behold there was a door.
Ezekiel,8,9,And He said to me Go in and see the wicked abominations that they do here.
Ezekiel,8,10,So I went in and saw there pictures of every form of creeping things and loathsome beasts and all the idols of the house of Israel painted round about on the wall.
Ezekiel,8,11,And there stood before these [pictures] seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan [the scribe] with every man his censer in his hand and a thick cloud of incense was going up [in prayer to these their gods].
Ezekiel,8,12,Then said He to me Son of man have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark every man in his [secret] chambers of [idol] pictures? For they say The Lord does not see us; the Lord has forsaken the land.
Ezekiel,8,13,He also said to me Yet again you shall see greater abominations which they are committing.
Ezekiel,8,14,Then He brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the Lord's house; and behold there sat women weeping for Tammuz [a Babylonian god who was supposed to die annually and subsequently be resurrected].
Ezekiel,8,15,Then said [the Spirit] to me Have you seen this O son of man? Yet again you shall see greater abominations that they are committing.
Ezekiel,8,16,And He brought me to the inner court of the Lord's house; and behold at the door of the temple of the Lord between the porch and the bronze altar were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east and they were bowing themselves toward the east and worshiping the sun.
Ezekiel,8,17,Then [the Spirit] said to me Have you seen this O son of man? Is it too slight a thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here that they must fill the land with violence and turn back afresh to provoke Me to anger? And behold they put the branch to their nose [actually before their mouths in superstitious worship]!
Ezekiel,8,18,Therefore I will deal in wrath; My eye will not spare nor will I have pity; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice yet will I not hear them.
Ezekiel,9,1,[THE SPIRIT] cried in my ears [in the vision] with a loud voice saying Cause those to draw near who have charge over the city [as executioners] every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.
Ezekiel,9,2,And behold six men came from the direction of the Upper Gate which faces north every man with his battle-ax in his hand; and one man among them was clothed in linen with a writer's ink bottle at his side. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
Ezekiel,9,3,And the glory of the God of Israel [the Shekinah cloud] had gone up from the cherubim upon which it had rested to [stand above] the threshold of the [Lord's] house. And [the Lord] called to the man clothed with linen who had the writer's ink bottle at his side.
Ezekiel,9,4,And the Lord said to him Go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in the midst of it.
Ezekiel,9,5,And to the others He said in my hearing Follow [the man with the ink bottle] through the city and smite; let not your eye spare neither have any pity.
Ezekiel,9,6,Slay outright the elderly the young man and the virgin the infant and the women; but do not touch or go near anyone on whom is the mark. Begin at My sanctuary. So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple [who did not have the Lord's mark on their foreheads].
Ezekiel,9,7,And He said to [the executioners] Defile the temple and fill its courts with the slain. Go forth! And they went forth and slew in the city.
Ezekiel,9,8,And while they were slaying them and I was left I fell upon my face and cried Ah Lord God! Will You destroy all that is left of Israel in Your pouring out of Your wrath and indignation upon Jerusalem?
Ezekiel,9,9,Then said He to me The iniquity and guilt of the house of Israel and Judah are exceedingly great; the land is full of blood and the city full of injustice and perverseness; for they say The Lord has forsaken the land; the Lord does not see [what we are doing].
Ezekiel,9,10,And as for Me My eye will not spare neither will I have pity but I will recompense their wicked doings upon their own heads.
Ezekiel,9,11,And behold the man clothed in linen who had the ink bottle at his side reported the matter saying I have done as You have commanded me.
Ezekiel,10,1,THEN I looked and behold in the firmament that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared above them something looking like a sapphire stone in form resembling a throne.
Ezekiel,10,2,And [the Lord] spoke to the man clothed in linen and said Go in among the whirling wheels under the cherubim; fill your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim and scatter them over the city. And he went in before my eyes.
Ezekiel,10,3,Now the cherubim stood on the south side of the house when the man went in; and the cloud [the Shekinah] filled the inner court.
Ezekiel,10,4,Then the glory of the Lord mounted up from the cherubim to stand over the threshold of the [Lord's] house; and the house was filled with the cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord's glory.
Ezekiel,10,5,And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks.
Ezekiel,10,6,And when He commanded the man clothed in linen saying Take fire from between the whirling wheels from between the cherubim [the man] went in and stood beside a wheel.
Ezekiel,10,7,And a cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen who took it and went out.
Ezekiel,10,8,And the cherubim seemed to have the form of a man's hand under their wings.
Ezekiel,10,9,And I looked and behold there were four wheels beside the cherubim one wheel beside one cherub and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like sparkling chrysolite.
Ezekiel,10,10,And as for their appearance they four looked alike as if a wheel had been within a wheel.
Ezekiel,10,11,When they went they went in any one of the four directions [in which their four individual faces were turned]; they did not turn as they went but to the place to which the front wheel faced the others followed; they turned not as they went.
Ezekiel,10,12,And their whole body their backs their hands and their wings and the wheels were full of eyes round about even the wheels that each had.
Ezekiel,10,13,As regarding the wheels [attached to them] they were called in my hearing the whirling wheels.
Ezekiel,10,14,And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub the second the face of a man the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle.
Ezekiel,10,15,And the cherubim mounted upward. This is the [same] living creature [the four regarded as one] that I saw by the river Chebar [in Babylonia].
Ezekiel,10,16,And when the cherubim went the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth the wheels did not turn from beside them.
Ezekiel,10,17,When those stood still these stood still; and when those mounted up these [the wheels] mounted up also for the spirit of life was in these [wheels].
Ezekiel,10,18,Then the glory of the Lord [the Shekinah cloud] went forth from above the threshold of the temple and stood over the cherubim.
Ezekiel,10,19,And the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight and they went forth with the wheels beside them; and they stood at the entrance of the East Gate of the house of the Lord and the glory of the God of Israel [the Shekinah cloud] was over them.
Ezekiel,10,20,This is the living creature [of four combined creatures] that I saw beneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar and I knew that they were cherubim.
Ezekiel,10,21,Each one had four faces and each one had four wings and what looked like the hands of a man was under their wings.
Ezekiel,10,22,And as for the likeness of their faces they were the same faces which I saw by the river Chebar with regard to their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.
Ezekiel,11,1,MOREOVER THE Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the East Gate of the Lord's house which faces east. And behold at the door of the gateway there were twenty-five men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah princes of the people.
Ezekiel,11,2,Then [the Spirit] said to me Son of man these are the men who devise iniquity and give wicked counsel in this city
Ezekiel,11,3,Who say [The time] is not near to build houses; this city is the boiling pot and we are the flesh.
Ezekiel,11,4,Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy O son of man!
Ezekiel,11,5,And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me and He said to me Speak. Say Thus says the Lord: This is what you thought O house of Israel for I know the things that come into your mind.
Ezekiel,11,6,You have multiplied your slain in this city and you have filled its streets with the slain.
Ezekiel,11,7,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Your slain whom you have laid in your midst; they are the flesh and this city is the boiling pot but you shall be brought forth out of the midst of it.
Ezekiel,11,8,You have feared the sword and I will bring a sword upon you says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,11,9,And I will bring you forth out of the midst of it and deliver you into the hands of foreigners and execute judgments among you.
Ezekiel,11,10,You shall fall by the sword; I will judge and punish you [before your neighbors] at the border or outside the land of Israel and you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,11,11,This city shall not be your boiling pot neither shall you be the flesh in the midst of it; I will judge you at the border or outside of Israel;
Ezekiel,11,12,And you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord; for you have not walked in My statutes nor executed My ordinances but have acted according to the ordinances of the nations around you.
Ezekiel,11,13,And while I was prophesying Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face and cried with a loud voice Ah Lord God! Will You make a complete end of the remnant of Israel?
Ezekiel,11,14,And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,11,15,Son of man your brethren even your kindred your fellow exiles and all the house of Israel all of them are they of whom the [present] inhabitants of Jerusalem have said They have gone far from the Lord [and from this land]; therefore this land is given to us for a possession.
Ezekiel,11,16,Therefore say Thus says the Lord God: Whereas I have removed [Israel] far off among the nations and whereas I have scattered them among the countries yet I have been to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries to which they have come.
Ezekiel,11,17,Therefore say Thus says the Lord God: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered and I will give back to you the land of Israel.
Ezekiel,11,18,And when they return there they shall take away from it all traces of its detestable things and all its abominations (sex impurities and heathen religious practices).
Ezekiel,11,19,And I will give them one heart [a new heart] and I will put a new spirit within them; and I will take the stony [unnaturally hardened] heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart of flesh [sensitive and responsive to the touch of their God]
Ezekiel,11,20,That they may walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances and do them. And they shall be My people and I will be their God.
Ezekiel,11,21,But as for those whose heart yearns for and goes after their detestable things and their loathsome abominations [associated with idolatry] I will repay their deeds upon their own heads says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,11,22,Then the cherubim lifted up their wings with the wheels which were beside them and the glory of the God of Israel [the Shekinah cloud] was over them.
Ezekiel,11,23,Then the glory of the Lord rose up from over the midst of the city and stood over the mountain which is on the east side of the city.
Ezekiel,11,24,And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen went up from me.
Ezekiel,11,25,And I told the exiles everything that the Lord had shown me.
Ezekiel,12,1,THE WORD of the Lord also came to me saying
Ezekiel,12,2,Son of man you dwell in the midst of the house of the rebellious who have eyes to see and see not who have ears to hear and hear not for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel,12,3,Therefore son of man prepare your belongings for removing and going into exile and move out by day in their sight; and you shall remove from your place to another place in their sight. It may be they will consider and perceive that they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel,12,4,And you shall bring forth your baggage by day in their sight as baggage for removing into exile; and you shall go forth yourself at evening in their sight as those who go forth into exile.
Ezekiel,12,5,Dig through the wall in their sight and carry the stuff out through the hole.
Ezekiel,12,6,In their sight you shall bear your baggage upon your shoulder and carry it forth in the dark; you shall cover your face so that you cannot see the land for I have set you as a sign for the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,12,7,And I did as I was commanded. I brought forth my baggage by day as baggage for exile and in the evening I dug through the wall with my own hands. I brought out my baggage in the dark carrying it upon my shoulder in their sight.
Ezekiel,12,8,And in the morning came the word of the Lord to me saying
Ezekiel,12,9,Son of man has not the house of Israel the rebellious house asked you what you are doing?
Ezekiel,12,10,Say to them Thus says the Lord God: This oracle or revelation concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are in it.
Ezekiel,12,11,Say I am your sign; as I have done so shall it be done to them; into banishment into captivity they shall go.
Ezekiel,12,12,And the prince who is in their midst shall lift up his luggage to his shoulder in the dark; then shall he go forth. They shall dig through the wall to carry out through the hole in it. He shall cover his face so that he will not see with his eyes the land.
Ezekiel,12,13,My net also will I spread over him and he shall be taken in My snare and I will bring him to Babylonia to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it though he shall die there.
Ezekiel,12,14,And I will scatter toward every wind all who are about him to help him even all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.
Ezekiel,12,15,And they shall know (recognize understand and realize) that I am the Lord when I shall scatter them among the nations and disperse them in the countries.
Ezekiel,12,16,But I will leave a few survivors who will escape the sword the famine and the pestilence that they may declare and confess all their [idolatrous] abominations among the nations to which they go and [thus God's punishment of them will be justified before everyone and] they shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,12,17,Moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,12,18,Son of man eat your bread with shaking and drink water with trembling and with fearfulness;
Ezekiel,12,19,And say to the people of the land Thus says the Lord God concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with fearfulness and drink water with dismay for their land will be stripped and plundered of all its fullness because of the violence of all those who dwell in it.
Ezekiel,12,20,And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste and the land shall be deserted and become a desolation; and you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,12,21,And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,12,22,Son of man what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel saying The days drag on and every vision comes to nothing and is not fulfilled?
Ezekiel,12,23,Tell them therefore Thus says the Lord God: I will put an end to this proverb and they shall use it no more as a proverb in Israel. But say to them The days are at hand and the fulfillment of every vision.
Ezekiel,12,24,For there shall be no more any false empty and fruitless vision or flattering divination in the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,12,25,For I am the Lord; I will speak and the word that I shall speak shall be performed (come to pass); it shall be no more delayed or prolonged for in your days O rebellious house I will speak the word and will perform it says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,12,26,Again the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,12,27,Son of man behold they of the house of Israel say The vision that [Ezekiel] sees is for many days to come and he prophesies of the times that are far off.
Ezekiel,12,28,Therefore say to them Thus says the Lord God: There shall none of My words be deferred any more but the word which I have spoken shall be performed says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,13,1,AND THE word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,13,2,Son of man prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy and say to those who prophesy out of their own mind and heart Hear the word of the Lord!
Ezekiel,13,3,Thus says the Lord God: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit [and things they have not seen] and have seen nothing!
Ezekiel,13,4,O Israel your prophets have been like foxes among ruins and in waste places.
Ezekiel,13,5,You have not gone up into the gaps or breeches nor built up the wall for the house of Israel that it might stand in the battle in the day of the Lord.
Ezekiel,13,6,They have seen falsehood and lying divination saying The Lord says; but the Lord has not sent them. Yet they have hoped and made men to hope for the confirmation of their word.
Ezekiel,13,7,Have you not seen a false vision and have you not spoken a lying divination when you say The Lord says although I have not spoken?
Ezekiel,13,8,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Because you have spoken empty false and delusive words and have seen lies therefore behold I am against you says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,13,9,And My hand shall be against the prophets who see empty false and delusive visions and who give lying prophecies. They shall not be in the secret council of My people nor shall they be recorded in the register of the house of Israel nor shall they enter into the land of Israel; and you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord God.
Ezekiel,13,10,Because even because they have seduced My people saying Peace when there is no peace and because when one builds a [flimsy] wall behold [these prophets] daub it over with whitewash
Ezekiel,13,11,Say to them who daub it with whitewash that it shall fall! There shall be a downpour of rain; and you O great hailstones shall fall and a violent wind shall tear apart [the whitewashed flimsy wall].
Ezekiel,13,12,Behold when the wall is fallen will you not be asked Where is the coating with which you [prophets] daubed it?
Ezekiel,13,13,Therefore thus says the Lord God: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in My wrath and there shall be an overwhelming rain in My anger and great hailstones in wrath to destroy [that wall].
Ezekiel,13,14,So will I break down the wall that you have daubed with whitewash and bring it down to the ground so that its foundations will be exposed; when it falls you will perish and be consumed in the midst of it. And you will know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,13,15,Thus will I accomplish My wrath upon the wall and upon those who have daubed it with whitewash and I will say to you The wall is no more neither are they who daubed it
Ezekiel,13,16,The [false] prophets of Israel who prophesied deceitfully about Jerusalem seeing visions of peace for her when there is no peace says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,13,17,And you son of man set your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy out of [the wishful thinking of] their own minds and hearts; prophesy against them
Ezekiel,13,18,And say Thus says the Lord God: Woe to the women who sew pillows to all armholes and fasten magic protective charms to all wrists and deceptive veils upon the heads of those of every stature to hunt and capture human lives! Will you snare the lives of My people to keep your own selves alive?
Ezekiel,13,19,You have profaned Me among My people [in payment] for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread slaying persons who should not die and giving [a guaranty of] life to those who should not live by your lying to My people who give heed to lies.
Ezekiel,13,20,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold I am against your pillows and charms and veils with which you snare human lives like birds and I will tear them from your arms and will let the lives you hunt go free the lives you are snaring like birds.
Ezekiel,13,21,Your [deceptive] veils also will I tear and deliver My people out of your hand and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted and snared. Then you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,13,22,Because with lies you have made the righteous sad and disheartened whom I have not made sad or disheartened and because you have encouraged and strengthened the hands of the wicked that he should not return from his wicked way and be saved [in that you falsely promised him life]
Ezekiel,13,23,Therefore you will no more see false visions or practice divinations and I will deliver My people out of your hand. Then you will know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,14,1,THEN CAME certain of the elders of Israel to me and sat before me.
Ezekiel,14,2,And the word of the Lord came to me:
Ezekiel,14,3,Son of man these men have set up their idols in their hearts and put the stumbling block of their iniquity and guilt before their faces; should I permit Myself to be inquired of at all by them?
Ezekiel,14,4,Therefore speak to them and say to them Thus says the Lord God: Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols [of self-will and unsubmissiveness] into his heart and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity [idols of silver and gold] before his face and yet comes to the prophet [to inquire of him] I the Lord will answer him answer him according to the multitude of his idols
Ezekiel,14,5,That I may lay hold of the house of Israel in the thoughts of their own mind and heart because they are all estranged from Me through their idols.
Ezekiel,14,6,Therefore say to the house of Israel Thus says the Lord God: Repent and turn away from your idols and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
Ezekiel,14,7,For anyone of the house of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel who separates himself from Me taking his idols into his heart and putting the stumbling block of his iniquity and guilt before his face and [yet] comes to the prophet to inquire for himself of Me I the Lord will answer him Myself!
Ezekiel,14,8,And I will set My face against that [false worshiper] and will make him a sign and a byword and I will cut him off from the midst of My people; and you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,14,9,[The prophet has not been granted permission to give an answer to the hypocritical inquirer] but if the prophet does give the man the answer he desires [thus allowing himself to be a party to the inquirer's sin] I the Lord will see to it that the prophet is deceived in his answer and I will stretch out My hand against him and will destroy him from the midst of My people Israel.
Ezekiel,14,10,And they both shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the iniquity of the [presumptuous] prophet shall be the same as the iniquity of the [hypocritical] inquirer
Ezekiel,14,11,That the house of Israel may go no more astray from Me neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions but that they may be My people and I may be their God says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,14,12,The word of the Lord came [again] to me saying
Ezekiel,14,13,Son of man when a land sins against Me by committing a trespass and I stretch out My hand against it and break its staff of bread and send famine upon it and cut off from it man and beast
Ezekiel,14,14,Even if these three men Noah Daniel and Job were in it they would save but their own lives by their righteousness (their uprightness and right standing with Me) says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,14,15,If I cause ferocious and evil wild animals to pass through the land and they ravage and bereave it and it becomes desolate so that no man may pass through because of the beasts;
Ezekiel,14,16,Though these three men were in it as I live says the Lord God they would deliver neither sons nor daughters; they themselves alone would be delivered but the land would be desolate (laid waste and deserted).
Ezekiel,14,17,Or if I bring a sword upon that land and say Sword go through the land so that I cut off man and beast from it
Ezekiel,14,18,Though these three men were in it as I live says the Lord God they would deliver neither sons nor daughters but they themselves alone would be delivered.
Ezekiel,14,19,Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out My wrath upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast
Ezekiel,14,20,Though Noah Daniel and Job were in it as I live says the Lord God they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would but deliver their own lives by their righteousness (their moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation).
Ezekiel,14,21,For thus says the Lord God: How much more when I send My four sore acts of judgment upon Jerusalem--the sword the famine the evil wild beasts and the pestilence--to cut off from it man and beast!
Ezekiel,14,22,And yet behold in it shall be left a remnant (an escaped portion) both sons and daughters. They shall be carried forth to you [in Babylon] and when you see their [ungodly] walk and their [wicked] doings you will be consoled for the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem even concerning all that I have brought upon it.
Ezekiel,14,23,And they shall console you when you see their evil ways and their rebellious actions. Then you shall know (understand and realize) that I have not done without cause all that I have done in Jerusalem says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,15,1,AND THE word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,15,2,Son of man How is the wood of the grapevine [Israel] more than that of any tree the vine branch which was among the trees of the forest?
Ezekiel,15,3,Shall wood be taken from it to do any work? Or will men take a peg of it on which to hang any vessel?
Ezekiel,15,4,Behold it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire consumes both ends of it and the middle of it is charred. Is it suitable or profitable for any work?
Ezekiel,15,5,Notice even when it was whole it was good for no work; how much less shall it be useful and profitable when the fire has devoured it and it is charred?
Ezekiel,15,6,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Like the wood of the grapevine among the trees of the forest which I have given to the fire for fuel so will I give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Ezekiel,15,7,And I will set My face against them; they shall go out from one fire and another fire shall devour them and you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord when I set My face against them.
Ezekiel,15,8,And I will make the land desolate (laid waste and deserted) because they have acted faithlessly [through their idolatry] says the Lord.
Ezekiel,16,1,AGAIN THE word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,16,2,Son of man cause Jerusalem to know understand and realize her [idolatrous] abominations [that they] are disgusting detestable and shamefully vile.
Ezekiel,16,3,And say Thus says the Lord God to Jerusalem [representing Israel]: Your [spiritual] origin and your birth are thoroughly Canaanitish; your [spiritual] father was an Amorite and your [spiritual] mother a Hittite.
Ezekiel,16,4,And as for your birth on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut nor were you washed with water to cleanse you nor rubbed with salt or swaddled with bands at all.
Ezekiel,16,5,No eye pitied you to do any of these things for you to have compassion on you; but you were cast out in the open field for your person was abhorrent and loathsome on the day that you were born.
Ezekiel,16,6,And when I passed by you and saw you rolling about in your blood I said to you in your blood Live! Yes I said to you still in your natal blood Live!
Ezekiel,16,7,I caused you [Israel] to multiply as the bud which grows in the field and you increased and became tall and you came to full maidenhood and beauty; your breasts were formed and your hair had grown yet you were naked and bare.
Ezekiel,16,8,Now I passed by you again and looked upon you; behold you were maturing and at the time for love and I spread My skirt over you and covered your nakedness. Yes I plighted My troth to you and entered into a covenant with you says the Lord and you became Mine.
Ezekiel,16,9,Then I washed you with water; yes I thoroughly washed away your [clinging] blood from you and I anointed you with oil.
Ezekiel,16,10,I clothed you also with embroidered cloth and shod you with [fine seal] leather; and I girded you about with fine linen and covered you with silk.
Ezekiel,16,11,I decked you also with ornaments and I put bracelets on your wrists and a chain on your neck.
Ezekiel,16,12,And I put a ring on your nostril and earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown upon your head!
Ezekiel,16,13,Thus you were decked with gold and silver and your raiment was of fine linen and silk and embroidered cloth; you ate fine flour and honey and oil. And you were exceedingly beautiful and you prospered into royal estate.
Ezekiel,16,14,And your renown went forth among the nations for your beauty for it was perfect through My majesty and splendor which I had put upon you says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,16,15,But you trusted in and relied on your own beauty and were unfaithful to God and played the harlot [in idolatry] because of your renown and you poured out your fornications upon anyone who passed by [as you worshiped the idols of every nation which prevailed over you] and your beauty was his.
Ezekiel,16,16,And you took some of your garments and made for yourself gaily decorated high places or shrines and played the harlot on them--things which should not come and that which should not take place.
Ezekiel,16,17,You did also take your fair jewels and beautiful vessels of My gold and My silver which I had given you and made for yourself images of men and you played the harlot with them;
Ezekiel,16,18,And you took your embroidered garments and covered them and set My oil and My incense before them.
Ezekiel,16,19,My bread also which I gave you--fine flour and oil and honey with which I fed you--you have even set it before the idols for a sweet odor. Thus it was says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,16,20,Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters whom you have borne to Me and you have sacrificed them [to your idols] to be destroyed. Were your harlotries too little
Ezekiel,16,21,That you have slain My children and delivered them up in setting them apart and causing them to pass through the fire for [your idols]?
Ezekiel,16,22,And in all your abominations and idolatrous whoredoms you have not [earnestly] remembered the days of your youth when you were naked and bare rolling about in your natal blood.
Ezekiel,16,23,And after all your wickedness--Woe woe to you! says the Lord God--
Ezekiel,16,24,You have built also for yourself a vaulted chamber (brothel) and have made a high place [of idol worship] in every street.
Ezekiel,16,25,At every crossway you built your high place [for idol worship] and have made your beauty an abomination [abhorrent loathsome extremely disgusting and detestable]; and you have made your body available to every passerby and multiplied your [idolatry and spiritual] harlotry.
Ezekiel,16,26,You have also played the harlot with the Egyptians your neighbors [by adopting their idolatries] whose worship is thoroughly sensuous and you have multiplied your harlotry to provoke Me to anger.
Ezekiel,16,27,Behold therefore I have stretched out My hand against you diminished your ordinary allowance of food and delivered you over to the will of those who hate and despise you the daughters of the Philistines who turned away in shame from your despicable policy and lewd behavior [for they are faithful to their gods]!
Ezekiel,16,28,You played the harlot also with the Assyrians because you were unsatiable; yes you played the harlot with them and yet you were not satisfied.
Ezekiel,16,29,Moreover you multiplied your harlotry with the land of trade with Chaldea and yet even with this you were not satisfied.
Ezekiel,16,30,How weak and spent with longing and lust is your heart and mind says the Lord God seeing you do all these things the work of a bold domineering harlot
Ezekiel,16,31,In that you build your vaulted place (brothel) at the head of every street and make your high place at every crossing. But you were not like a harlot because you scorned pay.
Ezekiel,16,32,Rather you were as an adulterous wife who receives strangers instead of her husband!
Ezekiel,16,33,Men give gifts to all harlots but you give your gifts to all your lovers and hire them bribing [the nations to ally themselves with you] that they may come to you on every side for your harlotries (your idolatrous unfaithfulnesses to God).
Ezekiel,16,34,And you are different [the reverse] from other women in your harlotries in that nobody follows you to lure you into harlotry and in that you give hire when no hire is given you; and so you are different.
Ezekiel,16,35,Therefore O harlot [Israel] hear the word of the Lord!
Ezekiel,16,36,Thus says the Lord God: Because your brass [coins and gifts] and your filthiness were emptied out and your nakedness uncovered through your harlotries with your lovers and because of all the [filthy] idols of your abominations and the blood of your children that you gave to them
Ezekiel,16,37,Therefore behold I will gather all your lovers with whom you have taken pleasure and all those whom you have loved with all those whom you have hated; I will even gather them [the allies you have courted] against you on every side and will uncover your nakedness to them that they may see all your nakedness [making you Israel an object of loathing and of mockery a spectacle among the nations].
Ezekiel,16,38,And I the Lord will judge you as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged and I will bring upon you the blood of [your divine Husband's] wrath and jealousy.
Ezekiel,16,39,And I will also give you into the hand of those [your enemies] and they shall throw down your vaulted place (brothel) and shall demolish your high places [of idolatry]; they shall strip you of your clothes and shall take your splendid jewels and leave you naked and bare.
Ezekiel,16,40,They shall also bring up a company against you and they shall stone you with stones and hew down and thrust you through with their swords.
Ezekiel,16,41,And they shall burn your houses with fire and execute judgments upon you before the eyes of many women spectators [the nations]. And I will cause you to cease playing the harlot and you also shall give hire no more.
Ezekiel,16,42,So will I make My wrath toward you to rest and My jealousy shall depart from you [My adulterous wife] and I will be quiet and will be no more angry.
Ezekiel,16,43,Because you have not [earnestly] remembered the days of your youth but have enraged Me with all these things therefore behold I also will bring your deeds down on your own head says the Lord God. Did you not commit this lewdness above and in addition to all your other abominations?
Ezekiel,16,44,Behold everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb against you: As is the mother so is her daughter.
Ezekiel,16,45,You are your [spiritual] mother's daughter who loathed her husband and her children and you are the sister of your sisters who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
Ezekiel,16,46,And your elder sister is Samaria she and her daughters who dwelt in the north and at your left hand; and your younger sister who dwelt in the south and at your right hand is Sodom and her daughters.
Ezekiel,16,47,Yet you were not satisfied to walk after their ways or to do after their abominations but very soon you were more corrupt in all your ways than they were [for your sin as those taught of God is far blacker than theirs].
Ezekiel,16,48,As I live says the Lord God Sodom your sister has not done she nor her daughters as you have done you and your daughters.
Ezekiel,16,49,Behold this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride overabundance of food prosperous ease and idleness were hers and her daughters'; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
Ezekiel,16,50,And they were haughty and committed abominable offenses before Me; therefore I removed them when I saw it and I saw fit.
Ezekiel,16,51,Neither has Samaria committed half of your sins but you have multiplied your [idolatrous] abominations more than they and have seemed to justify your sisters [Samaria and Sodom] in all their wickedness by all the abominable things which you have done--you even make them appear righteous in comparison with you.
Ezekiel,16,52,Take upon you and bear your own shame and disgrace [in your punishment] you also who called in question and judged your sisters for you have virtually absolved them by your sins in which you behaved more abominably than they; they are more right than you. Yes be ashamed and confounded and bear your shame and disgrace you also for you have seemed to justify your sisters and make them appear righteous.
Ezekiel,16,53,I will restore them again from their captivity restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters and I will restore your own fortunes in the midst of them [in the day of the Lord]
Ezekiel,16,54,That you [Judah] amid your shame and disgrace may be compelled to recognize your wickedness and be thoroughly ashamed and confounded at all you have done becoming [converted and bringing] consolation and comfort to [your sisters.]
Ezekiel,16,55,And your sisters Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former estate and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate; then you and your daughters shall return to your former estate.
Ezekiel,16,56,For was your sister Sodom not mentioned by you [except] as a byword in the day of your pride
Ezekiel,16,57,Before your own wickedness was uncovered? Now you have become like her an object of reproach and a byword for the daughters of Syria and of Edom and for all who are round about them and for the daughters of the Philistines--those round about who despise you.
Ezekiel,16,58,You bear the penalty of your lewdness and your [idolatrous] abominations says the Lord.
Ezekiel,16,59,Yes thus says the Lord God: I will even deal with you as you have done who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant;
Ezekiel,16,60,Nevertheless I will [earnestly] remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth and I will establish with you an everlasting covenant.
Ezekiel,16,61,Then you will [earnestly] remember your ways and be ashamed and confounded when you shall receive your sisters both your elder and your younger; I will give them to you as daughters but not on account of your covenant [with Me].
Ezekiel,16,62,And I will establish My covenant with you and you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord
Ezekiel,16,63,That you may [earnestly] remember and be ashamed and confounded and never open your mouth again because of your shame when I have forgiven you all that you have done says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,17,1,AND THE word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,17,2,Son of man put forth a riddle and speak a parable or allegory to the house of Israel;
Ezekiel,17,3,Say Thus says the Lord God: A great eagle [Nebuchadnezzar] with great wings and long pinions rich in feathers of various colors came to Lebanon [symbolic of Jerusalem] and took the top of the cedar [tree].
Ezekiel,17,4,He broke off the topmost of its young twigs [the youthful King Jehoiachin] and carried it into a land of trade [Babylon]; he set it in a city of merchants.
Ezekiel,17,5,He took also of the seedlings of the land [Zedekiah one of the native royal family] and planted it in fertile soil and a fruitful field; he placed it beside abundant waters and set it as a willow tree [to succeed Zedekiah's nephew Jehoiachin in Judah as vassal king].
Ezekiel,17,6,And it grew and became a spreading vine of low [not Davidic] stature whose branches turned [in submission] toward him and its roots remained under and subject to him [the king of Babylon]; so it became a vine and brought forth branches and shot forth leafy twigs.
Ezekiel,17,7,There was also another great eagle [the Egyptian king] with great wings and many feathers; and behold this vine [Zedekiah] bent its roots [languishingly] toward him and shot forth its branches toward him away from the beds of its planting for him to water.
Ezekiel,17,8,Though it was planted in good soil where water was plentiful for it to produce leaves and to bear fruit it was transplanted that it might become a splendid vine.
Ezekiel,17,9,Thus says the Lord God: Ask Will it thrive? Will he [the insulted Nebuchadnezzar] not pluck up its roots and strip off its fruit so that all its fresh sprouting leaves will wither? It will not take a strong arm or many people to pluck it up by its roots [totally ending Israel's national existence].
Ezekiel,17,10,Yes behold though transplanted will it prosper? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It will wither in the furrows and beds where it sprouted and grew.
Ezekiel,17,11,Moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,17,12,Say now to the rebellious house Do you not know and realize what these things mean? Tell them Behold the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and took its king [Jehoiachin] and its princes and brought them with him to Babylon.
Ezekiel,17,13,And he took one of the royal family [the king's uncle Zedekiah] and made a covenant with him putting him under oath. He also took the mighty and chief men of the land
Ezekiel,17,14,That the kingdom might become low and base and be unable to lift itself up but that by keeping his [Nebuchadnezzar's] covenant it might stand.
Ezekiel,17,15,But he [Zedekiah] rebelled against him [Nebuchadnezzar] in sending his ambassadors into Egypt that they might give him horses and much people. Will he prosper? Will he escape who does such things? Can he break the covenant with [Babylon] and yet escape?
Ezekiel,17,16,As I live says the Lord God surely in the place where the king [Nebuchadnezzar] dwells who made [Zedekiah as vassal] king whose oath [Zedekiah] despised and whose covenant he broke even with him in the midst of Babylon shall [Zedekiah] die.
Ezekiel,17,17,Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war when the [Babylonians] cast up mounds and build forts to destroy many lives.
Ezekiel,17,18,For [Zedekiah] despised the oath and broke the covenant and behold he had given his hand and yet has done all these things; he shall not escape.
Ezekiel,17,19,Therefore thus says the Lord God: As I live surely My oath [made for Me by Nebuchadnezzar] that [Zedekiah] has despised and My covenant with him that he has broken I will even bring down on his own head.
Ezekiel,17,20,And I will spread My net over him and he shall be taken in My snare; and I will bring him to Babylon and will enter into judgment and punishment with him there for his trespass and treason that he has committed against Me.
Ezekiel,17,21,And all his fugitives [from Judah] in all his bands shall fall by the sword and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind. And you shall know (understand and realize) that I the Lord have spoken it.
Ezekiel,17,22,Thus says the Lord God: I Myself will take a twig from the lofty top of the cedar and will set it out; I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one and will plant it upon a mountain high and exalted.
Ezekiel,17,23,On the mountain height of Israel will I plant it that it may bring forth boughs and bear fruit and be a noble cedar and under it shall dwell all birds of every feather; in the shade of its branches they shall nestle and find rest.
Ezekiel,17,24,And all the trees of the field shall know (understand and realize) that I the Lord have brought low the high tree have exalted the low tree have dried up the green tree and have made the dry tree flourish. I the Lord have spoken and I will do it.
Ezekiel,18,1,THE WORD of the Lord came to me again saying
Ezekiel,18,2,What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge?
Ezekiel,18,3,As I live says the Lord God you shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.
Ezekiel,18,4,Behold all souls are Mine; as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is Mine; the soul that sins it shall die.
Ezekiel,18,5,But if a man is [uncompromisingly] righteous (upright and in right standing with God) and does what is lawful and right
Ezekiel,18,6,And has not eaten [at the idol shrines] upon the mountains nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel has not defiled his neighbor's wife nor come near to a woman in her time of impurity
Ezekiel,18,7,And has not wronged anyone but has restored to the debtor his pledge has taken nothing by robbery but has given his bread to the hungry and has covered the naked with a garment
Ezekiel,18,8,Who does not charge interest or percentage of increase on what he lends [in compassion] who withholds his hand from iniquity who executes true justice between man and man
Ezekiel,18,9,Who has walked in My statutes and kept My ordinances to deal justly; [then] he is [truly] righteous; he shall surely live says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,18,10,If he begets a son who is a robber or a shedder of blood who does to a brother either of these sins of violence
Ezekiel,18,11,And leaves undone all of the duties [of a righteous man] and has even eaten [the food set before idols] on the mountains and defiled his neighbor's wife
Ezekiel,18,12,Has wronged the poor and needy has taken by robbery has not restored [to the debtor] his pledge has lifted up his eyes to the idols has committed abomination (things hateful and exceedingly vile in the eyes of God)
Ezekiel,18,13,And has charged interest or percentage of increase on what he has loaned [in supposed compassion]; shall he then live? He shall not live! He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
Ezekiel,18,14,But if this wicked man begets a son who sees all the sins which his father has committed and considers and fears [God] and does not do like his father
Ezekiel,18,15,Who has not eaten [food set before idols] upon the mountains nor has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel has not defiled his neighbor's wife
Ezekiel,18,16,Nor wronged anyone nor has taken anything in pledge nor has taken by robbery but has given his bread to the hungry and has covered the naked with a garment
Ezekiel,18,17,Who has withdrawn his hand from [oppressing] the poor who has not received interest or increase [from the needy] but has executed My ordinances and has walked in My statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father; he shall surely live.
Ezekiel,18,18,As for his father because he cruelly oppressed robbed his brother and did that which is not good among his people behold he shall die for his iniquity and guilt.
Ezekiel,18,19,Yet do you say Why does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right and has kept all My statutes and has done them he shall surely live.
Ezekiel,18,20,The soul that sins it [is the one that] shall die. The son shall not bear and be punished for the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear and be punished for the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him only and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon the wicked only.
Ezekiel,18,21,But if the wicked man turns from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all My statutes and does that which is lawful and right he shall surely live; he shall not die.
Ezekiel,18,22,None of his transgressions which he has committed shall be remembered against him; for his righteousness which he has executed [for his moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation] he shall live.
Ezekiel,18,23,Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? says the Lord and not rather that he should turn from his evil way and return [to his God] and live?
Ezekiel,18,24,But if the righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does shall he live? None of his righteous deeds which he has done shall be remembered. In his trespass that he has trespassed and in his sin that he has sinned in them shall he die.
Ezekiel,18,25,Yet you say The way of the Lord is not fair and just. Hear now O house of Israel: Is not My way fair and just? Are not your ways unfair and unjust?
Ezekiel,18,26,When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity and dies in his sins for his iniquity that he has done he shall die.
Ezekiel,18,27,Again when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness which he has committed and does that which is lawful and right he shall save his life.
Ezekiel,18,28,Because he considers and turns away from all his transgressions which he has committed he shall surely live; he shall not die.
Ezekiel,18,29,Yet says the house of Israel The way of the Lord is not fair and just! O house of Israel are not My ways fair and just? Are not your ways unfair and unjust?
Ezekiel,18,30,Therefore I will judge you O house of Israel every one according to his ways says the Lord God. Repent and turn from all your transgressions lest iniquity be your ruin and so shall they not be a stumbling block to you.
Ezekiel,18,31,Cast away from you all your transgressions by which you have transgressed against Me and make you a new mind and heart and a new spirit. For why will you die O house of Israel?
Ezekiel,18,32,For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies says the Lord God. Therefore turn (be converted) and live!
Ezekiel,19,1,THE WORD of the Lord came to me again saying
Ezekiel,19,2,What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge?
Ezekiel,19,3,As I live says the Lord God you shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.
Ezekiel,19,4,Behold all souls are Mine; as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is Mine; the soul that sins it shall die.
Ezekiel,19,5,But if a man is [uncompromisingly] righteous (upright and in right standing with God) and does what is lawful and right
Ezekiel,19,6,And has not eaten [at the idol shrines] upon the mountains nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel has not defiled his neighbor's wife nor come near to a woman in her time of impurity
Ezekiel,19,7,And has not wronged anyone but has restored to the debtor his pledge has taken nothing by robbery but has given his bread to the hungry and has covered the naked with a garment
Ezekiel,19,8,Who does not charge interest or percentage of increase on what he lends [in compassion] who withholds his hand from iniquity who executes true justice between man and man
Ezekiel,19,9,Who has walked in My statutes and kept My ordinances to deal justly; [then] he is [truly] righteous; he shall surely live says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,19,10,If he begets a son who is a robber or a shedder of blood who does to a brother either of these sins of violence
Ezekiel,19,11,And leaves undone all of the duties [of a righteous man] and has even eaten [the food set before idols] on the mountains and defiled his neighbor's wife
Ezekiel,19,12,Has wronged the poor and needy has taken by robbery has not restored [to the debtor] his pledge has lifted up his eyes to the idols has committed abomination (things hateful and exceedingly vile in the eyes of God)
Ezekiel,19,13,And has charged interest or percentage of increase on what he has loaned [in supposed compassion]; shall he then live? He shall not live! He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
Ezekiel,19,14,But if this wicked man begets a son who sees all the sins which his father has committed and considers and fears [God] and does not do like his father
Ezekiel,20,1,IN THE seventh year in the fifth [month] on the tenth [day] of the month [after the beginning of the Babylonian captivity which was to last seventy years] certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord and sat down before me [Ezekiel in Babylonia].
Ezekiel,20,2,Then came the word of the Lord to me saying
Ezekiel,20,3,Son of man speak to the elders of Israel and say to them Thus says the Lord God: Have you come to inquire of Me? As I live says the Lord God I will not be inquired of by you!
Ezekiel,20,4,Will you judge them son of man [Ezekiel] will you judge them? Then cause them to know understand and realize the abominations of their fathers.
Ezekiel,20,5,And say to them Thus says the Lord God: In the day when I chose Israel and lifted up My hand and swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt when I lifted up My hand and swore to them saying I am the Lord your God
Ezekiel,20,6,On that day I lifted up My hand and swore to them to bring them out of the land of Egypt to a land that I had searched out for them flowing with milk and honey [a land] which is an ornament and a glory to all lands.
Ezekiel,20,7,Then said I to them Let every man cast away the abominable things on which he feasts his eyes and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the Lord your God.
Ezekiel,20,8,But they rebelled against Me and would not listen to Me; they did not every man cast away the abominable things on which they feasted their eyes nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I [thought] I will pour out My wrath upon them and finish My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel,20,9,But I acted for My name's sake that it should not be profaned in the sight of the [heathen] nations among whom they dwelt in whose sight I made Myself known to them by bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel,20,10,So I caused them to go out from the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
Ezekiel,20,11,And I gave them My statutes and showed and made known to them My judgments which if a man keeps he must live in and by them.
Ezekiel,20,12,Moreover also I gave them My Sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them that they might understand and realize that I am the Lord Who sanctifies them [separates and sets them apart].
Ezekiel,20,13,But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness; they walked not in My statutes and they despised and cast away My judgments which if a man keeps he must even live in and by them; and they grievously profaned My Sabbaths. Then I thought I would pour out My wrath on them in the wilderness and uproot and consume them.
Ezekiel,20,14,But I acted for My name's sake that it should not be profaned before the [heathen] nations in whose sight I brought them out.
Ezekiel,20,15,Yet also I lifted up My hand to swear to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them flowing with milk and honey which is the ornament and glory of all lands--
Ezekiel,20,16,Because they despised and rejected My ordinances and walked not in My statutes and profaned My Sabbaths for their hearts went after their idols.
Ezekiel,20,17,Yet My eye pitied them instead of destroying them and I did not make a full end of them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel,20,18,But I said to their sons in the wilderness You shall not walk in the statutes of your fathers nor observe their ordinances nor defile yourselves with their idols.
Ezekiel,20,19,I the Lord am your God; walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances
Ezekiel,20,20,And hallow (separate and keep holy) My Sabbaths and they shall be a sign between Me and you that you may know understand and realize that I am the Lord your God.
Ezekiel,20,21,Yet the sons rebelled against Me; they walked not in My statutes neither kept My ordinances which if a man does he must live in and by them; they profaned My Sabbaths. Then I thought I would pour out My wrath on them and finish My anger against them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel,20,22,Yet I withheld My hand and acted for My name's sake that it should not be debased and profaned in the sight of the [heathen] nations in whose sight I had brought them forth [from bondage].
Ezekiel,20,23,Moreover I lifted up My hand and swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the [heathen] nations and disperse them in the countries
Ezekiel,20,24,Because they had not executed My ordinances but had despised and rejected My statutes and had profaned My Sabbaths and their eyes were set on their fathers' idols.
Ezekiel,20,25,Wherefore also I gave them [over to] statutes that were not good and ordinances whereby they should not live and could not have life
Ezekiel,20,26,And I [let them] pollute and make themselves unclean in their own offerings [to their idols] in that they caused to pass through the fire all the firstborn that I might make them desolate to the end that they might know understand and realize that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,20,27,Therefore son of man speak to the house of Israel and say to them Thus says the Lord God: Again in this your fathers blasphemed Me in that they dealt faithlessly and treacherously with Me and committed a treasonous trespass against Me.
Ezekiel,20,28,For when I had brought them into the land which I lifted up My hand and swore to give to them then they saw every high hill and every dark and leafy tree [as a place for idol worship] and they offered there their sacrifices and there they presented their offering that provoked My anger and sadness; there also they made their sweet-smelling savor and poured out there their drink offerings.
Ezekiel,20,29,Then I said to them What is the high place to which you go? And the name of it is called Bamah [high place] to this day.
Ezekiel,20,30,Therefore say to the house of Israel Thus says the Lord God: Do you [exiles] debase and defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers? And do you play the harlot after their loathsome and detestable things?
Ezekiel,20,31,And when you offer your gifts when you make your sons pass through the fire do you not debase and defile yourselves with all your idols to this day? And shall I be inquired of by you O house of Israel? As I live says the Lord God I will not be inquired of by you!
Ezekiel,20,32,And that which has come up in your mind shall never happen in that you think We will be as the nations as the tribes of the countries to serve idols of wood and stone.
Ezekiel,20,33,As I live says the Lord God surely with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out will I be King over you.
Ezekiel,20,34,And I will bring you out from the peoples and will gather you out of the countries in which you are scattered with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out.
Ezekiel,20,35,And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples and there will I enter into judgment with you and contend with you face to face.
Ezekiel,20,36,As I entered into judgment and contended with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt so will I enter into judgment and contend with you says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,20,37,And I will cause you to pass under the rod [as the shepherd does his sheep when he counts them and I will count you as Mine and I will constrain you] and bring you into the covenant to which you are permanently bound.
Ezekiel,20,38,And I will purge out and separate from among you the rebels and those who transgress against Me; I will bring them out of the country where they temporarily dwell but they shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,20,39,As for you O house of Israel thus says the Lord God: Go serve every one of you his idols now and hereafter if you will not listen to Me! But you shall not profane My holy name any more with your sacrificial gifts and your idols!
Ezekiel,20,40,For on My holy mountain on the mountain height of Israel says the Lord God there all the house of Israel all of them in the land shall serve Me. There will I [graciously] accept them and there will I require your offerings and the firstfruits and the choicest of your contributions with all your sacred things.
Ezekiel,20,41,I will accept you [graciously] as a pleasant odor when I lead you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries in which you have been scattered and I will manifest My holiness among you in the sight of the nations [who will seek Me because of My power displayed in you].
Ezekiel,20,42,And you shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord when I bring you into the land of Israel into the country which I lifted up My hand and swore to give to your fathers.
Ezekiel,20,43,And there you shall [earnestly] remember your ways and all your doings with which you have defiled yourselves and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evil deeds which you have done.
Ezekiel,20,44,And you shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord when I deal with you for My name's sake not according to your evil ways nor according to your corrupt doings O house of Israel says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,20,45,Moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,20,46,Son of man set your face toward the south preach against the south and prophesy against the forest land of the South (the Negeb)
Ezekiel,20,47,And say to the forest of the South (the Negeb) Hear the word of the Lord; Thus says the Lord God: Behold I will kindle a fire in you and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree. The blazing flame shall not be quenched and all faces from the south to the north shall be scorched by it.
Ezekiel,20,48,All flesh shall see that I the Lord have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.
Ezekiel,20,49,Then said I Ah Lord God! They are saying of me Does he not speak in parables and make allegories?
Ezekiel,21,1,AND THE word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,21,2,Son of man set your face toward Jerusalem and direct your [prophetic] word against the holy places; prophesy against the land of Israel
Ezekiel,21,3,And say to the land of Israel Thus says the Lord: Behold I am against you and will draw forth My sword out of its sheath and will cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.
Ezekiel,21,4,Because I will cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked therefore shall My sword go out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north
Ezekiel,21,5,And all living shall know understand and realize that I the Lord have drawn My sword out of its sheath; it shall not be sheathed any more.
Ezekiel,21,6,Sigh therefore son of man! With breaking heart and with bitterness shall you sigh before their eyes.
Ezekiel,21,7,And it shall be that when they say to you Why do you sigh? that you shall answer Because of the tidings. When it comes every heart will melt and all hands will be feeble and every spirit will faint and all knees will be weak as water. Behold it comes and it shall be fulfilled says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,21,8,Again the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,21,9,Son of man prophesy and say Thus says the Lord: Say A sword a sword is sharpened and also polished;
Ezekiel,21,10,It [the sword of Babylon] is sharpened that it may make a slaughter polished that it may flash and glitter like lightning! Shall we then rejoice and make mirth [when such a calamity is impending]? But the rod or scepter of My son [Judah] rejects and views with contempt every tree [that is since God's promise long ago to Judah is certain he believes Judah's scepter must remain no matter what power arises against it]!
Ezekiel,21,11,And the sword [of Babylon] is given to be polished that it may be put to use; the sword is sharpened and polished to be given into the hand of the slayer.
Ezekiel,21,12,Cry and wail son of man for it is against My people; it is against all the princes of Israel; they are thrown to the sword along with My people and terrors by reason of the sword are upon My people. Therefore smite your thigh [in dismay].
Ezekiel,21,13,For this sword has been tested and proved [on others] and what if the rejecting and despising rod or scepter of Judah shall be no more but completely swept away? says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,21,14,Therefore son of man prophesy and smite your hands together and let the sword be doubled yes trebled in intensity--the sword for those to be overthrown and pierced through; it is the sword of great slaughter which encompasses them [so that none can escape even by entering into their inner chambers].
Ezekiel,21,15,I have set the threatening and glittering sword against all their gates that their hearts may melt and their stumblings be multiplied. Ah! It is made [to flash] like lightning; it is pointed and sharpened for slaughter.
Ezekiel,21,16,Turn [O sword] and cut right or cut left whichever way your lust for blood and your edge direct you.
Ezekiel,21,17,I will also clap My hands and I will cause My wrath to rest. I the Lord have said it.
Ezekiel,21,18,The word of the Lord came to me again saying
Ezekiel,21,19,Also son of man mark out two ways by which the sword of the king of Babylon may come; both shall come forth from the same land. And make a signpost (a hand); make it at the head of the way to a city.
Ezekiel,21,20,You shall point out a way for the [Babylonian] sword to come to Rabbah [the capital] of the sons of Ammon and to Judah with Jerusalem the fortified and inaccessible.
Ezekiel,21,21,For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way at the fork of the two ways to use divination. He shakes the arrows to and fro he consults the teraphim (household gods) he looks at the liver.
Ezekiel,21,22,In his right hand is the lot marked for Jerusalem: to set battering rams to open the mouth calling for slaughter to lift up the voice with a war cry to set battering rams against the gates to cast up siege mounds and to build siege towers.
Ezekiel,21,23,And it shall seem like a lying divination to them who have sworn oaths [of allegiance to Nebuchadnezzar]. [Will he now fight against their homeland?] But he will remind them of their guilt and iniquity [in violating those oaths] that they may be caught.
Ezekiel,21,24,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Because you have made your guilt and iniquity to be remembered in that your transgressions are uncovered so that in all your doings your sins appear--because I say you have come to remembrance you shall be taken with the [enemy's] hand.
Ezekiel,21,25,And you O dishonored and wicked one [Zedekiah] the prince of Israel whose day will come at the time of your final reckoning and punishment
Ezekiel,21,26,Thus says the Lord God: Remove the [high priest's] miter or headband and take off the [king's] crown; things shall not remain as they have been; the low is to be exalted and the high is to be brought low.
Ezekiel,21,27,I will overthrow overthrow overthrow it; this also shall be no more until He comes Whose right it is [to reign in judgment and in righteousness] and I will give it to Him.
Ezekiel,21,28,And you son of man prophesy and say Thus says the Lord God concerning the sons of Ammon and concerning their reproach: Say A sword a sword is drawn for the slaughter; it is polished to cause it to devour to the uttermost and to flash like lightning
Ezekiel,21,29,While they see for you false visions while they divine lies for you to lay you [of Ammon] upon the headless trunks of those who are slain of the wicked whose day is coming at the time of the final reckoning and punishment.
Ezekiel,21,30,Return [the sword] to its sheath. In the place where you were created in the land of your origin and of your birth I will judge you.
Ezekiel,21,31,And I will pour out My indignation upon you [O sons of Ammon]; I will blow upon you with the fire of My wrath and will deliver you into the hand of brutish men skillful to destroy.
Ezekiel,21,32,You shall be for fuel to the fire; your blood shall be in the midst of the land; you shall be no more remembered for I the Lord have spoken it.
Ezekiel,22,1,MOREOVER THE word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,22,2,And you son of man [Ezekiel] will you judge will you judge the bloodshedding city? Then cause her to know all her abominations
Ezekiel,22,3,And say Thus says the Lord God: A city that sheds blood in the midst of her so that her time [of doom] will come and makes idols [over those who worship them] to defile her!
Ezekiel,22,4,In your blood which you have shed you have become guilty and you are defiled by the idols which you have made and you have caused your time [of judgment and punishment] to draw near and have arrived at the full measure of your years. Therefore have I made you a reproach to the [heathen] nations and a mocking to all countries.
Ezekiel,22,5,Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you you infamous one full of tumult.
Ezekiel,22,6,Behold the princes of Israel in you every one according to his power have been intending to shed blood.
Ezekiel,22,7,In you have they treated father and mother lightly; in the midst of you they have dealt unjustly and by oppression in relation to the stranger; in you they have wronged the fatherless and the widow.
Ezekiel,22,8,You have despised and scorned My sacred things and have profaned My Sabbaths.
Ezekiel,22,9,In you are slanderous men who arouse suspicions to shed blood and in you are they who have eaten [food offered to idols] upon the mountains; in the midst of you they have committed lewdness.
Ezekiel,22,10,In you men have uncovered their fathers' nakedness [the nakedness of mother or stepmother]; in you they have humbled women who are [ceremonially] unclean [during their periods or because of childbirth].
Ezekiel,22,11,And one has committed abomination with his neighbor's wife another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law and another in you has humbled his sister his father's daughter.
Ezekiel,22,12,In you they have accepted bribes to shed blood; you have taken [forbidden] interest and [percentage of] increase and you have greedily gained from your neighbors by oppression and extortion and have forgotten Me says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,22,13,Behold therefore I have struck My hands together at your dishonest gain which you have made and at the blood which has been in the midst of you.
Ezekiel,22,14,Can your heart and courage endure or can your hands be strong in the days that I shall deal with you? I the Lord have spoken it and I will do it.
Ezekiel,22,15,And I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the countries and I will consume your filthiness out of you.
Ezekiel,22,16,And you shall be dishonored and profane yourself in the sight of the nations and you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,22,17,And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,22,18,Son of man the house of Israel has become to Me scum and waste matter. All of them are bronze and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.
Ezekiel,22,19,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Because you have all become scum and waste matter behold therefore I will gather you [O Israel] into the midst of Jerusalem.
Ezekiel,22,20,As they gather silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it in order to melt it so will I gather you in My anger and in My wrath and I will put you in and melt you.
Ezekiel,22,21,Yes I will gather you and blow upon you with the fire of My wrath and you shall be melted in the midst of it.
Ezekiel,22,22,As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace so shall you be melted in the midst of it and you shall know understand and realize that I the Lord have poured out My wrath upon you [O Israel].
Ezekiel,22,23,And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,22,24,Son of man say to her You are a land that is not cleansed nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
Ezekiel,22,25,There is a conspiracy of [Israel's false] prophets in the midst of her like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured human lives; they have taken [in their greed] treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in the midst of her.
Ezekiel,22,26,Her priests have done violence to My law and have profaned My holy things. They have made no distinction between the sacred and the secular neither have they taught people the difference between the unclean and the clean and have hid their eyes from My Sabbaths and I am profaned among them.
Ezekiel,22,27,Her princes in the midst of her are like wolves rending and devouring the prey shedding blood and destroying lives to get dishonest gain.
Ezekiel,22,28,And her prophets have daubed them over with whitewash seeing false visions and divining lies to them saying Thus says the Lord God--when the Lord has not spoken.
Ezekiel,22,29,The people of the land have used oppression and extortion and have committed robbery; yes they have wronged and vexed the poor and needy; yes they have oppressed the stranger and temporary resident wrongfully.
Ezekiel,22,30,And I sought a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the gap before Me for the land that I should not destroy it but I found none.
Ezekiel,22,31,Therefore have I poured out My indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; their own way have I repaid [by bringing it] upon their own heads says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,23,1,THE WORD of the Lord came again to me saying
Ezekiel,23,2,Son of man there were two women the daughters of one mother;
Ezekiel,23,3,And they played the harlot in Egypt. There they played the harlot in their youth; there their bosoms were pressed and there their virgin breasts were handled.
Ezekiel,23,4,And the names of them were Aholah the elder and Aholibah her sister and they became Mine and they bore sons and daughters. As for the identity of their names Aholah is Samaria and Aholibah is Jerusalem.
Ezekiel,23,5,And Aholah played the harlot when she was Mine and she was foolishly fond of her lovers and doted on the Assyrians her neighbors
Ezekiel,23,6,Who were clothed with blue governors and deputies all of them attractive young men horsemen riding upon horses.
Ezekiel,23,7,And she bestowed her harlotries upon them the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whomever she doted with all their idols she defiled herself.
Ezekiel,23,8,Neither has she left her harlotries since the days of Egypt [from where she brought them] for in her youth men there lay with her and handled her girlish bosom and they poured out their sinful desire upon her.
Ezekiel,23,9,Wherefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers into the hand of the Assyrians upon whom she doted.
Ezekiel,23,10,These uncovered her nakedness and shame; they took her sons and her daughters and they slew her with the sword and her name became notorious and a byword among women when judgments were executed upon her.
Ezekiel,23,11,And her sister Aholibah saw this; yet she was more corrupt in her foolish fondness than she and in her harlotries she was more wanton than her sister in her harlotries.
Ezekiel,23,12,She doted upon the Assyrians--governors and deputies her neighbors clothed most gorgeously horsemen riding upon horses all of them desirable young men.
Ezekiel,23,13,And I saw that she was defiled that both [of the sisters] took one way.
Ezekiel,23,14,But [Aholibah] carried her harlotries further for she saw men pictured upon the wall the pictures of the Chaldeans sketched in bright red pigment
Ezekiel,23,15,Girded with girdles on their loins with flowing turbans on their heads all of them looking like officers a picture of Babylonian men whose native land was Chaldea
Ezekiel,23,16,Then as soon as she saw [the sketches of] them she doted on them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
Ezekiel,23,17,And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love and they defiled her with their evil desire; and when she was polluted by them she [Jerusalem] broke the relationship and pushed them away from her in disgust.
Ezekiel,23,18,So she flaunted her harlotries and exposed her nakedness and I was disgusted and turned from her as I had turned in disgust from her sister.
Ezekiel,23,19,Yet she multiplied her harlotries remembering the days of her youth in which she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel,23,20,For she doted upon her paramours there whose lust was sensuous and vulgar like that of asses or stallions.
Ezekiel,23,21,Thus you yearned for the lewdness of your youth when those of Egypt handled your bosom on account of your girlish breasts.
Ezekiel,23,22,Therefore O Aholibah thus says the Lord God: Behold I will rouse up your lovers against you from whom you turned in disgust and I will bring them against you on every side:
Ezekiel,23,23,The Babylonians and all the Chaldeans Pekod and Shoa and Koa and all the Assyrians with them desirable young men governors and officers all of them princes men of renown and counselors all of them riding on horses.
Ezekiel,23,24,And they shall come against you with weapons chariots wagons and wheels and with a host of infantry which shall array themselves against you with buckler and shield and helmet round about; and I will commit the judgment and punishment to them and they shall judge and punish you according to their [heathen] customs in such matters.
Ezekiel,23,25,And I will set My jealous indignation against you and they shall deal with you in fury; they shall take away your nose and your ears and those who are left of you shall fall by the sword; they shall take your sons and your daughters and the remainder shall be devoured by the fire.
Ezekiel,23,26,They shall also strip you [Judah] of your clothes and take away your fine jewels.
Ezekiel,23,27,Thus I will put an end to your lewdness and your harlotry brought from the land of Egypt so that you will not lift up your eyes to them nor [earnestly] remember Egypt any more.
Ezekiel,23,28,For thus says the Lord God: Behold I will deliver you into the hands of those whom you hate into the hands of those from whom you turned away in disgust.
Ezekiel,23,29,They shall deal with you in hatred and shall take away all [the earnings of] your labor and shall leave you naked and bare and the nakedness of your harlotry shall be uncovered both your lewdness and your wanton ways.
Ezekiel,23,30,These things shall be done to you because you have played the harlot after the nations and because you have defiled yourself with their idols.
Ezekiel,23,31,You have walked in the way of your sister [Samaria Israel's capital]; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.
Ezekiel,23,32,Thus says the Lord God: You shall drink of your sister's cup which is deep and wide and brimful; you shall be laughed to scorn and held in derision for it contains much [too much to endure].
Ezekiel,23,33,You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow with the cup of wasting astonishment and horror and desolation with the cup of your sister Samaria.
Ezekiel,23,34,You shall drink it and drain it out and then gnaw the pieces of it [which in your drunkenness you have broken] and shall tear your [own] breasts; for I have spoken it says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,23,35,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Because you have forgotten Me [your divine Husband] and cast Me behind your back therefore bear also [the consequences of] your lewdness and your harlotry.
Ezekiel,23,36,The Lord said moreover to me: Son of man will you judge Aholah and Aholibah? Then declare and show to them their abominations (the detestable loathsome and shamefully vile things they do)
Ezekiel,23,37,For they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands even with their idols have they committed adultery [against Me]. And they have also caused their sons whom they bore to Me to pass through the fire to their images [as an offering of food] to be devoured [by them].
Ezekiel,23,38,Moreover this they have done to Me: they have defiled My sanctuary on the same day [of their idolatries] and have profaned My Sabbaths.
Ezekiel,23,39,For when they had slain their children [as offerings] to their idols then they came the same day into My sanctuary to profane it [by daring to offer sacrifice there also]! And behold thus have they done in the midst of My house!
Ezekiel,23,40,And furthermore you have sent for men to come from afar to whom a messenger was sent; and behold they came--those for whom you washed yourself painted your eyelids and decked yourself with ornaments;
Ezekiel,23,41,And you sat upon a stately couch with a table spread before it upon which you set My incense and My oil.
Ezekiel,23,42,And the sound of a careless crowd was with her and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness who put bracelets upon the hands of both sisters and beautiful crowns upon their heads.
Ezekiel,23,43,Then I said of the one [Aholah] worn out with adulteries Will they now play the harlot with her [now that she is old] and she with them?
Ezekiel,23,44,Yet they went in to her as they go in to a woman who plays the harlot; so they went in to Aholah and to Aholibah [Israel and Judah] the lewd women.
Ezekiel,23,45,And the righteous men they shall judge and condemn them to the punishment due to adulteresses to women who shed blood for they are adulteresses and blood is upon their hands.
Ezekiel,23,46,For thus says the Lord God: I will bring up a host upon them and will give them over to be tossed to and fro and robbed.
Ezekiel,23,47,And the host shall stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters and burn up their houses with fire.
Ezekiel,23,48,Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
Ezekiel,23,49,Thus your lewdness shall be recompensed upon you and you shall suffer the penalty for your sinful idolatry; and you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord God.
Ezekiel,24,1,AGAIN IN the ninth year [of King Jehoiachin's captivity by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon] in the tenth month on the tenth day of the month the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,24,2,Son of man record the name of the day even of this same day; the king of Babylon set himself against and assailed Jerusalem this same day.
Ezekiel,24,3,And utter a parable against the rebellious house [of Judah] and say to them Thus says the Lord God: Put on a pot; put it on and also pour water into it.
Ezekiel,24,4,Put into it the pieces [of meat] all the good pieces the thigh and the shoulder; fill it with the choice of the bones.
Ezekiel,24,5,Take the choicest of the flock and burn also the unused bones under it and make it boil well and seethe its bones in [the pot].
Ezekiel,24,6,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Woe to the bloody city to the pot whose rust and scum are in it and whose rust and scum have not gone out of it! Take out of it piece by piece without making any choice.
Ezekiel,24,7,For the blood she has shed remains in the midst of her; she put it upon the bare rock; she did not pour it on the ground to cover it with dust.
Ezekiel,24,8,That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance I have put her blood [guilt for her children sacrificed to Molech] upon the bare rock that it would not be covered.
Ezekiel,24,9,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Woe to the bloodguilty city! Also I will make the pile [of fuel] great.
Ezekiel,24,10,Heap on wood kindle the fire and make it hot boil well the meat and mix the spices pour out the broth when thick and let the bones be burned up.
Ezekiel,24,11,Then set [the pot Jerusalem] back empty upon the coals that the bronze of it may be hot and may glow and the filthiness of it may be melted in it and the rust and scum of it may be consumed.
Ezekiel,24,12,She has wearied herself and Me with toil; yet her great rust and scum go not forth out of her for however hotly the fire burns her thick rust and filth will not go out of her by fire.
Ezekiel,24,13,In your filthiness is abomination; [and therefore] because I would have cleansed you and you were not cleansed you shall not be cleansed from your filthiness any more until I have satisfied My wrath against and upon you.
Ezekiel,24,14,I the Lord have spoken it; it shall come to pass and I will do it; I will not go back neither will I spare neither will I relent; according to your ways and according to your doings shall they judge and punish you says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,24,15,Also the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,24,16,Son of man [Ezekiel] behold I take away from you the desire of your eyes [your wife] at a single stroke. Yet you shall neither mourn nor weep neither shall your tears flow.
Ezekiel,24,17,Sigh and groan but not aloud [be silent]; make no mourning for the dead; bind your turban upon your head and put your shoes on your feet and do not cover your beard or eat the bread of mourners [furnished by others].
Ezekiel,24,18,So I spoke to the people in the morning and in the evening my wife died and I did the next morning as I was commanded.
Ezekiel,24,19,And the people said to me Will you not tell us what these things are supposed to mean to us that you are acting as you do?
Ezekiel,24,20,Then I answered them The word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,24,21,Speak to the house of Israel Thus says the Lord God: Behold I will profane My sanctuary--[in which you take] pride as your strength the desire of your eyes and the pity and sympathy of your soul [that you would spare with your life]; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind shall fall by the sword.
Ezekiel,24,22,And you shall do as I [Ezekiel] have done; you shall not cover your beard nor eat the bread of mourning [brought to you by others]
Ezekiel,24,23,And your turbans shall be upon your heads and your shoes upon your feet; you shall not mourn or weep but you shall pine away for your iniquities (your guilt) and sigh and groan to one another.
Ezekiel,24,24,Thus Ezekiel is to you a sign; according to all that he has done you shall do. And when this [destruction of the temple] comes you shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord God [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,24,25,And you son of man on the day when I take from them [My temple] their strength and their stronghold their joy and their glory the delight of their eyes and their hearts' chief desire and also [take] their sons and their daughters--
Ezekiel,24,26,On that day an escaped fugitive shall come to you to cause you to hear of it [the destruction of Jerusalem] with your own ears.
Ezekiel,24,27,In that day your mouth shall be open to him who has escaped and you shall speak and be no more speechless and you shall be a sign to them and they shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,25,1,THE WORD of the Lord came again to me saying
Ezekiel,25,2,Son of man set your face toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them.
Ezekiel,25,3,And say to the Ammonites Hear the word of the Lord God for thus says the Lord God: Because you said Aha! over My sanctuary when it was profaned and over the land of Israel when it was made desolate and over the house of Judah when it went into captivity and exile
Ezekiel,25,4,Therefore behold I am delivering you to the people of the East for a possession and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings in your midst; they shall eat your fruit and they shall drink your milk.
Ezekiel,25,5,And I will make Rabbah [your chief city] a stable for camels and [the cities of] the Ammonites a fold for flocks. And you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,25,6,For thus says the Lord God: Because you have clapped your hands and stamped with the feet and rejoiced [in heart] with all the contempt malice and spite that is in you against the land of Israel
Ezekiel,25,7,Therefore behold I have stretched out My hand against you and will hand you over for a prey and a spoil to the nations and I will cut you off from the peoples and will cause you to perish and be lost out of the countries; I will destroy you. Then will you know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,25,8,Thus says the Lord God: Because Moab says as does Seir [Edom] Behold the house of Judah is like all the [heathen] nations
Ezekiel,25,9,Therefore behold I will lay open the flank of Moab from the cities from its cities on its frontiers and in every quarter the glory of the country Beth-jeshimoth Baal-meon and Kiriathaim.
Ezekiel,25,10,I will give it along with the children of Ammon to the people of the East for a possession that it and the children of Ammon may not be [any more seriously] remembered among the nations.
Ezekiel,25,11,And I will execute judgments and punishments upon Moab and they shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,25,12,Thus says the Lord God: Because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance and has greatly offended and has become doubly guilty by taking revenge upon them
Ezekiel,25,13,Therefore thus says the Lord God: I will also stretch out My hand against Edom and will cut off and root out man and beast from it and I will make it desolate; from Teman even to Dedan they shall fall by the sword.
Ezekiel,25,14,And I will lay My vengeance upon Edom by the hand of My people Israel and they shall do upon Edom according to My anger and according to My wrath and they shall know My vengeance says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,25,15,Thus says the Lord God: Because the Philistines have dealt revengefully and have taken vengeance contemptuously with malice and spite in their hearts to destroy in perpetual enmity
Ezekiel,25,16,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold I will stretch out My hand against the Philistines and I will cut off the Cherethites [an immigration in Philistia] and destroy the remainder of the seacoast.
Ezekiel,25,17,And I will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes and chastisements and they shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon them.
Ezekiel,26,1,AND IN the eleventh year on the first day of the month [after the carrying away of King Jehoiachin] the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,26,2,Son of man because Tyre has said against Jerusalem Aha! She is broken that has been the gate of the people; she is open to me [Tyre]; I shall become full now that she is desolate and a wasteland
Ezekiel,26,3,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold I am against you O Tyre and will cause many nations to come up against you as the sea mounts up by its waves.
Ezekiel,26,4,And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; I will also scrape her dust from her and make her bare like the top of a rock.
Ezekiel,26,5,Her island in the midst of the sea shall become a place for the spreading of nets for I have spoken it says the Lord God; and she shall become a prey and a spoil to the nations.
Ezekiel,26,6,And Tyre's daughters [her towns and villages on the mainland] in the level place shall be slain by the sword and they shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,26,7,For thus says the Lord God: Behold I will bring from the north upon Tyre Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon a king of kings with horses and chariots and with horsemen and a host of many people.
Ezekiel,26,8,He shall slay with the sword your daughters [the towns and villages] in the level area [on the mainland] and he shall make a fortified wall against you and cast up a siege mound against you and raise up a roof of bucklers and shields as a defense against you.
Ezekiel,26,9,And he shall set his battering engines in shock against your walls and with his axes he will break down your towers.
Ezekiel,26,10,Because of the great number of [Nebuchadrezzar's] horses their dust will cover you; your walls [O Tyre] will shake at the noise of the horsemen and of the wagon wheels and of the chariots when he enters into your gates as men enter into the city in whose walls there has been made a breach.
Ezekiel,26,11,With the hoofs of his horses [Nebuchadrezzar] will trample all your streets; he will slay your people with the sword and your strong pillars or obelisks will fall to the ground.
Ezekiel,26,12,And [your adversaries] shall make a spoil of your riches and make booty of your merchandise. And they shall break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses and they shall lay the stones and the timber and the very dust from your demolished city out in the midst of the water [between the island and the mainland city site to make a causeway].
Ezekiel,26,13,And I will cause the noise of your songs to cease and the sound of your lyres shall be no more heard.
Ezekiel,26,14,And I will make you [Tyre] a bare rock; you shall be a place upon which to spread nets; you shall never be rebuilt for I the Lord have spoken it says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,26,15,Thus says the Lord God to Tyre: Shall not the isles and coastlands shake at the sound of your fall when the wounded groan when the slaughter is made in the midst of you?
Ezekiel,26,16,Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones and lay aside their robes and strip off their embroidered garments; they shall clothe themselves with tremblings; they shall sit upon the ground and shall tremble every moment and be astonished at you and appalled.
Ezekiel,26,17,They shall take up a lamentation over you and say to you How you are destroyed and vanished O renowned city that was won from the seas and inhabited by seafaring men renowned city that was mighty on the sea she and her inhabitants who caused their terror to fall upon all who dwell there!
Ezekiel,26,18,Now the isles and coastlands tremble in the day of your fall; yes the isles that are in the sea are troubled and dismayed at your departure.
Ezekiel,26,19,For thus says the Lord God: When I make you a desolate city like the cities that are not inhabited when I bring up the deep over you and great waters cover you
Ezekiel,26,20,Then I will thrust you down with those who descend into the pit (the place of the dead) to the people of olden times and I will make you [Tyre] to dwell in the lower world like the places that were desolate of old with those who go down to the pit that you be not inhabited or shed forth your glory and renown in the land of the living.
Ezekiel,26,21,I will make you a terror [bring you to a dreadful end] and you shall be no more. Though you be sought yet you shall never be found again says the Lord God.

Ezekiel,27,27,Your riches your wares your merchandise your oarsmen and your pilots your caulkers your dealers in merchandise and all your men of war who are in you with all your company which is in your midst sink in the heart of the seas on the day of your ruin!
Ezekiel,27,28,The waves and the countryside shake at the [piercing] sound of the [hopeless wailing] cry of your pilots.
Ezekiel,27,29,And down from their ships come all who handle the oar. The mariners and all the pilots of the sea stand upon the shore

Ezekiel,27,31,And they make themselves [utterly] bald for you and gird themselves with sackcloth and they weep over you in bitterness of heart and with bitter mourning and wailing.
Ezekiel,27,32,And in their wailing they take up a lamentation for you and lament over you saying Who was ever like Tyre the destroyed (the annihilated) [who has become so still] in the heart of the sea?

Ezekiel,27,36,The merchants among the people hiss over you [with malicious joy]; you have become a horror and a source of terrors. You shall be no more [forever].
Ezekiel,28,1,THE WORD of the Lord came again to me saying
Ezekiel,28,2,Son of man say to the prince of Tyre Thus says the Lord God: Because your heart is lifted up and you have said and thought I am a god I sit in the seat of the gods in the heart of the seas; yet you are only man [weak feeble made of earth] and not God though you imagine yourself to be almost more than mortal with your mind as the mind of God;
Ezekiel,28,3,Indeed you are [imagining yourself] wiser than Daniel; there is no secret [you think] that is hidden from you;
Ezekiel,28,4,With your own wisdom and with your own understanding you have gotten you riches and power and have brought gold and silver into your treasuries;
Ezekiel,28,5,By your great wisdom and by your traffic you have increased your riches and power and your heart is proud and lifted up because of your wealth;
Ezekiel,28,6,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Because you have imagined your mind as the mind of God [having thoughts and purposes suitable only to God Himself]
Ezekiel,28,7,Behold therefore I am bringing strangers upon you the most terrible of the nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom [O Tyre] and they shall defile your splendor.
Ezekiel,28,8,They shall bring you down to the pit [of destruction] and you shall die the [many] deaths of all the Tyrians that are slain in the heart of the seas.
Ezekiel,28,9,Will you still say I am a god before him who slays you? But you are only a man [made of earth] and no god in the hand of him who wounds and profanes you.
Ezekiel,28,10,You shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers for I have spoken it says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,28,11,Moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,28,12,Son of man take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre and say to him Thus says the Lord God: You are the full measure and pattern of exactness [giving the finishing touch to all that constitutes completeness] full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
Ezekiel,28,13,You were in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering the carnelian topaz jasper chrysolite beryl onyx sapphire carbuncle and emerald; and your settings and your sockets and engravings were wrought in gold. On the day that you were created they were prepared.
Ezekiel,28,14,You were the anointed cherub that covers with overshadowing [wings] and I set you so. You were upon the holy mountain of God; you walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire [like the paved work of gleaming sapphire stone upon which the God of Israel walked on Mount Sinai].
Ezekiel,28,15,You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created until iniquity and guilt were found in you.
Ezekiel,28,16,Through the abundance of your commerce you were filled with lawlessness and violence and you sinned; therefore I cast you out as a profane thing from the mountain of God and the guardian cherub drove you out from the midst of the stones of fire.
Ezekiel,28,17,Your heart was proud and lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. I cast you to the ground; I lay you before kings that they might gaze at you.
Ezekiel,28,18,You have profaned your sanctuaries by the multitude of your iniquities and the enormity of your guilt by the unrighteousness of your trade. Therefore I have brought forth a fire from your midst; it has consumed you and I have reduced you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all who looked at you.
Ezekiel,28,19,All who know you among the people are astonished and appalled at you; you have come to a horrible end and shall never return to being.
Ezekiel,28,20,Again the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,28,21,Son of man set your face toward Sidon and prophesy against her.
Ezekiel,28,22,And say Thus says the Lord God: Behold I am against you O Sidon and I will show forth My glory and be glorified in the midst of you. And they shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord when I execute judgments and punishments in her and am set apart and separated and My holiness is manifested in her.
Ezekiel,28,23,For I will send pestilence into her and blood into her streets and the wounded shall be judged and fall by the sword in the midst of her on every side and they shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,28,24,And there shall be no more a brier to prick the house of Israel or a hurting thorn of all those around them who have treated them with contempt and they shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord God [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,28,25,Thus says the Lord God: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered and I shall be set apart and separated and My holiness made apparent in them in the sight of the nations then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to My servant Jacob.
Ezekiel,28,26,And they shall dwell safely in it and shall build houses and plant vineyards; yes they shall dwell securely and with confidence when I have executed judgments and punishments upon all those round about them who have despised and trodden upon them and pushed them away and they shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord their God [their Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,29,1,IN THE tenth year [of the captivity of King Jehoiachin by the king of Babylon] in the tenth [month] on the twelfth [day] of the month the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,29,2,Son of man set your face toward Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.
Ezekiel,29,3,Say Thus says the Lord God: Behold I am against you Pharaoh king of Egypt the great monster [of sluggish and unwieldy strength] that lies in the midst of his [delta] streams [boastfully] declaring My river Nile is my own and I have made it for myself.
Ezekiel,29,4,But I will put hooks in your jaws [O Egyptian dragon] and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales and I will draw you up out of the midst of your streams with all the fish of your streams which stick to your scales.
Ezekiel,29,5,And I will cast you forth into the wilderness you and all the fish of your rivers; you shall fall upon the open field and not be gathered up or buried. I have given you for food to the [wild] beasts of the earth and the birds of the heavens.
Ezekiel,29,6,And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service] because they have been a [deceitful] staff [made of fragile] reeds to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,29,7,When they grasped you with the hand and leaned upon you you broke and tore their whole shoulder and [by injuring their muscles made them so stiff and rigid that] they could do no more than stand.
Ezekiel,29,8,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold I will bring a sword upon you and cut off man and beast from you
Ezekiel,29,9,And the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste. And they shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service]. Because you have said The river is mine and I have made it
Ezekiel,29,10,Behold therefore I am against you and against your streams and I will make the land of Egypt an utter [plundered] waste and desolation [of subjection] from [northern] Migdol to [southern] Syene even as far as the border of Ethiopia.
Ezekiel,29,11,No foot of man shall pass through it [in travel] no foot of beast shall pass through it [in trade with other countries] neither shall [Egypt] be [truly] inhabited [again] for forty years.
Ezekiel,29,12,And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation [plundered and reduced to subjection] in the midst of desolated (plundered and reduced to subjection) countries and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries.
Ezekiel,29,13,Yet thus says the Lord God: At the end of [their] forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered
Ezekiel,29,14,And I will reverse the captivity of Egypt [as I will that of Israel] and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros [under Egypt] the land of their origin and they shall be there a lowly kingdom.
Ezekiel,29,15,It shall be the lowliest of the kingdoms neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations; I will diminish [the Egyptians] so they shall never again rule over the nations.
Ezekiel,29,16,And never again shall Egypt have the confidence and be the reliance of the house of Israel; their iniquity will be brought to remembrance whenever [Israel] looks toward them [for help]. They shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord God [Who demands loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,29,17,In the twenty-seventh year [after King Jehoiachin was taken to Babylon] in the first month on the first day of the month the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,29,18,Son of man Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to render heavy service [at My bidding] against Tyre; every [soldier's] head became bald and every shoulder was worn and peeled [with carrying loads of earth and stones for siege works]. Yet he had no remuneration from Tyre [in proportion to the time and labor expended in the thirteen years' siege] either for himself or his army for the work that he had done against it [for Me].
Ezekiel,29,19,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and he shall carry off her great mass of people and of things (her riches) and take her spoil and take her prey and it shall be the wages for his army.
Ezekiel,29,20,I have given him the land of Egypt for his labor with which he served [against Tyre] because they did it for Me says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,29,21,In that day will I cause a horn to spring forth to the house of Israel and I will open your lips among them and they shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,30,1,THE WORD of the Lord came again to me saying
Ezekiel,30,2,Son of man prophesy and say Thus says the Lord God: Wail Alas for the day!
Ezekiel,30,3,For the day is near even the day of the Lord is near a cloudy day; it shall be the time [of doom] for the nations.
Ezekiel,30,4,And a sword shall come upon Egypt and anguish and great sorrow shall be in Ethiopia (Cush) when the slain fall in Egypt and they [of Babylon] carry away her great mass of people and of things and her foundations are broken down.
Ezekiel,30,5,Ethiopia (Cush) and Put Lud and all the mingled people [foreigners living in Egypt] Cub (Lub Libya) and the children of the land of the covenant [the Jews who had taken refuge in Egypt] shall fall with [the Egyptians] by the sword.
Ezekiel,30,6,Thus says the Lord: They also who uphold or lean upon and are supported by Egypt shall fall and the pride of her power shall come down; from Migdol [in the north] to Syene [in the south] they shall fall within her by the sword says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,30,7,And they shall be desolated in the midst of countries that are desolated and her cities shall be in the midst of cities that are wasted [by plunder and subjection].
Ezekiel,30,8,And they shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service] when I have set a fire in Egypt and all her helpers are broken and destroyed.
Ezekiel,30,9,In that day shall [swift] messengers go forth from Me in ships to terrify the careless and unsuspecting Ethiopians and there shall be anguish and great sorrow upon them as in the day of Egypt's [doom] for behold [their day] comes!
Ezekiel,30,10,Thus says the Lord God: I will also make the tumult and the wealth and the large population of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.
Ezekiel,30,11,He and his people with him the [most] terrible of the nations shall be brought in to destroy the land and they shall draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain.
Ezekiel,30,12,And I will make the [artificial] streams [of the Nile delta] dry and will sell the land into the hand of evil men and I will make the land desolate and all that is in it by the hand of strangers. I the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service] have spoken it.
Ezekiel,30,13,Thus says the Lord God: I will also destroy the idols and I will put an end to the images in Noph or Memphis and there shall be no longer a prince of the land of Egypt. And I will put fear in the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel,30,14,And I will make Pathros desolate and will set fire to Zoan and will execute judgments and punishments upon No or Thebes.
Ezekiel,30,15,And I will pour My wrath upon Pelusium the stronghold of Egypt and I will cut off the tumult the prosperity and the population of No or Thebes.
Ezekiel,30,16,And I will set fire to Egypt; Pelusium shall have great anguish and No or Thebes shall be torn open and Noph or Memphis shall have adversaries in the daytime and all the day long.
Ezekiel,30,17,The young men of Aven or On and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword and the [women and children] shall go into captivity.
Ezekiel,30,18,At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself and be dark when I break there the yokes and dominion of Egypt and the pride of her power shall come to an end. As for her a cloud [of calamities] shall cover her and her daughters shall go into captivity.
Ezekiel,30,19,Thus will I execute judgments and punishments upon Egypt. Then shall they know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,30,20,And in the eleventh year [after King Jehoiachin was taken to Babylon] in the first month on the seventh day of the month the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,30,21,Son of man I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt and behold it has not been bound up to heal it by binding it with a bandage to make it strong to hold and wield the sword.
Ezekiel,30,22,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt and will break his arms both the strong one and the one which was broken and I will cause the sword to fall from his hand.
Ezekiel,30,23,And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and will disperse them throughout the countries.
Ezekiel,30,24,And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put My sword in his hand but I will break Pharaoh's arms and he will groan before [Nebuchadrezzar] with the groanings of a mortally wounded man.
Ezekiel,30,25,But I will strengthen and hold up the arms of the king of Babylon and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down and they [of Egypt] shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service] when I put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel,30,26,And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries and they shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,31,1,AND IN the eleventh year [after King Jehoiachin was taken captive to Babylon] in the third month on the first day of the month the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,31,2,Son of man say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude: Whom are you like in your greatness?
Ezekiel,31,3,Behold [I will liken you to] Assyria a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches and with forestlike shade and of high stature with its top among the thick boughs [even among the clouds].
Ezekiel,31,4,The waters nourished it; the deep made it grow tall; its rivers ran round about its planting sending out its streams to all the trees of the forest [the other nations].
Ezekiel,31,5,Therefore it towered higher than all the trees of the forest; its boughs were multiplied and its branches became long because there was much water when they were shot forth.
Ezekiel,31,6,All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs and under its branches all the wild beasts of the field brought forth their young and under its shadow dwelt all of the great nations.
Ezekiel,31,7,Thus was it beautiful in its greatness in the length of its branches for its root was by many and great waters.
Ezekiel,31,8,The cedars in the garden of God could not hide or rival it; the cypress trees did not have boughs like it and the plane trees did not have branches like it nor was any tree in the garden of God like it in its beauty.
Ezekiel,31,9,I made it beautiful with the multitude of its branches so that all the trees of Eden that were in the garden of God envied it [Assyria].
Ezekiel,31,10,Therefore thus said the Lord God: Because it is exalted in stature and has set its top among the thick boughs and the clouds and its heart is proud of its height
Ezekiel,31,11,I will even deliver it into the hand of a mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with it. I have driven it out for its wickedness and lawlessness.
Ezekiel,31,12,And strangers the most terrible of the nations will cut it off and leave it; upon the mountains and in all the valleys its branches will fall and its boughs will lie broken by all the watercourses of the land and all the peoples of the earth will go down out of its shade and leave it.
Ezekiel,31,13,Upon its ruins all the birds of the heavens will dwell and all the wild beasts of the field will be upon [Assyria's fallen] branches.
Ezekiel,31,14,All this is so that none of the trees by the waters may exalt themselves because of their height or shoot up their top among the thick boughs and the clouds and that none of their mighty ones should stand upon [their own estimate of] themselves for their height all that drink water. For they are all delivered over to death to the lower world in the midst of the children of men with those who go down to the pit (the grave).
Ezekiel,31,15,Thus says the Lord God: When [Assyria] goes down to Sheol (the place of the dead) I will cause a mourning; I will cover the deep for it and I will restrain its floods and the many waters [that contributed to its prosperity] will be stayed; and I will cause Lebanon to be in black gloom and to mourn for it and all the trees of the field dismayed will faint because of it.
Ezekiel,31,16,I will make the nations quake at the sound of its fall when I cast it down to Sheol with those who descend into the pit and all the trees of Eden the choice and best of Lebanon all [the trees] that drink water will be comforted in the netherworld [at Assyria's downfall].
Ezekiel,31,17,They also shall go down into Sheol with it to those who were slain by the sword--yes those who were its arm who dwelt under its shadow in the midst of the nations.
Ezekiel,31,18,To whom [O Egypt] among the trees of Eden are you thus like in glory and in greatness? Yet you [also] shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the netherworld. You shall lie among the uncircumcised heathen with those who are slain by the sword. This is how it shall be with Pharaoh and all the multitude of his strength his tumult and his store [of wealth and glory] says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,32,1,IN THE twelfth year [after King Jehoiachin of Judah was taken into exile by the king of Babylon] in the twelfth month on the first day of the month the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,32,2,Son of man take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him You have likened [yourself] to a young lion leader of the nations but you are like a [monster] dragon in the seas; you break forth in your rivers and trouble the waters with your feet and you make foul their rivers [the sources of their prosperity].
Ezekiel,32,3,Thus says the Lord God: I will therefore throw out My net over you with a host of many peoples and they shall bring you up in My dragnet.
Ezekiel,32,4,Then I will leave you [Egypt] upon the shore; I will cast you on the open field and will cause all the birds of the heavens to settle upon you and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with you.
Ezekiel,32,5,And I will scatter your flesh upon the mountains and fill the valleys with your high heap of corpses and their worms.
Ezekiel,32,6,I will also water with your flowing blood the land even to the mountains and the hollows and water channels shall be full of you.
Ezekiel,32,7,And when I have extinguished you I will cover the heavens [of Egypt] and make their stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon shall not give her light.
Ezekiel,32,8,All the bright lights of the heavens I will make dark over you and set darkness upon your land says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,32,9,I will also trouble and vex the hearts of many peoples when I bring your breaking and trembling and destruction and carry you captive among the nations into the countries which you have not known.
Ezekiel,32,10,I will make many peoples amazed and appalled at you [Egypt] and their kings shall shudder and be horribly afraid because of you when I brandish My sword before them; they shall tremble every moment every man for his own life in the day of your downfall.
Ezekiel,32,11,For thus says the Lord God: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you.
Ezekiel,32,12,I will cause your multitude your tumult and your store [of wealth strength and glory] to fall by the swords of the mighty--the most terrible among the nations are they all. And they shall bring to nothing the pomp and pride of Egypt and all its multitude [with its activity and its wealth in every sphere] shall be destroyed.
Ezekiel,32,13,I will destroy also all its beasts from beside many and great waters and no foot of man shall trouble them any more nor shall the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
Ezekiel,32,14,Then will I make their waters sink down (subside be quiet and become clear); their rivers I will cause to run [slowly and smoothly] like oil says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,32,15,When I make the land of Egypt desolate and the country is stripped and destitute of all that of which it was full when I smite all those who dwell in it then will they know understand and realize that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who requires and calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,32,16,This is the lamentation with which they shall intone or chant the lament for her; the daughters of the nations shall chant their lament with it; over Egypt and over all her multitude her tumult and her wealth in every sphere shall they chant it says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,32,17,In the twelfth year [after King Jehoiachin of Judah was taken into exile] on the fifteenth day of the month the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,32,18,Son of man wail over the multitude of Egypt and cast them down even her and the daughters of the famous and majestic nations to the netherworld with those who go down to the pit;
Ezekiel,32,19,Whom [among them] do you surpass in beauty? Go down and be laid with the uncircumcised (the heathen).
Ezekiel,32,20,They shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword; she [Egypt] is delivered to the sword; they draw her down [to her judgment] and all her multitudes [with their noise and stores].
Ezekiel,32,21,The strong among the mighty shall speak of [Pharaoh] out of the midst of Sheol (the place of the dead the netherworld) with those who helped him; they are gone down; they lie still even the uncircumcised (the heathen) slain by the sword.
Ezekiel,32,22,Assyria is there and all her company; their graves are round about her all of them slain fallen by the sword
Ezekiel,32,23,Whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit and whose company is round about her grave all of them slain fallen by the sword who caused terror to spread in the land of the living.
Ezekiel,32,24,Elam [an auxiliary of Assyria] is there and all her multitude round about her grave all of them slain fallen by the sword who have gone down uncircumcised into the netherworld who caused their terror to spread in the land of the living and have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit.
Ezekiel,32,25,They have set her a bed (a sepulcher) among the slain with all her multitude--their graves round about her all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword for their terror had spread in the land of the living and they henceforth bear their shame with those who go down to the pit; they are laid in the midst of the slain.
Ezekiel,32,26,Meshech Tubal and all their multitude are there; their graves are round about [Pharaoh] all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword for they caused their terror to be spread in the land of the living.
Ezekiel,32,27,And they shall not lie with the mighty who have fallen of the uncircumcised [and] who have gone down to Sheol (the place of the dead the netherworld) with their weapons of war whose swords were laid [with honors] under their heads and whose iniquities are upon their bones for they caused their terror to spread in the land of the living.
Ezekiel,32,28,But you [Meshech and Tubal] shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised and shall lie [without honors] with those who are slain with the sword.
Ezekiel,32,29,Edom is there her kings and all her princes who for all their might are laid with those who were slain by the sword; they shall lie with the uncircumcised (the heathen) and with those who go down to the pit.
Ezekiel,32,30,The princes of the north are there all of them and all the Sidonians who have gone down with the slain; for all the terror which they caused by their might they are put to shame and they lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword and henceforth bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.
Ezekiel,32,31,When Pharaoh sees them he will comfort himself for all his multitude--even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,32,32,For I have put his and My terror in the land of the living and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised (the heathen) with those slain by the sword even Pharaoh and all his multitude says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,33,1,AND THE word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,33,2,Son of man speak to your people [the Israelite captives in Babylon] and say to them When I bring the sword upon a land and the people of the land take a man from among them and make him their watchman
Ezekiel,33,3,If when he sees the sword coming upon the land he blows the trumpet and warns the people
Ezekiel,33,4,Then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning and the sword comes and takes him away his blood shall be upon his own head.
Ezekiel,33,5,He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But he who takes warning shall save his life.
Ezekiel,33,6,But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet and the people are not warned and the sword comes and takes any one of them he is taken away in and for his perversity and iniquity but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
Ezekiel,33,7,So you son of man I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at My mouth and give them warning from Me.
Ezekiel,33,8,When I say to the wicked O wicked man you shall surely die and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his perversity and iniquity but his blood will I require at your hand.
Ezekiel,33,9,But if you warn the wicked to turn from his evil way and he does not turn from his evil way he shall die in his iniquity but you will have saved your life.
Ezekiel,33,10,And you son of man say to the house of Israel Thus you have said: Truly our transgressions and our sins are upon us and we waste away because of them; how then can we live?
Ezekiel,33,11,Say to them As I live says the Lord God I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but rather that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn back turn back from your evil ways for why will you die O house of Israel?
Ezekiel,33,12,And you son of man say to your people The uprightness and justice of the [uncompromisingly] righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wicked lawlessness of the wicked lawless he shall not fall because of it in the day that he turns from his wickedness neither shall the rigidly upright and just be able to live because of his past righteousness in the day that he sins and misses the mark [in keeping in harmony and right standing with God].
Ezekiel,33,13,When I shall say to the [uncompromisingly] righteous that he shall surely live and he trusts to his own righteousness [to save him] and commits iniquity (heinous sin) all his righteous deeds shall not be [seriously] remembered; but for his perversity and iniquity that he has committed he shall die.
Ezekiel,33,14,Again when I have said to the wicked You shall surely die if he turns from his sin and does that which is lawful and right--
Ezekiel,33,15,If the wicked restores [what he took in] pledge gives back what he had taken in robbery walks in the statutes of life [right relationship with God] without committing iniquity he shall surely live; he shall not die.
Ezekiel,33,16,None of his sins that he has committed shall be [seriously] remembered against him; he has done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
Ezekiel,33,17,Yet your people say The way of the Lord is not perfect or even just; but as for them it is their own way that is not perfect or even just.
Ezekiel,33,18,When the righteous turns back from his [uncompromising] righteousness and commits perverseness and iniquity he shall even die in and because of it.
Ezekiel,33,19,But if the wicked turns back from his wickedness and does what is lawful and right he shall live because of it.
Ezekiel,33,20,Yet you say The way of the Lord is not perfect or [even] just. O you house of Israel I will judge you every one according to his own ways!
Ezekiel,33,21,In the twelfth year of our captivity [in Babylon] in the tenth [month] on the fifth [day] of the month a man who had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me [Ezekiel] saying The city [Jerusalem] is taken.
Ezekiel,33,22,Now the hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening before this one who had escaped came and He had opened my mouth [in readiness for the fugitives] coming to me in the morning and my mouth was opened and I was no longer dumb.
Ezekiel,33,23,Then the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,33,24,Son of man those [back in Palestine] who inhabit those wastes of the ground of Israel are saying Abraham was only one man and he inherited the land but we are many; the land is surely given to us to possess as our inheritance.
Ezekiel,33,25,Therefore say to them Thus says the Lord God: You eat meat with the blood [as an idolatrous rite] and lift up your eyes to your [filthy] idols and shed blood; shall you then possess the land?
Ezekiel,33,26,You stand upon your sword [as your dependence]; you commit abominations and each of you defiles your neighbor's wife; shall you then possess the land?
Ezekiel,33,27,Say this to them Thus says the Lord God: As I live surely those who are in the waste places shall fall by the sword and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured and those who are in strongholds and in caves shall die by pestilence.
Ezekiel,33,28,And I will make the land [of Israel] a desolation and a waste and her proud might shall cease and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that no one will pass through them.
Ezekiel,33,29,Then shall they know understand and realize that I am the Lord when I have made the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations which they have committed.
Ezekiel,33,30,As for you son of man your people who talk of you by the walls and in the doors of the houses say one to another every one to his brother Come and hear what the word is that comes forth from the Lord.
Ezekiel,33,31,And they come to you as people come and they sit before you as My people and they hear the words you say but they will not do them; for with their mouths they show much love but their hearts go after and are set on their [idolatrous greed for] gain.
Ezekiel,33,32,Behold you are to them as a very lovely [love] song of one who has a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument for they hear your words but do not do them.
Ezekiel,33,33,When this comes to pass--for behold it will come!--then shall they know understand and realize that a prophet has been among them.
Ezekiel,34,1,AND THE word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,34,2,Son of man speak to your people [the Israelite captives in Babylon] and say to them When I bring the sword upon a land and the people of the land take a man from among them and make him their watchman
Ezekiel,34,3,If when he sees the sword coming upon the land he blows the trumpet and warns the people
Ezekiel,34,4,Then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning and the sword comes and takes him away his blood shall be upon his own head.
Ezekiel,34,5,He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But he who takes warning shall save his life.
Ezekiel,34,6,But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet and the people are not warned and the sword comes and takes any one of them he is taken away in and for his perversity and iniquity but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
Ezekiel,34,7,So you son of man I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at My mouth and give them warning from Me.
Ezekiel,34,8,When I say to the wicked O wicked man you shall surely die and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his perversity and iniquity but his blood will I require at your hand.
Ezekiel,34,9,But if you warn the wicked to turn from his evil way and he does not turn from his evil way he shall die in his iniquity but you will have saved your life.
Ezekiel,34,10,And you son of man say to the house of Israel Thus you have said: Truly our transgressions and our sins are upon us and we waste away because of them; how then can we live?
Ezekiel,34,11,Say to them As I live says the Lord God I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but rather that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn back turn back from your evil ways for why will you die O house of Israel?
Ezekiel,34,12,And you son of man say to your people The uprightness and justice of the [uncompromisingly] righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wicked lawlessness of the wicked lawless he shall not fall because of it in the day that he turns from his wickedness neither shall the rigidly upright and just be able to live because of his past righteousness in the day that he sins and misses the mark [in keeping in harmony and right standing with God].
Ezekiel,34,13,When I shall say to the [uncompromisingly] righteous that he shall surely live and he trusts to his own righteousness [to save him] and commits iniquity (heinous sin) all his righteous deeds shall not be [seriously] remembered; but for his perversity and iniquity that he has committed he shall die.
Ezekiel,34,14,Again when I have said to the wicked You shall surely die if he turns from his sin and does that which is lawful and right--
Ezekiel,34,15,If the wicked restores [what he took in] pledge gives back what he had taken in robbery walks in the statutes of life [right relationship with God] without committing iniquity he shall surely live; he shall not die.
Ezekiel,34,16,None of his sins that he has committed shall be [seriously] remembered against him; he has done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
Ezekiel,34,17,Yet your people say The way of the Lord is not perfect or even just; but as for them it is their own way that is not perfect or even just.
Ezekiel,34,18,When the righteous turns back from his [uncompromising] righteousness and commits perverseness and iniquity he shall even die in and because of it.
Ezekiel,34,19,But if the wicked turns back from his wickedness and does what is lawful and right he shall live because of it.
Ezekiel,34,20,Yet you say The way of the Lord is not perfect or [even] just. O you house of Israel I will judge you every one according to his own ways!
Ezekiel,34,21,In the twelfth year of our captivity [in Babylon] in the tenth [month] on the fifth [day] of the month a man who had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me [Ezekiel] saying The city [Jerusalem] is taken.
Ezekiel,34,22,Now the hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening before this one who had escaped came and He had opened my mouth [in readiness for the fugitives] coming to me in the morning and my mouth was opened and I was no longer dumb.
Ezekiel,34,23,Then the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,34,24,Son of man those [back in Palestine] who inhabit those wastes of the ground of Israel are saying Abraham was only one man and he inherited the land but we are many; the land is surely given to us to possess as our inheritance.
Ezekiel,34,25,Therefore say to them Thus says the Lord God: You eat meat with the blood [as an idolatrous rite] and lift up your eyes to your [filthy] idols and shed blood; shall you then possess the land?
Ezekiel,34,26,You stand upon your sword [as your dependence]; you commit abominations and each of you defiles your neighbor's wife; shall you then possess the land?
Ezekiel,34,27,Say this to them Thus says the Lord God: As I live surely those who are in the waste places shall fall by the sword and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured and those who are in strongholds and in caves shall die by pestilence.
Ezekiel,34,28,And I will make the land [of Israel] a desolation and a waste and her proud might shall cease and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that no one will pass through them.
Ezekiel,34,29,Then shall they know understand and realize that I am the Lord when I have made the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations which they have committed.
Ezekiel,34,30,As for you son of man your people who talk of you by the walls and in the doors of the houses say one to another every one to his brother Come and hear what the word is that comes forth from the Lord.
Ezekiel,34,31,And they come to you as people come and they sit before you as My people and they hear the words you say but they will not do them; for with their mouths they show much love but their hearts go after and are set on their [idolatrous greed for] gain.
Ezekiel,35,1,MOREOVER THE word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,35,2,Son of man set your face against the mountain [range of] Seir [in Edom] and prophesy against it
Ezekiel,35,3,And say to it Thus says the Lord God: Behold O Mount Seir I am against you and I will stretch out My hand against you and I will make you a desolation and an astonishment.
Ezekiel,35,4,I will lay your cities waste and you shall be desolate and you shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,35,5,Because you [of Esau] have had a perpetual enmity [for Jacob] and you gave over the sons of Israel to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity when they were suffering their final punishment [the Babylonian conquest]
Ezekiel,35,6,Therefore as I live says the Lord God I will expose you to slaughter and slaughter shall pursue you; since you could not bear to live without bloodshed therefore bloodshed shall pursue you.
Ezekiel,35,7,Thus will I make Mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation and I will cut off from it him who passes through it and him who returns [that way].
Ezekiel,35,8,And I will fill [Edom's] mountains with his slain men; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines shall those fall who are slain with the sword.
Ezekiel,35,9,I will make you a perpetual desolation and your cities shall not be inhabited. Then you will know understand and realize that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,35,10,Because you [Edom] said These two nations [Israel and Judah] and these two countries shall be mine and we will take possession of them--although the Lord was there
Ezekiel,35,11,Therefore as I live says the Lord God I will deal with you according to the anger and envy you showed because of your enmity for them and I will make Myself known among them [as He Who will judge and punish] when I judge and punish you.
Ezekiel,35,12,And you shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service] and that I have heard all your revilings and scornful speeches that you have uttered against the mountains of Israel saying They are laid waste and desolate; they are given to us to devour.
Ezekiel,35,13,Thus you have boasted and magnified yourselves against Me with your mouth multiplying your words against Me; I have heard it.
Ezekiel,35,14,Thus says the Lord God: While the whole earth rejoices I will make you a waste and desolation.
Ezekiel,35,15,As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate so will I deal with you; you shall be a waste and desolation O Mount Seir and all Edom all of it. Then they shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,36,1,ALSO YOU son of man prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say You mountains of Israel hear the word of the Lord.
Ezekiel,36,2,Thus says the Lord God: Because the enemy has said over you Aha! and The ancient heights have become our possession
Ezekiel,36,3,Therefore prophesy and say Thus says the Lord God: Because yes because they made you a desolation and they snapped after and crushed you from every side so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations and you became the talk and evil gossip of the people
Ezekiel,36,4,Therefore O mountains of Israel hear the word of the Lord God: Thus says the Lord God to the mountains and hills to the ravines and valleys to the desolate wastes and the cities that are forsaken that have become a prey and derision to the rest of the nations that are round about;
Ezekiel,36,5,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Surely in the fire of My hot jealousy have I spoken against the rest of the nations and against all Edom who have given to themselves My land with wholehearted joy and with uttermost contempt that they might empty it out and possess it for a prey and a spoil.
Ezekiel,36,6,Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and hills to the ravines and valleys Thus says the Lord God: Behold I have spoken in My jealousy and in My wrath because you have suffered the shame and reproach of the nations;
Ezekiel,36,7,Therefore thus says the Lord God: I have lifted up My hand and sworn Surely the nations that are round about you shall themselves suffer shame and reproach.
Ezekiel,36,8,But you O mountains of Israel shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to My people Israel for they are soon to come [home].
Ezekiel,36,9,For behold I am for you and I will turn to you; and you shall be tilled and sown
Ezekiel,36,10,And I will multiply men upon you the whole house of Israel even all of it; the cities shall be inhabited and the waste places shall be rebuilt
Ezekiel,36,11,And I will multiply upon you man and beast and they shall increase and be fruitful. And I will cause you to be inhabited according to your former estate and I will do better for you than at your beginnings; and you shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,36,12,Yes [O mountains of Israel] I will cause men to walk upon you even My people Israel and they shall possess you and you shall be their inheritance; and you shall no more after this bereave them of children [for idol sacrifices].
Ezekiel,36,13,Thus says the Lord God: Because they say to you You [O land] are a devourer of men and have bereaved your nation of children [offered to idols]
Ezekiel,36,14,Therefore you shall devour men no more neither bereave your nation or cause it to stumble any more says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,36,15,Neither will I let you hear any more the reproach of the nations nor shall you suffer the dishonor of the peoples any more nor shall you cause your nation to stumble and fall any more [through idolatry] says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,36,16,Moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,36,17,Son of man when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land they defiled it by [doing] their [own] way and by their [idolatrous] doings. Their conduct before Me was like the uncleanness of a woman during her [physical] impurity.
Ezekiel,36,18,So I poured out My wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land and for their idols with which they had defiled it.
Ezekiel,36,19,And I scattered them among the nations and they were dispersed through the countries; according to their conduct and their [idolatrous] deeds I judged and punished them.
Ezekiel,36,20,And when they came to the nations to which they went they profaned My holy name in that men said of them These are the people of the Lord and yet they had to go forth out of His land.
Ezekiel,36,21,But I had regard concern and compassion for My holy name which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they went.
Ezekiel,36,22,Therefore say to the house of Israel Thus says the Lord God: I do not do this for your sakes O house of Israel but for My holy name's sake which you have profaned among the nations to which you went.
Ezekiel,36,23,And I will vindicate the holiness of My great name and separate it for its holy purpose from all that defiles it--My name which has been profaned among the nations which you have profaned among them--and the nations will know understand and realize that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service] when I shall be set apart by you and My holiness vindicated in you before their eyes and yours.
Ezekiel,36,24,For I will take you from among the nations and gather you out of all countries and bring you into your own land.
Ezekiel,36,25,Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your uncleanness; and from all your idols will I cleanse you.
Ezekiel,36,26,A new heart will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.
Ezekiel,36,27,And I will put my Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes and you shall heed My ordinances and do them.
Ezekiel,36,28,And you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and you shall be My people and I will be your God.
Ezekiel,36,29,I will also save you from all your uncleannesses and I will call forth the grain and make it abundant and lay no famine on you.
Ezekiel,36,30,And I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field that you may no more suffer the reproach and disgrace of famine among the nations.
Ezekiel,36,31,Then you shall [earnestly] remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominable deeds.
Ezekiel,36,32,Not for your sake do I do this says the Lord God; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your [own] wicked ways O house of Israel!
Ezekiel,36,33,Thus says the Lord God: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities I will [also] cause [Israel's] cities to be inhabited and the waste places shall be rebuilt.
Ezekiel,36,34,And the desolate land shall be tilled that which had lain desolate in the sight of all who passed by.
Ezekiel,36,35,And they shall say This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.
Ezekiel,36,36,Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I the Lord have rebuilt the ruined places and replanted that which was desolate. I the Lord have spoken it and I will do it.
Ezekiel,36,37,Thus says the Lord God: For this also I will let the house of Israel inquire of Me to do it for them; I will increase their men like a flock.
Ezekiel,36,38,Like the flock of holy things for sacrifice like the flock of Jerusalem in her [solemn] appointed feasts so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,37,1,THE HAND of the Lord was upon me and He brought me out in the Spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.
Ezekiel,37,2,And He caused me to pass round about among them and behold there were very many [human bones] in the open valley or plain and behold they were very dry.
Ezekiel,37,3,And He said to me Son of man can these bones live? And I answered O Lord God You know!
Ezekiel,37,4,Again He said to me Prophesy to these bones and say to them O you dry bones hear the word of the Lord.
Ezekiel,37,5,Thus says the Lord God to these bones: Behold I will cause breath and spirit to enter you and you shall live;
Ezekiel,37,6,And I will lay sinews upon you and bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and I will put breath and spirit in you and you [dry bones] shall live; and you shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,37,7,So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied there was a [thundering] noise and behold a shaking and trembling and a rattling and the bones came together bone to its bone.
Ezekiel,37,8,And I looked and behold there were sinews upon [the bones] and flesh came upon them and skin covered them over but there was no breath or spirit in them.
Ezekiel,37,9,Then said He to me Prophesy to the breath and spirit son of man and say to the breath and spirit Thus says the Lord God: Come from the four winds O breath and spirit and breathe upon these slain that they may live.
Ezekiel,37,10,So I prophesied as He commanded me and the breath and spirit came into [the bones] and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceedingly great host.
Ezekiel,37,11,Then He said to me Son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold they say Our bones are dried up and our hope is lost; we are completely cut off.
Ezekiel,37,12,Therefore prophesy and say to them Thus says the Lord God: Behold I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves O My people; and I will bring you [back home] to the land of Israel.
Ezekiel,37,13,And you shall know that I am the Lord [your Sovereign Ruler] when I have opened your graves and caused you to come up out of your graves O My people.
Ezekiel,37,14,And I shall put My Spirit in you and you shall live and I shall place you in your own land. Then you shall know understand and realize that I the Lord have spoken it and performed it says the Lord.
Ezekiel,37,15,The word of the Lord came again to me saying
Ezekiel,37,16,Son of man take a stick and write on it For Judah and the children of Israel his companions; then take another stick and write upon it For Joseph the stick of Ephraim and all the house of Israel his companions;
Ezekiel,37,17,And join them together into one stick that they may become one in your hand.
Ezekiel,37,18,And when your people say to you Will you not show us what you mean by these?
Ezekiel,37,19,Say to them Thus says the Lord God: Behold I will take the stick of Joseph--which is in the hand of Ephraim--and the tribes of Israel his associates and will join with it the stick of Judah and make them one stick and they shall be one in My hand.
Ezekiel,37,20,When the sticks on which you write shall be in your hand before their eyes
Ezekiel,37,21,Then say to them Thus says the Lord God: Behold I will take the children of Israel from among the nations to which they have gone and will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land.
Ezekiel,37,22,And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel and one King shall be King over them all; and they shall be no longer two nations neither be divided into two kingdoms any more.
Ezekiel,37,23,They shall not defile themselves any more with their idols and their detestable things or with any of their transgressions but I will save them out of all their dwelling places and from all their backslidings in which they have sinned and I will cleanse them. So shall they be My people and I will be their God.
Ezekiel,37,24,And David My Servant shall be King over them and they all shall have one Shepherd. They shall also walk in My ordinances and heed My statutes and do them.
Ezekiel,37,25,They shall dwell in the land in which your fathers dwelt that I gave to My servant Jacob and they shall dwell there they and their children and their children's children forever; and My Servant David shall be their Prince forever.
Ezekiel,37,26,I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them and I will give blessings to them and multiply them and will set My sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore.
Ezekiel,37,27,My tabernacle or dwelling place also shall be with them; and I will be their God and they shall be My people.
Ezekiel,37,28,Then the nations shall know understand and realize that I the Lord do set apart and consecrate Israel for holy use when My sanctuary shall be in their midst forevermore.
Ezekiel,38,1,AND THE word of the Lord came to me saying
Ezekiel,38,2,Son of man set your face against Gog of the land of Magog the prince of Rosh of Meshech and of Tubal and prophesy against him
Ezekiel,38,3,And say Thus says the Lord God: Behold I am against you O Gog chief prince (ruler) of Rosh of Meshech and of Tubal.
Ezekiel,38,4,And I will turn you back and put hooks into your jaws and I will bring you forth and all your army horses and horsemen all of them clothed in full armor a great company with buckler and shield all of them handling swords--
Ezekiel,38,5,Persia Cush and Put or Libya with them all of them with shield and helmet
Ezekiel,38,6,Gomer and all his hordes the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north and all his hordes--many people are with you.
Ezekiel,38,7,You [Gog] be prepared; yes prepare yourself you and all your companies that are assembled about you and you be a guard and a commander for them.
Ezekiel,38,8,After many days you shall be visited and mustered [for service]; in the latter years you shall go against the land that is restored from the ravages of the sword where people are gathered out of many nations upon the mountains of Israel which had been a continual waste; but its [people] are brought forth out of the nations and they shall dwell securely all of them.
Ezekiel,38,9,You shall ascend and come like a storm; you shall be like a cloud to cover the land you and all your hosts and many people with you.
Ezekiel,38,10,Thus says the Lord God: At the same time thoughts shall come into your mind and you will devise an evil plan.
Ezekiel,38,11,And you will say I will go up against an open country [the land of unwalled villages]; I will fall upon those who are at rest who dwell securely all of them dwelling without walls and having neither bars nor gates
Ezekiel,38,12,To take spoil and prey to turn your hand upon the desolate places now inhabited and assail the people gathered out of the nations who have obtained livestock and goods who dwell at the center of the earth [Palestine].
Ezekiel,38,13,Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish with all their lionlike cubs [or satellite areas] shall say to you Have you come to take spoil? Have you gathered your hosts to take the prey? To carry away silver and gold to take away livestock and goods to take a great spoil?
Ezekiel,38,14,Therefore son of man prophesy and say to Gog Thus says the Lord God: In that day when My people Israel dwell securely will you not know it and be aroused?
Ezekiel,38,15,And you will come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north you and many peoples with you all of them riding on horses a great host a mighty army.
Ezekiel,38,16,And you shall come up against My people Israel like a cloud to cover the land. In the latter days I will bring you against My land that the nations may know understand and realize Me when My holiness shall be vindicated through you [vindicated and honored in your overwhelming destruction] O Gog before their eyes.
Ezekiel,38,17,Thus says the Lord God: Are you he of whom I have spoken in olden times by My servants the prophets of Israel who prophesied in those days for years that I would bring you [Gog] against them?
Ezekiel,38,18,But in that day when Gog shall come against the land of Israel says the Lord God My wrath shall come up into My nostrils.
Ezekiel,38,19,For in My jealousy and in the fire of My wrath have I said Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking or cosmic catastrophe in the land of Israel
Ezekiel,38,20,So that the fishes of the sea and the birds of the heavens the beasts of the field and all creeping things that creep upon the earth and all the men that are upon the face of the earth shall tremble and shake at My presence; and the mountains shall be thrown down and the steep places shall fall and every wall [natural or artificial] shall fall to the ground.
Ezekiel,38,21,And I will call for a sword against [Gog] throughout all My mountains says the Lord God every man's sword shall be against his brother [over the dividing of booty].
Ezekiel,38,22,And with pestilence and with bloodshed will I enter into judgment with [Gog] and I will rain upon him and upon his hordes and upon the many peoples that are with him torrents of rain and great hailstones fire and brimstone.
Ezekiel,38,23,Thus will I demonstrate My greatness and My holiness and I will be recognized understood and known in the eyes of many nations; yes they shall know that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,39,1,AND YOU son of man prophesy against Gog Thus says the Lord God: Behold I am against you O Gog chief prince (ruler) of Rosh of Meshech and of Tubal.
Ezekiel,39,2,And I will turn you about and will lead you on and will cause you to come up from the uttermost parts of the north and will lead you against the mountains of Israel;
Ezekiel,39,3,And I will smite your bow from your left hand and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand.
Ezekiel,39,4,You shall fall [dead] upon the mountains of Israel you and all your hosts and the peoples who are with you. I will give you to the ravenous birds of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.
Ezekiel,39,5,You shall fall in the open field for I have spoken [it] says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,39,6,I will send fire on Magog and upon those who dwell securely in the coastlands and they shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
Ezekiel,39,7,And I will make My holy name known in the midst of My people Israel and I will not let them profane My holy name any more; and the nations shall know understand and realize that I am the Lord the Holy One of Israel.
Ezekiel,39,8,Behold it is coming and it will be done says the Lord God; that is the day of which I have spoken.
Ezekiel,39,9,And [when you Gog are no longer] they who dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth and shall set on fire and burn the battle gear the shields and the bucklers the bows and the arrows the handspikes or riding whips and the spears; and they shall burn them as fuel for seven years
Ezekiel,39,10,So that My people shall take no firewood out of the field or cut down any out of the forests for they shall make their fires of the weapons. And they shall despoil those who despoiled them and plunder those who plundered them says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,39,11,And in that day I will give to Gog a place for burial there in Israel the valley of those who pass through on the east side in front of the [Dead] Sea [the highway between Syria Petra and Egypt] and it will delay and stop those who pass through. And there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude and they shall call it the Valley of Hamon-gog [multitude of Gog].
Ezekiel,39,12,For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them that they may cleanse the land.
Ezekiel,39,13,Yes all the people of the land will bury them and it shall bring them renown in the day that I shall be glorified says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,39,14,And they shall set apart men to work continually who shall pass through the land men commissioned to bury with the help of those who are passing by those bodies that lie unburied on the face of the ground in order to cleanse the land. After the end of seven months they shall make their search.
Ezekiel,39,15,And when these pass through the land and anyone sees a human bone he shall set up a marker by it as a sign to the buriers until they have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-gog or of Gog's multitude.
Ezekiel,39,16,And Hamonah [multitude] shall also be the name of the city [of the dead]. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
Ezekiel,39,17,And you son of man thus says the Lord God: Say to the birds of prey of every sort and to every beast of the field Assemble yourselves and come gather from every side to the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you even a great sacrificial feast on the mountains of Israel at which you may eat flesh and drink blood.
Ezekiel,39,18,You shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth of rams of lambs of goats and of bullocks all of them fatlings of Bashan [east of the Jordan].
Ezekiel,39,19,And you shall eat fat till you are filled and drink blood till you are drunk at the sacrificial feast which I am preparing for you.
Ezekiel,39,20,And you shall be filled at My table with horses and riders with mighty men and with soldiers of every kind says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,39,21,And I will manifest My honor and glory among the nations and all the nations shall see My judgment and justice [in the punishment] which I have executed and My hand which I have laid on them.
Ezekiel,39,22,So the house of Israel shall know understand and realize beyond all question that I am the Lord their God from that day forward.
Ezekiel,39,23,And the nations shall know understand and realize positively that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity because they trespassed against Me; and I hid My face from them. So I gave them into the hand of their enemies and they all fell [into captivity or were slain] by the power of the sword.
Ezekiel,39,24,According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I dealt with them and hid My face from them.
Ezekiel,39,25,Therefore thus says the Lord God: Now will I reverse the captivity of Jacob and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel and will be jealous for My holy name.
Ezekiel,39,26,They shall forget their shame and self-reproach and all their treachery and unfaithfulness in which they have transgressed against Me when they dwell securely in their land and there is none who makes them afraid.
Ezekiel,39,27,When I have brought them again from the peoples and gathered them out of their enemies' lands and My justice and holiness are set apart and vindicated through them in the sight of many nations
Ezekiel,39,28,Then shall they know understand and realize positively that I am the Lord their God because I sent them into captivity and exile among the nations and then gathered them to their own land. I will leave none of them remaining among the nations any more [in the latter days].
Ezekiel,39,29,Neither will I hide My face any more then from them when I have poured out My Spirit upon the house of Israel says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,40,1,IN THE twenty-fifth year of our captivity [by Babylon] in the beginning of the year on the tenth day of the month in the fourteenth year after the city [of Jerusalem] was taken on the very same day the hand of the Lord was upon me and He brought me to that place.
Ezekiel,40,2,In the visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel and set me down upon a very high mountain on the south side of which there was what seemed to be the structure of a city.
Ezekiel,40,3,He brought me there and behold there was a man [an angel] whose appearance was like bronze with a line of flax and a measuring reed in his hand and he stood in the gateway.
Ezekiel,40,4,And the man said to me Son of man look with your eyes and hear with your ears and set your heart and mind on all that I will show you for you are brought here that I may show them to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,40,5,And behold there was a wall all around the outside area of the house [of the Lord] and in the man's hand a measuring reed six long cubits in length each cubit being longer [than the usual one] by a handbreadth; so he measured the thickness of the wall one reed and the height one reed.
Ezekiel,40,6,Then he came to the gate which faced the east and went up its [seven] steps and measured the threshold of the gateway one reed broad and the other threshold of the gateway [inside the thick wall] one reed broad.
Ezekiel,40,7,And every room for the guards was one reed long and one reed broad and the space between the guardrooms or lodges was five cubits. And the threshold of the gate by the porch or vestibule of the gateway within was one reed.
Ezekiel,40,8,He measured also the porch or vestibule of the gate toward the house [of the Lord] one reed.
Ezekiel,40,9,Then he measured the porch or vestibule of the gateway eight cubits and its posts or jambs two cubits. And the porch or vestibule of the gate was inside [toward the house of the Lord].
Ezekiel,40,10,And the guardrooms or lodges of the east gateway were three on this side and three on that side; the three were the same size and the posts or jambs were the same size on either side.
Ezekiel,40,11,And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gateway ten cubits and the length of the gateway thirteen cubits.
Ezekiel,40,12,And a border or barrier before the guardrooms was one cubit on this side and a border or barrier one cubit on that side. And the guardrooms or lodges were six cubits on this side and six cubits on that side.
Ezekiel,40,13,And the man [an angel] measured the gate from the outer wall of one chamber or guardroom to the outer wall of another--a breadth of twenty-five cubits from door to door.
Ezekiel,40,14,And the open part of the porch or vestibule of the gateway on the outside was twenty cubits the chambers or guardrooms of the gate being round about.
Ezekiel,40,15,And including this porch or vestibule of the gate on the outside and the porch or vestibule on the inside the extent was fifty cubits.
Ezekiel,40,16,And there were closed windows to the guardrooms or chambers and to their posts or pillars within the gate round about and likewise to the archway or vestibule; and windows were round about facing into the court and upon each post or pillar were palm tree [decorations].
Ezekiel,40,17,Then he brought me into the outward court and behold there were chambers and a pavement round about the court; thirty chambers fronted on the pavement.
Ezekiel,40,18,And the pavement was along by the side of the gates answerable to the length of the gateways; this was the lower pavement.
Ezekiel,40,19,Then the man measured the distance from the inner front before the lower gate to the outer front of the inner court a hundred cubits both on the east and on the north.
Ezekiel,40,20,And the gate of the outward court which faced the north of it he measured both the length and the breadth.
Ezekiel,40,21,And its guardrooms or lodges three on this side and three on that side and its posts or pillars and archway or vestibule were the same size as those of the first gate; the length was fifty cubits and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
Ezekiel,40,22,And its windows and its archway or vestibule and its palm trees were of the same size as those of the gate that faces toward the east. It was reached by going up seven steps and the archway of its vestibule was on the inner side.
Ezekiel,40,23,Opposite the gate on the north and on the east was a gate to the inner court and he [the man with the measuring rod of reed] measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel,40,24,After that the man brought me toward the south and behold there was a gate on the south and he measured its posts or pillars and its archway or vestibule; they measured as the others did.
Ezekiel,40,25,And there were windows round about in it and in its archway or vestibule like those windows in the other gateways; its length was fifty cubits and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
Ezekiel,40,26,And there were seven steps going up to the gate and its archway or vestibule was on the inside. And it had palm trees one on this side and another on that side carved on its posts or pillars.
Ezekiel,40,27,And there was a gate to the inner court on the south and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel,40,28,And the man [an angel] brought me into the inner court by the south gate and he measured the south gate; its measurements were the same as those of the other gateways.
Ezekiel,40,29,And its guardrooms or chambers and its posts or pillars and its archway or vestibule measured as did the others. And there were windows in the gateway and in its archway or vestibule round about; its length was fifty cubits and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
Ezekiel,40,30,And there was an archway or a vestibule round about twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.
Ezekiel,40,31,And its [arched] vestibule faced the outer court; and palm trees were carved upon its posts or pillars and the steps going up to it were eight.
Ezekiel,40,32,And he brought me into the inner court toward the east and he measured the gate; it measured the same as the others.
Ezekiel,40,33,And its guardrooms or chambers and its posts or pillars and its archway or vestibule measured as did the others. And there were windows in it and in its [arched] vestibule round about; the gateway was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
Ezekiel,40,34,And its [arched] vestibule faced the outer court; and palm trees were carved upon its posts or pillars on either side and the steps leading to it were eight.
Ezekiel,40,35,And the man [an angel] brought me to the north gate and measured it; the measurements were the same as those of the other gates.
Ezekiel,40,36,Its guardrooms or chambers its posts or pillars its [arched] vestibule and the windows to it round about [were of the same size as the others]. The length of the gateway was fifty cubits and the width was twenty-five cubits.
Ezekiel,40,37,And its posts or pillars were toward the outer court and palm trees were carved upon them on either side. And the approach to it had eight steps.
Ezekiel,40,38,There was an attached chamber with its door beside the posts or pillars of the gates where the burnt offering was to be washed.
Ezekiel,40,39,And in the porch or vestibule of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side on which to slay the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass or guilt offering.
Ezekiel,40,40,And on the one side without as one goes up to the entrance of the gate to the north were two tables; and on the other side at the vestibule of the gate were two tables.
Ezekiel,40,41,Four tables were on the inside and four tables on the outside of the side of the gate eight tables upon which the sacrifices were to be slain.
Ezekiel,40,42,Moreover there were four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering a cubit and a half long a cubit and a half broad and one cubit high. Upon them were to be laid the instruments with which were slain the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
Ezekiel,40,43,And slabs or hooks a handbreadth long were fastened within [the room] round about. Upon the tables was to be placed the flesh of the offering.
Ezekiel,40,44,Then the man [an angel] led me [from without] into the inner court and behold there were two chambers in the inner court: one beside the north gate but facing the south and one beside the south gate but looking toward the north.
Ezekiel,40,45,And the man [an angel who was guiding me] said This chamber with its view to the south is for the priests who have charge of the house [of the Lord]
Ezekiel,40,46,And the chamber with its view to the north is for the priests who have charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok who alone among the sons of Levi may come near to the Lord to minister to Him.
Ezekiel,40,47,And he measured the court a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits broad foursquare; and the altar was in front of the house [of the Lord].
Ezekiel,40,48,Then he brought me to the porch or vestibule of the temple proper and he measured each post or pillar of the porch five cubits on either side. And the width of the gate was three cubits for this [leaf] and three cubits for that one.
Ezekiel,40,49,And the length of the porch or vestibule was twenty cubits and the breadth eleven cubits; and he brought me by the steps by which it was reached and there were two pillars standing on the posts [as bases] or beside them one on either side of the entrance.
Ezekiel,41,1,AND the man [an angel] brought me to [the Holy Place of] the temple and measured the wall pillars six cubits broad on one side [of the ten-cubit door] and six cubits broad on the other side which was the breadth of the tabernacle or tent [later called the temple].
Ezekiel,41,2,And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits and the leaves of the door were five cubits on the one side and five cubits on the other side; and he measured its length forty cubits and its breadth twenty cubits.
Ezekiel,41,3,Then the man [being an angel and unrestricted] went inside [the inner room but went alone] and measured each post of the door two cubits the doorway six cubits and the breadth of the entrance seven cubits.
Ezekiel,41,4,And he measured the length [of the interior of the second room] in the temple proper twenty cubits and the breadth twenty cubits; and he [came out and] said to me This is the Most Holy Place (the Holy of Holies).
Ezekiel,41,5,Then he measured the wall of the temple six cubits thick [to accommodate side chambers]; and the breadth of every side chamber four cubits round about the temple proper on every side.
Ezekiel,41,6,These side chambers were three stories high one over another and thirty in each story; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side chambers round about that they might have hold of the wall [of the house] but they did not have hold of the wall of the temple.
Ezekiel,41,7,And the side rooms became broader as they encompassed the temple higher and higher for the encircling of the house went higher and higher round about the temple; therefore the breadth of the house continued upward and so one went up from the lowest story to the highest one by way of the middle story [on a winding stairway].
Ezekiel,41,8,I saw also that the temple had an elevation or foundation platform round about it. The foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed measure of six long cubits.
Ezekiel,41,9,The thickness of the outer wall of the side chamber was five cubits as was the width of that part of the foundation that was left free of the side chambers that belonged to the house.
Ezekiel,41,10,And between [the free space of the foundation platform and] the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the temple on every side.
Ezekiel,41,11,And the doors of the attached side chambers opened on the free space that was left one door toward the north and another door toward the south; and the breadth of the space on the foundation platform that was left free was five cubits round about.
Ezekiel,41,12,And the building that faced the temple yard on the west side was seventy cubits broad and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about and its length ninety cubits.
Ezekiel,41,13,And the man [an angel in my vision] measured the temple a hundred cubits long; and the yard and the building with its walls a hundred cubits long;
Ezekiel,41,14,Also the breadth of the east front of the temple and the yard a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel,41,15,Then the man [an angel] measured the length of the building on the west side of the yard with its walls on either side a hundred cubits. The Holy Place of the temple the inner Holy of Holies and the outer vestibule
Ezekiel,41,16,Were roofed over and all three had latticed windows all around. The inside walls of the temple were paneled with wood round about from the floor up to the windows and from the windows to the roof
Ezekiel,41,17,Including the space above the door leading to the inner room inside and out. And on the walls round about in the inner room and the Holy Place were carvings
Ezekiel,41,18,With figures of cherubim and palm trees so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces
Ezekiel,41,19,So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. It was made this way through all the house round about.
Ezekiel,41,20,From the floor to above the entrance were cherubim and palm trees made and also on the wall of the temple [the Holy Place].
Ezekiel,41,21,The door frames of the temple were squared and in front [outside of the sanctuary or Holy of Holies] was what appeared to be
Ezekiel,41,22,An altar of wood three cubits high and two cubits long [and wide]; and its corners its base and its sides were of wood. And the man [an angel] said to me This is the table that is before the Lord.
Ezekiel,41,23,And the temple or Holy Place and the sanctuary or Holy of Holies had two doors [one for each of them].
Ezekiel,41,24,And the doors had two leaves apiece two folding leaves--two leaves for the one door and two leaves for the other door.
Ezekiel,41,25,And there were carved on them on the doors of the temple cherubim and palm trees like those carved upon the walls; and there was also a canopy of wood in front of the porch outside.
Ezekiel,41,26,And there were recessed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side of the porch. Thus were the side chambers and the canopies of the house.
Ezekiel,42,1,THEN the man [an angel] brought me forth into the outer court northward and he brought me to the attached chambers that were opposite the temple yard and were opposite the building on the north.
Ezekiel,42,2,Before the long side of one hundred cubits was the door toward the north and the breadth was fifty cubits.
Ezekiel,42,3,Adjoining the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court was balcony facing balcony in three stories.
Ezekiel,42,4,And before the attached chambers was a walk inward of ten cubits breadth and a hundred cubits long and their doors were on the north.
Ezekiel,42,5,Now the upper chambers were shorter for the balconies took off from these more than from the lower and middle chambers of the building.
Ezekiel,42,6,For they were in three stories but did not have pillars as the pillars of the [outer] court; therefore the upper chambers were set back more than the lower and the middle ones from the ground.
Ezekiel,42,7,And the wall or fence that was outside opposite and parallel to the chambers toward the outer court before the chambers was fifty cubits long
Ezekiel,42,8,For the length of the [combined] chambers that were on the outer court was fifty cubits while [the length] of those opposite the temple was a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel,42,9,And under these chambers was the entrance on the east side as one approached them from the outer court.
Ezekiel,42,10,In the breadth of the wall of the court going toward the east before the yard and before the building were the chambers
Ezekiel,42,11,With a passage before them that gave the appearance of the attached chambers on the north of the same length and breadth with similar exits and arrangements and doors.
Ezekiel,42,12,And like the doors of the chambers that were toward the south there was an entrance at the head of the way the way before the dividing wall toward the east as one enters them.
Ezekiel,42,13,Then said the man [an angel] to me The north chambers and the south chambers which are opposite the yard are the holy chambers where the priests who approach the Lord shall eat the most holy offerings; there shall they lay the most holy things--the meal offering the sin offering and the trespass or guilt offering--for the place is holy.
Ezekiel,42,14,When the priests enter the Holy Place they shall not go out of it into the outer court unless they lay aside there the garments in which they minister for these are holy separate and set apart. They shall put on other garments before they approach that which is for the people.
Ezekiel,42,15,Now when he had finished measuring the inner temple area he brought me forth toward the gate which faces east and measured it [the outer area] round about.
Ezekiel,42,16,He measured the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.
Ezekiel,42,17,He measured the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.
Ezekiel,42,18,He measured the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
Ezekiel,42,19,He turned about to the west side and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
Ezekiel,42,20,He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall round about the length five hundred reeds and the breadth five hundred to make a separation between that which was holy [the temple proper] and that which was common [the outer area].
Ezekiel,43,1,AFTERWARD the man [an angel] brought me to the gate the gate that faces east.
Ezekiel,43,2,And behold the glory of the God of Israel came from the east and His voice was like the sound of many waters and the earth shone with His glory.
Ezekiel,43,3,And the vision which I saw was like the vision I had seen when I came to foretell the destruction of the city and like the vision I had seen beside the river Chebar [near Babylon]; and I fell on my face.
Ezekiel,43,4,And the glory of the Lord entered the temple by the gate facing east.
Ezekiel,43,5,Then the Spirit caught me up and brought me into the inner court and behold the glory of the Lord filled the temple.
Ezekiel,43,6,And I heard One speaking to me out of the temple and a Man stood by me.
Ezekiel,43,7,And He [the Lord] said to me Son of man this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever; and My holy name the house of Israel shall no more profane neither they nor their kings by their [idolatrous] harlotry nor by the dead bodies and monuments of their kings
Ezekiel,43,8,Nor by setting their threshold by My thresholds and their doorposts by My doorposts with a mere wall between Me and them. They have profaned My holy name by their abominations which they have committed; therefore I have consumed them in My anger.
Ezekiel,43,9,Now let them put away their [idolatrous] harlotry and the dead bodies and monuments of their kings far from Me and I will dwell in their midst forever.
Ezekiel,43,10,Son of man show the temple by your description of it to the house of Israel that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure accurately its appearance and plan.
Ezekiel,43,11,And if they are ashamed of all that they have done make known to them the form of the temple and the arrangement of it--its exits and its entrances and the whole form of it--all its ordinances and all its forms and all its laws. And write it down in their sight so that they may keep the whole form of it and all the ordinances of it and do them.
Ezekiel,43,12,This is the law of the house [of the Lord]: The whole area round about on the top of the mountain [Mount Moriah] shall be most holy separated and set apart. Behold this is the law of the house [of the Lord].
Ezekiel,43,13,And these are the measurements of the altar [of burnt offering] in cubits. The cubit is a royal cubit [the length of a forearm and a palm of the hand]; the bottom or gutter shall be a cubit deep and a cubit wide with a rim or lip round about it of a span's breadth. And this shall be the height of the altar:
Ezekiel,43,14,From the bottom or gutter on the ground to the lower ledge or brim shall be two cubits and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits and the breadth one cubit.
Ezekiel,43,15,And the altar hearth shall be four cubits high and from the altar hearth reaching upward there shall be four horns one cubit high.
Ezekiel,43,16,And the altar hearth shall be square--twelve cubits long twelve broad square in its four sides.
Ezekiel,43,17,And the ledge shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits broad on its four sides and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and its bottom or gutter shall be a cubit deep and wide and its ascent [not steps] shall face the east.
Ezekiel,43,18,And [the Lord] said to me Son of man thus says the Lord God: These are the regulations for the use of the altar in the day that it is erected upon which to offer burnt offerings and to sprinkle blood against it:
Ezekiel,43,19,You shall give to the priests the Levites who are of the offspring of Zadok who are near to Me to minister to Me says the Lord God a young bull for a sin offering.
Ezekiel,43,20,And you shall take of its blood and put it on the four horns of [the altar of burnt offering] and on the four corners of the ledge and on the rim or border round about. Thus shall you cleanse and make atonement for [the altar].
Ezekiel,43,21,You shall also take the bullock of the sin offering and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the temple outside the sacred enclosure.
Ezekiel,43,22,And on the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering. Thus the altar shall be cleansed as it was cleansed with the bullock.
Ezekiel,43,23,When you have finished cleansing it you shall offer a young bull without blemish and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
Ezekiel,43,24,And you shall bring them near before the Lord and the priests shall cast salt upon them and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to the Lord.
Ezekiel,43,25,Seven days you shall prepare every day a goat for a sin offering; also a young bull and a ram out of the flock without blemish shall be prepared.
Ezekiel,43,26,For seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so the priests shall consecrate separate and set it apart to receive offerings.
Ezekiel,43,27,And when these days have been accomplished on the eighth day and from then on the priests shall offer your burnt offerings upon the altar and your peace offerings; and I will accept you says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,44,1,THEN the man [an angel] brought me back the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary which faces the east and it was shut.
Ezekiel,44,2,Then the Lord said to me This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened and no man shall enter in by it for the Lord the God of Israel has entered in by it; therefore it shall remain shut.
Ezekiel,44,3,As for the prince being the prince he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord; he shall enter by way of the porch or vestibule of the gate and shall go out the same way.
Ezekiel,44,4,Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple; I looked and behold the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord and I fell upon my face.
Ezekiel,44,5,And the Lord said to me Son of man mark well and set your heart to see with your eyes and hear with your ears all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord and all its laws and mark well and set your heart to know who are allowed to enter the temple and all those who are excluded from the sanctuary.
Ezekiel,44,6,And you shall say to the rebellious even to the house of Israel Thus says the Lord God: O you house of Israel let all your previous abominations be enough for you! [Do not repeat them!]
Ezekiel,44,7,You have brought into My sanctuary aliens uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh to be in My sanctuary to pollute and profane it even My house when you offer My bread the fat and the blood; and through it all and in addition to all your abominations they and you have broken My covenant.
Ezekiel,44,8,And you have not kept charge of My holy things but you have chosen foreign keepers to please yourselves and have set them in charge of My sanctuary.
Ezekiel,44,9,Therefore thus says the Lord God: No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and flesh shall enter into My sanctuary [where no one but the priests might enter] of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel.
Ezekiel,44,10,But the Levites who went far away from Me when Israel went astray who went astray from Me after their idols they shall bear [the punishment for] their iniquity and guilt.
Ezekiel,44,11,They shall minister in My sanctuary having oversight as guards at the gates of the temple and ministering in the temple. They shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people and they shall attend the people to serve them.
Ezekiel,44,12,Because [the priests] ministered to [the people] before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity and guilt to the house of Israel therefore I have lifted up My hand and have sworn against them says the Lord God that they shall bear the punishment for their iniquity and guilt.
Ezekiel,44,13,And they shall not come near to Me to do the office of a priest to Me nor come near to any of My holy things that are most sacred; but they shall bear their shame and their punishment for the abominations which they have committed.
Ezekiel,44,14,Yet I will appoint them as caretakers to have charge of the temple for all the service of the temple and for all that will be done in it.
Ezekiel,44,15,But the Levitical priests the sons of Zadok who kept the charge of My sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from Me shall come near to Me to minister to Me and they shall attend Me to offer to Me the fat and the blood says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,44,16,They shall enter into My sanctuary; and they shall come near to My table to minister to Me and they shall keep My charge.
Ezekiel,44,17,When they enter the gates of the inner court they shall be clothed in linen garments; no wool shall be on them while they minister at the gates of the inner court and within the temple.
Ezekiel,44,18,They shall have linen turbans on their heads and linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with anything that causes [them to] sweat.
Ezekiel,44,19,And when they go out into the outer court to the people they shall put off the garments in which they ministered and lay them in the holy chambers and they shall put on other garments lest by contact of their garments with the people they should consecrate (separate and set apart for holy use) such persons [unintentionally and unfittingly].
Ezekiel,44,20,Neither shall they shave their heads or allow their locks to grow long; they shall only cut short or trim the hair of their heads.
Ezekiel,44,21,Neither shall any priest drink wine when he enters the inner court.
Ezekiel,44,22,Neither shall they take for their wives a widow or a woman separated or divorced from her husband; but they shall marry maidens [who are virgins] of the offspring of the house of Israel or a widow previously married to a priest.
Ezekiel,44,23,The priests shall teach My people the difference between the holy and the common or profane and cause them to distinguish between the unclean and the clean.
Ezekiel,44,24,And in a controversy they shall act as judges and they shall judge according to My judgments; and they shall keep My laws and My statutes in all My appointed feasts and they shall keep My Sabbaths holy.
Ezekiel,44,25,And they shall go near to no dead person to defile themselves except for father or for mother for son or for daughter for brother or for sister who has had no husband; for them they may defile themselves.
Ezekiel,44,26,And after he is cleansed [from the defilement of a dead body] they shall reckon to him seven days more before returning to the temple.
Ezekiel,44,27,And on the day that he goes into the sanctuary into the inner court to minister in the sanctuary he shall offer his sin offering says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,44,28,This [their ministry to Me] shall be to them as an inheritance for I am their inheritance; and you shall give them no possession in Israel for I am their possession.
Ezekiel,44,29,They shall eat the meal offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering and every offering in Israel dedicated by a solemn vow to God shall be theirs.
Ezekiel,44,30,And the first of all the firstfruits of all kinds and every offering of all kinds from all your offerings shall belong to the priests. You shall also give to the priest the first of your coarse meal and bread dough that a blessing may rest on your house.
Ezekiel,44,31,The priests shall not eat of anything that has died of itself or is torn whether it be bird or beast.
Ezekiel,45,1,MOREOVER WHEN you shall divide the land by apportioned and assigned lots for inheritance you shall set apart as an offering to the Lord a portion of the land to be used for holy purposes. The length shall be 25000 cubits and the breadth 20000. It shall be holy (set apart and consecrated to sacred use) in its every area.
Ezekiel,45,2,Of this there shall belong to the sanctuary a square plot 500 by 500 and 50 cubits for the open space around it.
Ezekiel,45,3,And in this sacred section you shall measure off a portion 25000 cubits in length and 10000 cubits in breadth. And in it shall be the sanctuary which is most holy.
Ezekiel,45,4,It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary who come near to minister to the Lord; and it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place (set apart as sacred) for the sanctuary.
Ezekiel,45,5,And another portion of land 25000 cubits long and 10000 cubits wide shall also be for the Levites the ministers of the temple and they shall possess it as a place in which to live.
Ezekiel,45,6,And you shall appoint for the possession of the city an area of 5000 cubits wide and 25000 cubits long along beside the portion set aside as a holy section. It shall belong to the whole house of Israel.
Ezekiel,45,7,And to the prince shall belong the land on the one side and on the other side of the portion set aside as a holy section and the property of the city in front of the holy section and the property of the city from the west side westward and from the east side eastward; and the length shall be answerable to that of one of the tribal portions and parallel to it from the western boundary to the eastern boundary of the land.
Ezekiel,45,8,It shall be for the prince--his possession in Israel. And My princes shall no more oppress My people but they shall give the rest of the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
Ezekiel,45,9,Thus says the Lord God: That is enough for you O princes of Israel! Stop the violence and plundering and oppression [that you did when you were given no property] and do justice and righteousness and take away your exactions and cease your evictions of My people says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,45,10,You shall have just weights on your scales and just measures--both a just ephah measure and a just bath measure.
Ezekiel,45,11,The ephah and the bath measures shall both be the same size the bath containing one tenth of a homer and the ephah one tenth of a homer; the standard measure shall be the homer.
Ezekiel,45,12,And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels and twenty-five shekels and fifteen shekels shall be your maneh.
Ezekiel,45,13,This is the offering which you shall make: a sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat and a sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley.
Ezekiel,45,14,And as to the set portion of oil you shall offer the tenth part of a bath of oil out of each cor which is a homer of ten baths for ten baths make [both a cor and] a homer.

Ezekiel,45,16,All the people of the land shall give this offering for the prince in Israel.
Ezekiel,45,17,And it shall be the prince's part to furnish [from the contributions of the people] the burnt offerings meal offerings and drink offerings at the feasts and on the New Moons and on the Sabbaths at all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel. He shall prepare and make the sin offering the meal offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings to make atonement for bringing forgiveness and reconciliation to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,45,18,Thus says the Lord God: In the first [month] on the first [day] of the month you shall take a young bull without blemish and you shall cleanse the sanctuary.
Ezekiel,45,19,And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it upon the doorposts of the temple and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.
Ezekiel,45,20,You shall do this on the seventh day of the month for everyone who has sinned through error or ignorance and for him who is simple-minded. So shall you make atonement for the temple.
Ezekiel,45,21,In the first month on the fourteenth day of the [month]; you shall have the Passover a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.
Ezekiel,45,22,Upon that day the prince shall prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.
Ezekiel,45,23,And for the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the Lord seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily for the seven days and a he-goat daily for a sin offering.

Ezekiel,45,25,In the seventh [month] on the fifteenth day of the month he shall make the same provision and preparation for the seven days of the feast for sin offerings burnt offerings bloodless or meal offerings and for the oil.
Ezekiel,46,1,THUS SAYS the Lord God: The gate of the inner court that faces east shall be shut during the six working days but on the Sabbath it shall be opened and also on the day of the New Moon it shall be opened.
Ezekiel,46,2,And the prince shall enter by the porch or vestibule of the gate from without and shall stand by the sidepost of the gate. The priests shall prepare and offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out but the gate shall not be shut until evening.
Ezekiel,46,3,The people of the land shall worship at the entrance of that gate before the Lord on the Sabbaths and on the New Moons.
Ezekiel,46,4,And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer to the Lord on the Sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish.
Ezekiel,46,5,And the bloodless or meal offering with the ram shall be an ephah and the meal offering with the lambs shall be as much as he is able and willing to give and a hin of oil with each ephah.
Ezekiel,46,6,And on the day of the New Moon the offering shall be a young bull without blemish and six lambs and a ram without blemish.
Ezekiel,46,7,And the prince shall provide and make a meal or bloodless offering an ephah for the bullock and an ephah for the ram and for the lambs as he is able and willing according to what has been made available to his hand and a hin of oil to each ephah.
Ezekiel,46,8,And when the prince shall enter he shall go in by the porch or vestibule of that gate and he shall go out by way of it.
Ezekiel,46,9,But when the people of the land shall come before the Lord at the appointed solemn feasts he who enters the north gate to worship shall go out by the south gate and he who enters by the south gate shall go out by the north gate; he shall not return by the gate by which he came in but shall go out by the opposite gate [straight ahead].
Ezekiel,46,10,And the prince when they go in shall go in with them and when they go out he shall go out.
Ezekiel,46,11,And in the appointed and solemn feasts the meal or bloodless offering shall be with a bullock an ephah and with a ram an ephah and with the lambs as much as the prince is willing and able to give [from what has been made available to him] and a hin of oil with each ephah.
Ezekiel,46,12,When the prince shall prepare and make a freewill burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily to the Lord the gate that faces east shall be opened for him and he shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out and after he has gone out the gate shall be shut.
Ezekiel,46,13,And a lamb a year old without blemish shall you [the priests for the congregation] offer daily to the Lord; you shall prepare and offer it every morning.
Ezekiel,46,14,And you [the priests] shall prepare a meal offering to go with it every morning one-sixth of an ephah with one-third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour. This is a perpetual ordinance for a continual meal offering to the Lord.
Ezekiel,46,15,Thus shall they prepare and offer the lamb and the meal offering and the oil every morning for a continual burnt offering.
Ezekiel,46,16,Thus says the Lord God: If the prince gives a gift to any of his sons out of his inheritance it shall belong to his sons; it is their property by inheritance.
Ezekiel,46,17,But if he gives a gift out of his inheritance to one of his servants then it shall be his until the year of liberty [the Year of Jubilee]; after that it shall be returned to the prince; only his sons may keep a gift from his inheritance [permanently].
Ezekiel,46,18,Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression thrusting them out of their property; what he gives to his sons he shall take out of his own possession so that none of My people shall be separated from his [inherited] possession.
Ezekiel,46,19,Then he [my guide] led me through the entrance which was at the side of the gate into the holy chambers for the priests which faced the north; and behold there was a place at the extreme western end of them.
Ezekiel,46,20,And he said to me This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering and where they shall bake the [bloodless] meal offering to prevent their having to bring them into the outer court lest they should thereby wrongfully sanctify (separate and consecrate for holy service) the people who are there.
Ezekiel,46,21,And he brought me out into the outer court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court and behold in every corner of the court there was a court.
Ezekiel,46,22,In the four corners of the court there were courts joined on and enclosed forty cubits long and thirty broad; these four in the corners were the same size.
Ezekiel,46,23,And there was a row of masonry inside them round about [each of] the four courts and it was made with hearths for boiling at the bottom of the rows round about.
Ezekiel,46,24,Then said he to me These are the kitchens of those who do the boiling where the ministers [the Levites] of the temple shall boil the sacrifices of the people.
Ezekiel,47,1,THEN HE [my guide] brought me again to the door of the house [of the Lord--the temple] and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east for the front of the temple was toward the east; and the waters came down from under from the right side of the temple on the south side of the altar.
Ezekiel,47,2,Then he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around outside to the outer gate by the way that faces east and behold waters were running out on the right side.
Ezekiel,47,3,And when the man went on eastward with the measuring line in his hand he measured a thousand cubits and he caused me to pass through the waters waters that were ankle-deep.
Ezekiel,47,4,Again he measured a thousand cubits and caused me to pass through the waters waters that reached to the knees. Again he measured a thousand cubits and caused me to pass through the waters waters that reached to the loins.
Ezekiel,47,5,Afterward he measured a thousand and it was a river that I could not pass through for the waters had risen waters to swim in a river that could not be passed over or through.
Ezekiel,47,6,And he said to me Son of man have you seen this? Then he led me and caused me to return to the bank of the river.
Ezekiel,47,7,Now when I had returned behold on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
Ezekiel,47,8,Then he said to me These waters pour out toward the eastern region and go down into the Arabah (the Jordan Valley) and on into the Dead Sea. And when they shall enter into the sea [the sea of putrid waters] the waters shall be healed and made fresh.
Ezekiel,47,9,And wherever the double river shall go every living creature which swarms shall live. And there shall be a very great number of fish because these waters go there that [the waters of the sea] may be healed and made fresh; and everything shall live wherever the river goes.
Ezekiel,47,10,The fishermen shall stand on [the banks of the Dead Sea]; from En-gedi even to En-eglaim shall be a place to spread nets; their fish shall be of very many kinds as the fish of the Great or Mediterranean Sea.
Ezekiel,47,11,But its swamps and marshes will not become wholesome for animal life; they shall [as the river subsides] be left encrusted with salt and given over to it.
Ezekiel,47,12,And on the banks of the river on both its sides there shall grow all kinds of trees for food; their leaf shall not fade nor shall their fruit fail [to meet the demand]. Each tree shall bring forth new fruit every month [these supernatural qualities being] because their waters came from out of the sanctuary. And their fruit shall be for food and their leaves for healing.
Ezekiel,47,13,Thus says the Lord God: These shall be the boundaries by which you shall divide the land among the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.
Ezekiel,47,14,And you shall divide it equally. I lifted up My hand and swore to give it to your fathers and this land shall fall to you as your inheritance.
Ezekiel,47,15,And this shall be the boundary of the land on the north side: from the Great or Mediterranean Sea by way of Hethlon to the entrance of Zedad
Ezekiel,47,16,Hamath Berothah Sibraim which is on the border between Damascus and Hamath as far as Hazer-hatticon on the border of Hauran.
Ezekiel,47,17,So the boundary shall extend from the [Mediterranean] Sea to Hazar-enan at the boundary of Damascus on the north together with the boundary of Hamath to the north. This is the north side.
Ezekiel,47,18,And on the east side you shall measure the boundary from between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead on one side and the land of Israel on the other with the Jordan forming the boundary down to the East or Dead Sea. And this [from Damascus to the Dead Sea and including it] is the east side.
Ezekiel,47,19,And the south side [boundary] southward from Tamar [near the Dead Sea] shall run as far as the waters of Meribath-kadesh then along the Brook of Egypt to the Great or Mediterranean Sea. And this is the south side.
Ezekiel,47,20,On the west side [the boundary] shall be the Great or Mediterranean Sea to a point opposite the entrance of Hamath [north of Mount Hermon]. This is the west side.
Ezekiel,47,21,So you shall divide this land among you according to the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel,47,22,You shall divide it by allotment as an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners who reside among you and shall have children born among you. They shall be to you as those born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall inherit with you among the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel,47,23,In whatever tribe the foreigner resides there shall you give him his inheritance says the Lord God.
Ezekiel,48,1,NOW THESE are the names of the tribes: From the north end beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath as far as Hazar-enan which is on the northern border of Damascus opposite Hamath and reaching from the east border to the west Dan one [portion].
Ezekiel,48,2,And beside the border of Dan from the east side to the west side Asher one [portion].
Ezekiel,48,3,And beside the border of Asher from the east side to the west side Naphtali one [portion].
Ezekiel,48,4,And beside the border of Naphtali from the east side to the west side Manasseh one [portion].
Ezekiel,48,5,And beside the border of Manasseh from the east side to the west side Ephraim one [portion].
Ezekiel,48,6,And beside the border of Ephraim from the east side to the west side Reuben one [portion].
Ezekiel,48,7,And beside the border of Reuben from the east side to the west side Judah one [portion].
Ezekiel,48,8,And beside the border of Judah from the east side to the west side shall be the offering of land which you shall offer: 25000 reeds in breadth and in length as one of the tribal portions from the east side to the west side; and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.
Ezekiel,48,9,The portion of land that you shall set apart and offer to the Lord shall be 25000 [measures] in length and 10000 in breadth [for each of the two districts].
Ezekiel,48,10,And for these even for the priests shall be this holy offering of land: toward the north 25000 [measures] in length and toward the west 10000 in breadth and toward the east 10000 in breadth and toward the south 25000 in length and the sanctuary of the Lord shall be in the midst of it.
Ezekiel,48,11,The set-apart and sacred portion shall be for the consecrated priests of the sons of Zadok who have kept My charge and who did not go astray when the children of Israel went astray as the other Levites did.
Ezekiel,48,12,And this land offering shall be for the priests as a thing most holy beside the border of the [other] Levites.
Ezekiel,48,13,And opposite the border of the priests the [other] Levites shall have 25000 [measures] in length and 10000 in breadth. The whole length shall be 25000 and the breadth 10000.
Ezekiel,48,14,And they shall not sell any of it or exchange it; they shall not convey or transfer this the firstfruits of the land for it has been offered to the Lord and is holy to Him.
Ezekiel,48,15,And the remaining strip of 5000 [measures] in breadth and 25000 in length shall be for the city's secular use for a place in which to dwell and for open country or suburbs. The city shall be in the midst of the plot.
Ezekiel,48,16,And these shall be the dimensions of it: the north side 4500 [measures] and the south side 4500 the east side 4500 and the west side 4500.
Ezekiel,48,17,And the city shall have suburbs or open country: toward the north 250 [measures] and toward the south 250 toward the east 250 and toward the west 250.

Daniel,1,1,IN THE third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
Daniel,1,2,And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand along with a part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar [Babylonia] to the house of his god and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god.
Daniel,1,3,And the [Babylonian] king told Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs to bring in some of the children of Israel both of the royal family and of the nobility--
Daniel,1,4,Youths without blemish well-favored in appearance and skillful in all wisdom discernment and understanding apt in learning knowledge competent to stand and serve in the king's palace--and to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans.
Daniel,1,5,And the king assigned for them a daily portion of his own rich and dainty food and of the wine which he drank. They were to be so educated and so nourished for three years that at the end of that time they might stand before the king.
Daniel,1,6,Among these were of the children of Judah: Daniel Hananiah Mishael and Azariah.
Daniel,1,7,The chief of the eunuchs gave them names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar [the king's attendant] Hananiah he called Shadrach Mishael he called Meshach and Azariah he called Abednego.
Daniel,1,8,But Daniel determined in his heart that he would not defile himself by [eating his portion of] the king's rich and dainty food or by [drinking] the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might [be allowed] not to defile himself.
Daniel,1,9,Now God made Daniel to find favor compassion and loving-kindness with the chief of the eunuchs.
Daniel,1,10,And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel I fear lest my lord the king who has appointed your food and your drink should see your faces worse looking or more sad than the other youths of your age. Then you would endanger my head with the king.
Daniel,1,11,Then said Daniel to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over Daniel Hananiah Mishael and Azariah
Daniel,1,12,Prove your servants I beseech you for ten days and let us be given a vegetable diet and water to drink.
Daniel,1,13,Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat of the king's [rich] dainties be observed and compared by you and deal with us your servants according to what you see.
Daniel,1,14,So [the man] consented to them in this matter and proved them ten days.
Daniel,1,15,And at the end of ten days it was seen that they were looking better and had taken on more flesh than all the youths who ate of the king's rich dainties.
Daniel,1,16,So the steward took away their [rich] dainties and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables.
Daniel,1,17,As for these four youths God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom and Daniel had understanding in all [kinds of] visions and dreams.
Daniel,1,18,Now at the end of the time which the king had set for bringing [all the young men in] the chief of the eunuchs brought them before Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel,1,19,And the king conversed with them and among them all none was found like Daniel Hananiah Mishael and Azariah; therefore they were assigned to stand before the king.
Daniel,1,20,And in all matters of wisdom and understanding concerning which the king asked them he found them ten times better than all the [learned] magicians and enchanters who were in his whole realm.
Daniel,1,21,And Daniel continued there even to the first year of King Cyrus [at the close of the seventy years' exile of Judah in Babylonia which Jeremiah had foretold].
Daniel,2,1,IN THE second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar had dreams by which his spirit was troubled and agitated and his sleep went from him.
Daniel,2,2,Then the king commanded to call the magicians the enchanters or soothsayers the sorcerers and the Chaldeans [diviners] to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.
Daniel,2,3,And the king said to them I had a dream and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.
Daniel,2,4,Then said the Chaldeans [diviners] to the king in Aramaic [the Syrian language] O king live forever! Tell your servants the dream and we will show the interpretation.
Daniel,2,5,The king answered the Chaldeans The thing is gone from me! And the decree goes forth from me and I say it with all emphasis: if you do not make known to me the dream with its interpretation you shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a dunghill!
Daniel,2,6,But if you show the dream and its interpretation you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So show me the dream and the interpretation of it.
Daniel,2,7,They answered again Let the king tell his servants the dream and we will show the interpretation of it.
Daniel,2,8,The king answered I know with certainty that you are trying to gain time because you see the thing is gone from me and because you see that my word [against you] is sure:
Daniel,2,9,If you will not make known to me the dream there is but one sentence for you; for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me [hoping to delay your execution] until the time is changed. Therefore tell me the dream and I will know that you can tell me the interpretation of it.
Daniel,2,10,The Chaldeans [diviners] answered before the king and said There is not a man on earth who can show the king this matter for no king lord or ruler has [ever] asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean.
Daniel,2,11,A rare and weighty thing indeed the king requires! None except the gods can reveal it to the king and their dwelling is not with [human] flesh.
Daniel,2,12,For this cause the king was angry and very furious and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed.
Daniel,2,13,So the decree went forth that the wise men were to be killed and [the officers] sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.
Daniel,2,14,Then Daniel returned an answer which was full of prudence and wisdom to Arioch the captain or executioner of the king's guard who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel,2,15,He said to Arioch the king's captain Why is the decree so urgent and hasty from the king? Then Arioch explained the matter to Daniel.
Daniel,2,16,And Daniel went in and desired of the king that he would set a date and give him time and he would show the king the interpretation.
Daniel,2,17,Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah Mishael and Azariah his companions
Daniel,2,18,So that they would desire and request mercy of the God of heaven concerning this secret that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel,2,19,Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night and Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
Daniel,2,20,Daniel answered Blessed be the name of God forever and ever! For wisdom and might are His!
Daniel,2,21,He changes the times and the seasons; He removes kings and sets up kings. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding!
Daniel,2,22,He reveals the deep and secret things; He knows what is in the darkness and the light dwells with Him!
Daniel,2,23,I thank You and praise You O God of my fathers Who has given me wisdom and might and has made known to me now what we desired of You for You have made known to us the solution to the king's problem.
Daniel,2,24,Therefore Daniel went to Arioch whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus to him: Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon! Bring me in before the king and I will show to the king the interpretation.
Daniel,2,25,Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus to him: I have found a man of the captives of Judah who will make known to the king the interpretation [of his dream].
Daniel,2,26,The king said to Daniel whose name was Belteshazzar Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen and the interpretation of it?
Daniel,2,27,Daniel answered the king The [mysterious] secret which the king has demanded neither the wise men enchanters magicians nor astrologers can show the king
Daniel,2,28,But there is a God in heaven Who reveals secrets and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what it is that shall be in the latter days (at the end of days). Your dream and the visions in your head upon your bed are these:
Daniel,2,29,As for you O king as you were lying upon your bed thoughts came into your mind about what should come to pass hereafter and He Who reveals secrets was making known to you what shall come to pass.
Daniel,2,30,But as for me this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than anyone else living but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king and that you may know the thoughts of your heart and mind.
Daniel,2,31,You O king saw and behold [there was] a great image. This image which was mighty and of exceedingly great brightness stood before you and the appearance of it was frightening and terrible.
Daniel,2,32,As for this image its head was of fine gold its breast and its arms of silver its belly and its thighs of bronze
Daniel,2,33,Its legs of iron its feet partly of iron and partly of clay [the baked clay of the potter].
Daniel,2,34,As you looked a Stone was cut out without human hands which smote the image on its feet of iron and [baked] clay [of the potter] and broke them to pieces.
Daniel,2,35,Then the iron the [baked] clay [of the potter] the bronze the silver and the gold were broken and crushed together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them could be found. And the Stone that smote the image became a great mountain or rock and filled the whole earth.
Daniel,2,36,This was the dream and we will tell the interpretation of it to the king.
Daniel,2,37,You O king are king of the [earthly] kings to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom the power the might and the glory.
Daniel,2,38,And wherever the children of men dwell and the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens--He has given them into your hand and has made you to rule over them all. You [king of Babylon] are the head of gold.
Daniel,2,39,And after you shall arise another kingdom [the Medo-Persian] inferior to you and still a third kingdom of bronze [Greece under Alexander the Great] which shall bear rule over all the earth.
Daniel,2,40,And the fourth kingdom [Rome] shall be strong as iron since iron breaks to pieces and subdues all things; and like iron which crushes it shall break and crush all these.
Daniel,2,41,And as you saw the feet and toes partly of [baked] clay [of the potter] and partly of iron it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it some of the firmness and strength of iron just as you saw the iron mixed with miry [earthen] clay.
Daniel,2,42,And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of [baked] clay [of the potter] so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle and broken.
Daniel,2,43,And as you saw the iron mixed with miry and earthen clay so they shall mingle themselves in the seed of men [in marriage bonds]; but they will not hold together [for two such elements or ideologies can never harmonize] even as iron does not mingle itself with clay.
Daniel,2,44,And in the days of these [final ten] kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed nor shall its sovereignty be left to another people; but it shall break and crush and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever.
Daniel,2,45,Just as you saw that the Stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it broke in pieces the iron the bronze the clay the silver and the gold the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter. The dream is certain and the interpretation of it is sure.
Daniel,2,46,Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and paid homage to Daniel [as a great prophet of the highest God] and ordered that an offering and incense should be offered up to him [in honor of his God].
Daniel,2,47,The king answered Daniel Of a truth your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a Revealer of secret mysteries seeing that you could reveal this secret mystery!
Daniel,2,48,Then the king made Daniel great and gave him many great gifts and he made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel,2,49,And Daniel requested of the king and he appointed Shadrach Meshach and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon. But Daniel remained in the gate of the king [at the king's court].
Daniel,3,1,NEBUCHADNEZZAR THE king [caused to be] made an image of gold whose height was sixty cubits or ninety feet and its breadth six cubits or nine feet. He set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
Daniel,3,2,Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps the deputies the governors the judges and chief stargazers the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and lawyers and all the chief officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnezzar had [caused to be] set up.
Daniel,3,3,Then the satraps the deputies the governors the judges and chief stargazers the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and lawyers and all the chief officials of the provinces were gathered together for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
Daniel,3,4,Then the herald cried aloud You are commanded O peoples nations and languages
Daniel,3,5,That when you hear the sound of the horn pipe lyre trigon harp dulcimer or bagpipe and every kind of music you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
Daniel,3,6,And whoever does not fall down and worship shall that very hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
Daniel,3,7,Therefore when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn pipe lyre trigon dulcimer or bagpipe and every kind of music all the peoples nations and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
Daniel,3,8,Therefore at that time certain men of Chaldean descent came near and brought [malicious] accusations against the Jews.
Daniel,3,9,They said to King Nebuchadnezzar O king live forever!
Daniel,3,10,You O king have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn pipe lyre trigon harp dulcimer or bagpipe and every kind of music shall fall down and worship the golden image
Daniel,3,11,And that whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
Daniel,3,12,There are certain Jews whom you have appointed and set over the affairs of the province of Babylon--Shadrach Meshach and Abednego. These men O king pay no attention to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.
Daniel,3,13,Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and Abednego; and these men were brought before the king.
Daniel,3,14,[Then] Nebuchadnezzar said to them Is it true O Shadrach Meshach and Abednego that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image which I have set up?
Daniel,3,15,Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn pipe lyre trigon harp dulcimer or bagpipe and every kind of music to fall down and worship the image which I have made very good. But if you do not worship you shall be cast at once into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that god who can deliver you out of my hands?
Daniel,3,16,Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered the king O Nebuchadnezzar it is not necessary for us to answer you on this point.
Daniel,3,17,If our God Whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace He will deliver us out of your hand O king.
Daniel,3,18,But if not let it be known to you O king that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up!
Daniel,3,19,Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury and his facial expression was changed [to antagonism] against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego. Therefore he commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times hotter than it was usually heated.
Daniel,3,20,And he commanded the strongest men in his army to bind Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
Daniel,3,21,Then these [three] men were bound in their cloaks their tunics or undergarments their turbans and their other clothing and they were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
Daniel,3,22,Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceedingly hot the flame and sparks from the fire killed those men who handled Shadrach Meshach and Abednego.
Daniel,3,23,And these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego fell down bound into the burning fiery furnace.
Daniel,3,24,Then Nebuchadnezzar the king [saw and] was astounded and he jumped up and said to his counselors Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered True O king.
Daniel,3,25,He answered Behold I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they are not hurt! And the form of the fourth is like a son of the gods!
Daniel,3,26,Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and said Shadrach Meshach and Abednego you servants of the Most High God come out and come here. Then Shadrach Meshach and Abednego came out from the midst of the fire.
Daniel,3,27,And the satraps the deputies the governors and the king's counselors gathered around together and saw these men--that the fire had no power upon their bodies nor was the hair of their head singed; neither were their garments scorched or changed in color or condition nor had even the smell of smoke clung to them.
Daniel,3,28,Then Nebuchadnezzar said Blessed be the God of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego Who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who believed in trusted in and relied on Him! And they set aside the king's command and yielded their bodies rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.
Daniel,3,29,Therefore I make a decree that any people nation and language that speaks anything amiss against the God of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses be made a dunghill for there is no other God who can deliver in this way!
Daniel,3,30,Then the king promoted Shadrach Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
Daniel,4,1,NEBUCHADNEZZAR THE king to all people nations and languages that dwell on all the earth: May peace be multiplied to you!
Daniel,4,2,It seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed toward me.
Daniel,4,3,How great are His signs! And how mighty His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and His dominion is from generation to generation.
Daniel,4,4,I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house and prospering in my palace.
Daniel,4,5,I had a dream which made me afraid and the thoughts and imaginations and the visions of my head as I was lying upon my bed troubled and agitated me.
Daniel,4,6,Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
Daniel,4,7,Then the magicians the enchanters the Chaldeans and the astrologers came in and I told them the dream but they could not make known to me the interpretation of it.
Daniel,4,8,But at last Daniel came in before me--he who was named Belteshazzar after the name of my god and in whom is the Spirit of the Holy God--and I told the dream before him saying
Daniel,4,9,O Belteshazzar chief of the magicians because I know that the Spirit of the Holy God is in you and no secret mystery is a burden or troubles you tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen and the interpretation of it.
Daniel,4,10,The visions of my head [as I lay] on my bed were these: I saw and behold [there was] a tree in the midst of the earth and its height was great.
Daniel,4,11,The tree grew and was strong and its height reached to the heavens and the sight of it reached to the end of the whole earth.
Daniel,4,12,Its leaves were fair and its fruit abundant and in it was food for all. The living creatures of the field found shade under it and the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches; and all flesh was fed from it.
Daniel,4,13,I saw in the visions of my head [as I lay] on my bed and behold a watcher a holy one came down from heaven.
Daniel,4,14,He cried aloud [with might] and said Cut down the tree and cut off its branches; shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the living creatures flee from under it and the fowls from its branches.
Daniel,4,15,Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth bound with a band of iron and bronze in the midst of the tender grass of the field. Let him be wet with the dew of the heavens and let him share the lot of the living creatures in the grass of the earth.
Daniel,4,16,Let his nature and understanding be changed from a man's and let a beast's nature and understanding be given him and let seven times [or years] pass over him.
Daniel,4,17,This sentence is by the decree of the [heavenly] watchers and the decision is by the word of the holy ones to the intent that the living may know that the Most High [God] rules the kingdom of mankind and gives it to whomever He will and sets over it the humblest and lowliest of men.
Daniel,4,18,This dream I King Nebuchadnezzar have seen. And you O Belteshazzar [Daniel] declare now its interpretation since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able for the Spirit of the Holy God is in you.
Daniel,4,19,Then Daniel whose name was Belteshazzar was astonished and dismayed and stricken dumb for a while [concerned about the king's destiny] and his thoughts troubled agitated and alarmed him. The king said Belteshazzar let not the dream or its interpretation trouble or alarm you. Belteshazzar answered My lord may the dream be for those who hate you and its message for your enemies.
Daniel,4,20,The tree that you saw which grew [great] and was strong whose height reached to the heavens and which was visible to all the earth
Daniel,4,21,Whose foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant on which was food for all under which the living creatures of the field dwelt and on whose branches the birds of the sky had their nests--
Daniel,4,22,It is you O king who have grown and become strong; your greatness has increased and it reaches to the heavens and your dominion to the ends of the earth.
Daniel,4,23,And whereas the king saw a watcher a holy one coming down from heaven and saying Cut the tree down and destroy it but leave the stump of its roots in the earth with a band of iron and bronze around it in the tender grass of the field; and let him be wet with the dew of the heavens and let his portion be with the living creatures of the field until seven times [or years] pass over him--
Daniel,4,24,This is the interpretation O king: It is the decree of the Most High [God] which has come upon my lord the king:
Daniel,4,25,You shall be driven from among men and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; you shall be made to eat grass as do the oxen and you shall be wet with the dew of the heavens; and seven times [or years] shall pass over you until you learn and know and recognize that the Most High [God] rules the kingdom of mankind and gives it to whomever He will.
Daniel,4,26,And in that it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree your kingdom shall be sure to you after you have learned and know that [the God of] heaven rules.
Daniel,4,27,Therefore O king let my counsel be acceptable to you; break off your sins and show the reality of your repentance by righteousness (right standing with God and moral and spiritual rectitude and rightness in every area and relation) and liberate yourself from your iniquities by showing mercy and loving-kindness to the poor and oppressed that [if the king will repent] there may possibly be a continuance and lengthening of your peace and tranquility and a healing of your error.
Daniel,4,28,All this was fulfilled and came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel,4,29,At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.
Daniel,4,30,The king said Is not this the great Babylon that I have built as the royal residence and seat of government by the might of my power and for the honor and glory of my majesty?
Daniel,4,31,While the words were still in the king's mouth there fell a voice from heaven saying O King Nebuchadnezzar to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you
Daniel,4,32,And you shall be driven from among men and your dwelling will be with the living creatures of the field. You will be made to eat grass like the oxen and seven times [or years] shall pass over you until you have learned and know that the Most High [God] rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever He will.
Daniel,4,33,That very hour the thing was [in process of] being fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from among men and did eat grass like oxen [as Daniel had said he would] and his body was wet with the dew of the heavens until his hair grew like eagles' [feathers] and his nails [were] like birds' [claws].
Daniel,4,34,And at the end of the days [seven years] I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to heaven and my understanding and the right use of my mind returned to me; and I blessed the Most High [God] and I praised and honored and glorified Him Who lives forever Whose dominion is an everlasting dominion; and His kingdom endures from generation to generation.
Daniel,4,35,And all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing. And He does according to His will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay His hand or say to Him What are You doing?
Daniel,4,36,Now at the same time my reason and understanding returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom my majesty and splendor returned to me and my counselors and my lords sought me out; I was reestablished in my kingdom and still more greatness [than before] was added to me.
Daniel,4,37,Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the King of heaven Whose works are all faithful and right and Whose ways are just. And those who walk in pride He is able to abase and humble.
Daniel,5,1,BELSHAZZAR THE king [descendant of Nebuchadnezzar] made a great feast for a thousand of his lords and he drank his wine in the presence of the thousand.
Daniel,5,2,Belshazzar while he was tasting the wine commanded that the gold and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple [out of the sacred area--the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies] which was in Jerusalem be brought that the king and his lords his wives and his concubines might drink from them.
Daniel,5,3,Then they brought in the gold and silver vessels which had been taken out of the temple the house of God which was in Jerusalem; and the king and his lords his wives and his concubines drank from them.
Daniel,5,4,They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and silver of bronze iron wood and stone.
Daniel,5,5,Immediately and suddenly there appeared the fingers of a man's hand and wrote on the plaster of the wall opposite the candlestick [so exposed especially to the light] in the king's palace and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
Daniel,5,6,Then the color and the [drunken] hilarious brightness of the king's face was changed and his [terrifying] thoughts troubled and alarmed him; the joints and muscles of his hips and back gave way and his knees smote together.
Daniel,5,7,The king cried aloud [mightily] to bring in the enchanters or soothsayers the Chaldeans [diviners] and the astrologers. The king said to the wise men of Babylon Whoever will read this writing and show me the interpretation of it will be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold put about his neck and will be the third ruler in the kingdom.
Daniel,5,8,And all the king's wise men came in but they could not read the writing or make known to the king the interpretation of it.
Daniel,5,9,Then King Belshazzar was greatly perplexed and alarmed and the color faded from his face and his lords were puzzled and astounded.
Daniel,5,10,Now the queen [mother] overhearing the exciting words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house. The queen [mother] said O king live forever! Do not be alarmed at your thoughts or let your cheerful expression and the color of your face be changed.
Daniel,5,11,There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the Spirit of the holy God [or gods] and in the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him; and King Nebuchadnezzar your father--the king I say your father--appointed him master of the magicians enchanters or soothsayers Chaldeans and astrologers
Daniel,5,12,Because an excellent spirit knowledge and understanding to interpret dreams clarify riddles and solve knotty problems were found in this same Daniel whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called and he will show the interpretation.
Daniel,5,13,Then Daniel was brought in before the king. And the king said to Daniel Are you that Daniel of the children of the captivity of Judah whom the king my father brought out of Judah?
Daniel,5,14,I have heard of you that the Spirit of the holy God [or gods] is in you and that light and understanding and superior wisdom are found in you.
Daniel,5,15,Now the wise men the enchanters have been brought in before me that they might read this writing and make known to me the interpretation of it but they could not show the interpretation of the matter.
Daniel,5,16,But I have heard of you that you can make interpretations and solve knotty problems. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation you shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold put around your neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
Daniel,5,17,Then Daniel answered before the king Let your gifts be for yourself and give your rewards to another. However I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation.
Daniel,5,18,O king the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father a kingdom and greatness and glory and majesty;
Daniel,5,19,And because of the greatness that He gave him all peoples nations and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he would he slew and whom he would he kept alive; whom he would he set up and whom he would he put down.
Daniel,5,20,But when his heart was lifted up and his mind and spirit were hardened so that he dealt proudly he was deposed from his kingly throne and his glory was taken from him;
Daniel,5,21,He was driven from among men and his heart or mind was made like the beasts and his dwelling was with the wild asses. He was fed with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the dew of the heavens until he learned and knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men and that He appoints and sets over it whomever He will.
Daniel,5,22,And you his son O Belshazzar have not humbled your heart and mind though you knew all this [knew it and were defiant].
Daniel,5,23,And you have lifted yourself up against the Lord of heaven and the vessels of His house have been brought before you and you and your lords your wives and your concubines have drunk wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold of bronze iron wood and stone which do not see or hear or know; but the God in Whose hand your breath is and Whose are all your ways you have not honored and glorified [but have dishonored and disgraced].
Daniel,5,24,Then was the part of the hand sent from the presence of [the Most High God] and this writing was inscribed.
Daniel,5,25,And this is the inscription that was written MENE MENE TEKEL UPHARSIN--numbered numbered weighed divisions.
Daniel,5,26,This is the interpretation of the matter: MENE God has numbered the days of your kingship and brought them to an end;
Daniel,5,27,TEKEL You are weighed in the balances and are found wanting;
Daniel,5,28,PERES Your kingdom and your kingship are divided and given to the Medes and Persians. [Foretold in Isa. 21:2 5 9.]
Daniel,5,29,Then Belshazzar commanded and Daniel was clothed with purple and a chain of gold put about his neck and a proclamation was made concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
Daniel,5,30,During that night Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans was slain
Daniel,5,31,And Darius the Mede took the kingdom; he was about sixty-two years old.
Daniel,6,1,IT PLEASED [King] Darius [successor to Belshazzar] to set over the kingdom 120 satraps who should be [in charge] throughout all the kingdom
Daniel,6,2,And over them three presidents--of whom Daniel was one--that these satraps might give account to them and that the king should have no loss or damage.
Daniel,6,3,Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps because an excellent spirit was in him and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
Daniel,6,4,Then the presidents and satraps sought to find occasion [to bring accusation] against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find no occasion or fault for he was faithful nor was there any error or fault found in him.
Daniel,6,5,Then said these men We shall not find any occasion [to bring accusation] against this Daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.
Daniel,6,6,Then these presidents and satraps came [tumultuously] together to the king and said to him King Darius live forever!
Daniel,6,7,All the presidents of the kingdom the deputies and the satraps the counselors and the governors have consulted and agreed that the king should establish a royal statute and make a firm decree that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days except of you O king shall be cast into the den of lions.
Daniel,6,8,Now O king establish the decree and sign the writing that it may not be changed according to the law of the Medes and Persians which cannot be altered.
Daniel,6,9,So King Darius signed the writing and the decree.
Daniel,6,10,Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem he got down upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he had done previously.
Daniel,6,11,Then these men came thronging [by agreement] and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.
Daniel,6,12,Then they came near and said before the king concerning his prohibitory decree Have you not signed an edict that any man who shall make a petition to any god or man within thirty days except of you O king shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said The thing is true according to the law of the Medes and Persians which cannot be changed or repealed.
Daniel,6,13,Then they said before the king That Daniel who is one of the exiles from Judah does not regard or pay any attention to you O king or to the decree that you have signed but makes his petition three times a day.
Daniel,6,14,Then the king when he heard these words was much distressed [over what he had done] and set his mind on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored until the sun went down to rescue him.
Daniel,6,15,Then these same men came thronging [by agreement] to the king and said Know O king that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no decree or statute which the king establishes may be changed or repealed.
Daniel,6,16,Then the king commanded and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king said to Daniel May your God Whom you are serving continually deliver you!
Daniel,6,17,And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords that there might be no change of purpose concerning Daniel.
Daniel,6,18,Then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting neither were instruments of music or dancing girls brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.
Daniel,6,19,Then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the den of lions.
Daniel,6,20,And when he came to the den and to Daniel he cried out in a voice of anguish. The king said to Daniel O Daniel servant of the living God is your God Whom you serve continually able to deliver you from the lions?
Daniel,6,21,Then Daniel said to the king O king live forever!
Daniel,6,22,My God has sent His angel and has shut the lions' mouths so that they have not hurt me because I was found innocent and blameless before Him; and also before you O king [as you very well know] I have done no harm or wrong.
Daniel,6,23,Then the king was exceedingly glad and commanded that Daniel should be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no hurt of any kind was found on him because he believed in (relied on adhered to and trusted in) his God.
Daniel,6,24,And the king commanded and those men who had accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions they their children and their wives; and before they ever reached the bottom of the den the lions had overpowered them and had broken their bones in pieces.
Daniel,6,25,Then King Darius wrote to all peoples nations and languages [in his realm] that dwelt in all the earth: May peace be multiplied to you!
Daniel,6,26,I make a decree that in all my royal dominion men must tremble and fear before the God of Daniel for He is the living God enduring and steadfast forever and His kingdom shall not be destroyed and His dominion shall be even to the end [of the world].
Daniel,6,27,He is a Savior and Deliverer and He works signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth--He Who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
Daniel,6,28,So this [man] Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
Daniel,7,1,IT PLEASED [King] Darius [successor to Belshazzar] to set over the kingdom 120 satraps who should be [in charge] throughout all the kingdom
Daniel,7,2,And over them three presidents--of whom Daniel was one--that these satraps might give account to them and that the king should have no loss or damage.

Daniel,7,27,He is a Savior and Deliverer and He works signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth--He Who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
Daniel,7,28,So this [man] Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
Daniel,8,1,IN THE third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me Daniel after the one that appeared to me at the first.
Daniel,8,2,And I saw in the vision and it seemed that I was at Shushan the palace or fortress [in Susa the capital of Persia] which is in the province of Elam and I saw in the vision and I was by the river of Ulai.
Daniel,8,3,And I lifted up my eyes and saw and behold there stood before the river a [single] ram which had two horns [representing two kings of Medo-Persia: Darius the Mede then Cyrus]; and the two horns were high but one [Persia] was higher than the other and the higher one came up last.
Daniel,8,4,I looked and saw the ram [Medo-Persia] pushing and charging westward and northward and southward; no beast could stand before him neither could anyone rescue from his power but he did according to his [own] will and pleasure and magnified himself.
Daniel,8,5,As I was considering behold a he-goat [the king of Greece] came from the west across the face of the whole earth without touching the ground and the goat had a conspicuous and remarkable horn between his eyes [symbolizing Alexander the Great].
Daniel,8,6,And he came to the ram that had the two horns which I had seen standing on the bank of the river and ran at him in the heat of his power.
Daniel,8,7,[In my vision] I saw him come close to the ram [Medo-Persia] and he was moved with anger against him and he [Alexander the Great] struck the ram and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him but the goat threw him to the ground and trampled on him. And there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power.
Daniel,8,8,And the he-goat [Alexander the Great] magnified himself exceedingly and when he was [young and] strong the great horn [he] was [suddenly] broken; and instead of [him] there came up four notable horns [to whom the kingdom was divided one] toward [each of] the four winds of the heavens.
Daniel,8,9,Out of littleness and small beginnings one of them came forth [Antiochus Epiphanes] a horn whose [impious presumption and pride] grew exceedingly great toward the south and toward the east and toward the ornament [the precious blessed land of Israel].
Daniel,8,10,And [in my vision this horn] grew great even against the host of heaven [God's true people the saints] and some of the host and of the stars [priests] it cast down to the ground and trampled on them
Daniel,8,11,Yes [this horn] magnified itself even [matching itself] against the Prince of the host [of heaven]; and from Him the continual [burnt offering] was taken away and the place of [God's] sanctuary was cast down and profaned.
Daniel,8,12,And the host [the chosen people] was given [to the wicked horn] together with the continual burnt offering because of the transgression [of God's people--their abounding irreverence ungodliness and lack of piety]. And righteousness and truth were cast down to the ground and it [the wicked horn] accomplished this [by divine permission] and prospered.
Daniel,8,13,Then I heard a holy one speaking and another holy one said to the one that spoke For how long is the vision concerning the continual offering the transgression that makes desolate and the giving over of both the sanctuary and the host [of the people] to be trampled underfoot?
Daniel,8,14,And he said to him and to me For 2300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary shall be cleansed and restored.
Daniel,8,15,When I even I Daniel had seen the vision I sought to understand it; then behold there stood before me one [Gabriel] with the appearance of a man.
Daniel,8,16,And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the [river] Ulai which called and said Gabriel make this man [Daniel] understand the vision.
Daniel,8,17,So he came near where I stood and when he came I was frightened and fell on my face. But he said to me Understand O son of man for the [fulfillment of the] vision belongs to [events that shall occur in] the time of the end.
Daniel,8,18,Now as he [Gabriel] was speaking with me I fell stunned and in deep unconsciousness with my face to the ground; but he touched me and set me upright [where I had stood].
Daniel,8,19,And he said Behold I will make you know what will be in the latter time of the indignation [of God upon the ungodly] for it has to do with the time of the end.
Daniel,8,20,The ram you saw having two horns they are the kings of Media and Persia.
Daniel,8,21,And the shaggy and rough he-goat is the king of Greece and the great horn between his eyes is the first king [who consolidated the whole realm Alexander the Great].
Daniel,8,22,And as for the horn which was shattered in whose place four others arose four kingdoms shall arise out of his nation but not having his [Alexander's] power.
Daniel,8,23,And at the latter end of their kingdom when the transgressors [the apostate Jews] have reached the fullness [of their wickedness taxing the limits of God's mercy] a king of fierce countenance and understanding dark trickery and craftiness shall stand up.
Daniel,8,24,And his power shall be mighty but not by his own power; and he shall corrupt and destroy astonishingly and shall prosper and do his own pleasure and he shall corrupt and destroy the mighty men and the holy people (the people of the saints).
Daniel,8,25,And through his policy he shall cause trickery to prosper in his hand; he shall magnify himself in his heart and mind and in their security he will corrupt and destroy many. He shall also stand up against the Prince of princes but he shall be broken and that by no [human] hand.
Daniel,8,26,The vision of the evenings and the mornings which has been told you is true. But seal up the vision for it has to do with and belongs to the [now] distant future.
Daniel,8,27,And I Daniel fainted and was sick [for several] days. Afterward I rose up and did the king's business; and I wondered at the vision but there was no one who understood it or could make it understood.
Daniel,9,1,IN THE first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus of the offspring of the Medes who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans--
Daniel,9,2,In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood from the books the number of years which according to the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet must pass by before the desolations [which had been] pronounced on Jerusalem should end; and it was seventy years.
Daniel,9,3,And I set my face to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes;
Daniel,9,4,And I prayed to the Lord my God and made confession and said O Lord the great and dreadful God Who keeps covenant mercy and loving-kindness with those who love Him and keep His commandments
Daniel,9,5,We have sinned and dealt perversely and done wickedly and have rebelled turning aside from Your commandments and ordinances.
Daniel,9,6,Neither have we listened to and heeded Your servants the prophets who spoke in Your name to our kings our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land.
Daniel,9,7,O Lord righteousness belongs to You but to us confusion and shame of face as at this day--to the men of Judah to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to all Israel to those who are near and those who are far off through all the countries to which You have driven them because of the [treacherous] trespass which they have committed against You.
Daniel,9,8,O Lord to us belong confusion and shame of face--to our kings to our princes and to our fathers--because we have sinned against You.
Daniel,9,9,To the Lord our God belong mercy and loving-kindness and forgiveness for we have rebelled against Him;
Daniel,9,10,And we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God by walking in His laws which He set before us through His servants the prophets.
Daniel,9,11,Yes all Israel has transgressed Your law even turning aside that they might not obey Your voice. Therefore the curse has been poured out on us and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God because we have sinned against Him.
