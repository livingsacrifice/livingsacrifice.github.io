Genesis,1,1,"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."
Genesis,1,2,"The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters."
Genesis,1,3,"And God said, ""Let there be light,"" and there was light."
Genesis,1,4,And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.
Genesis,1,5,"God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day."
Genesis,1,6,"And God said, ""Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."""
Genesis,1,7,And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so.
Genesis,1,8,"And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day."
Genesis,1,9,"And God said, ""Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear."" And it was so."
Genesis,1,10,"God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,11,"And God said, ""Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth."" And it was so."
Genesis,1,12,"The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,13,"And there was evening and there was morning, the third day."
Genesis,1,14,"And God said, ""Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years,"
Genesis,1,15,"and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth."" And it was so."
Genesis,1,16,And God made the two great lights--the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night--and the stars.
Genesis,1,17,"And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,"
Genesis,1,18,"to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,19,"And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day."
Genesis,1,20,"And God said, ""Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens."""
Genesis,1,21,"So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,22,"And God blessed them, saying, ""Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."""
Genesis,1,23,"And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day."
Genesis,1,24,"And God said, ""Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds--livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds."" And it was so."
Genesis,1,25,"And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,26,"Then God said, ""Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."""
Genesis,1,27,"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them."
Genesis,1,28,"And God blessed them. And God said to them, ""Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth."""
Genesis,1,29,"And God said, ""Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food."
Genesis,1,30,"And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food."" And it was so."
Genesis,1,31,"And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day."
Genesis,2,1,"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them."
Genesis,2,2,"And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done."
Genesis,2,3,"So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation."
Genesis,2,4,"These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens."
Genesis,2,5,"When no bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up--for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground,"
Genesis,2,6,and a mist was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground--
Genesis,2,7,"then the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature."
Genesis,2,8,"And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed."
Genesis,2,9,"And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil."
Genesis,2,10,"A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers."
Genesis,2,11,"The name of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold."
Genesis,2,12,And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.
Genesis,2,13,The name of the second river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush.
Genesis,2,14,"And the name of the third river is the Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates."
Genesis,2,15,The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.
Genesis,2,16,"And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, ""You may surely eat of every tree of the garden,"
Genesis,2,17,"but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die."""
Genesis,2,18,"Then the LORD God said, ""It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him."""
Genesis,2,19,"So out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name."
Genesis,2,20,The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him.
Genesis,2,21,"So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh."
Genesis,2,22,And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.
Genesis,2,23,"Then the man said, ""This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."""
Genesis,2,24,"Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh."
Genesis,2,25,And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
Genesis,3,1,"Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made.He said to the woman, ""Did God actually say, 'You shall not eat of any tree in the garden'?"""
Genesis,3,2,"And the woman said to the serpent, ""We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden,"
Genesis,3,3,"but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'"""
Genesis,3,4,"But the serpent said to the woman, ""You will not surely die."
Genesis,3,5,"For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."""
Genesis,3,6,"So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate."
Genesis,3,7,"Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths."
Genesis,3,8,"And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden."
Genesis,3,9,"But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, ""Where are you?"""
Genesis,3,10,"And he said, ""I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself."""
Genesis,3,11,"He said, ""Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"""
Genesis,3,12,"The man said, ""The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate."""
Genesis,3,13,"Then the LORD God said to the woman, ""What is this that you have done?"" The woman said, ""The serpent deceived me, and I ate."""
Genesis,3,14,"The LORD God said to the serpent, ""Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life."
Genesis,3,15,"I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel."""
Genesis,3,16,"To the woman he said, ""I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you."""
Genesis,3,17,"And to Adam he said, ""Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life;"
Genesis,3,18,thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.
Genesis,3,19,"By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return."""
Genesis,3,20,"The man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living."
Genesis,3,21,And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.
Genesis,3,22,"Then the LORD God said, ""Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever--"""
Genesis,3,23,therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken.
Genesis,3,24,"He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life."
Genesis,4,1,"Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, ""I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD."""
Genesis,4,2,"And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a worker of the ground."
Genesis,4,3,"In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground,"
Genesis,4,4,"and Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering,"
Genesis,4,5,"but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell."
Genesis,4,6,"The LORD said to Cain, ""Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen?"
Genesis,4,7,"If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it."""
Genesis,4,8,"Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him."
Genesis,4,9,"Then the LORD said to Cain, ""Where is Abel your brother?"" He said, ""I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?"""
Genesis,4,10,"And the LORD said, ""What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground."
Genesis,4,11,"And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand."
Genesis,4,12,"When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth."""
Genesis,4,13,"Cain said to the LORD, ""My punishment is greater than I can bear."
Genesis,4,14,"Behold, you have driven me today away from the ground, and from your face I shall be hidden. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."""
Genesis,4,15,"Then the LORD said to him, ""Not so! If anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold."" And the LORD put a mark on Cain, lest any who found him should attack him."
Genesis,4,16,"Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden."
Genesis,4,17,"Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. When he built a city, he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch."
Genesis,4,18,"To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech."
Genesis,4,19,"And Lamech took two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah."
Genesis,4,20,Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
Genesis,4,21,His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
Genesis,4,22,Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
Genesis,4,23,"Lamech said to his wives: ""Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say: I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me."
Genesis,4,24,"If Cain's revenge is sevenfold, then Lamech's is seventy-sevenfold."""
Genesis,4,25,"And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, ""God has appointed for me another offspring instead of Abel, for Cain killed him."""
Genesis,4,26,"To Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time people began to call upon the name of the LORD."
Genesis,5,1,"This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God."
Genesis,5,2,"Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created."
Genesis,5,3,"When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth."
Genesis,5,4,The days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years; and he had other sons and daughters.

Genesis,5,6,"When Seth had lived 105 years, he fathered Enosh."
Genesis,5,7,Seth lived after he fathered Enosh 807 years and had other sons and daughters.

Genesis,5,22,Enoch walked with God after he fathered Methuselah 300 years and had other sons and daughters.

Genesis,5,27,"Thus all the days of Methuselah were 969 years, and he died."
Genesis,5,28,"When Lamech had lived 182 years, he fathered a son"

Genesis,5,31,"Thus all the days of Lamech were 777 years, and he died."
Genesis,5,32,"After Noah was 500 years old, Noah fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
Genesis,6,1,"When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them,"
Genesis,6,2,the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose.
Genesis,6,3,"Then the LORD said, ""My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years."""
Genesis,6,4,"The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown."
Genesis,6,5,"The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
Genesis,6,6,"And the LORD was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart."
Genesis,6,7,"So the LORD said, ""I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them."""
Genesis,6,8,But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
Genesis,6,9,"These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God."
Genesis,6,10,"And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
Genesis,6,11,"Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence."
Genesis,6,12,"And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth."
Genesis,6,13,"And God said to Noah, ""I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth."
Genesis,6,14,"Make yourself an ark of gopher wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch."
Genesis,6,15,"This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits."
Genesis,6,16,"Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above, and set the door of the ark in its side. Make it with lower, second, and third decks."
Genesis,6,17,"For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die."
Genesis,6,18,"But I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you."
Genesis,6,19,"And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female."
Genesis,6,20,"Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground, according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you to keep them alive."
Genesis,6,21,"Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and store it up. It shall serve as food for you and for them."""
Genesis,6,22,Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.
Genesis,7,1,"Then the LORD said to Noah, ""Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you are righteous before me in this generation."
Genesis,7,2,"Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and his mate, and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate,"
Genesis,7,3,"and seven pairs of the birds of the heavens also, male and female, to keep their offspring alive on the face of all the earth."
Genesis,7,4,"For in seven days I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground."""
Genesis,7,5,And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.
Genesis,7,6,Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth.
Genesis,7,7,And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
Genesis,7,8,"Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,"
Genesis,7,9,"two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah."
Genesis,7,10,And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth.
Genesis,7,11,"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened."
Genesis,7,12,And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
Genesis,7,13,"On the very same day Noah and his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark,"
Genesis,7,14,"they and every beast, according to its kind, and all the livestock according to their kinds, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, according to its kind, and every bird, according to its kind, every winged creature."
Genesis,7,15,"They went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life."
Genesis,7,16,"And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him. And the LORD shut him in."
Genesis,7,17,"The flood continued forty days on the earth. The waters increased and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth."
Genesis,7,18,"The waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the face of the waters."
Genesis,7,19,And the waters prevailed so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.
Genesis,7,20,"The waters prevailed above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep."
Genesis,7,21,"And all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, livestock, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all mankind."
Genesis,7,22,Everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.
Genesis,7,23,"He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens. They were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark."
Genesis,7,24,And the waters prevailed on the earth 150 days.
Genesis,8,1,"But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided."
Genesis,8,2,"The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained,"
Genesis,8,3,"and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of 150 days the waters had abated,"
Genesis,8,4,"and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat."
Genesis,8,5,"And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen."
Genesis,8,6,At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made
Genesis,8,7,and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.
Genesis,8,8,"Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground."
Genesis,8,9,"But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him."
Genesis,8,10,"He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark."
Genesis,8,11,"And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth."
Genesis,8,12,"Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore."
Genesis,8,13,"In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry."
Genesis,8,14,"In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth had dried out."
Genesis,8,15,"Then God said to Noah,"
Genesis,8,16,"""Go out from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you."
Genesis,8,17,"Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh--birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth--that they may swarm on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth."""
Genesis,8,18,"So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him."
Genesis,8,19,"Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by families from the ark."
Genesis,8,20,Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and took some of every clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
Genesis,8,21,"And when the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, the LORD said in his heart, ""I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the intention of man's heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done."
Genesis,8,22,"While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease."""
Genesis,9,1,"And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, ""Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth."
Genesis,9,2,"The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand they are delivered."
Genesis,9,3,"Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything."
Genesis,9,4,"But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood."
Genesis,9,5,And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning: from every beast I will require it and from man. From his fellow man I will require a reckoning for the life of man.
Genesis,9,6,"""Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image."
Genesis,9,7,"And you, be fruitful and multiply, teem on the earth and multiply in it."""
Genesis,9,8,"Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,"
Genesis,9,9,"""Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you,"
Genesis,9,10,"and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark; it is for every beast of the earth."
Genesis,9,11,"I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth."""
Genesis,9,12,"And God said, ""This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:"
Genesis,9,13,"I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth."
Genesis,9,14,"When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds,"
Genesis,9,15,I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh. And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.
Genesis,9,16,"When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."""
Genesis,9,17,"God said to Noah, ""This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."""
Genesis,9,18,"The sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)"
Genesis,9,19,"These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the people of the whole earth were dispersed."

Genesis,13,2,"Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold."
Genesis,13,3,"And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,"
Genesis,13,4,to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the LORD.
Genesis,13,5,"And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents,"
Genesis,13,6,"so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together,"
Genesis,13,7,and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.
Genesis,13,8,"Then Abram said to Lot, ""Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen."

Genesis,13,12,"Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom."
Genesis,13,13,"Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the LORD."

Genesis,14,9,"with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, four kings against five."
Genesis,14,10,"Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the hill country."
Genesis,14,11,"So the enemy took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way."

Genesis,18,12,"So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, ""After I am worn out, and my lord is old, shall I have pleasure?"""

Genesis,18,22,"So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the LORD."
Genesis,18,23,"Then Abraham drew near and said, ""Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?"
Genesis,18,24,Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it?
Genesis,18,25,"Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?"""
Genesis,18,26,"And the LORD said, ""If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake."""
Genesis,18,27,"Abraham answered and said, ""Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes."
Genesis,18,28,"Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?"" And he said, ""I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there."""
Genesis,18,29,"Again he spoke to him and said, ""Suppose forty are found there."" He answered, ""For the sake of forty I will not do it."""
Genesis,18,30,"Then he said, ""Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there."" He answered, ""I will not do it, if I find thirty there."""
Genesis,18,31,"He said, ""Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there."" He answered, ""For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it."""
Genesis,18,32,"Then he said, ""Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there."" He answered, ""For the sake of ten I will not destroy it."""
Genesis,18,33,"And the LORD went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place."
Genesis,19,1,"The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth"
Genesis,19,2,"and said, ""My lords, please turn aside to your servant's house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way."" They said, ""No; we will spend the night in the town square."""
Genesis,19,3,"But he pressed them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate."
Genesis,19,4,"But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house."
Genesis,19,5,"And they called to Lot, ""Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them."""
Genesis,19,6,"Lot went out to the men at the entrance, shut the door after him,"
Genesis,19,7,"and said, ""I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly."
Genesis,19,8,"Behold, I have two daughters who have not known any man. Let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof."""
Genesis,19,9,"But they said, ""Stand back!"" And they said, ""This fellow came to sojourn, and he has become the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them."" Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door down."
Genesis,19,10,But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door.
Genesis,19,11,"And they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door."
Genesis,19,12,"Then the men said to Lot, ""Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city, bring them out of the place."
Genesis,19,13,"For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it."""
Genesis,19,14,"So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, ""Up! Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy the city."" But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting."
Genesis,19,15,"As morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, ""Up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city."""
Genesis,19,16,"But he lingered. So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the LORD being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city."
Genesis,19,17,"And as they brought them out, one said, ""Escape for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Escape to the hills, lest you be swept away."""
Genesis,19,18,"And Lot said to them, ""Oh, no, my lords."
Genesis,19,19,"Behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life. But I cannot escape to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me and I die."
Genesis,19,20,"Behold, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there--is it not a little one?--and my life will be saved!"""
Genesis,19,21,"He said to him, ""Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken."
Genesis,19,22,"Escape there quickly, for I can do nothing till you arrive there."" Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar."
Genesis,19,23,The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
Genesis,19,24,Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven.
Genesis,19,25,"And he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground."
Genesis,19,26,"But Lot's wife, behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt."
Genesis,19,27,And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
Genesis,19,28,"And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley, and he looked and, behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace."
Genesis,19,29,"So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived."
Genesis,19,30,"Now Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters."
Genesis,19,31,"And the firstborn said to the younger, ""Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth."
Genesis,19,32,"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father."""
Genesis,19,33,So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
Genesis,19,34,"The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, ""Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father."""
Genesis,19,35,"So they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose."
Genesis,19,36,Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.
Genesis,19,37,The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.
Genesis,19,38,The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites to this day.
Genesis,20,1,From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.
Genesis,20,2,"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, ""She is my sister."" And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah."
Genesis,20,3,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, ""Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man's wife."""
Genesis,20,4,"Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, ""Lord, will you kill an innocent people?"
Genesis,20,5,"Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this."""
Genesis,20,6,"Then God said to him in the dream, ""Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her."
Genesis,20,7,"Now then, return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you, and all who are yours."""
Genesis,20,8,So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid.
Genesis,20,9,"Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, ""What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done."""
Genesis,20,10,"And Abimelech said to Abraham, ""What did you see, that you did this thing?"""
Genesis,20,11,"Abraham said, ""I did it because I thought, There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife."
Genesis,20,12,"Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife."
Genesis,20,13,"And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, 'This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, He is my brother.'"""
Genesis,20,14,"Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him."
Genesis,20,15,"And Abimelech said, ""Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you."""
Genesis,20,16,"To Sarah he said, ""Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you, and before everyone you are vindicated."""
Genesis,20,17,"Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children."
Genesis,20,18,"For the LORD had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife."
Genesis,21,1,"The LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had promised."
Genesis,21,2,And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him.
Genesis,21,3,"Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac."
Genesis,21,4,"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him."
Genesis,21,5,Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
Genesis,21,6,"And Sarah said, ""God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me."""
Genesis,21,7,"And she said, ""Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age."""
Genesis,21,8,And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
Genesis,21,9,"But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, laughing."
Genesis,21,10,"So she said to Abraham, ""Cast out this slave woman with her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac."""
Genesis,21,11,And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son.
Genesis,21,12,"But God said to Abraham, ""Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named."
Genesis,21,13,"And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring."""
Genesis,21,14,"So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba."
Genesis,21,15,"When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes."
Genesis,21,16,"Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, ""Let me not look on the death of the child."" And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept."
Genesis,21,17,"And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, ""What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is."
Genesis,21,18,"Up! Lift up the boy, and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation."""
Genesis,21,19,"Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink."
Genesis,21,20,"And God was with the boy, and he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an expert with the bow."
Genesis,21,21,"He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt."
Genesis,21,22,"At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, ""God is with you in all that you do."
Genesis,21,23,"Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned."""
Genesis,21,24,"And Abraham said, ""I will swear."""
Genesis,21,25,"When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized,"
Genesis,21,26,"Abimelech said, ""I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today."""
Genesis,21,27,"So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant."
Genesis,21,28,Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart.
Genesis,21,29,"And Abimelech said to Abraham, ""What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?"""
Genesis,21,30,"He said, ""These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this may be a witness for me that I dug this well."""
Genesis,21,31,"Therefore that place was called Beersheba, because there both of them swore an oath."
Genesis,21,32,So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines.
Genesis,21,33,"Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God."
Genesis,21,34,And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.
Genesis,22,1,"After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, ""Abraham!"" And he said, ""Here am I."""
Genesis,22,2,"He said, ""Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you."""
Genesis,22,3,"So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him."
Genesis,22,4,On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.
Genesis,22,5,"Then Abraham said to his young men, ""Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you."""
Genesis,22,6,And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together.
Genesis,22,7,"And Isaac said to his father Abraham, ""My father!"" And he said, ""Here am I, my son."" He said, ""Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"""
Genesis,22,8,"Abraham said, ""God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son."" So they went both of them together."
Genesis,22,9,"When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood."
Genesis,22,10,Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.
Genesis,22,11,"But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, ""Abraham, Abraham!"" And he said, ""Here am I."""
Genesis,22,12,"He said, ""Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me."""
Genesis,22,13,"And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son."
Genesis,22,14,"So Abraham called the name of that place, ""The LORD will provide""; as it is said to this day, ""On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided."""
Genesis,22,15,And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven
Genesis,22,16,"and said, ""By myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,"
Genesis,22,17,"I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies,"
Genesis,22,18,"and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice."""
Genesis,22,19,"So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba."
Genesis,22,20,"Now after these things it was told to Abraham, ""Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor:"
Genesis,22,21,"Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,"
Genesis,22,22,"Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."""
Genesis,22,23,"(Bethuel fathered Rebekah.) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother."
Genesis,22,24,"Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah."
Genesis,23,1,Sarah lived 127 years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.
Genesis,23,2,"And Sarah died at Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her."
Genesis,23,3,"And Abraham rose up from before his dead and said to the Hittites,"
Genesis,23,4,"""I am a sojourner and foreigner among you; give me property among you for a burying place, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."""
Genesis,23,5,"The Hittites answered Abraham,"
Genesis,23,6,"""Hear us, my lord; you are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb to hinder you from burying your dead."""
Genesis,23,7,"Abraham rose and bowed to the Hittites, the people of the land."
Genesis,23,8,"And he said to them, ""If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar,"
Genesis,23,9,"that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns; it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as property for a burying place."""
Genesis,23,10,"Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites, and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who went in at the gate of his city,"
Genesis,23,11,"""No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the sight of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead."""
Genesis,23,12,Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.
Genesis,23,13,"And he said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, ""But if you will, hear me: I give the price of the field. Accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there."""
Genesis,23,14,"Ephron answered Abraham,"
Genesis,23,15,"""My lord, listen to me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between you and me? Bury your dead."""
Genesis,23,16,"Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants."
Genesis,23,17,"So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, was made over"
Genesis,23,18,"to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all who went in at the gate of his city."
Genesis,23,19,"After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah east of Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,23,20,The field and the cave that is in it were made over to Abraham as property for a burying place by the Hittites.
Genesis,24,1,"Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years. And the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things."
Genesis,24,2,"And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he had, ""Put your hand under my thigh,"
Genesis,24,3,"that I may make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell,"
Genesis,24,4,"but will go to my country and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac."""
Genesis,24,5,"The servant said to him, ""Perhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?"""
Genesis,24,6,"Abraham said to him, ""See to it that you do not take my son back there."
Genesis,24,7,"The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and swore to me, 'To your offspring I will give this land,' he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there."
Genesis,24,8,"But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there."""
Genesis,24,9,So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.
Genesis,24,10,"Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master; and he arose and went to Mesopotamia to the city of Nahor."
Genesis,24,11,"And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time when women go out to draw water."
Genesis,24,12,"And he said, ""O LORD, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham."
Genesis,24,13,"Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water."
Genesis,24,14,"Let the young woman to whom I shall say, 'Please let down your jar that I may drink,' and who shall say, 'Drink, and I will water your camels'--let her be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master."""
Genesis,24,15,"Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water jar on her shoulder."
Genesis,24,16,"The young woman was very attractive in appearance, a maiden whom no man had known. She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up."
Genesis,24,17,"Then the servant ran to meet her and said, ""Please give me a little water to drink from your jar."""
Genesis,24,18,"She said, ""Drink, my lord."" And she quickly let down her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink."
Genesis,24,19,"When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, ""I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking."""
Genesis,24,20,"So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water, and she drew for all his camels."
Genesis,24,21,The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether the LORD had prospered his journey or not.
Genesis,24,22,"When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel, and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels,"
Genesis,24,23,"and said, ""Please tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?"""
Genesis,24,24,"She said to him, ""I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."""
Genesis,24,25,"She added, ""We have plenty of both straw and fodder, and room to spend the night."""
Genesis,24,26,The man bowed his head and worshiped the LORD
Genesis,24,27,"and said, ""Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the LORD has led me in the way to the house of my master's kinsmen."""
Genesis,24,28,Then the young woman ran and told her mother's household about these things.
Genesis,24,29,"Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban. Laban ran out toward the man, to the spring."
Genesis,24,30,"As soon as he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and heard the words of Rebekah his sister, ""Thus the man spoke to me,"" he went to the man. And behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring."
Genesis,24,31,"He said, ""Come in, O blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels."""
Genesis,24,32,"So the man came to the house and unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and there was water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him."
Genesis,24,33,"Then food was set before him to eat. But he said, ""I will not eat until I have said what I have to say."" He said, ""Speak on."""
Genesis,24,34,"So he said, ""I am Abraham's servant."
Genesis,24,35,"The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, camels and donkeys."
Genesis,24,36,"And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old, and to him he has given all that he has."
Genesis,24,37,"My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell,"
Genesis,24,38,but you shall go to my father's house and to my clan and take a wife for my son.'
Genesis,24,39,"I said to my master, 'Perhaps the woman will not follow me.'"
Genesis,24,40,"But he said to me, 'The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my clan and from my father's house."
Genesis,24,41,"Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my clan. And if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.'"
Genesis,24,42,"""I came today to the spring and said, 'O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now you are prospering the way that I go,"
Genesis,24,43,"behold, I am standing by the spring of water. Let the virgin who comes out to draw water, to whom I shall say, ""Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,"""
Genesis,24,44,"and who will say to me, ""Drink, and I will draw for your camels also,"" let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master's son.'"
Genesis,24,45,"""Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her water jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'"
Genesis,24,46,"She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I will give your camels drink also.' So I drank, and she gave the camels drink also."
Genesis,24,47,"Then I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.' So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms."
Genesis,24,48,"Then I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way to take the daughter of my master's kinsman for his son."
Genesis,24,49,"Now then, if you are going to show steadfast love and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left."""
Genesis,24,50,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, ""The thing has come from the LORD; we cannot speak to you bad or good."
Genesis,24,51,"Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has spoken."""
Genesis,24,52,"When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the earth before the LORD."
Genesis,24,53,"And the servant brought out jewelry of silver and of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments."
Genesis,24,54,"And he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they arose in the morning, he said, ""Send me away to my master."""
Genesis,24,55,"Her brother and her mother said, ""Let the young woman remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go."""
Genesis,24,56,"But he said to them, ""Do not delay me, since the LORD has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master."""
Genesis,24,57,"They said, ""Let us call the young woman and ask her."""
Genesis,24,58,"And they called Rebekah and said to her, ""Will you go with this man?"" She said, ""I will go."""
Genesis,24,59,"So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham's servant and his men."
Genesis,24,60,"And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, ""Our sister, may you become thousands of ten thousands, and may your offspring possess the gate of those who hate them!"""
Genesis,24,61,Then Rebekah and her young women arose and rode on the camels and followed the man. Thus the servant took Rebekah and went his way.
Genesis,24,62,Now Isaac had returned from Beer-lahai-roi and was dwelling in the Negeb.
Genesis,24,63,"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, there were camels coming."
Genesis,24,64,"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel"
Genesis,24,65,"and said to the servant, ""Who is that man, walking in the field to meet us?"" The servant said, ""It is my master."" So she took her veil and covered herself."
Genesis,24,66,And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
Genesis,24,67,"Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death."
Genesis,25,1,"Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah."
Genesis,25,2,"She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah."
Genesis,25,3,"Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim."
Genesis,25,4,"The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah."
Genesis,25,5,Abraham gave all he had to Isaac.
Genesis,25,6,"But to the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts, and while he was still living he sent them away from his son Isaac, eastward to the east country."
Genesis,25,7,"These are the days of the years of Abraham's life, 175 years."
Genesis,25,8,"Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people."
Genesis,25,9,"Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, east of Mamre,"
Genesis,25,10,"the field that Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried, with Sarah his wife."
Genesis,25,11,"After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac settled at Beer-lahai-roi."
Genesis,25,12,"These are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's servant, bore to Abraham."
Genesis,25,13,"These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, named in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael; and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,"
Genesis,25,14,"Mishma, Dumah, Massa,"
Genesis,25,15,"Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah."
Genesis,25,16,"These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their tribes."
Genesis,25,17,"(These are the years of the life of Ishmael: 137 years. He breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.)"
Genesis,25,18,"They settled from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria. He settled over against all his kinsmen."
Genesis,25,19,"These are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham fathered Isaac,"
Genesis,25,20,"and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to be his wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean."
Genesis,25,21,"And Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived."
Genesis,25,22,"The children struggled together within her, and she said, ""If it is thus, why is this happening to me?"" So she went to inquire of the LORD."
Genesis,25,23,"And the LORD said to her, ""Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you shall be divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the older shall serve the younger."""
Genesis,25,24,"When her days to give birth were completed, behold, there were twins in her womb."
Genesis,25,25,"The first came out red, all his body like a hairy cloak, so they called his name Esau."
Genesis,25,26,"Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau's heel, so his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them."
Genesis,25,27,"When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents."
Genesis,25,28,"Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob."
Genesis,25,29,"Once when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted."
Genesis,25,30,"And Esau said to Jacob, ""Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am exhausted!"" (Therefore his name was called Edom. )"
Genesis,25,31,"Jacob said, ""Sell me your birthright now."""
Genesis,25,32,"Esau said, ""I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?"""
Genesis,25,33,"Jacob said, ""Swear to me now."" So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob."
Genesis,25,34,"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright."
Genesis,26,1,"Now there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Gerar to Abimelech king of the Philistines."
Genesis,26,2,"And the LORD appeared to him and said, ""Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land of which I shall tell you."
Genesis,26,3,"Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you, for to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham your father."
Genesis,26,4,"I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these lands. And in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed,"
Genesis,26,5,"because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."""
Genesis,26,6,So Isaac settled in Gerar.
Genesis,26,7,"When the men of the place asked him about his wife, he said, ""She is my sister,"" for he feared to say, ""My wife,"" thinking, ""lest the men of the place should kill me because of Rebekah,"" because she was attractive in appearance."
Genesis,26,8,"When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac laughing with Rebekah his wife."
Genesis,26,9,"So Abimelech called Isaac and said, ""Behold, she is your wife. How then could you say, 'She is my sister'?"" Isaac said to him, ""Because I thought, 'Lest I die because of her.'"""
Genesis,26,10,"Abimelech said, ""What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us."""
Genesis,26,11,"So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, ""Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."""
Genesis,26,12,"And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. The LORD blessed him,"
Genesis,26,13,"and the man became rich, and gained more and more until he became very wealthy."
Genesis,26,14,"He had possessions of flocks and herds and many servants, so that the Philistines envied him."
Genesis,26,15,(Now the Philistines had stopped and filled with earth all the wells that his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father.)
Genesis,26,16,"And Abimelech said to Isaac, ""Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we."""
Genesis,26,17,So Isaac departed from there and encamped in the valley of Gerar and settled there.
Genesis,26,18,"And Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham. And he gave them the names that his father had given them."
Genesis,26,19,"But when Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of spring water,"
Genesis,26,20,"the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, ""The water is ours."" So he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him."
Genesis,26,21,"Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that also, so he called its name Sitnah."
Genesis,26,22,"And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, saying, ""For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."""
Genesis,26,23,From there he went up to Beersheba.
Genesis,26,24,"And the LORD appeared to him the same night and said, ""I am the God of Abraham your father. Fear not, for I am with you and will bless you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham's sake."""
Genesis,26,25,So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac's servants dug a well.
Genesis,26,26,"When Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army,"
Genesis,26,27,"Isaac said to them, ""Why have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?"""
Genesis,26,28,"They said, ""We see plainly that the LORD has been with you. So we said, let there be a sworn pact between us, between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you,"
Genesis,26,29,"that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD."""
Genesis,26,30,"So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank."
Genesis,26,31,"In the morning they rose early and exchanged oaths. And Isaac sent them on their way, and they departed from him in peace."
Genesis,26,32,"That same day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well that they had dug and said to him, ""We have found water."""
Genesis,26,33,He called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.
Genesis,26,34,"When Esau was forty years old, he took Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite to be his wife, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite,"
Genesis,26,35,and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah.
Genesis,27,1,"When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his older son and said to him, ""My son""; and he answered, ""Here I am."""
Genesis,27,2,"He said, ""Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death."
Genesis,27,3,"Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me,"
Genesis,27,4,"and prepare for me delicious food, such as I love, and bring it to me so that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die."""
Genesis,27,5,"Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it,"
Genesis,27,6,"Rebekah said to her son Jacob, ""I heard your father speak to your brother Esau,"
Genesis,27,7,"'Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food, that I may eat it and bless you before the LORD before I die.'"
Genesis,27,8,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice as I command you."
Genesis,27,9,"Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats, so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father, such as he loves."
Genesis,27,10,"And you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies."""
Genesis,27,11,"But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, ""Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man."
Genesis,27,12,"Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing."""
Genesis,27,13,"His mother said to him, ""Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me."""
Genesis,27,14,"So he went and took them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared delicious food, such as his father loved."
Genesis,27,15,"Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son."
Genesis,27,16,And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
Genesis,27,17,"And she put the delicious food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob."
Genesis,27,18,"So he went in to his father and said, ""My father."" And he said, ""Here I am. Who are you, my son?"""
Genesis,27,19,"Jacob said to his father, ""I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me."""
Genesis,27,20,"But Isaac said to his son, ""How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?"" He answered, ""Because the LORD your God granted me success."""
Genesis,27,21,"Then Isaac said to Jacob, ""Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not."""
Genesis,27,22,"So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, ""The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."""
Genesis,27,23,"And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him."
Genesis,27,24,"He said, ""Are you really my son Esau?"" He answered, ""I am."""
Genesis,27,25,"Then he said, ""Bring it near to me, that I may eat of my son's game and bless you."" So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank."
Genesis,27,26,"Then his father Isaac said to him, ""Come near and kiss me, my son."""
Genesis,27,27,"So he came near and kissed him. And Isaac smelled the smell of his garments and blessed him and said, ""See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed!"
Genesis,27,28,May God give you of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth and plenty of grain and wine.
Genesis,27,29,"Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be everyone who blesses you!"""
Genesis,27,30,"As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting."
Genesis,27,31,"He also prepared delicious food and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, ""Let my father arise and eat of his son's game, that you may bless me."""
Genesis,27,32,"His father Isaac said to him, ""Who are you?"" He answered, ""I am your son, your firstborn, Esau."""
Genesis,27,33,"Then Isaac trembled very violently and said, ""Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed."""
Genesis,27,34,"As soon as Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, ""Bless me, even me also, O my father!"""
Genesis,27,35,"But he said, ""Your brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing."""
Genesis,27,36,"Esau said, ""Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me these two times. He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing."" Then he said, ""Have you not reserved a blessing for me?"""
Genesis,27,37,"Isaac answered and said to Esau, ""Behold, I have made him lord over you, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?"""
Genesis,27,38,"Esau said to his father, ""Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father."" And Esau lifted up his voice and wept."
Genesis,27,39,"Then Isaac his father answered and said to him: ""Behold, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, and away from the dew of heaven on high."
Genesis,27,40,"By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; but when you grow restless you shall break his yoke from your neck."""
Genesis,27,41,"Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, ""The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob."""
Genesis,27,42,"But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, ""Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you."
Genesis,27,43,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran"
Genesis,27,44,"and stay with him a while, until your brother's fury turns away--"
Genesis,27,45,"until your brother's anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereft of you both in one day?"""
Genesis,27,46,"Then Rebekah said to Isaac, ""I loathe my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women like these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?"""
Genesis,28,1,"Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and directed him, ""You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women."
Genesis,28,2,"Arise, go to Paddan-aram to the house of Bethuel your mother's father, and take as your wife from there one of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother."
Genesis,28,3,"God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples."
Genesis,28,4,"May he give the blessing of Abraham to you and to your offspring with you, that you may take possession of the land of your sojournings that God gave to Abraham!"""
Genesis,28,5,"Thus Isaac sent Jacob away. And he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother."
Genesis,28,6,"Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he directed him, ""You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women,"""
Genesis,28,7,and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and gone to Paddan-aram.
Genesis,28,8,"So when Esau saw that the Canaanite women did not please Isaac his father,"
Genesis,28,9,"Esau went to Ishmael and took as his wife, besides the wives he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth."
Genesis,28,10,Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran.
Genesis,28,11,"And he came to a certain place and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep."
Genesis,28,12,"And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it!"
Genesis,28,13,"And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, ""I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring."
Genesis,28,14,"Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
Genesis,28,15,"Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you."""
Genesis,28,16,"Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, ""Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it."""
Genesis,28,17,"And he was afraid and said, ""How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."""
Genesis,28,18,So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it.
Genesis,28,19,"He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first."
Genesis,28,20,"Then Jacob made a vow, saying, ""If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear,"
Genesis,28,21,"so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the LORD shall be my God,"
Genesis,28,22,"and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that you give me I will give a full tenth to you."""
Genesis,29,1,Then Jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the people of the east.
Genesis,29,2,"As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep lying beside it, for out of that well the flocks were watered. The stone on the well's mouth was large,"
Genesis,29,3,"and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well."
Genesis,29,4,"Jacob said to them, ""My brothers, where do you come from?"" They said, ""We are from Haran."""
Genesis,29,5,"He said to them, ""Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?"" They said, ""We know him."""
Genesis,29,6,"He said to them, ""Is it well with him?"" They said, ""It is well; and see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep!"""
Genesis,29,7,"He said, ""Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep and go, pasture them."""
Genesis,29,8,"But they said, ""We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep."""
Genesis,29,9,"While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess."
Genesis,29,10,"Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, Jacob came near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother."
Genesis,29,11,Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud.
Genesis,29,12,"And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's kinsman, and that he was Rebekah's son, and she ran and told her father."
Genesis,29,13,"As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things,"
Genesis,29,14,"and Laban said to him, ""Surely you are my bone and my flesh!"" And he stayed with him a month."
Genesis,29,15,"Then Laban said to Jacob, ""Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?"""
Genesis,29,16,"Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
Genesis,29,17,"Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance."
Genesis,29,18,"Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, ""I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel."""
Genesis,29,19,"Laban said, ""It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me."""
Genesis,29,20,"So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her."
Genesis,29,21,"Then Jacob said to Laban, ""Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed."""
Genesis,29,22,So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and made a feast.
Genesis,29,23,"But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and he went in to her."
Genesis,29,24,(Laban gave his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant.)
Genesis,29,25,"And in the morning, behold, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, ""What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?"""
Genesis,29,26,"Laban said, ""It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn."
Genesis,29,27,"Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years."""
Genesis,29,28,"Jacob did so, and completed her week. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife."
Genesis,29,29,(Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.)
Genesis,29,30,"So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served Laban for another seven years."
Genesis,29,31,"When the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren."
Genesis,29,32,"And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, ""Because the LORD has looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me."""
Genesis,29,33,"She conceived again and bore a son, and said, ""Because the LORD has heard that I am hated, he has given me this son also."" And she called his name Simeon."
Genesis,29,34,"Again she conceived and bore a son, and said, ""Now this time my husband will be attached to me, because I have borne him three sons."" Therefore his name was called Levi."
Genesis,29,35,"And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, ""This time I will praise the LORD."" Therefore she called his name Judah. Then she ceased bearing."
Genesis,30,1,"When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she envied her sister. She said to Jacob, ""Give me children, or I shall die!"""
Genesis,30,2,"Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, ""Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"""
Genesis,30,3,"Then she said, ""Here is my servant Bilhah; go in to her, so that she may give birth on my behalf, that even I may have children through her."""
Genesis,30,4,"So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her."
Genesis,30,5,And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
Genesis,30,6,"Then Rachel said, ""God has judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son."" Therefore she called his name Dan."
Genesis,30,7,Rachel's servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
Genesis,30,8,"Then Rachel said, ""With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister and have prevailed."" So she called his name Naphtali."
Genesis,30,9,"When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife."
Genesis,30,10,Then Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
Genesis,30,11,"And Leah said, ""Good fortune has come!"" so she called his name Gad."
Genesis,30,12,Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
Genesis,30,13,"And Leah said, ""Happy am I! For women have called me happy."" So she called his name Asher."
Genesis,30,14,"In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, ""Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."""
Genesis,30,15,"But she said to her, ""Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes also?"" Rachel said, ""Then he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes."""
Genesis,30,16,"When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, ""You must come in to me, for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes."" So he lay with her that night."
Genesis,30,17,"And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son."
Genesis,30,18,"Leah said, ""God has given me my wages because I gave my servant to my husband."" So she called his name Issachar."
Genesis,30,19,"And Leah conceived again, and she bore Jacob a sixth son."
Genesis,30,20,"Then Leah said, ""God has endowed me with a good endowment; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons."" So she called his name Zebulun."
Genesis,30,21,Afterward she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah.
Genesis,30,22,"Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb."
Genesis,30,23,"She conceived and bore a son and said, ""God has taken away my reproach."""
Genesis,30,24,"And she called his name Joseph, saying, ""May the LORD add to me another son!"""
Genesis,30,25,"As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, ""Send me away, that I may go to my own home and country."
Genesis,30,26,"Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, that I may go, for you know the service that I have given you."""
Genesis,30,27,"But Laban said to him, ""If I have found favor in your sight, I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you."
Genesis,30,28,"Name your wages, and I will give it."""
Genesis,30,29,"Jacob said to him, ""You yourself know how I have served you, and how your livestock has fared with me."
Genesis,30,30,"For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I provide for my own household also?"""
Genesis,30,31,"He said, ""What shall I give you?"" Jacob said, ""You shall not give me anything. If you will do this for me, I will again pasture your flock and keep it:"
Genesis,30,32,"let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and they shall be my wages."
Genesis,30,33,"So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to look into my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be counted stolen."""
Genesis,30,34,"Laban said, ""Good! Let it be as you have said."""
Genesis,30,35,"But that day Laban removed the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put them in charge of his sons."
Genesis,30,36,"And he set a distance of three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob pastured the rest of Laban's flock."
Genesis,30,37,"Then Jacob took fresh sticks of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white of the sticks."
Genesis,30,38,"He set the sticks that he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, that is, the watering places, where the flocks came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink,"
Genesis,30,39,"the flocks bred in front of the sticks and so the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted."
Genesis,30,40,And Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban. He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban's flock.
Genesis,30,41,"Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the sticks,"
Genesis,30,42,"but for the feebler of the flock he would not lay them there. So the feebler would be Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's."
Genesis,30,43,"Thus the man increased greatly and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys."
Genesis,31,1,"Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were saying, ""Jacob has taken all that was our father's, and from what was our father's he has gained all this wealth."""
Genesis,31,2,And Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him with favor as before.
Genesis,31,3,"Then the LORD said to Jacob, ""Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you."""
Genesis,31,4,So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was
Genesis,31,5,"and said to them, ""I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before. But the God of my father has been with me."
Genesis,31,6,"You know that I have served your father with all my strength,"
Genesis,31,7,yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times. But God did not permit him to harm me.
Genesis,31,8,"If he said, 'The spotted shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said, 'The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore striped."
Genesis,31,9,Thus God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me.
Genesis,31,10,"In the breeding season of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream that the goats that mated with the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled."
Genesis,31,11,"Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am!'"
Genesis,31,12,"And he said, 'Lift up your eyes and see, all the goats that mate with the flock are striped, spotted, and mottled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you."
Genesis,31,13,"I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise, go out from this land and return to the land of your kindred.'"""
Genesis,31,14,"Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, ""Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father's house?"
Genesis,31,15,"Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has indeed devoured our money."
Genesis,31,16,"All the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do."""
Genesis,31,17,So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels.
Genesis,31,18,"He drove away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac."
Genesis,31,19,"Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's household gods."
Genesis,31,20,"And Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean, by not telling him that he intended to flee."
Genesis,31,21,"He fled with all that he had and arose and crossed the Euphrates, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead."
Genesis,31,22,"When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,"
Genesis,31,23,he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead.
Genesis,31,24,"But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night and said to him, ""Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad."""
Genesis,31,25,"And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen pitched tents in the hill country of Gilead."
Genesis,31,26,"And Laban said to Jacob, ""What have you done, that you have tricked me and driven away my daughters like captives of the sword?"
Genesis,31,27,"Why did you flee secretly and trick me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre?"
Genesis,31,28,And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? Now you have done foolishly.
Genesis,31,29,"It is in my power to do you harm. But the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.'"
Genesis,31,30,"And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father's house, but why did you steal my gods?"""
Genesis,31,31,"Jacob answered and said to Laban, ""Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force."
Genesis,31,32,"Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and take it."" Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them."
Genesis,31,33,"So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent and entered Rachel's."
Genesis,31,34,"Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel's saddle and sat on them. Laban felt all about the tent, but did not find them."
Genesis,31,35,"And she said to her father, ""Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me."" So he searched but did not find the household gods."
Genesis,31,36,"Then Jacob became angry and berated Laban. Jacob said to Laban, ""What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?"
Genesis,31,37,"For you have felt through all my goods; what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two."
Genesis,31,38,"These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks."
Genesis,31,39,"What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night."
Genesis,31,40,"There I was: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes."
Genesis,31,41,"These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times."
Genesis,31,42,"If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night."""
Genesis,31,43,"Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, ""The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne?"
Genesis,31,44,"Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I. And let it be a witness between you and me."""
Genesis,31,45,So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
Genesis,31,46,"And Jacob said to his kinsmen, ""Gather stones."" And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap."
Genesis,31,47,"Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed."
Genesis,31,48,"Laban said, ""This heap is a witness between you and me today."" Therefore he named it Galeed,"
Genesis,31,49,"and Mizpah, for he said, ""The LORD watch between you and me, when we are out of one another's sight."
Genesis,31,50,"If you oppress my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us, see, God is witness between you and me."""
Genesis,31,51,"Then Laban said to Jacob, ""See this heap and the pillar, which I have set between you and me."
Genesis,31,52,"This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm."
Genesis,31,53,"The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us."" So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac,"
Genesis,31,54,and Jacob offered a sacrifice in the hill country and called his kinsmen to eat bread. They ate bread and spent the night in the hill country.
Genesis,31,55,Early in the morning Laban arose and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned home.
Genesis,32,1,"Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him."
Genesis,32,2,"And when Jacob saw them he said, ""This is God's camp!"" So he called the name of that place Mahanaim."
Genesis,32,3,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the country of Edom,"
Genesis,32,4,"instructing them, ""Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, 'I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now."
Genesis,32,5,"I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your sight.'"""
Genesis,32,6,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, ""We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him."""
Genesis,32,7,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps,"
Genesis,32,8,"thinking, ""If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp that is left will escape."""
Genesis,32,9,"And Jacob said, ""O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD who said to me, 'Return to your country and to your kindred, that I may do you good,'"
Genesis,32,10,"I am not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps."
Genesis,32,11,"Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, that he may come and attack me, the mothers with the children."
Genesis,32,12,"But you said, 'I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.'"""
Genesis,32,13,"So he stayed there that night, and from what he had with him he took a present for his brother Esau,"
Genesis,32,14,"two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,"
Genesis,32,15,"thirty milking camels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys."
Genesis,32,16,"These he handed over to his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, ""Pass on ahead of me and put a space between drove and drove."""
Genesis,32,17,"He instructed the first, ""When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, 'To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these ahead of you?'"
Genesis,32,18,"then you shall say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a present sent to my lord Esau. And moreover, he is behind us.'"""
Genesis,32,19,"He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, ""You shall say the same thing to Esau when you find him,"
Genesis,32,20,"and you shall say, 'Moreover, your servant Jacob is behind us.'"" For he thought, ""I may appease him with the present that goes ahead of me, and afterward I shall see his face. Perhaps he will accept me."""
Genesis,32,21,"So the present passed on ahead of him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp."
Genesis,32,22,"The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok."
Genesis,32,23,"He took them and sent them across the stream, and everything else that he had."
Genesis,32,24,And Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.
Genesis,32,25,"When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him."
Genesis,32,26,"Then he said, ""Let me go, for the day has broken."" But Jacob said, ""I will not let you go unless you bless me."""
Genesis,32,27,"And he said to him, ""What is your name?"" And he said, ""Jacob."""
Genesis,32,28,"Then he said, ""Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed."""
Genesis,32,29,"Then Jacob asked him, ""Please tell me your name."" But he said, ""Why is it that you ask my name?"" And there he blessed him."
Genesis,32,30,"So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, ""For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered."""
Genesis,32,31,"The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his hip."
Genesis,32,32,"Therefore to this day the people of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket, because he touched the socket of Jacob's hip on the sinew of the thigh."
Genesis,33,1,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two female servants."
Genesis,33,2,"And he put the servants with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all."
Genesis,33,3,"He himself went on before them, bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother."
Genesis,33,4,"But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept."
Genesis,33,5,"And when Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children, he said, ""Who are these with you?"" Jacob said, ""The children whom God has graciously given your servant."""
Genesis,33,6,"Then the servants drew near, they and their children, and bowed down."
Genesis,33,7,"Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down. And last Joseph and Rachel drew near, and they bowed down."
Genesis,33,8,"Esau said, ""What do you mean by all this company that I met?"" Jacob answered, ""To find favor in the sight of my lord."""
Genesis,33,9,"But Esau said, ""I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself."""
Genesis,33,10,"Jacob said, ""No, please, if I have found favor in your sight, then accept my present from my hand. For I have seen your face, which is like seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me."
Genesis,33,11,"Please accept my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough."" Thus he urged him, and he took it."
Genesis,33,12,"Then Esau said, ""Let us journey on our way, and I will go ahead of you."""
Genesis,33,13,"But Jacob said to him, ""My lord knows that the children are frail, and that the nursing flocks and herds are a care to me. If they are driven hard for one day, all the flocks will die."
Genesis,33,14,"Let my lord pass on ahead of his servant, and I will lead on slowly, at the pace of the livestock that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir."""
Genesis,33,15,"So Esau said, ""Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me."" But he said, ""What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord."""
Genesis,33,16,So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
Genesis,33,17,"But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth."
Genesis,33,18,"And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, on his way from Paddan-aram, and he camped before the city."
Genesis,33,19,"And from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, he bought for a hundred pieces of money the piece of land on which he had pitched his tent."
Genesis,33,20,There he erected an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.
Genesis,34,1,"Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the women of the land."
Genesis,34,2,"And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he seized her and lay with her and humiliated her."
Genesis,34,3,And his soul was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob. He loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.
Genesis,34,4,"So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, ""Get me this girl for my wife."""
Genesis,34,5,"Now Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah. But his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob held his peace until they came."
Genesis,34,6,And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.
Genesis,34,7,"The sons of Jacob had come in from the field as soon as they heard of it, and the men were indignant and very angry, because he had done an outrageous thing in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, for such a thing must not be done."
Genesis,34,8,"But Hamor spoke with them, saying, ""The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him to be his wife."
Genesis,34,9,"Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves."
Genesis,34,10,"You shall dwell with us, and the land shall be open to you. Dwell and trade in it, and get property in it."""
Genesis,34,11,"Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, ""Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give."
Genesis,34,12,"Ask me for as great a bride price and gift as you will, and I will give whatever you say to me. Only give me the young woman to be my wife."""
Genesis,34,13,"The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah."
Genesis,34,14,"They said to them, ""We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us."
Genesis,34,15,Only on this condition will we agree with you--that you will become as we are by every male among you being circumcised.
Genesis,34,16,"Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to ourselves, and we will dwell with you and become one people."
Genesis,34,17,"But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter, and we will be gone."""
Genesis,34,18,Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor's son Shechem.
Genesis,34,19,"And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob's daughter. Now he was the most honored of all his father's house."
Genesis,34,20,"So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,"
Genesis,34,21,"""These men are at peace with us; let them dwell in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters as wives, and let us give them our daughters."
Genesis,34,22,Only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us to become one people--when every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised.
Genesis,34,23,"Will not their livestock, their property and all their beasts be ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will dwell with us."""
Genesis,34,24,"And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city."
Genesis,34,25,"On the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came against the city while it felt secure and killed all the males."
Genesis,34,26,They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword and took Dinah out of Shechem's house and went away.
Genesis,34,27,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister."
Genesis,34,28,"They took their flocks and their herds, their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field."
Genesis,34,29,"All their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and plundered."
Genesis,34,30,"Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, ""You have brought trouble on me by making me stink to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites. My numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household."""
Genesis,34,31,"But they said, ""Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?"""
Genesis,35,1,"God said to Jacob, ""Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau."""
Genesis,35,2,"So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, ""Put away the foreign gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments."
Genesis,35,3,"Then let us arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone."""
Genesis,35,4,"So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree that was near Shechem."
Genesis,35,5,"And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob."
Genesis,35,6,"And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him,"
Genesis,35,7,"and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother."
Genesis,35,8,"And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So he called its name Allon-bacuth."
Genesis,35,9,"God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him."
Genesis,35,10,"And God said to him, ""Your name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name."" So he called his name Israel."
Genesis,35,11,"And God said to him, ""I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from your own body."
Genesis,35,12,"The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you."""
Genesis,35,13,Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him.
Genesis,35,14,"And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it."
Genesis,35,15,So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.
Genesis,35,16,"Then they journeyed from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor, and she had hard labor."
Genesis,35,17,"And when her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, ""Do not fear, for you have another son."""
Genesis,35,18,"And as her soul was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin."
Genesis,35,19,"So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),"
Genesis,35,20,"and Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb. It is the pillar of Rachel's tomb, which is there to this day."
Genesis,35,21,Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
Genesis,35,22,"While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine. And Israel heard of it.Now the sons of Jacob were twelve."
Genesis,35,23,"The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun."
Genesis,35,24,The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis,35,25,"The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali."
Genesis,35,26,"The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram."
Genesis,35,27,"And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned."
Genesis,35,28,Now the days of Isaac were 180 years.
Genesis,35,29,"And Isaac breathed his last, and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
Genesis,36,1,"These are the generations of Esau (that is, Edom)."
Genesis,36,2,"Esau took his wives from the Canaanites: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, Oholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,"
Genesis,36,3,"and Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, the sister of Nebaioth."
Genesis,36,4,"And Adah bore to Esau, Eliphaz; Basemath bore Reuel;"
Genesis,36,5,"and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,36,6,"Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, his livestock, all his beasts, and all his property that he had acquired in the land of Canaan. He went into a land away from his brother Jacob."
Genesis,36,7,For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together. The land of their sojournings could not support them because of their livestock.
Genesis,36,8,So Esau settled in the hill country of Seir. (Esau is Edom.)
Genesis,36,9,These are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir.
Genesis,36,10,"These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau."
Genesis,36,11,"The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz."
Genesis,36,12,"(Timna was a concubine of Eliphaz, Esau's son; she bore Amalek to Eliphaz.) These are the sons of Adah, Esau's wife."
Genesis,36,13,"These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife."
Genesis,36,14,"These are the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: she bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah."
Genesis,36,15,"These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: the chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,"
Genesis,36,16,"Korah, Gatam, and Amalek; these are the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah."
Genesis,36,17,"These are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: the chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah; these are the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife."
Genesis,36,18,"These are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau's wife: the chiefs Jeush, Jalam, and Korah; these are the chiefs born of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife."

Genesis,36,43,"Magdiel, and Iram; these are the chiefs of Edom (that is, Esau, the father of Edom), according to their dwelling places in the land of their possession."
Genesis,37,1,"Jacob lived in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,37,2,"These are the generations of Jacob.Joseph, being seventeen years old, was pasturing the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father."
Genesis,37,3,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of many colors."
Genesis,37,4,"But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him."
Genesis,37,5,"Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more."
Genesis,37,6,"He said to them, ""Hear this dream that I have dreamed:"
Genesis,37,7,"Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf."""
Genesis,37,8,"His brothers said to him, ""Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to rule over us?"" So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words."
Genesis,37,9,"Then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, ""Behold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me."""
Genesis,37,10,"But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him and said to him, ""What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?"""
Genesis,37,11,"And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind."
Genesis,37,12,Now his brothers went to pasture their father's flock near Shechem.
Genesis,37,13,"And Israel said to Joseph, ""Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them."" And he said to him, ""Here I am."""
Genesis,37,14,"So he said to him, ""Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me word."" So he sent him from the Valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem."
Genesis,37,15,"And a man found him wandering in the fields. And the man asked him, ""What are you seeking?"""
Genesis,37,16,"""I am seeking my brothers,"" he said. ""Tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock."""
Genesis,37,17,"And the man said, ""They have gone away, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'"" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan."
Genesis,37,18,"They saw him from afar, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him."
Genesis,37,19,"They said to one another, ""Here comes this dreamer."
Genesis,37,20,"Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits. Then we will say that a fierce animal has devoured him, and we will see what will become of his dreams."""
Genesis,37,21,"But when Reuben heard it, he rescued him out of their hands, saying, ""Let us not take his life."""
Genesis,37,22,"And Reuben said to them, ""Shed no blood; cast him into this pit here in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him""--that he might rescue him out of their hand to restore him to his father."
Genesis,37,23,"So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the robe of many colors that he wore."
Genesis,37,24,And they took him and cast him into a pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.
Genesis,37,25,"Then they sat down to eat. And looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt."
Genesis,37,26,"Then Judah said to his brothers, ""What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?"
Genesis,37,27,"Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh."" And his brothers listened to him."
Genesis,37,28,"Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt."
Genesis,37,29,"When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes"
Genesis,37,30,"and returned to his brothers and said, ""The boy is gone, and I, where shall I go?"""
Genesis,37,31,Then they took Joseph's robe and slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.
Genesis,37,32,"And they sent the robe of many colors and brought it to their father and said, ""This we have found; please identify whether it is your son's robe or not."""
Genesis,37,33,"And he identified it and said, ""It is my son's robe. A fierce animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces."""
Genesis,37,34,Then Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days.
Genesis,37,35,"All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, ""No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning."" Thus his father wept for him."
Genesis,37,36,"Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard."
Genesis,38,1,"It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers and turned aside to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah."
Genesis,38,2,"There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. He took her and went in to her,"
Genesis,38,3,"and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er."
Genesis,38,4,"She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan."
Genesis,38,5,"Yet again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. Judah was in Chezib when she bore him."
Genesis,38,6,"And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar."
Genesis,38,7,"But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death."
Genesis,38,8,"Then Judah said to Onan, ""Go in to your brother's wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother."""
Genesis,38,9,"But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his. So whenever he went in to his brother's wife he would waste the semen on the ground, so as not to give offspring to his brother."
Genesis,38,10,"And what he did was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and he put him to death also."
Genesis,38,11,"Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, ""Remain a widow in your father's house, till Shelah my son grows up""--for he feared that he would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and remained in her father's house."
Genesis,38,12,"In course of time the wife of Judah, Shua's daughter, died. When Judah was comforted, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite."
Genesis,38,13,"And when Tamar was told, ""Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,"""
Genesis,38,14,"she took off her widow's garments and covered herself with a veil, wrapping herself up, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she had not been given to him in marriage."
Genesis,38,15,"When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face."
Genesis,38,16,"He turned to her at the roadside and said, ""Come, let me come in to you,"" for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, ""What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"""
Genesis,38,17,"He answered, ""I will send you a young goat from the flock."" And she said, ""If you give me a pledge, until you send it--"""
Genesis,38,18,"He said, ""What pledge shall I give you?"" She replied, ""Your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand."" So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him."
Genesis,38,19,"Then she arose and went away, and taking off her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood."
Genesis,38,20,"When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite to take back the pledge from the woman's hand, he did not find her."
Genesis,38,21,"And he asked the men of the place, ""Where is the cult prostitute who was at Enaim at the roadside?"" And they said, ""No cult prostitute has been here."""
Genesis,38,22,"So he returned to Judah and said, ""I have not found her. Also, the men of the place said, 'No cult prostitute has been here.'"""
Genesis,38,23,"And Judah replied, ""Let her keep the things as her own, or we shall be laughed at. You see, I sent this young goat, and you did not find her."""
Genesis,38,24,"About three months later Judah was told, ""Tamar your daughter-in-law has been immoral. Moreover, she is pregnant by immorality."" And Judah said, ""Bring her out, and let her be burned."""
Genesis,38,25,"As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, ""By the man to whom these belong, I am pregnant."" And she said, ""Please identify whose these are, the signet and the cord and the staff."""
Genesis,38,26,"Then Judah identified them and said, ""She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah."" And he did not know her again."
Genesis,38,27,"When the time of her labor came, there were twins in her womb."
Genesis,38,28,"And when she was in labor, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, ""This one came out first."""
Genesis,38,29,"But as he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out. And she said, ""What a breach you have made for yourself!"" Therefore his name was called Perez."
Genesis,38,30,"Afterward his brother came out with the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah."
Genesis,39,1,"Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, had bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there."
Genesis,39,2,"The LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, and he was in the house of his Egyptian master."
Genesis,39,3,His master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD caused all that he did to succeed in his hands.
Genesis,39,4,"So Joseph found favor in his sight and attended him, and he made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all that he had."
Genesis,39,5,"From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had, in house and field."
Genesis,39,6,"So he left all that he had in Joseph's charge, and because of him he had no concern about anything but the food he ate.Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance."
Genesis,39,7,"And after a time his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, ""Lie with me."""
Genesis,39,8,"But he refused and said to his master's wife, ""Behold, because of me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and he has put everything that he has in my charge."
Genesis,39,9,"He is not greater in this house than I am, nor has he kept back anything from me except yourself, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?"""
Genesis,39,10,"And as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her."
Genesis,39,11,"But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house,"
Genesis,39,12,"she caught him by his garment, saying, ""Lie with me."" But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house."
Genesis,39,13,"And as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of the house,"
Genesis,39,14,"she called to the men of her household and said to them, ""See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice."
Genesis,39,15,"And as soon as he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried out, he left his garment beside me and fled and got out of the house."""
Genesis,39,16,"Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home,"
Genesis,39,17,"and she told him the same story, saying, ""The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to laugh at me."
Genesis,39,18,"But as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment beside me and fled out of the house."""
Genesis,39,19,"As soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, ""This is the way your servant treated me,"" his anger was kindled."
Genesis,39,20,"And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison."
Genesis,39,21,But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
Genesis,39,22,"And the keeper of the prison put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever was done there, he was the one who did it."
Genesis,39,23,"The keeper of the prison paid no attention to anything that was in Joseph's charge, because the LORD was with him. And whatever he did, the LORD made it succeed."
Genesis,40,1,"Some time after this, the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker committed an offense against their lord the king of Egypt."
Genesis,40,2,"And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,"
Genesis,40,3,"and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined."
Genesis,40,4,"The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be with them, and he attended them. They continued for some time in custody."
Genesis,40,5,"And one night they both dreamed--the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison--each his own dream, and each dream with its own interpretation."
Genesis,40,6,"When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled."
Genesis,40,7,"So he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his master's house, ""Why are your faces downcast today?"""
Genesis,40,8,"They said to him, ""We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them."" And Joseph said to them, ""Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me."""
Genesis,40,9,"So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, ""In my dream there was a vine before me,"
Genesis,40,10,"and on the vine there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes."
Genesis,40,11,"Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand."""
Genesis,40,12,"Then Joseph said to him, ""This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days."
Genesis,40,13,"In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his cupbearer."
Genesis,40,14,"Only remember me, when it is well with you, and please do me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house."
Genesis,40,15,"For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit."""
Genesis,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, ""I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head,"
Genesis,40,17,"and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head."""
Genesis,40,18,"And Joseph answered and said, ""This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days."
Genesis,40,19,"In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head--from you!--and hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat the flesh from you."""
Genesis,40,20,"On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for all his servants and lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants."
Genesis,40,21,"He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand."
Genesis,40,22,"But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them."
Genesis,40,23,"Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him."
Genesis,41,1,"After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile,"
Genesis,41,2,"and behold, there came up out of the Nile seven cows attractive and plump, and they fed in the reed grass."
Genesis,41,3,"And behold, seven other cows, ugly and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile."
Genesis,41,4,"And the ugly, thin cows ate up the seven attractive, plump cows. And Pharaoh awoke."
Genesis,41,5,"And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time. And behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk."
Genesis,41,6,"And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind."
Genesis,41,7,"And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream."
Genesis,41,8,"So in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was none who could interpret them to Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,9,"Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, ""I remember my offenses today."
Genesis,41,10,"When Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard,"
Genesis,41,11,"we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own interpretation."
Genesis,41,12,"A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream."
Genesis,41,13,"And as he interpreted to us, so it came about. I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged."""
Genesis,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the pit. And when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,15,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, ""I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."""
Genesis,41,16,"Joseph answered Pharaoh, ""It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer."""
Genesis,41,17,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, ""Behold, in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile."
Genesis,41,18,"Seven cows, plump and attractive, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass."
Genesis,41,19,"Seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,20,"And the thin, ugly cows ate up the first seven plump cows,"
Genesis,41,21,"but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as ugly as at the beginning. Then I awoke."
Genesis,41,22,"I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good."
Genesis,41,23,"Seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them,"
Genesis,41,24,"and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me."""
Genesis,41,25,"Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, ""The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do."
Genesis,41,26,"The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one."
Genesis,41,27,"The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine."
Genesis,41,28,It is as I told Pharaoh; God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
Genesis,41,29,"There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt,"
Genesis,41,30,"but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land,"
Genesis,41,31,"and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of the famine that will follow, for it will be very severe."
Genesis,41,32,"And the doubling of Pharaoh's dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it about."
Genesis,41,33,"Now therefore let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,34,Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land and take one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plentiful years.
Genesis,41,35,"And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it."
Genesis,41,36,"That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine."""
Genesis,41,37,This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants.
Genesis,41,38,"And Pharaoh said to his servants, ""Can we find a man like this, in whom is the Spirit of God?"""
Genesis,41,39,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, ""Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are."
Genesis,41,40,"You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command. Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you."""
Genesis,41,41,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, ""See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt."""
Genesis,41,42,"Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck."
Genesis,41,43,"And he made him ride in his second chariot. And they called out before him, ""Bow the knee!"" Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,44,"Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, ""I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."""
Genesis,41,45,"And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah. And he gave him in marriage Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,46,Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt.
Genesis,41,47,"During the seven plentiful years the earth produced abundantly,"
Genesis,41,48,"and he gathered up all the food of these seven years, which occurred in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities. He put in every city the food from the fields around it."
Genesis,41,49,"And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured."
Genesis,41,50,"Before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph. Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore them to him."
Genesis,41,51,"Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. ""For,"" he said, ""God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father's house."""
Genesis,41,52,"The name of the second he called Ephraim, ""For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."""
Genesis,41,53,"The seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt came to an end,"
Genesis,41,54,"and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
Genesis,41,55,"When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, ""Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do."""
Genesis,41,56,"So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,57,"Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth."
Genesis,42,1,"When Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said to his sons, ""Why do you look at one another?"""
Genesis,42,2,"And he said, ""Behold, I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt. Go down and buy grain for us there, that we may live and not die."""
Genesis,42,3,So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.
Genesis,42,4,"But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm might happen to him."
Genesis,42,5,"Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,42,6,Now Joseph was governor over the land. He was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground.
Genesis,42,7,"Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them. ""Where do you come from?"" he said. They said, ""From the land of Canaan, to buy food."""
Genesis,42,8,"And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him."
Genesis,42,9,"And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them. And he said to them, ""You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land."""
Genesis,42,10,"They said to him, ""No, my lord, your servants have come to buy food."
Genesis,42,11,"We are all sons of one man. We are honest men. Your servants have never been spies."""
Genesis,42,12,"He said to them, ""No, it is the nakedness of the land that you have come to see."""
Genesis,42,13,"And they said, ""We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more."""
Genesis,42,14,"But Joseph said to them, ""It is as I said to you. You are spies."
Genesis,42,15,"By this you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here."
Genesis,42,16,"Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. Or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies."""
Genesis,42,17,And he put them all together in custody for three days.
Genesis,42,18,"On the third day Joseph said to them, ""Do this and you will live, for I fear God:"
Genesis,42,19,"if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined where you are in custody, and let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households,"
Genesis,42,20,"and bring your youngest brother to me. So your words will be verified, and you shall not die."" And they did so."
Genesis,42,21,"Then they said to one another, ""In truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us and we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us."""
Genesis,42,22,"And Reuben answered them, ""Did I not tell you not to sin against the boy? But you did not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood."""
Genesis,42,23,"They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them."
Genesis,42,24,Then he turned away from them and wept. And he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.
Genesis,42,25,"And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, and to replace every man's money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. This was done for them."
Genesis,42,26,Then they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed.
Genesis,42,27,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack."
Genesis,42,28,"He said to his brothers, ""My money has been put back; here it is in the mouth of my sack!"" At this their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, ""What is this that God has done to us?"""
Genesis,42,29,"When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying,"
Genesis,42,30,"""The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us and took us to be spies of the land."
Genesis,42,31,"But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we have never been spies."
Genesis,42,32,"We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.'"
Genesis,42,33,"Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way."
Genesis,42,34,"Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men, and I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.'"""
Genesis,42,35,"As they emptied their sacks, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid."
Genesis,42,36,"And Jacob their father said to them, ""You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin. All this has come against me."""
Genesis,42,37,"Then Reuben said to his father, ""Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you."""
Genesis,42,38,"But he said, ""My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is the only one left. If harm should happen to him on the journey that you are to make, you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol."""
Genesis,43,1,Now the famine was severe in the land.
Genesis,43,2,"And when they had eaten the grain that they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, ""Go again, buy us a little food."""
Genesis,43,3,"But Judah said to him, ""The man solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.'"
Genesis,43,4,"If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food."
Genesis,43,5,"But if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.'"""
Genesis,43,6,"Israel said, ""Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?"""
Genesis,43,7,"They replied, ""The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?' What we told him was in answer to these questions. Could we in any way know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down'?"""
Genesis,43,8,"And Judah said to Israel his father, ""Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones."
Genesis,43,9,"I will be a pledge of his safety. From my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever."
Genesis,43,10,"If we had not delayed, we would now have returned twice."""
Genesis,43,11,"Then their father Israel said to them, ""If it must be so, then do this: take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry a present down to the man, a little balm and a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds."
Genesis,43,12,Take double the money with you. Carry back with you the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.
Genesis,43,13,"Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man."
Genesis,43,14,"May God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, and may he send back your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."""
Genesis,43,15,"So the men took this present, and they took double the money with them, and Benjamin. They arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph."
Genesis,43,16,"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, ""Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon."""
Genesis,43,17,The man did as Joseph told him and brought the men to Joseph's house.
Genesis,43,18,"And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house, and they said, ""It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may assault us and fall upon us to make us servants and seize our donkeys."""
Genesis,43,19,"So they went up to the steward of Joseph's house and spoke with him at the door of the house,"
Genesis,43,20,"and said, ""Oh, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food."
Genesis,43,21,"And when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and there was each man's money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. So we have brought it again with us,"
Genesis,43,22,"and we have brought other money down with us to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks."""
Genesis,43,23,"He replied, ""Peace to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has put treasure in your sacks for you. I received your money."" Then he brought Simeon out to them."
Genesis,43,24,"And when the man had brought the men into Joseph's house and given them water, and they had washed their feet, and when he had given their donkeys fodder,"
Genesis,43,25,"they prepared the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there."
Genesis,43,26,"When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present that they had with them and bowed down to him to the ground."
Genesis,43,27,"And he inquired about their welfare and said, ""Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?"""
Genesis,43,28,"They said, ""Your servant our father is well; he is still alive."" And they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves."
Genesis,43,29,"And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, ""Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!"""
Genesis,43,30,"Then Joseph hurried out, for his compassion grew warm for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there."
Genesis,43,31,"Then he washed his face and came out. And controlling himself he said, ""Serve the food."""
Genesis,43,32,"They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians."
Genesis,43,33,"And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth. And the men looked at one another in amazement."
Genesis,43,34,"Portions were taken to them from Joseph's table, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry with him."
Genesis,44,1,"Then he commanded the steward of his house, ""Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in the mouth of his sack,"
Genesis,44,2,"and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain."" And he did as Joseph told him."
Genesis,44,3,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their donkeys."
Genesis,44,4,"They had gone only a short distance from the city. Now Joseph said to his steward, ""Up, follow after the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid evil for good?"
Genesis,44,5,"Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he practices divination? You have done evil in doing this.'"""
Genesis,44,6,"When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words."
Genesis,44,7,"They said to him, ""Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!"
Genesis,44,8,"Behold, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord's house?"
Genesis,44,9,"Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die, and we also will be my lord's servants."""
Genesis,44,10,"He said, ""Let it be as you say: he who is found with it shall be my servant, and the rest of you shall be innocent."""
Genesis,44,11,"Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack."
Genesis,44,12,"And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack."
Genesis,44,13,"Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city."
Genesis,44,14,"When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there. They fell before him to the ground."
Genesis,44,15,"Joseph said to them, ""What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can indeed practice divination?"""
Genesis,44,16,"And Judah said, ""What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord's servants, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found."""
Genesis,44,17,"But he said, ""Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my servant. But as for you, go up in peace to your father."""
Genesis,44,18,"Then Judah went up to him and said, ""O my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself."
Genesis,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father, or a brother?'"
Genesis,44,20,"And we said to my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age. His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother's children, and his father loves him.'"
Genesis,44,21,"Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.'"
Genesis,44,22,"We said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.'"
Genesis,44,23,"Then you said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall not see my face again.'"
Genesis,44,24,"""When we went back to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord."
Genesis,44,25,"And when our father said, 'Go again, buy us a little food,'"
Genesis,44,26,"we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother goes with us, then we will go down. For we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'"
Genesis,44,27,"Then your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons."
Genesis,44,28,"One left me, and I said, Surely he has been torn to pieces, and I have never seen him since."
Genesis,44,29,"If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs in evil to Sheol.'"
Genesis,44,30,"""Now therefore, as soon as I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the boy's life,"
Genesis,44,31,"as soon as he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol."
Genesis,44,32,"For your servant became a pledge of safety for the boy to my father, saying, 'If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father all my life.'"
Genesis,44,33,"Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a servant to my lord, and let the boy go back with his brothers."
Genesis,44,34,"For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would find my father."""
Genesis,45,1,"Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him. He cried, ""Make everyone go out from me."" So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers."
Genesis,45,2,"And he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it."
Genesis,45,3,"And Joseph said to his brothers, ""I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?"" But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence."
Genesis,45,4,"So Joseph said to his brothers, ""Come near to me, please."" And they came near. And he said, ""I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt."
Genesis,45,5,"And now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life."
Genesis,45,6,"For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest."
Genesis,45,7,"And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors."
Genesis,45,8,"So it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,45,9,"Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; do not tarry."
Genesis,45,10,"You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children's children, and your flocks, your herds, and all that you have."
Genesis,45,11,"There I will provide for you, for there are yet five years of famine to come, so that you and your household, and all that you have, do not come to poverty.'"
Genesis,45,12,"And now your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth that speaks to you."
Genesis,45,13,"You must tell my father of all my honor in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. Hurry and bring my father down here."""
Genesis,45,14,"Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck."
Genesis,45,15,And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. After that his brothers talked with him.
Genesis,45,16,"When the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, ""Joseph's brothers have come,"" it pleased Pharaoh and his servants."
Genesis,45,17,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, ""Say to your brothers, 'Do this: load your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan,"
Genesis,45,18,"and take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.'"
Genesis,45,19,"And you, Joseph, are commanded to say, 'Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father, and come."
Genesis,45,20,"Have no concern for your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.'"""
Genesis,45,21,"The sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey."
Genesis,45,22,"To each and all of them he gave a change of clothes, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five changes of clothes."
Genesis,45,23,"To his father he sent as follows: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and provision for his father on the journey."
Genesis,45,24,"Then he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, ""Do not quarrel on the way."""
Genesis,45,25,So they went up out of Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob.
Genesis,45,26,"And they told him, ""Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt."" And his heart became numb, for he did not believe them."
Genesis,45,27,"But when they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived."
Genesis,45,28,"And Israel said, ""It is enough; Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."""
Genesis,46,1,"So Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac."
Genesis,46,2,"And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, ""Jacob, Jacob."" And he said, ""Here am I."""
Genesis,46,3,"Then he said, ""I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you into a great nation."
Genesis,46,4,"I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up again, and Joseph's hand shall close your eyes."""
Genesis,46,5,"Then Jacob set out from Beersheba. The sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him."
Genesis,46,6,"They also took their livestock and their goods, which they had gained in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him,"
Genesis,46,7,"his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters. All his offspring he brought with him into Egypt."
Genesis,46,8,"Now these are the names of the descendants of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons. Reuben, Jacob's firstborn,"
Genesis,46,9,"and the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi."
Genesis,46,10,"The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman."
Genesis,46,11,"The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
Genesis,46,12,"The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan); and the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul."
Genesis,46,13,"The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Yob, and Shimron."
Genesis,46,14,"The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel."
Genesis,46,15,"These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, together with his daughter Dinah; altogether his sons and his daughters numbered thirty-three."
Genesis,46,16,"The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli."
Genesis,46,17,"The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, with Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel."
Genesis,46,18,"These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bore to Jacob--sixteen persons."
Genesis,46,19,"The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin."
Genesis,46,20,"And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On, bore to him."
Genesis,46,21,"And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard."
Genesis,46,22,"These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob--fourteen persons in all."
Genesis,46,23,The sons of Dan: Hushim.
Genesis,46,24,"The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem."
Genesis,46,25,"These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob--seven persons in all."
Genesis,46,26,"All the persons belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who were his own descendants, not including Jacob's sons' wives, were sixty-six persons in all."
Genesis,46,27,"And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two. All the persons of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were seventy."
Genesis,46,28,"He had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to show the way before him in Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen."
Genesis,46,29,Then Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen. He presented himself to him and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while.
Genesis,46,30,"Israel said to Joseph, ""Now let me die, since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive."""
Genesis,46,31,"Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, ""I will go up and tell Pharaoh and will say to him, 'My brothers and my father's household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me."
Genesis,46,32,"And the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.'"
Genesis,46,33,"When Pharaoh calls you and says, 'What is your occupation?'"
Genesis,46,34,"you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,' in order that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians."""
Genesis,47,1,"So Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, ""My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan. They are now in the land of Goshen."""
Genesis,47,2,And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them to Pharaoh.
Genesis,47,3,"Pharaoh said to his brothers, ""What is your occupation?"" And they said to Pharaoh, ""Your servants are shepherds, as our fathers were."""
Genesis,47,4,"They said to Pharaoh, ""We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. And now, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen."""
Genesis,47,5,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, ""Your father and your brothers have come to you."
Genesis,47,6,"The land of Egypt is before you. Settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land. Let them settle in the land of Goshen, and if you know any able men among them, put them in charge of my livestock."""
Genesis,47,7,"Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father and stood him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh."
Genesis,47,8,"And Pharaoh said to Jacob, ""How many are the days of the years of your life?"""
Genesis,47,9,"And Jacob said to Pharaoh, ""The days of the years of my sojourning are 130 years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojourning."""
Genesis,47,10,And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
Genesis,47,11,"Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
Genesis,47,12,"And Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father's household with food, according to the number of their dependents."
Genesis,47,13,"Now there was no food in all the land, for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished by reason of the famine."
Genesis,47,14,"And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, in exchange for the grain that they bought. And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house."
Genesis,47,15,"And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, ""Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? For our money is gone."""
Genesis,47,16,"And Joseph answered, ""Give your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, if your money is gone."""
Genesis,47,17,"So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the herds, and the donkeys. He supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year."
Genesis,47,18,"And when that year was ended, they came to him the following year and said to him, ""We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent. The herds of livestock are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our land."
Genesis,47,19,"Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we with our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate."""
Genesis,47,20,"So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for all the Egyptians sold their fields, because the famine was severe on them. The land became Pharaoh's."
Genesis,47,21,"As for the people, he made servants of them from one end of Egypt to the other."
Genesis,47,22,"Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh and lived on the allowance that Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land."
Genesis,47,23,"Then Joseph said to the people, ""Behold, I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Now here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land."
Genesis,47,24,"And at the harvests you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and as food for yourselves and your households, and as food for your little ones."""
Genesis,47,25,"And they said, ""You have saved our lives; may it please my lord, we will be servants to Pharaoh."""
Genesis,47,26,"So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt, and it stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's."
Genesis,47,27,"Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied greatly."
Genesis,47,28,"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were 147 years."
Genesis,47,29,"And when the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, ""If now I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh and promise to deal kindly and truly with me. Do not bury me in Egypt,"
Genesis,47,30,"but let me lie with my fathers. Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place."" He answered, ""I will do as you have said."""
Genesis,47,31,"And he said, ""Swear to me""; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself upon the head of his bed."
Genesis,48,1,"After this, Joseph was told, ""Behold, your father is ill."" So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
Genesis,48,2,"And it was told to Jacob, ""Your son Joseph has come to you."" Then Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed."
Genesis,48,3,"And Jacob said to Joseph, ""God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,"
Genesis,48,4,"and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.'"
Genesis,48,5,"And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are."
Genesis,48,6,And the children that you fathered after them shall be yours. They shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.
Genesis,48,7,"As for me, when I came from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)."""
Genesis,48,8,"When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, ""Who are these?"""
Genesis,48,9,"Joseph said to his father, ""They are my sons, whom God has given me here."" And he said, ""Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them."""
Genesis,48,10,"Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them."
Genesis,48,11,"And Israel said to Joseph, ""I never expected to see your face; and behold, God has let me see your offspring also."""
Genesis,48,12,"Then Joseph removed them from his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth."
Genesis,48,13,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near him."
Genesis,48,14,"And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands (for Manasseh was the firstborn)."
Genesis,48,15,"And he blessed Joseph and said, ""The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day,"
Genesis,48,16,"the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys; and in them let my name be carried on, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."""
Genesis,48,17,"When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he took his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head."
Genesis,48,18,"And Joseph said to his father, ""Not this way, my father; since this one is the firstborn, put your right hand on his head."""
Genesis,48,19,"But his father refused and said, ""I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great. Nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations."""
Genesis,48,20,"So he blessed them that day, saying, ""By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, 'God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh.'""Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh."
Genesis,48,21,"Then Israel said to Joseph, ""Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your fathers."
Genesis,48,22,"Moreover, I have given to you rather than to your brothers one mountain slope that I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow."""
Genesis,49,1,"Then Jacob called his sons and said, ""Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall happen to you in days to come."
Genesis,49,2,"""Assemble and listen, O sons of Jacob, listen to Israel your father."
Genesis,49,3,"""Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the firstfruits of my strength, preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power."

Genesis,49,5,"""Simeon and Levi are brothers; weapons of violence are their swords."
Genesis,49,6,"Let my soul come not into their council; O my glory, be not joined to their company. For in their anger they killed men, and in their willfulness they hamstrung oxen."
Genesis,49,7,"Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, and their wrath, for it is cruel! I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel."
Genesis,49,8,"""Judah, your brothers shall praise you; your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; your father's sons shall bow down before you."
Genesis,49,9,"Judah is a lion's cub; from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He stooped down; he crouched as a lion and as a lioness; who dares rouse him?"
Genesis,49,10,"The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until tribute comes to him; and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples."
Genesis,49,11,"Binding his foal to the vine and his donkey's colt to the choice vine, he has washed his garments in wine and his vesture in the blood of grapes."

Genesis,49,17,"Dan shall be a serpent in the way, a viper by the path, that bites the horse's heels so that his rider falls backward."

Genesis,49,21,"""Naphtali is a doe let loose that bears beautiful fawns."
Genesis,49,22,"""Joseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a spring; his branches run over the wall."
Genesis,49,23,"The archers bitterly attacked him, shot at him, and harassed him severely,"
Genesis,49,24,"yet his bow remained unmoved; his arms were made agile by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (from there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel),"
Genesis,49,25,"by the God of your father who will help you, by the Almighty who will bless you with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that crouches beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb."
Genesis,49,26,"The blessings of your father are mighty beyond the blessings of my parents, up to the bounties of the everlasting hills. May they be on the head of Joseph, and on the brow of him who was set apart from his brothers."
Genesis,49,27,"""Benjamin is a ravenous wolf, in the morning devouring the prey and at evening dividing the spoil."""
Genesis,49,28,"All these are the twelve tribes of Israel. This is what their father said to them as he blessed them, blessing each with the blessing suitable to him."
Genesis,49,29,"Then he commanded them and said to them, ""I am to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,"
Genesis,49,30,"in the cave that is in the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place."
Genesis,49,31,"There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah--"
Genesis,49,32,"the field and the cave that is in it were bought from the Hittites."""
Genesis,49,33,"When Jacob finished commanding his sons, he drew up his feet into the bed and breathed his last and was gathered to his people."
Genesis,50,1,Then Joseph fell on his father's face and wept over him and kissed him.
Genesis,50,2,And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.
Genesis,50,3,"Forty days were required for it, for that is how many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days."
Genesis,50,4,"And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, ""If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,"
Genesis,50,5,"My father made me swear, saying, 'I am about to die: in my tomb that I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.' Now therefore, let me please go up and bury my father. Then I will return."""
Genesis,50,6,"And Pharaoh answered, ""Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear."""
Genesis,50,7,"So Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,"
Genesis,50,8,"as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's household. Only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen."
Genesis,50,9,And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company.
Genesis,50,10,"When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and grievous lamentation, and he made a mourning for his father seven days."
Genesis,50,11,"When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, ""This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians."" Therefore the place was named Abel-mizraim; it is beyond the Jordan."
Genesis,50,12,"Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them,"
Genesis,50,13,"for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place."
Genesis,50,14,"After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father."
Genesis,50,15,"When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, ""It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil that we did to him."""
Genesis,50,16,"So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, ""Your father gave this command before he died,"
Genesis,50,17,"'Say to Joseph, Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.' And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father."" Joseph wept when they spoke to him."
Genesis,50,18,"His brothers also came and fell down before him and said, ""Behold, we are your servants."""
Genesis,50,19,"But Joseph said to them, ""Do not fear, for am I in the place of God?"
Genesis,50,20,"As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today."
Genesis,50,21,"So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones."" Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them."
Genesis,50,22,"So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father's house. Joseph lived 110 years."
Genesis,50,23,And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation. The children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were counted as Joseph's own.
Genesis,50,24,"And Joseph said to his brothers, ""I am about to die, but God will visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."""
Genesis,50,25,"Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, ""God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here."""
Genesis,50,26,"So Joseph died, being 110 years old. They embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."
Exodus,1,1,"These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob, each with his household:"
Exodus,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,"
Exodus,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,"
Exodus,1,4,"Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher."
Exodus,1,5,All the descendants of Jacob were seventy persons; Joseph was already in Egypt.
Exodus,1,6,"Then Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation."
Exodus,1,7,"But the people of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them."
Exodus,1,8,"Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph."
Exodus,1,9,"And he said to his people, ""Behold, the people of Israel are too many and too mighty for us."
Exodus,1,10,"Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and, if war breaks out, they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land."""
Exodus,1,11,"Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with heavy burdens. They built for Pharaoh store cities, Pithom and Raamses."
Exodus,1,12,"But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And the Egyptians were in dread of the people of Israel."
Exodus,1,13,So they ruthlessly made the people of Israel work as slaves
Exodus,1,14,"and made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and brick, and in all kinds of work in the field. In all their work they ruthlessly made them work as slaves."
Exodus,1,15,"Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,"
Exodus,1,16,"""When you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him, but if it is a daughter, she shall live."""
Exodus,1,17,"But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the male children live."
Exodus,1,18,"So the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them, ""Why have you done this, and let the male children live?"""
Exodus,1,19,"The midwives said to Pharaoh, ""Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them."""
Exodus,1,20,So God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied and grew very strong.
Exodus,1,21,"And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families."
Exodus,1,22,"Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, ""Every son that is born to the Hebrews you shall cast into the Nile, but you shall let every daughter live."""
Exodus,2,1,Now a man from the house of Levi went and took as his wife a Levite woman.
Exodus,2,2,"The woman conceived and bore a son, and when she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months."
Exodus,2,3,"When she could hide him no longer, she took for him a basket made of bulrushes and daubed it with bitumen and pitch. She put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the river bank."
Exodus,2,4,And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him.
Exodus,2,5,"Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her young women walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman, and she took it."
Exodus,2,6,"When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. She took pity on him and said, ""This is one of the Hebrews' children."""
Exodus,2,7,"Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, ""Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?"""
Exodus,2,8,"And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, ""Go."" So the girl went and called the child's mother."
Exodus,2,9,"And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, ""Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages."" So the woman took the child and nursed him."
Exodus,2,10,"When the child grew up, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, ""Because,"" she said, ""I drew him out of the water."""
Exodus,2,11,"One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people."
Exodus,2,12,"He looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together. And he said to the man in the wrong, ""Why do you strike your companion?"""
Exodus,2,14,"He answered, ""Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?"" Then Moses was afraid, and thought, ""Surely the thing is known."""
Exodus,2,15,"When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian. And he sat down by a well."
Exodus,2,16,"Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock."
Exodus,2,17,"The shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and saved them, and watered their flock."
Exodus,2,18,"When they came home to their father Reuel, he said, ""How is it that you have come home so soon today?"""
Exodus,2,19,"They said, ""An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and even drew water for us and watered the flock."""
Exodus,2,20,"He said to his daughters, ""Then where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread."""
Exodus,2,21,"And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah."
Exodus,2,22,"She gave birth to a son, and he called his name Gershom, for he said, ""I have been a sojourner in a foreign land."""
Exodus,2,23,"During those many days the king of Egypt died, and the people of Israel groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help. Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God."
Exodus,2,24,"And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob."
Exodus,2,25,God saw the people of Israel--and God knew.
Exodus,3,1,"Now Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian, and he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God."
Exodus,3,2,"And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed."
Exodus,3,3,"And Moses said, ""I will turn aside to see this great sight, why the bush is not burned."""
Exodus,3,4,"When the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, ""Moses, Moses!"" And he said, ""Here I am."""
Exodus,3,5,"Then he said, ""Do not come near; take your sandals off your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground."""
Exodus,3,6,"And he said, ""I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."" And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God."
Exodus,3,7,"Then the LORD said, ""I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I know their sufferings,"
Exodus,3,8,"and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites."
Exodus,3,9,"And now, behold, the cry of the people of Israel has come to me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them."
Exodus,3,10,"Come, I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt."""
Exodus,3,11,"But Moses said to God, ""Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?"""
Exodus,3,12,"He said, ""But I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."""
Exodus,3,13,"Then Moses said to God, ""If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' what shall I say to them?"""
Exodus,3,14,"God said to Moses, ""I AM WHO I AM."" And he said, ""Say this to the people of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"""
Exodus,3,15,"God also said to Moses, ""Say this to the people of Israel, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations."
Exodus,3,16,"Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, ""I have observed you and what has been done to you in Egypt,"
Exodus,3,17,"and I promise that I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey.""'"
Exodus,3,18,"And they will listen to your voice, and you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us; and now, please let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.'"
Exodus,3,19,But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless compelled by a mighty hand.
Exodus,3,20,So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all the wonders that I will do in it; after that he will let you go.
Exodus,3,21,"And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and when you go, you shall not go empty,"
Exodus,3,22,"but each woman shall ask of her neighbor, and any woman who lives in her house, for silver and gold jewelry, and for clothing. You shall put them on your sons and on your daughters. So you shall plunder the Egyptians."""
Exodus,4,1,"Then Moses answered, ""But behold, they will not believe me or listen to my voice, for they will say, 'The LORD did not appear to you.'"""
Exodus,4,2,"The LORD said to him, ""What is that in your hand?"" He said, ""A staff."""
Exodus,4,3,"And he said, ""Throw it on the ground."" So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses ran from it."
Exodus,4,4,"But the LORD said to Moses, ""Put out your hand and catch it by the tail""--so he put out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand--"
Exodus,4,5,"""that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you."""
Exodus,4,6,"Again, the LORD said to him, ""Put your hand inside your cloak."" And he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous like snow."
Exodus,4,7,"Then God said, ""Put your hand back inside your cloak."" So he put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh."
Exodus,4,8,"""If they will not believe you,"" God said, ""or listen to the first sign, they may believe the latter sign."
Exodus,4,9,"If they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground, and the water that you shall take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground."""
Exodus,4,10,"But Moses said to the LORD, ""Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant, but I am slow of speech and of tongue."""
Exodus,4,11,"Then the LORD said to him, ""Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the LORD?"
Exodus,4,12,"Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak."""
Exodus,4,13,"But he said, ""Oh, my Lord, please send someone else."""
Exodus,4,14,"Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses and he said, ""Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Behold, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart."
Exodus,4,15,"You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you both what to do."
Exodus,4,16,"He shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be your mouth, and you shall be as God to him."
Exodus,4,17,"And take in your hand this staff, with which you shall do the signs."""
Exodus,4,18,"Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, ""Please let me go back to my brothers in Egypt to see whether they are still alive."" And Jethro said to Moses, ""Go in peace."""
Exodus,4,19,"And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, ""Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead."""
Exodus,4,20,"So Moses took his wife and his sons and had them ride on a donkey, and went back to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand."
Exodus,4,21,"And the LORD said to Moses, ""When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the miracles that I have put in your power. But I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go."
Exodus,4,22,"Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the LORD, Israel is my firstborn son,"
Exodus,4,23,"and I say to you, ""Let my son go that he may serve me."" If you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your firstborn son.'"""
Exodus,4,24,At a lodging place on the way the LORD met him and sought to put him to death.
Exodus,4,25,"Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin and touched Moses' feet with it and said, ""Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me!"""
Exodus,4,26,"So he let him alone. It was then that she said, ""A bridegroom of blood,"" because of the circumcision."
Exodus,4,27,"The LORD said to Aaron, ""Go into the wilderness to meet Moses."" So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him."
Exodus,4,28,"And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which he had sent him to speak, and all the signs that he had commanded him to do."
Exodus,4,29,Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the people of Israel.
Exodus,4,30,Aaron spoke all the words that the LORD had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people.
Exodus,4,31,"And the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD had visited the people of Israel and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshiped."
Exodus,5,1,"Afterward Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, ""Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.'"""
Exodus,5,2,"But Pharaoh said, ""Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and moreover, I will not let Israel go."""
Exodus,5,3,"Then they said, ""The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword."""
Exodus,5,4,"But the king of Egypt said to them, ""Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work? Get back to your burdens."""
Exodus,5,5,"And Pharaoh said, ""Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens!"""
Exodus,5,6,"The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen,"
Exodus,5,7,"""You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as in the past; let them go and gather straw for themselves."
Exodus,5,8,"But the number of bricks that they made in the past you shall impose on them, you shall by no means reduce it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, 'Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.'"
Exodus,5,9,"Let heavier work be laid on the men that they may labor at it and pay no regard to lying words."""
Exodus,5,10,"So the taskmasters and the foremen of the people went out and said to the people, ""Thus says Pharaoh, 'I will not give you straw."
Exodus,5,11,"Go and get your straw yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced in the least.'"""
Exodus,5,12,So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
Exodus,5,13,"The taskmasters were urgent, saying, ""Complete your work, your daily task each day, as when there was straw."""
Exodus,5,14,"And the foremen of the people of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, ""Why have you not done all your task of making bricks today and yesterday, as in the past?"""
Exodus,5,15,"Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, ""Why do you treat your servants like this?"
Exodus,5,16,"No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, 'Make bricks!' And behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people."""
Exodus,5,17,"But he said, ""You are idle, you are idle; that is why you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'"
Exodus,5,18,"Go now and work. No straw will be given you, but you must still deliver the same number of bricks."""
Exodus,5,19,"The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in trouble when they said, ""You shall by no means reduce your number of bricks, your daily task each day."""
Exodus,5,20,"They met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them, as they came out from Pharaoh;"
Exodus,5,21,"and they said to them, ""The LORD look on you and judge, because you have made us stink in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us."""
Exodus,5,22,"Then Moses turned to the LORD and said, ""O LORD, why have you done evil to this people? Why did you ever send me?"
Exodus,5,23,"For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people, and you have not delivered your people at all."""
Exodus,6,1,"But the LORD said to Moses, ""Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand he will send them out, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land."""
Exodus,6,2,"God spoke to Moses and said to him, ""I am the LORD."
Exodus,6,3,"I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name the LORD I did not make myself known to them."
Exodus,6,4,"I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as sojourners."
Exodus,6,5,"Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant."
Exodus,6,6,"Say therefore to the people of Israel, 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from slavery to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment."
Exodus,6,7,"I will take you to be my people, and I will be your God, and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians."
Exodus,6,8,"I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. I will give it to you for a possession. I am the LORD.'"""
Exodus,6,9,"Moses spoke thus to the people of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses, because of their broken spirit and harsh slavery."
Exodus,6,10,"So the LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,6,11,"""Go in, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the people of Israel go out of his land."""

Exodus,7,23,"Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this to heart."
Exodus,7,24,"And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the Nile."

Exodus,8,11,"The frogs shall go away from you and your houses and your servants and your people. They shall be left only in the Nile."""
Exodus,8,12,"So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the LORD about the frogs, as he had agreed with Pharaoh."

Exodus,8,14,"And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank."

Exodus,8,17,"And they did so. Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,18,"The magicians tried by their secret arts to produce gnats, but they could not. So there were gnats on man and beast."

Exodus,8,24,And the LORD did so. There came great swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants' houses. Throughout all the land of Egypt the land was ruined by the swarms of flies.
Exodus,8,25,"Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, ""Go, sacrifice to your God within the land."""
Exodus,8,26,"But Moses said, ""It would not be right to do so, for the offerings we shall sacrifice to the LORD our God are an abomination to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice offerings abominable to the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us?"
Exodus,8,27,"We must go three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he tells us."""
Exodus,8,28,"So Pharaoh said, ""I will let you go to sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you must not go very far away. Plead for me."""
Exodus,8,29,"Then Moses said, ""Behold, I am going out from you and I will plead with the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow. Only let not Pharaoh cheat again by not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD."""

Exodus,8,31,"And the LORD did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; not one remained."
Exodus,8,32,"But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and did not let the people go."
Exodus,9,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, ""Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, ""Let my people go, that they may serve me."

Exodus,9,3,"behold, the hand of the LORD will fall with a very severe plague upon your livestock that are in the field, the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks."
Exodus,9,4,"But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing of all that belongs to the people of Israel shall die.""'"""
Exodus,9,5,"And the LORD set a time, saying, ""Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land."""

Exodus,9,7,"And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not one of the livestock of Israel was dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go."
Exodus,9,8,"And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, ""Take handfuls of soot from the kiln, and let Moses throw them in the air in the sight of Pharaoh."
Exodus,9,9,"It shall become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and become boils breaking out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt."""

Exodus,9,11,"And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils came upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians."
Exodus,9,12,"But the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had spoken to Moses."

Exodus,9,15,"For by now I could have put out my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth."
Exodus,9,16,"But for this purpose I have raised you up, to show you my power, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth."
Exodus,9,17,You are still exalting yourself against my people and will not let them go.

Exodus,9,20,"Then whoever feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh hurried his slaves and his livestock into the houses,"
Exodus,9,21,but whoever did not pay attention to the word of the LORD left his slaves and his livestock in the field.
Exodus,9,22,"Then the LORD said to Moses, ""Stretch out your hand toward heaven, so that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man and beast and every plant of the field, in the land of Egypt."""
Exodus,9,23,"Then Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. And the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt."
Exodus,9,24,"There was hail and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very heavy hail, such as had never been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation."
Exodus,9,25,"The hail struck down everything that was in the field in all the land of Egypt, both man and beast. And the hail struck down every plant of the field and broke every tree of the field."
Exodus,9,26,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the people of Israel were, was there no hail."
Exodus,9,27,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron and said to them, ""This time I have sinned; the LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong."

Exodus,9,31,"(The flax and the barley were struck down, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud."
Exodus,9,32,"But the wheat and the emmer were not struck down, for they are late in coming up.)"
Exodus,9,33,"So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and stretched out his hands to the LORD, and the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured upon the earth."
Exodus,9,34,"But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet again and hardened his heart, he and his servants."
Exodus,9,35,"So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people of Israel go, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses."
Exodus,10,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, ""Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I may show these signs of mine among them,"

Exodus,10,7,"Then Pharaoh's servants said to him, ""How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not yet understand that Egypt is ruined?"""
Exodus,10,8,"So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. And he said to them, ""Go, serve the LORD your God. But which ones are to go?"""
Exodus,10,9,"Moses said, ""We will go with our young and our old. We will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds, for we must hold a feast to the LORD."""

Exodus,10,15,"They covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was darkened, and they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Not a green thing remained, neither tree nor plant of the field, through all the land of Egypt."

Exodus,10,17,"Now therefore, forgive my sin, please, only this once, and plead with the LORD your God only to remove this death from me."""
Exodus,10,18,So he went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with the LORD.
Exodus,10,19,"And the LORD turned the wind into a very strong west wind, which lifted the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust was left in all the country of Egypt."
Exodus,10,20,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the people of Israel go."
Exodus,10,21,"Then the LORD said to Moses, ""Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness to be felt."""

Exodus,18,23,"If you do this, God will direct you, you will be able to endure, and all this people also will go to their place in peace."""

Exodus,33,3,"Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up among you, lest I consume you on the way, for you are a stiff-necked people."""
Exodus,33,4,"When the people heard this disastrous word, they mourned, and no one put on his ornaments."
Exodus,33,5,"For the LORD had said to Moses, ""Say to the people of Israel, 'You are a stiff-necked people; if for a single moment I should go up among you, I would consume you. So now take off your ornaments, that I may know what to do with you.'"""
Exodus,33,6,"Therefore the people of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward."
Exodus,33,7,"Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting. And everyone who sought the LORD would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp."
Exodus,33,8,"Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise up, and each would stand at his tent door, and watch Moses until he had gone into the tent."
Exodus,33,9,"When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and the LORD would speak with Moses."
Exodus,33,10,"And when all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would rise up and worship, each at his tent door."
Exodus,33,11,"Thus the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. When Moses turned again into the camp, his assistant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent."
Exodus,33,12,"Moses said to the LORD, ""See, you say to me, 'Bring up this people,' but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.'"
Exodus,33,13,"Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you in order to find favor in your sight. Consider too that this nation is your people."""
Exodus,33,14,"And he said, ""My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."""
Exodus,33,15,"And he said to him, ""If your presence will not go with me, do not bring us up from here."
Exodus,33,16,"For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Is it not in your going with us, so that we are distinct, I and your people, from every other people on the face of the earth?"""
Exodus,33,17,"And the LORD said to Moses, ""This very thing that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name."""

Exodus,33,19,"And he said, ""I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name 'The LORD.' And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy."
Exodus,33,20,"But,"" he said, ""you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live."""
Exodus,33,21,"And the LORD said, ""Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock,"
Exodus,33,22,"and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by."
Exodus,33,23,"Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen."""
Exodus,34,1,"The LORD said to Moses, ""Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke."
Exodus,34,2,"Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain."
Exodus,34,3,"No one shall come up with you, and let no one be seen throughout all the mountain. Let no flocks or herds graze opposite that mountain."""
Exodus,34,4,"So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the first. And he rose early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand two tablets of stone."
Exodus,34,5,"The LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD."
Exodus,34,6,"The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, ""The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness,"
Exodus,34,7,"keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation."""
Exodus,34,8,And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped.
Exodus,34,9,"And he said, ""If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, please let the Lord go in the midst of us, for it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance."""
Exodus,34,10,"And he said, ""Behold, I am making a covenant. Before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been created in all the earth or in any nation. And all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the LORD, for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you."

Exodus,34,27,"And the LORD said to Moses, ""Write these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."""
Exodus,34,28,"So he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights. He neither ate bread nor drank water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments."
Exodus,34,29,"When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand as he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God."
Exodus,34,30,"Aaron and all the people of Israel saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him."
Exodus,34,31,"But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses talked with them."
Exodus,34,32,"Afterward all the people of Israel came near, and he commanded them all that the LORD had spoken with him in Mount Sinai."
Exodus,34,33,"And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face."
Exodus,34,34,"Whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he would remove the veil, until he came out. And when he came out and told the people of Israel what he was commanded,"
Exodus,34,35,"the people of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face was shining. And Moses would put the veil over his face again, until he went in to speak with him."
Exodus,35,1,"Moses assembled all the congregation of the people of Israel and said to them, ""These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do."
Exodus,35,2,"Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it shall be put to death."

Exodus,35,19,"the finely worked garments for ministering in the Holy Place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, for their service as priests."""
Exodus,35,20,Then all the congregation of the people of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
Exodus,35,21,"And they came, everyone whose heart stirred him, and everyone whose spirit moved him, and brought the LORD's contribution to be used for the tent of meeting, and for all its service, and for the holy garments."
Exodus,35,22,"So they came, both men and women. All who were of a willing heart brought brooches and earrings and signet rings and armlets, all sorts of gold objects, every man dedicating an offering of gold to the LORD."
Exodus,35,23,And every one who possessed blue or purple or scarlet yarns or fine linen or goats' hair or tanned rams' skins or goatskins brought them.
Exodus,35,24,Everyone who could make a contribution of silver or bronze brought it as the LORD's contribution. And every one who possessed acacia wood of any use in the work brought it.

Exodus,35,29,"All the men and women, the people of Israel, whose heart moved them to bring anything for the work that the LORD had commanded by Moses to be done brought it as a freewill offering to the LORD."
Exodus,35,30,"Then Moses said to the people of Israel, ""See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;"
Exodus,35,31,"and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, with intelligence, with knowledge, and with all craftsmanship,"
Exodus,35,32,"to devise artistic designs, to work in gold and silver and bronze,"
Exodus,35,33,"in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, for work in every skilled craft."

Exodus,35,35,"He has filled them with skill to do every sort of work done by an engraver or by a designer or by an embroiderer in blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen, or by a weaver--by any sort of workman or skilled designer."
Exodus,36,1,"""Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whom the LORD has put skill and intelligence to know how to do any work in the construction of the sanctuary shall work in accordance with all that the LORD has commanded."""
Exodus,36,2,"And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whose mind the LORD had put skill, everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to do the work."
Exodus,36,3,"And they received from Moses all the contribution that the people of Israel had brought for doing the work on the sanctuary. They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning,"
Exodus,36,4,"so that all the craftsmen who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came, each from the task that he was doing,"
Exodus,36,5,"and said to Moses, ""The people bring much more than enough for doing the work that the LORD has commanded us to do."""
Exodus,36,6,"So Moses gave command, and word was proclaimed throughout the camp, ""Let no man or woman do anything more for the contribution for the sanctuary."" So the people were restrained from bringing,"
Exodus,36,7,"for the material they had was sufficient to do all the work, and more."
Exodus,36,8,"And all the craftsmen among the workmen made the tabernacle with ten curtains. They were made of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet yarns, with cherubim skillfully worked."
Exodus,36,9,"The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains were the same size."
Exodus,36,10,"He coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled to one another."
Exodus,36,11,He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain of the first set. Likewise he made them on the edge of the outermost curtain of the second set.
Exodus,36,12,"He made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set. The loops were opposite one another."
Exodus,36,13,"And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to the other with clasps. So the tabernacle was a single whole."
Exodus,36,14,He also made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle. He made eleven curtains.

Exodus,36,17,"And he made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain of the one set, and fifty loops on the edge of the other connecting curtain."
Exodus,36,18,And he made fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together that it might be a single whole.
Exodus,36,19,And he made for the tent a covering of tanned rams' skins and goatskins.
Exodus,36,20,Then he made the upright frames for the tabernacle of acacia wood.
Exodus,36,21,"Ten cubits was the length of a frame, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each frame."
Exodus,36,22,Each frame had two tenons for fitting together. He did this for all the frames of the tabernacle.
Exodus,36,23,The frames for the tabernacle he made thus: twenty frames for the south side.

Leviticus,7,6,Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place. It is most holy.
Leviticus,7,7,The guilt offering is just like the sin offering; there is one law for them. The priest who makes atonement with it shall have it.

Leviticus,7,17,But what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned up with fire.
Leviticus,7,18,"If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering is eaten on the third day, he who offers it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be credited to him. It is tainted, and he who eats of it shall bear his iniquity."

Leviticus,8,11,"And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them."
Leviticus,8,12,And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to consecrate him.
Leviticus,8,13,"And Moses brought Aaron's sons and clothed them with coats and tied sashes around their waists and bound caps on them, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,14,"Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering."

Leviticus,8,16,"And he took all the fat that was on the entrails and the long lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned them on the altar."
Leviticus,8,17,"But the bull and its skin and its flesh and its dung he burned up with fire outside the camp, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,18,"Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram."
Leviticus,8,19,"And he killed it, and Moses threw the blood against the sides of the altar."
Leviticus,8,20,"He cut the ram into pieces, and Moses burned the head and the pieces and the fat."
Leviticus,8,21,"He washed the entrails and the legs with water, and Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering with a pleasing aroma, a food offering for the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,22,"Then he presented the other ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram."

Leviticus,8,26,and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD he took one unleavened loaf and one loaf of bread with oil and one wafer and placed them on the pieces of fat and on the right thigh.
Leviticus,8,27,And he put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons and waved them as a wave offering before the LORD.
Leviticus,8,28,"Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering. This was an ordination offering with a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,8,29,"And Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD. It was Moses' portion of the ram of ordination, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,30,"Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments, and also on his sons and his sons' garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments, and his sons and his sons' garments with him."
Leviticus,8,31,"And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, ""Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, 'Aaron and his sons shall eat it.'"
Leviticus,8,32,And what remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn up with fire.
Leviticus,8,33,"And you shall not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for it will take seven days to ordain you."

Leviticus,9,3,"And say to the people of Israel, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old without blemish, for a burnt offering,"
Leviticus,9,4,"and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with oil, for today the LORD will appear to you.'"""
Leviticus,9,5,"And they brought what Moses commanded in front of the tent of meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD."
Leviticus,9,6,"And Moses said, ""This is the thing that the LORD commanded you to do, that the glory of the LORD may appear to you."""
Leviticus,9,7,"Then Moses said to Aaron, ""Draw near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and for the people, and bring the offering of the people and make atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded."""
Leviticus,9,8,"So Aaron drew near to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself."
Leviticus,9,9,"And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar."
Leviticus,9,10,"But the fat and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering he burned on the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,9,11,The flesh and the skin he burned up with fire outside the camp.
Leviticus,9,12,"Then he killed the burnt offering, and Aaron's sons handed him the blood, and he threw it against the sides of the altar."
Leviticus,9,13,"And they handed the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burned them on the altar."
Leviticus,9,14,And he washed the entrails and the legs and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.
Leviticus,9,15,"Then he presented the people's offering and took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people and killed it and offered it as a sin offering, like the first one."
Leviticus,9,16,And he presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the rule.
Leviticus,9,17,"And he presented the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning."
Leviticus,9,18,"Then he killed the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings for the people. And Aaron's sons handed him the blood, and he threw it against the sides of the altar."
Leviticus,9,19,"But the fat pieces of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail and that which covers the entrails and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver--"
Leviticus,9,20,"they put the fat pieces on the breasts, and he burned the fat pieces on the altar,"
Leviticus,9,21,"but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD, as Moses commanded."
Leviticus,9,22,"Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings."
Leviticus,9,23,"And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and when they came out they blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people."
Leviticus,9,24,"And fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar, and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces."
Leviticus,10,1,"Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it and offered unauthorized fire before the LORD, which he had not commanded them."
Leviticus,10,2,"And fire came out from before the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD."
Leviticus,10,3,"Then Moses said to Aaron, ""This is what the LORD has said, 'Among those who are near me I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified.'"" And Aaron held his peace."
Leviticus,10,4,"And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, ""Come near; carry your brothers away from the front of the sanctuary and out of the camp."""
Leviticus,10,5,"So they came near and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said."
Leviticus,10,6,"And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons, ""Do not let the hair of your heads hang loose, and do not tear your clothes, lest you die, and wrath come upon all the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning that the LORD has kindled."
Leviticus,10,7,"And do not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting, lest you die, for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you."" And they did according to the word of Moses."

Leviticus,10,15,"The thigh that is contributed and the breast that is waved they shall bring with the food offerings of the fat pieces to wave for a wave offering before the LORD, and it shall be yours and your sons' with you as a due forever, as the LORD has commanded."""
Leviticus,10,16,"Now Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it was burned up! And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the surviving sons of Aaron, saying,"
Leviticus,10,17,"""Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is a thing most holy and has been given to you that you may bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?"
Leviticus,10,18,"Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded."""

Leviticus,24,22,"You shall have the same rule for the sojourner and for the native, for I am the LORD your God."""
Leviticus,24,23,"So Moses spoke to the people of Israel, and they brought out of the camp the one who had cursed and stoned him with stones. Thus the people of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,25,1,"The LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying,"
Leviticus,25,2,"""Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land that I give you, the land shall keep a Sabbath to the LORD."
Leviticus,25,3,"For six years you shall sow your field, and for six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its fruits,"
Leviticus,25,4,"but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a Sabbath to the LORD. You shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard."
Leviticus,25,5,"You shall not reap what grows of itself in your harvest, or gather the grapes of your undressed vine. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land."
Leviticus,25,6,"The Sabbath of the land shall provide food for you, for yourself and for your male and female slaves and for your hired servant and the sojourner who lives with you,"
Leviticus,25,7,and for your cattle and for the wild animals that are in your land: all its yield shall be for food.
Leviticus,25,8,"""You shall count seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, so that the time of the seven weeks of years shall give you forty-nine years."
Leviticus,25,9,Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land.
Leviticus,25,10,"And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, when each of you shall return to his property and each of you shall return to his clan."
Leviticus,25,11,That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; in it you shall neither sow nor reap what grows of itself nor gather the grapes from the undressed vines.
Leviticus,25,12,For it is a jubilee. It shall be holy to you. You may eat the produce of the field.
Leviticus,25,13,"""In this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his property."
Leviticus,25,14,"And if you make a sale to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you shall not wrong one another."
Leviticus,25,15,"You shall pay your neighbor according to the number of years after the jubilee, and he shall sell to you according to the number of years for crops."
Leviticus,25,16,"If the years are many, you shall increase the price, and if the years are few, you shall reduce the price, for it is the number of the crops that he is selling to you."
Leviticus,25,17,"You shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God, for I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,25,18,"""Therefore you shall do my statutes and keep my rules and perform them, and then you will dwell in the land securely."
Leviticus,25,19,"The land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and dwell in it securely."
Leviticus,25,20,"And if you say, 'What shall we eat in the seventh year, if we may not sow or gather in our crop?'"
Leviticus,25,21,"I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year, so that it will produce a crop sufficient for three years."
Leviticus,25,22,"When you sow in the eighth year, you will be eating some of the old crop; you shall eat the old until the ninth year, when its crop arrives."
Leviticus,25,23,"""The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine. For you are strangers and sojourners with me."
Leviticus,25,24,"And in all the country you possess, you shall allow a redemption of the land."
Leviticus,25,25,"""If your brother becomes poor and sells part of his property, then his nearest redeemer shall come and redeem what his brother has sold."
Leviticus,25,26,"If a man has no one to redeem it and then himself becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it,"
Leviticus,25,27,"let him calculate the years since he sold it and pay back the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and then return to his property."
Leviticus,25,28,"But if he has not sufficient means to recover it, then what he sold shall remain in the hand of the buyer until the year of jubilee. In the jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his property."
Leviticus,25,29,"""If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, he may redeem it within a year of its sale. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption."
Leviticus,25,30,"If it is not redeemed within a full year, then the house in the walled city shall belong in perpetuity to the buyer, throughout his generations; it shall not be released in the jubilee."
Leviticus,25,31,"But the houses of the villages that have no wall around them shall be classified with the fields of the land. They may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the jubilee."
Leviticus,25,32,"As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites may redeem at any time the houses in the cities they possess."
Leviticus,25,33,"And if one of the Levites exercises his right of redemption, then the house that was sold in a city they possess shall be released in the jubilee. For the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the people of Israel."
Leviticus,25,34,"But the fields of pastureland belonging to their cities may not be sold, for that is their possession forever."
Leviticus,25,35,"""If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner, and he shall live with you."
Leviticus,25,36,"Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God, that your brother may live beside you."
Leviticus,25,37,"You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit."
Leviticus,25,38,"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God."
Leviticus,25,39,"""If your brother becomes poor beside you and sells himself to you, you shall not make him serve as a slave:"
Leviticus,25,40,he shall be with you as a hired servant and as a sojourner. He shall serve with you until the year of the jubilee.
Leviticus,25,41,"Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and go back to his own clan and return to the possession of his fathers."
Leviticus,25,42,"For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves."
Leviticus,25,43,You shall not rule over him ruthlessly but shall fear your God.
Leviticus,25,44,As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are around you.
Leviticus,25,45,"You may also buy from among the strangers who sojourn with you and their clans that are with you, who have been born in your land, and they may be your property."
Leviticus,25,46,"You may bequeath them to your sons after you to inherit as a possession forever. You may make slaves of them, but over your brothers the people of Israel you shall not rule, one over another ruthlessly."
Leviticus,25,47,"""If a stranger or sojourner with you becomes rich, and your brother beside him becomes poor and sells himself to the stranger or sojourner with you or to a member of the stranger's clan,"
Leviticus,25,48,"then after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him,"
Leviticus,25,49,"or his uncle or his cousin may redeem him, or a close relative from his clan may redeem him. Or if he grows rich he may redeem himself."
Leviticus,25,50,"He shall calculate with his buyer from the year when he sold himself to him until the year of jubilee, and the price of his sale shall vary with the number of years. The time he was with his owner shall be rated as the time of a hired servant."
Leviticus,25,51,"If there are still many years left, he shall pay proportionately for his redemption some of his sale price."
Leviticus,25,52,"If there remain but a few years until the year of jubilee, he shall calculate and pay for his redemption in proportion to his years of service."
Leviticus,25,53,He shall treat him as a servant hired year by year. He shall not rule ruthlessly over him in your sight.
Leviticus,25,54,"And if he is not redeemed by these means, then he and his children with him shall be released in the year of jubilee."
Leviticus,25,55,For it is to me that the people of Israel are servants. They are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus,26,1,"""You shall not make idols for yourselves or erect an image or pillar, and you shall not set up a figured stone in your land to bow down to it, for I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,26,2,You shall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
Leviticus,26,3,"""If you walk in my statutes and observe my commandments and do them,"
Leviticus,26,4,"then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit."
Leviticus,26,5,"Your threshing shall last to the time of the grape harvest, and the grape harvest shall last to the time for sowing. And you shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land securely."
Leviticus,26,6,"I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid. And I will remove harmful beasts from the land, and the sword shall not go through your land."
Leviticus,26,7,"You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword."
Leviticus,26,8,"Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand, and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword."
Leviticus,26,9,I will turn to you and make you fruitful and multiply you and will confirm my covenant with you.
Leviticus,26,10,"You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall clear out the old to make way for the new."
Leviticus,26,11,"I will make my dwelling among you, and my soul shall not abhor you."
Leviticus,26,12,"And I will walk among you and will be your God, and you shall be my people."
Leviticus,26,13,"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves. And I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect."
Leviticus,26,14,"""But if you will not listen to me and will not do all these commandments,"
Leviticus,26,15,"if you spurn my statutes, and if your soul abhors my rules, so that you will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant,"
Leviticus,26,16,"then I will do this to you: I will visit you with panic, with wasting disease and fever that consume the eyes and make the heart ache. And you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it."
Leviticus,26,17,"I will set my face against you, and you shall be struck down before your enemies. Those who hate you shall rule over you, and you shall flee when none pursues you."
Leviticus,26,18,"And if in spite of this you will not listen to me, then I will discipline you again sevenfold for your sins,"
Leviticus,26,19,"and I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your heavens like iron and your earth like bronze."
Leviticus,26,20,"And your strength shall be spent in vain, for your land shall not yield its increase, and the trees of the land shall not yield their fruit."
Leviticus,26,21,"""Then if you walk contrary to me and will not listen to me, I will continue striking you, sevenfold for your sins."
Leviticus,26,22,"And I will let loose the wild beasts against you, which shall bereave you of your children and destroy your livestock and make you few in number, so that your roads shall be deserted."
Leviticus,26,23,"""And if by this discipline you are not turned to me but walk contrary to me,"
Leviticus,26,24,"then I also will walk contrary to you, and I myself will strike you sevenfold for your sins."
Leviticus,26,25,"And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute vengeance for the covenant. And if you gather within your cities, I will send pestilence among you, and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy."
Leviticus,26,26,"When I break your supply of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in a single oven and shall dole out your bread again by weight, and you shall eat and not be satisfied."
Leviticus,26,27,"""But if in spite of this you will not listen to me, but walk contrary to me,"
Leviticus,26,28,"then I will walk contrary to you in fury, and I myself will discipline you sevenfold for your sins."
Leviticus,26,29,"You shall eat the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters."
Leviticus,26,30,"And I will destroy your high places and cut down your incense altars and cast your dead bodies upon the dead bodies of your idols, and my soul will abhor you."
Leviticus,26,31,"And I will lay your cities waste and will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your pleasing aromas."
Leviticus,26,32,"And I myself will devastate the land, so that your enemies who settle in it shall be appalled at it."
Leviticus,26,33,"And I will scatter you among the nations, and I will unsheathe the sword after you, and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste."
Leviticus,26,34,"""Then the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths as long as it lies desolate, while you are in your enemies' land; then the land shall rest, and enjoy its Sabbaths."
Leviticus,26,35,"As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, the rest that it did not have on your Sabbaths when you were dwelling in it."
Leviticus,26,36,"And as for those of you who are left, I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. The sound of a driven leaf shall put them to flight, and they shall flee as one flees from the sword, and they shall fall when none pursues."
Leviticus,26,37,"They shall stumble over one another, as if to escape a sword, though none pursues. And you shall have no power to stand before your enemies."
Leviticus,26,38,"And you shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up."
Leviticus,26,39,"And those of you who are left shall rot away in your enemies' lands because of their iniquity, and also because of the iniquities of their fathers they shall rot away like them."
Leviticus,26,40,"""But if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers in their treachery that they committed against me, and also in walking contrary to me,"
Leviticus,26,41,"so that I walked contrary to them and brought them into the land of their enemies--if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled and they make amends for their iniquity,"
Leviticus,26,42,"then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and I will remember my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land."
Leviticus,26,43,"But the land shall be abandoned by them and enjoy its Sabbaths while it lies desolate without them, and they shall make amends for their iniquity, because they spurned my rules and their soul abhorred my statutes."
Leviticus,26,44,"Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not spurn them, neither will I abhor them so as to destroy them utterly and break my covenant with them, for I am the LORD their God."
Leviticus,26,45,"But I will for their sake remember the covenant with their forefathers, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the LORD."""
Leviticus,26,46,These are the statutes and rules and laws that the LORD made between him and the people of Israel through Moses on Mount Sinai.
Leviticus,27,1,"The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,27,2,"""Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, If anyone makes a special vow to the LORD involving the valuation of persons,"
Leviticus,27,3,"then the valuation of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary."
Leviticus,27,4,"If the person is a female, the valuation shall be thirty shekels."
Leviticus,27,5,"If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, the valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels."
Leviticus,27,6,"If the person is from a month old up to five years old, the valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver, and for a female the valuation shall be three shekels of silver."
Leviticus,27,7,"And if the person is sixty years old or over, then the valuation for a male shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels."
Leviticus,27,8,"And if someone is too poor to pay the valuation, then he shall be made to stand before the priest, and the priest shall value him; the priest shall value him according to what the vower can afford."
Leviticus,27,9,"""If the vow is an animal that may be offered as an offering to the LORD, all of it that he gives to the LORD is holy."
Leviticus,27,10,"He shall not exchange it or make a substitute for it, good for bad, or bad for good; and if he does in fact substitute one animal for another, then both it and the substitute shall be holy."
Leviticus,27,11,"And if it is any unclean animal that may not be offered as an offering to the LORD, then he shall stand the animal before the priest,"
Leviticus,27,12,"and the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall be."
Leviticus,27,13,"But if he wishes to redeem it, he shall add a fifth to the valuation."
Leviticus,27,14,"""When a man dedicates his house as a holy gift to the LORD, the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand."
Leviticus,27,15,"And if the donor wishes to redeem his house, he shall add a fifth to the valuation price, and it shall be his."
Leviticus,27,16,"""If a man dedicates to the LORD part of the land that is his possession, then the valuation shall be in proportion to its seed. A homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver."
Leviticus,27,17,"If he dedicates his field from the year of jubilee, the valuation shall stand,"
Leviticus,27,18,"but if he dedicates his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall calculate the price according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee, and a deduction shall be made from the valuation."
Leviticus,27,19,"And if he who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, then he shall add a fifth to its valuation price, and it shall remain his."
Leviticus,27,20,"But if he does not wish to redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore."
Leviticus,27,21,"But the field, when it is released in the jubilee, shall be a holy gift to the LORD, like a field that has been devoted. The priest shall be in possession of it."
Leviticus,27,22,"If he dedicates to the LORD a field that he has bought, which is not a part of his possession,"
Leviticus,27,23,"then the priest shall calculate the amount of the valuation for it up to the year of jubilee, and the man shall give the valuation on that day as a holy gift to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,24,"In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, to whom the land belongs as a possession."
Leviticus,27,25,Every valuation shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall make a shekel.
Leviticus,27,26,"""But a firstborn of animals, which as a firstborn belongs to the LORD, no man may dedicate; whether ox or sheep, it is the LORD's."
Leviticus,27,27,"And if it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back at the valuation, and add a fifth to it; or, if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold at the valuation."
Leviticus,27,28,"""But no devoted thing that a man devotes to the LORD, of anything that he has, whether man or beast, or of his inherited field, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,29,"No one devoted, who is to be devoted for destruction from mankind, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death."
Leviticus,27,30,"""Every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is the LORD's; it is holy to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,31,"If a man wishes to redeem some of his tithe, he shall add a fifth to it."
Leviticus,27,32,"And every tithe of herds and flocks, every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman's staff, shall be holy to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,33,"One shall not differentiate between good or bad, neither shall he make a substitute for it; and if he does substitute for it, then both it and the substitute shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed."""
Leviticus,27,34,These are the commandments that the LORD commanded Moses for the people of Israel on Mount Sinai.
Numbers,1,1,"The LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,"
Numbers,1,2,"""Take a census of all the congregation of the people of Israel, by clans, by fathers' houses, according to the number of names, every male, head by head."
Numbers,1,3,"From twenty years old and upward, all in Israel who are able to go to war, you and Aaron shall list them, company by company."
Numbers,1,4,"And there shall be with you a man from each tribe, each man being the head of the house of his fathers."

Numbers,1,18,"and on the first day of the second month, they assembled the whole congregation together, who registered themselves by clans, by fathers' houses, according to the number of names from twenty years old and upward, head by head,"
Numbers,1,19,as the LORD commanded Moses. So he listed them in the wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers,1,20,"The people of Reuben, Israel's firstborn, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war:"

Numbers,1,46,"all those listed were 603,550."
Numbers,1,47,But the Levites were not listed along with them by their ancestral tribe.
Numbers,1,48,"For the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,1,49,"""Only the tribe of Levi you shall not list, and you shall not take a census of them among the people of Israel."
Numbers,1,50,"But appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings, and they shall take care of it and shall camp around the tabernacle."

Numbers,8,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,8,2,"""Speak to Aaron and say to him, When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand."""
Numbers,8,3,"And Aaron did so: he set up its lamps in front of the lampstand, as the LORD commanded Moses."

Numbers,8,5,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,8,6,"""Take the Levites from among the people of Israel and cleanse them."
Numbers,8,7,"Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of purification upon them, and let them go with a razor over all their body, and wash their clothes and cleanse themselves."
Numbers,8,8,"Then let them take a bull from the herd and its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another bull from the herd for a sin offering."
Numbers,8,9,And you shall bring the Levites before the tent of meeting and assemble the whole congregation of the people of Israel.
Numbers,8,10,"When you bring the Levites before the LORD, the people of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites,"
Numbers,8,11,"and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the people of Israel, that they may do the service of the LORD."
Numbers,8,12,"Then the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the LORD to make atonement for the Levites."
Numbers,8,13,"And you shall set the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and shall offer them as a wave offering to the LORD."
Numbers,8,14,"""Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the people of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine."
Numbers,8,15,"And after that the Levites shall go in to serve at the tent of meeting, when you have cleansed them and offered them as a wave offering."
Numbers,8,16,"For they are wholly given to me from among the people of Israel. Instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the people of Israel, I have taken them for myself."
Numbers,8,17,"For all the firstborn among the people of Israel are mine, both of man and of beast. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them for myself,"
Numbers,8,18,and I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel.
Numbers,8,19,"And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the people of Israel, to do the service for the people of Israel at the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the people of Israel, that there may be no plague among the people of Israel when the people of Israel come near the sanctuary."""
Numbers,8,20,"Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the people of Israel to the Levites. According to all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, the people of Israel did to them."
Numbers,8,21,"And the Levites purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes, and Aaron offered them as a wave offering before the LORD, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them."
Numbers,8,22,"And after that the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and his sons; as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them."
Numbers,8,23,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,8,24,"""This applies to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall come to do duty in the service of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,8,25,And from the age of fifty years they shall withdraw from the duty of the service and serve no more.
Numbers,8,26,"They minister to their brothers in the tent of meeting by keeping guard, but they shall do no service. Thus shall you do to the Levites in assigning their duties."""
Numbers,9,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,"
Numbers,9,2,"""Let the people of Israel keep the Passover at its appointed time."
Numbers,9,3,"On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and all its rules you shall keep it."""
Numbers,9,4,So Moses told the people of Israel that they should keep the Passover.
Numbers,9,5,"And they kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the people of Israel did."
Numbers,9,6,"And there were certain men who were unclean through touching a dead body, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day."
Numbers,9,7,"And those men said to him, ""We are unclean through touching a dead body. Why are we kept from bringing the LORD's offering at its appointed time among the people of Israel?"""
Numbers,9,8,"And Moses said to them, ""Wait, that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you."""
Numbers,9,9,"The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,9,10,"""Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If any one of you or of your descendants is unclean through touching a dead body, or is on a long journey, he shall still keep the Passover to the LORD."
Numbers,9,11,In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it. They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
Numbers,9,12,"They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break any of its bones; according to all the statute for the Passover they shall keep it."
Numbers,9,13,"But if anyone who is clean and is not on a journey fails to keep the Passover, that person shall be cut off from his people because he did not bring the LORD's offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin."
Numbers,9,14,"And if a stranger sojourns among you and would keep the Passover to the LORD, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its rule, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native."""
Numbers,9,15,"On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony. And at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning."
Numbers,9,16,So it was always: the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night.
Numbers,9,17,"And whenever the cloud lifted from over the tent, after that the people of Israel set out, and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the people of Israel camped."
Numbers,9,18,"At the command of the LORD the people of Israel set out, and at the command of the LORD they camped. As long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle, they remained in camp."
Numbers,9,19,"Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the people of Israel kept the charge of the LORD and did not set out."
Numbers,9,20,"Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of the LORD they remained in camp; then according to the command of the LORD they set out."
Numbers,9,21,"And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning. And when the cloud lifted in the morning, they set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud lifted they set out."
Numbers,9,22,"Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, abiding there, the people of Israel remained in camp and did not set out, but when it lifted they set out."
Numbers,9,23,"At the command of the LORD they camped, and at the command of the LORD they set out. They kept the charge of the LORD, at the command of the LORD by Moses."
Numbers,10,1,"The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,10,2,"""Make two silver trumpets. Of hammered work you shall make them, and you shall use them for summoning the congregation and for breaking camp."
Numbers,10,3,"And when both are blown, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the entrance of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,10,4,"But if they blow only one, then the chiefs, the heads of the tribes of Israel, shall gather themselves to you."
Numbers,10,5,"When you blow an alarm, the camps that are on the east side shall set out."
Numbers,10,6,"And when you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that are on the south side shall set out. An alarm is to be blown whenever they are to set out."
Numbers,10,7,"But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow a long blast, but you shall not sound an alarm."
Numbers,10,8,"And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. The trumpets shall be to you for a perpetual statute throughout your generations."
Numbers,10,9,"And when you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be remembered before the LORD your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies."
Numbers,10,10,"On the day of your gladness also, and at your appointed feasts and at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings. They shall be a reminder of you before your God: I am the LORD your God."""
Numbers,10,11,"In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony,"
Numbers,10,12,and the people of Israel set out by stages from the wilderness of Sinai. And the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran.
Numbers,10,13,They set out for the first time at the command of the LORD by Moses.
Numbers,10,14,"The standard of the camp of the people of Judah set out first by their companies, and over their company was Nahshon the son of Amminadab."
Numbers,10,15,And over the company of the tribe of the people of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.
Numbers,10,16,And over the company of the tribe of the people of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
Numbers,10,17,"And when the tabernacle was taken down, the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who carried the tabernacle, set out."
Numbers,10,18,"And the standard of the camp of Reuben set out by their companies, and over their company was Elizur the son of Shedeur."
Numbers,10,19,And over the company of the tribe of the people of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
Numbers,10,20,And over the company of the tribe of the people of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
Numbers,10,21,"Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things, and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival."
Numbers,10,22,"And the standard of the camp of the people of Ephraim set out by their companies, and over their company was Elishama the son of Ammihud."
Numbers,10,23,And over the company of the tribe of the people of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
Numbers,10,24,And over the company of the tribe of the people of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
Numbers,10,25,"Then the standard of the camp of the people of Dan, acting as the rear guard of all the camps, set out by their companies, and over their company was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai."
Numbers,10,26,And over the company of the tribe of the people of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran.
Numbers,10,27,And over the company of the tribe of the people of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
Numbers,10,28,"This was the order of march of the people of Israel by their companies, when they set out."
Numbers,10,29,"And Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, ""We are setting out for the place of which the LORD said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us, and we will do good to you, for the LORD has promised good to Israel."""
Numbers,10,30,"But he said to him, ""I will not go. I will depart to my own land and to my kindred."""
Numbers,10,31,"And he said, ""Please do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will serve as eyes for us."
Numbers,10,32,"And if you do go with us, whatever good the LORD will do to us, the same will we do to you."""
Numbers,10,33,"So they set out from the mount of the LORD three days' journey. And the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting place for them."
Numbers,10,34,"And the cloud of the LORD was over them by day, whenever they set out from the camp."
Numbers,10,35,"And whenever the ark set out, Moses said, ""Arise, O LORD, and let your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate you flee before you."""
Numbers,10,36,"And when it rested, he said, ""Return, O LORD, to the ten thousand thousands of Israel."""
Numbers,11,1,"And the people complained in the hearing of the LORD about their misfortunes, and when the LORD heard it, his anger was kindled, and the fire of the LORD burned among them and consumed some outlying parts of the camp."
Numbers,11,2,"Then the people cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to the LORD, and the fire died down."
Numbers,11,3,"So the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the LORD burned among them."
Numbers,11,4,"Now the rabble that was among them had a strong craving. And the people of Israel also wept again and said, ""Oh that we had meat to eat!"
Numbers,11,5,"We remember the fish we ate in Egypt that cost nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic."
Numbers,11,6,"But now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at."""
Numbers,11,7,"Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium."
Numbers,11,8,The people went about and gathered it and ground it in handmills or beat it in mortars and boiled it in pots and made cakes of it. And the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil.
Numbers,11,9,"When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell with it."
Numbers,11,10,"Moses heard the people weeping throughout their clans, everyone at the door of his tent. And the anger of the LORD blazed hotly, and Moses was displeased."
Numbers,11,11,"Moses said to the LORD, ""Why have you dealt ill with your servant? And why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?"
Numbers,11,12,"Did I conceive all this people? Did I give them birth, that you should say to me, 'Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing child,' to the land that you swore to give their fathers?"
Numbers,11,13,"Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me and say, 'Give us meat, that we may eat.'"
Numbers,11,14,I am not able to carry all this people alone; the burden is too heavy for me.
Numbers,11,15,"If you will treat me like this, kill me at once, if I find favor in your sight, that I may not see my wretchedness."""
Numbers,11,16,"Then the LORD said to Moses, ""Gather for me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them, and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you."
Numbers,11,17,"And I will come down and talk with you there. And I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you may not bear it yourself alone."
Numbers,11,18,"And say to the people, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat, for you have wept in the hearing of the LORD, saying, ""Who will give us meat to eat? For it was better for us in Egypt."" Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you shall eat."
Numbers,11,19,"You shall not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,"
Numbers,11,20,"but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected the LORD who is among you and have wept before him, saying, ""Why did we come out of Egypt?""'"""
Numbers,11,21,"But Moses said, ""The people among whom I am number six hundred thousand on foot, and you have said, 'I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month!'"
Numbers,11,22,"Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, and be enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, and be enough for them?"""
Numbers,11,23,"And the LORD said to Moses, ""Is the LORD's hand shortened? Now you shall see whether my word will come true for you or not."""
Numbers,11,24,So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD. And he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tent.
Numbers,11,25,"Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. And as soon as the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied. But they did not continue doing it."
Numbers,11,26,"Now two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the Spirit rested on them. They were among those registered, but they had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp."
Numbers,11,27,"And a young man ran and told Moses, ""Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."""
Numbers,11,28,"And Joshua the son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from his youth, said, ""My lord Moses, stop them."""
Numbers,11,29,"But Moses said to him, ""Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the LORD's people were prophets, that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!"""
Numbers,11,30,And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
Numbers,11,31,"Then a wind from the LORD sprang up, and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day's journey on this side and a day's journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the ground."
Numbers,11,32,"And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail. Those who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp."
Numbers,11,33,"While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck down the people with a very great plague."
Numbers,11,34,"Therefore the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had the craving."
Numbers,11,35,"From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth."
Numbers,12,1,"Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman."
Numbers,12,2,"And they said, ""Has the LORD indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?"" And the LORD heard it."
Numbers,12,3,"Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth."
Numbers,12,4,"And suddenly the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, ""Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting."" And the three of them came out."
Numbers,12,5,"And the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forward."
Numbers,12,6,"And he said, ""Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the LORD make myself known to him in a vision; I speak with him in a dream."
Numbers,12,7,Not so with my servant Moses. He is faithful in all my house.
Numbers,12,8,"With him I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in riddles, and he beholds the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?"""
Numbers,12,9,"And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them, and he departed."
Numbers,12,10,"When the cloud removed from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, like snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous."
Numbers,12,11,"And Aaron said to Moses, ""Oh, my lord, do not punish us because we have done foolishly and have sinned."
Numbers,12,12,"Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his mother's womb."""
Numbers,12,13,"And Moses cried to the LORD, ""O God, please heal her--please."""
Numbers,12,14,"But the LORD said to Moses, ""If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be shamed seven days? Let her be shut outside the camp seven days, and after that she may be brought in again."""
Numbers,12,15,"So Miriam was shut outside the camp seven days, and the people did not set out on the march till Miriam was brought in again."
Numbers,12,16,"After that the people set out from Hazeroth, and camped in the wilderness of Paran."
Numbers,13,1,"The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,13,2,"""Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the people of Israel. From each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a chief among them."""
Numbers,13,3,"So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran, according to the command of the LORD, all of them men who were heads of the people of Israel."
Numbers,13,4,"And these were their names: From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;"
Numbers,13,5,"from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;"
Numbers,13,6,"from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;"
Numbers,13,7,"from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;"
Numbers,13,8,"from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;"
Numbers,13,9,"from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;"
Numbers,13,10,"from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;"
Numbers,13,11,"from the tribe of Joseph (that is, from the tribe of Manasseh), Gaddi the son of Susi;"
Numbers,13,12,"from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;"
Numbers,13,13,"from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;"
Numbers,13,14,"from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;"
Numbers,13,15,"from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi."
Numbers,13,16,These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.
Numbers,13,17,"Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said to them, ""Go up into the Negeb and go up into the hill country,"
Numbers,13,18,"and see what the land is, and whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many,"
Numbers,13,19,"and whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad, and whether the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds,"
Numbers,13,20,"and whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there are trees in it or not. Be of good courage and bring some of the fruit of the land."" Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes."
Numbers,13,21,"So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, near Lebo-hamath."
Numbers,13,22,"They went up into the Negeb and came to Hebron. Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were there. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)"
Numbers,13,23,"And they came to the Valley of Eshcol and cut down from there a branch with a single cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole between two of them; they also brought some pomegranates and figs."
Numbers,13,24,"That place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster that the people of Israel cut down from there."
Numbers,13,25,At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land.
Numbers,13,26,"And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the people of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh. They brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land."
Numbers,13,27,"And they told him, ""We came to the land to which you sent us. It flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit."
Numbers,13,28,"However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. And besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there."
Numbers,13,29,"The Amalekites dwell in the land of the Negeb. The Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill country. And the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and along the Jordan."""
Numbers,13,30,"But Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, ""Let us go up at once and occupy it, for we are well able to overcome it."""
Numbers,13,31,"Then the men who had gone up with him said, ""We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we are."""
Numbers,13,32,"So they brought to the people of Israel a bad report of the land that they had spied out, saying, ""The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people that we saw in it are of great height."
Numbers,13,33,"And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim), and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them."""
Numbers,14,1,"Then all the congregation raised a loud cry, and the people wept that night."
Numbers,14,2,"And all the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron. The whole congregation said to them, ""Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness!"
Numbers,14,3,"Why is the LORD bringing us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become a prey. Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?"""
Numbers,14,4,"And they said to one another, ""Let us choose a leader and go back to Egypt."""
Numbers,14,5,Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the people of Israel.
Numbers,14,6,"And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes"
Numbers,14,7,"and said to all the congregation of the people of Israel, ""The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land."
Numbers,14,8,"If the LORD delights in us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and honey."
Numbers,14,9,"Only do not rebel against the LORD. And do not fear the people of the land, for they are bread for us. Their protection is removed from them, and the LORD is with us; do not fear them."""
Numbers,14,10,Then all the congregation said to stone them with stones. But the glory of the LORD appeared at the tent of meeting to all the people of Israel.
Numbers,14,11,"And the LORD said to Moses, ""How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them?"
Numbers,14,12,"I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they."""
Numbers,14,13,"But Moses said to the LORD, ""Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for you brought up this people in your might from among them,"
Numbers,14,14,"and they will tell the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you, O LORD, are in the midst of this people. For you, O LORD, are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night."
Numbers,14,15,"Now if you kill this people as one man, then the nations who have heard your fame will say,"
Numbers,14,16,'It is because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land that he swore to give to them that he has killed them in the wilderness.'
Numbers,14,17,"And now, please let the power of the Lord be great as you have promised, saying,"
Numbers,14,18,"'The LORD is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, forgiving iniquity and transgression, but he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, to the third and the fourth generation.'"
Numbers,14,19,"Please pardon the iniquity of this people, according to the greatness of your steadfast love, just as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt until now."""
Numbers,14,20,"Then the LORD said, ""I have pardoned, according to your word."
Numbers,14,21,"But truly, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD,"
Numbers,14,22,"none of the men who have seen my glory and my signs that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and yet have put me to the test these ten times and have not obeyed my voice,"
Numbers,14,23,shall see the land that I swore to give to their fathers. And none of those who despised me shall see it.
Numbers,14,24,"But my servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit and has followed me fully, I will bring into the land into which he went, and his descendants shall possess it."
Numbers,14,25,"Now, since the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valleys, turn tomorrow and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea."""
Numbers,14,26,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,"
Numbers,14,27,"""How long shall this wicked congregation grumble against me? I have heard the grumblings of the people of Israel, which they grumble against me."
Numbers,14,28,"Say to them, 'As I live, declares the LORD, what you have said in my hearing I will do to you:"
Numbers,14,29,"your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness, and of all your number, listed in the census from twenty years old and upward, who have grumbled against me,"
Numbers,14,30,"not one shall come into the land where I swore that I would make you dwell, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun."
Numbers,14,31,"But your little ones, who you said would become a prey, I will bring in, and they shall know the land that you have rejected."
Numbers,14,32,"But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness."
Numbers,14,33,"And your children shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years and shall suffer for your faithlessness, until the last of your dead bodies lies in the wilderness."
Numbers,14,34,"According to the number of the days in which you spied out the land, forty days, a year for each day, you shall bear your iniquity forty years, and you shall know my displeasure.'"
Numbers,14,35,"I, the LORD, have spoken. Surely this will I do to all this wicked congregation who are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall come to a full end, and there they shall die."""
Numbers,14,36,"And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation grumble against him by bringing up a bad report about the land--"
Numbers,14,37,the men who brought up a bad report of the land--died by plague before the LORD.
Numbers,14,38,"Of those men who went to spy out the land, only Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive."
Numbers,14,39,"When Moses told these words to all the people of Israel, the people mourned greatly."
Numbers,14,40,"And they rose early in the morning and went up to the heights of the hill country, saying, ""Here we are. We will go up to the place that the LORD has promised, for we have sinned."""
Numbers,14,41,"But Moses said, ""Why now are you transgressing the command of the LORD, when that will not succeed?"
Numbers,14,42,"Do not go up, for the Lord is not among you, lest you be struck down before your enemies."
Numbers,14,43,"For there the Amalekites and the Canaanites are facing you, and you shall fall by the sword. Because you have turned back from following the LORD, the LORD will not be with you."""
Numbers,14,44,"But they presumed to go up to the heights of the hill country, although neither the ark of the covenant of the LORD nor Moses departed out of the camp."
Numbers,14,45,"Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and defeated them and pursued them, even to Hormah."
Numbers,15,1,"The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,15,2,"""Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land you are to inhabit, which I am giving you,"

Numbers,15,29,"You shall have one law for him who does anything unintentionally, for him who is native among the people of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them."

Numbers,15,32,"While the people of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day."
Numbers,15,33,And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation.

Numbers,16,3,"They assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said to them, ""You have gone too far! For all in the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?"""
Numbers,16,4,"When Moses heard it, he fell on his face,"
Numbers,16,5,"and he said to Korah and all his company, ""In the morning the LORD will show who is his, and who is holy, and will bring him near to him. The one whom he chooses he will bring near to him."
Numbers,16,6,"Do this: take censers, Korah and all his company;"
Numbers,16,7,"put fire in them and put incense on them before the LORD tomorrow, and the man whom the LORD chooses shall be the holy one. You have gone too far, sons of Levi!"""
Numbers,16,8,"And Moses said to Korah, ""Hear now, you sons of Levi:"

Numbers,16,10,"and that he has brought you near him, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? And would you seek the priesthood also?"
Numbers,16,11,"Therefore it is against the LORD that you and all your company have gathered together. What is Aaron that you grumble against him?"""
Numbers,16,12,"And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and they said, ""We will not come up."

Numbers,16,18,So every man took his censer and put fire in them and laid incense on them and stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.
Numbers,16,19,Then Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.
Numbers,16,20,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,"
Numbers,16,21,"""Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment."""

Numbers,16,27,"So they got away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. And Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents, together with their wives, their sons, and their little ones."
Numbers,16,28,"And Moses said, ""Hereby you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works, and that it has not been of my own accord."

Numbers,16,32,"And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and all the people who belonged to Korah and all their goods."
Numbers,16,33,"So they and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol, and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly."
Numbers,16,34,"And all Israel who were around them fled at their cry, for they said, ""Lest the earth swallow us up!"""
Numbers,16,35,And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men offering the incense.

Numbers,16,37,"""Tell Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take up the censers out of the blaze. Then scatter the fire far and wide, for they have become holy."

Numbers,16,39,"So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned had offered, and they were hammered out as a covering for the altar,"
Numbers,16,40,"to be a reminder to the people of Israel, so that no outsider, who is not of the descendants of Aaron, should draw near to burn incense before the LORD, lest he become like Korah and his company--as the LORD said to him through Moses."
Numbers,16,41,"But on the next day all the congregation of the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and against Aaron, saying, ""You have killed the people of the LORD."""
Numbers,16,42,"And when the congregation had assembled against Moses and against Aaron, they turned toward the tent of meeting. And behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared."
Numbers,16,43,"And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting,"
Numbers,16,44,"and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,16,45,"""Get away from the midst of this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment."" And they fell on their faces."
Numbers,16,46,"And Moses said to Aaron, ""Take your censer, and put fire on it from off the altar and lay incense on it and carry it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, for wrath has gone out from the LORD; the plague has begun."""
Numbers,16,47,"So Aaron took it as Moses said and ran into the midst of the assembly. And behold, the plague had already begun among the people. And he put on the incense and made atonement for the people."
Numbers,16,48,"And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stopped."
Numbers,16,49,"Now those who died in the plague were 14,700, besides those who died in the affair of Korah."
Numbers,16,50,"And Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting, when the plague was stopped."

Numbers,17,8,"On the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony, and behold, the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds and produced blossoms, and it bore ripe almonds."
Numbers,17,9,"Then Moses brought out all the staffs from before the LORD to all the people of Israel. And they looked, and each man took his staff."
Numbers,17,10,"And the LORD said to Moses, ""Put back the staff of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept as a sign for the rebels, that you may make an end of their grumblings against me, lest they die."""
Numbers,17,11,"Thus did Moses; as the LORD commanded him, so he did."

Numbers,19,10,"And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. And this shall be a perpetual statute for the people of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them."
Numbers,19,11,"""Whoever touches the dead body of any person shall be unclean seven days."
Numbers,19,12,"He shall cleanse himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, and so be clean. But if he does not cleanse himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not become clean."
Numbers,19,13,"Whoever touches a dead person, the body of anyone who has died, and does not cleanse himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD, and that person shall be cut off from Israel; because the water for impurity was not thrown on him, he shall be unclean. His uncleanness is still on him."
Numbers,19,14,"""This is the law when someone dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be unclean seven days."
Numbers,19,15,And every open vessel that has no cover fastened on it is unclean.
Numbers,19,16,"Whoever in the open field touches someone who was killed with a sword or who died naturally, or touches a human bone or a grave, shall be unclean seven days."
Numbers,19,17,"For the unclean they shall take some ashes of the burnt sin offering, and fresh water shall be added in a vessel."
Numbers,19,18,"Then a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the furnishings and on the persons who were there and on whoever touched the bone, or the slain or the dead or the grave."
Numbers,19,19,"And the clean person shall sprinkle it on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day. Thus on the seventh day he shall cleanse him, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and at evening he shall be clean."
Numbers,19,20,"""If the man who is unclean does not cleanse himself, that person shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, since he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. Because the water for impurity has not been thrown on him, he is unclean."
Numbers,19,21,"And it shall be a statute forever for them. The one who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and the one who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening."
Numbers,19,22,"And whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean, and anyone who touches it shall be unclean until evening."""
Numbers,20,1,"And the people of Israel, the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed in Kadesh. And Miriam died there and was buried there."
Numbers,20,2,Now there was no water for the congregation. And they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
Numbers,20,3,"And the people quarreled with Moses and said, ""Would that we had perished when our brothers perished before the LORD!"
Numbers,20,4,"Why have you brought the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness, that we should die here, both we and our cattle?"
Numbers,20,5,"And why have you made us come up out of Egypt to bring us to this evil place? It is no place for grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, and there is no water to drink."""
Numbers,20,6,"Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces. And the glory of the LORD appeared to them,"
Numbers,20,7,"and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,20,8,"""Take the staff, and assemble the congregation, you and Aaron your brother, and tell the rock before their eyes to yield its water. So you shall bring water out of the rock for them and give drink to the congregation and their cattle."""
Numbers,20,9,"And Moses took the staff from before the LORD, as he commanded him."
Numbers,20,10,"Then Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, ""Hear now, you rebels: shall we bring water for you out of this rock?"""
Numbers,20,11,"And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice, and water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their livestock."
Numbers,20,12,"And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, ""Because you did not believe in me, to uphold me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them."""
Numbers,20,13,"These are the waters of Meribah, where the people of Israel quarreled with the LORD, and through them he showed himself holy."
Numbers,20,14,"Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom: ""Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the hardship that we have met:"
Numbers,20,15,"how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time. And the Egyptians dealt harshly with us and our fathers."
Numbers,20,16,"And when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. And here we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory."
Numbers,20,17,"Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or vineyard, or drink water from a well. We will go along the King's Highway. We will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory."""
Numbers,20,18,"But Edom said to him, ""You shall not pass through, lest I come out with the sword against you."""
Numbers,20,19,"And the people of Israel said to him, ""We will go up by the highway, and if we drink of your water, I and my livestock, then I will pay for it. Let me only pass through on foot, nothing more."""
Numbers,20,20,"But he said, ""You shall not pass through."" And Edom came out against them with a large army and with a strong force."
Numbers,20,21,"Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory, so Israel turned away from him."
Numbers,20,22,"And they journeyed from Kadesh, and the people of Israel, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor."
Numbers,20,23,"And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor, on the border of the land of Edom,"
Numbers,20,24,"""Let Aaron be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter the land that I have given to the people of Israel, because you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah."
Numbers,20,25,Take Aaron and Eleazar his son and bring them up to Mount Hor.
Numbers,20,26,"And strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son. And Aaron shall be gathered to his people and shall die there."""
Numbers,20,27,Moses did as the LORD commanded. And they went up Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
Numbers,20,28,And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son. And Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
Numbers,20,29,"And when all the congregation saw that Aaron had perished, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days."
Numbers,21,1,"When the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the Negeb, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive."
Numbers,21,2,"And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD and said, ""If you will indeed give this people into my hand, then I will devote their cities to destruction."""
Numbers,21,3,"And the LORD obeyed the voice of Israel and gave over the Canaanites, and they devoted them and their cities to destruction. So the name of the place was called Hormah."
Numbers,21,4,"From Mount Hor they set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. And the people became impatient on the way."
Numbers,21,5,"And the people spoke against God and against Moses, ""Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food."""
Numbers,21,6,"Then the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died."
Numbers,21,7,"And the people came to Moses and said, ""We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you. Pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us."" So Moses prayed for the people."
Numbers,21,8,"And the LORD said to Moses, ""Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live."""
Numbers,21,9,"So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on a pole. And if a serpent bit anyone, he would look at the bronze serpent and live."
Numbers,21,10,And the people of Israel set out and camped in Oboth.
Numbers,21,11,"And they set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness that is opposite Moab, toward the sunrise."
Numbers,21,12,From there they set out and camped in the Valley of Zered.
Numbers,21,13,"From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites."
Numbers,21,14,"Wherefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD, ""Waheb in Suphah, and the valleys of the Arnon,"
Numbers,21,15,"and the slope of the valleys that extends to the seat of Ar, and leans to the border of Moab."""
Numbers,21,16,"And from there they continued to Beer; that is the well of which the LORD said to Moses, ""Gather the people together, so that I may give them water."""
Numbers,21,17,"Then Israel sang this song: ""Spring up, O well!--Sing to it!--"
Numbers,21,18,"the well that the princes dug, that the nobles of the people delved, with the scepter and with their staffs.""And from the wilderness they went on to Mattanah,"
Numbers,21,19,"and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,"
Numbers,21,20,and from Bamoth to the valley lying in the region of Moab by the top of Pisgah that looks down on the desert.
Numbers,21,21,"Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,"
Numbers,21,22,"""Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field or vineyard. We will not drink the water of a well. We will go by the King's Highway until we have passed through your territory."""
Numbers,21,23,But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. He gathered all his people together and went out against Israel to the wilderness and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.
Numbers,21,24,"And Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as to the Ammonites, for the border of the Ammonites was strong."
Numbers,21,25,"And Israel took all these cities, and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages."
Numbers,21,26,"For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon."
Numbers,21,27,"Therefore the ballad singers say, ""Come to Heshbon, let it be built; let the city of Sihon be established."
Numbers,21,28,"For fire came out from Heshbon, flame from the city of Sihon. It devoured Ar of Moab, and swallowed the heights of the Arnon."
Numbers,21,29,"Woe to you, O Moab! You are undone, O people of Chemosh! He has made his sons fugitives, and his daughters captives, to an Amorite king, Sihon."
Numbers,21,30,"So we overthrew them; Heshbon, as far as Dibon, perished; and we laid waste as far as Nophah; fire spread as far as Medeba."""
Numbers,21,31,Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers,21,32,"And Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there."
Numbers,21,33,"Then they turned and went up by the way to Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan came out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei."
Numbers,21,34,"But the LORD said to Moses, ""Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand, and all his people, and his land. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon."""
Numbers,21,35,"So they defeated him and his sons and all his people, until he had no survivor left. And they possessed his land."
Numbers,22,1,Then the people of Israel set out and camped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.
Numbers,22,2,And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
Numbers,22,3,"And Moab was in great dread of the people, because they were many. Moab was overcome with fear of the people of Israel."
Numbers,22,4,"And Moab said to the elders of Midian, ""This horde will now lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field."" So Balak the son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time,"
Numbers,22,5,"sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which is near the River in the land of the people of Amaw, to call him, saying, ""Behold, a people has come out of Egypt. They cover the face of the earth, and they are dwelling opposite me."
Numbers,22,6,"Come now, curse this people for me, since they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them from the land, for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed."""
Numbers,22,7,So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fees for divination in their hand. And they came to Balaam and gave him Balak's message.
Numbers,22,8,"And he said to them, ""Lodge here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, as the LORD speaks to me."" So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam."
Numbers,22,9,"And God came to Balaam and said, ""Who are these men with you?"""
Numbers,22,10,"And Balaam said to God, ""Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, saying,"
Numbers,22,11,"'Behold, a people has come out of Egypt, and it covers the face of the earth. Now come, curse them for me. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them and drive them out.'"""
Numbers,22,12,"God said to Balaam, ""You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed."""
Numbers,22,13,"So Balaam rose in the morning and said to the princes of Balak, ""Go to your own land, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you."""
Numbers,22,14,"So the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak and said, ""Balaam refuses to come with us."""
Numbers,22,15,"Once again Balak sent princes, more in number and more honorable than these."
Numbers,22,16,"And they came to Balaam and said to him, ""Thus says Balak the son of Zippor: 'Let nothing hinder you from coming to me,"
Numbers,22,17,"for I will surely do you great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Come, curse this people for me.'"""
Numbers,22,18,"But Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, ""Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the command of the LORD my God to do less or more."
Numbers,22,19,"So you, too, please stay here tonight, that I may know what more the LORD will say to me."""
Numbers,22,20,"And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, ""If the men have come to call you, rise, go with them; but only do what I tell you."""
Numbers,22,21,So Balaam rose in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab.
Numbers,22,22,"But God's anger was kindled because he went, and the angel of the LORD took his stand in the way as his adversary. Now he was riding on the donkey, and his two servants were with him."
Numbers,22,23,"And the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road, with a drawn sword in his hand. And the donkey turned aside out of the road and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the road."
Numbers,22,24,"Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on either side."
Numbers,22,25,"And when the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pushed against the wall and pressed Balaam's foot against the wall. So he struck her again."
Numbers,22,26,"Then the angel of the LORD went ahead and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left."
Numbers,22,27,"When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam. And Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff."
Numbers,22,28,"Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, ""What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?"""
Numbers,22,29,"And Balaam said to the donkey, ""Because you have made a fool of me. I wish I had a sword in my hand, for then I would kill you."""
Numbers,22,30,"And the donkey said to Balaam, ""Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Is it my habit to treat you this way?"" And he said, ""No."""
Numbers,22,31,"Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his drawn sword in his hand. And he bowed down and fell on his face."
Numbers,22,32,"And the angel of the LORD said to him, ""Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to oppose you because your way is perverse before me."
Numbers,22,33,"The donkey saw me and turned aside before me these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, surely just now I would have killed you and let her live."""
Numbers,22,34,"Then Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, ""I have sinned, for I did not know that you stood in the road against me. Now therefore, if it is evil in your sight, I will turn back."""
Numbers,22,35,"And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, ""Go with the men, but speak only the word that I tell you."" So Balaam went on with the princes of Balak."
Numbers,22,36,"When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, on the border formed by the Arnon, at the extremity of the border."
Numbers,22,37,"And Balak said to Balaam, ""Did I not send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?"""
Numbers,22,38,"Balaam said to Balak, ""Behold, I have come to you! Have I now any power of my own to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that must I speak."""
Numbers,22,39,"Then Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth."
Numbers,22,40,"And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent for Balaam and for the princes who were with him."
Numbers,22,41,"And in the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal, and from there he saw a fraction of the people."
Numbers,23,1,"And Balaam said to Balak, ""Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams."""
Numbers,23,2,Balak did as Balaam had said. And Balak and Balaam offered on each altar a bull and a ram.
Numbers,23,3,"And Balaam said to Balak, ""Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet me, and whatever he shows me I will tell you."" And he went to a bare height,"
Numbers,23,4,"and God met Balaam. And Balaam said to him, ""I have arranged the seven altars and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram."""
Numbers,23,5,"And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth and said, ""Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak."""
Numbers,23,6,"And he returned to him, and behold, he and all the princes of Moab were standing beside his burnt offering."
Numbers,23,7,"And Balaam took up his discourse and said, ""From Aram Balak has brought me, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains: 'Come, curse Jacob for me, and come, denounce Israel!'"
Numbers,23,8,How can I curse whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce whom the LORD has not denounced?
Numbers,23,9,"For from the top of the crags I see him, from the hills I behold him; behold, a people dwelling alone, and not counting itself among the nations!"
Numbers,23,10,"Who can count the dust of Jacob or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright, and let my end be like his!"""
Numbers,23,11,"And Balak said to Balaam, ""What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have done nothing but bless them."""
Numbers,23,12,"And he answered and said, ""Must I not take care to speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?"""
Numbers,23,13,"And Balak said to him, ""Please come with me to another place, from which you may see them. You shall see only a fraction of them and shall not see them all. Then curse them for me from there."""
Numbers,23,14,"And he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,15,"Balaam said to Balak, ""Stand here beside your burnt offering, while I meet the LORD over there."""
Numbers,23,16,"And the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, ""Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak."""
Numbers,23,17,"And he came to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, ""What has the LORD spoken?"""
Numbers,23,18,"And Balaam took up his discourse and said, ""Rise, Balak, and hear; give ear to me, O son of Zippor:"
Numbers,23,19,"God is not man, that he should lie, or a son of man, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?"
Numbers,23,20,"Behold, I received a command to bless: he has blessed, and I cannot revoke it."
Numbers,23,21,"He has not beheld misfortune in Jacob, nor has he seen trouble in Israel. The LORD their God is with them, and the shout of a king is among them."
Numbers,23,22,God brings them out of Egypt and is for them like the horns of the wild ox.
Numbers,23,23,"For there is no enchantment against Jacob, no divination against Israel; now it shall be said of Jacob and Israel, 'What has God wrought!'"
Numbers,23,24,"Behold, a people! As a lioness it rises up and as a lion it lifts itself; it does not lie down until it has devoured the prey and drunk the blood of the slain."""
Numbers,23,25,"And Balak said to Balaam, ""Do not curse them at all, and do not bless them at all."""
Numbers,23,26,"But Balaam answered Balak, ""Did I not tell you, 'All that the LORD says, that I must do'?"""
Numbers,23,27,"And Balak said to Balaam, ""Come now, I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there."""
Numbers,23,28,"So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks the desert."
Numbers,23,29,"And Balaam said to Balak, ""Build for me here seven altars and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams."""
Numbers,23,30,"And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,24,1,"When Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go, as at other times, to look for omens, but set his face toward the wilderness."
Numbers,24,2,"And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel camping tribe by tribe. And the Spirit of God came upon him,"
Numbers,24,3,"and he took up his discourse and said, ""The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,"
Numbers,24,4,"the oracle of him who hears the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down with his eyes uncovered:"
Numbers,24,5,"How lovely are your tents, O Jacob, your encampments, O Israel!"
Numbers,24,6,"Like palm groves that stretch afar, like gardens beside a river, like aloes that the LORD has planted, like cedar trees beside the waters."
Numbers,24,7,"Water shall flow from his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters; his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted."
Numbers,24,8,"God brings him out of Egypt and is for him like the horns of the wild ox; he shall eat up the nations, his adversaries, and shall break their bones in pieces and pierce them through with his arrows."
Numbers,24,9,"He crouched, he lay down like a lion and like a lioness; who will rouse him up? Blessed are those who bless you, and cursed are those who curse you."""
Numbers,24,10,"And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, ""I called you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them these three times."
Numbers,24,11,"Therefore now flee to your own place. I said, 'I will certainly honor you,' but the LORD has held you back from honor."""
Numbers,24,12,"And Balaam said to Balak, ""Did I not tell your messengers whom you sent to me,"
Numbers,24,13,"'If Balak should give me his house full of silver and gold, I would not be able to go beyond the word of the LORD, to do either good or bad of my own will. What the LORD speaks, that will I speak'?"
Numbers,24,14,"And now, behold, I am going to my people. Come, I will let you know what this people will do to your people in the latter days."""
Numbers,24,15,"And he took up his discourse and said, ""The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,"
Numbers,24,16,"the oracle of him who hears the words of God, and knows the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down with his eyes uncovered:"
Numbers,24,17,"I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near: a star shall come out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel; it shall crush the forehead of Moab and break down all the sons of Sheth."
Numbers,24,18,"Edom shall be dispossessed; Seir also, his enemies, shall be dispossessed. Israel is doing valiantly."
Numbers,24,19,"And one from Jacob shall exercise dominion and destroy the survivors of cities!"""
Numbers,24,20,"Then he looked on Amalek and took up his discourse and said, ""Amalek was the first among the nations, but its end is utter destruction."""
Numbers,24,21,"And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his discourse and said, ""Enduring is your dwelling place, and your nest is set in the rock."
Numbers,24,22,"Nevertheless, Kain shall be burned when Asshur takes you away captive."""
Numbers,24,23,"And he took up his discourse and said, ""Alas, who shall live when God does this?"
Numbers,24,24,"But ships shall come from Kittim and shall afflict Asshur and Eber; and he too shall come to utter destruction."""
Numbers,24,25,Then Balaam rose and went back to his place. And Balak also went his way.
Numbers,25,1,"While Israel lived in Shittim, the people began to whore with the daughters of Moab."
Numbers,25,2,"These invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods."
Numbers,25,3,So Israel yoked himself to Baal of Peor. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.
Numbers,25,4,"And the LORD said to Moses, ""Take all the chiefs of the people and hang them in the sun before the LORD, that the fierce anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel."""
Numbers,25,5,"And Moses said to the judges of Israel, ""Each of you kill those of his men who have yoked themselves to Baal of Peor."""
Numbers,25,6,"And behold, one of the people of Israel came and brought a Midianite woman to his family, in the sight of Moses and in the sight of the whole congregation of the people of Israel, while they were weeping in the entrance of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,25,7,"When Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose and left the congregation and took a spear in his hand"
Numbers,25,8,"and went after the man of Israel into the chamber and pierced both of them, the man of Israel and the woman through her belly. Thus the plague on the people of Israel was stopped."
Numbers,25,9,"Nevertheless, those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand."
Numbers,25,10,"And the LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,25,11,"""Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, has turned back my wrath from the people of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I did not consume the people of Israel in my jealousy."
Numbers,25,12,"Therefore say, 'Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace,"
Numbers,25,13,"and it shall be to him and to his descendants after him the covenant of a perpetual priesthood, because he was jealous for his God and made atonement for the people of Israel.'"""
Numbers,25,14,"The name of the slain man of Israel, who was killed with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, chief of a father's house belonging to the Simeonites."
Numbers,25,15,"And the name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi the daughter of Zur, who was the tribal head of a father's house in Midian."
Numbers,25,16,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,25,17,"""Harass the Midianites and strike them down,"
Numbers,25,18,"for they have harassed you with their wiles, with which they beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the chief of Midian, their sister, who was killed on the day of the plague on account of Peor."""
Numbers,26,1,"After the plague, the LORD said to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron, the priest,"
Numbers,26,2,"""Take a census of all the congregation of the people of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' houses, all in Israel who are able to go to war."""
Numbers,26,3,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,"

Numbers,30,16,These are the statutes that the LORD commanded Moses about a man and his wife and about a father and his daughter while she is in her youth within her father's house.
Numbers,31,1,"The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"

Numbers,31,12,"Then they brought the captives and the plunder and the spoil to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the people of Israel, at the camp on the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho."
Numbers,31,13,Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation went to meet them outside the camp.
Numbers,31,14,"And Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, who had come from service in the war."

Numbers,31,23,"everything that can stand the fire, you shall pass through the fire, and it shall be clean. Nevertheless, it shall also be purified with the water for impurity. And whatever cannot stand the fire, you shall pass through the water."

Numbers,31,28,"And levy for the LORD a tribute from the men of war who went out to battle, one out of five hundred, of the people and of the oxen and of the donkeys and of the flocks."
Numbers,31,29,Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as a contribution to the LORD.
Numbers,31,30,"And from the people of Israel's half you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the people, of the oxen, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the cattle, and give them to the Levites who keep guard over the tabernacle of the LORD."""

Numbers,31,34,"61,000 donkeys,"
Numbers,31,35,"and 32,000 persons in all, women who had not known man by lying with him."
Numbers,31,36,"And the half, the portion of those who had gone out in the army, numbered 337,500 sheep,"
Numbers,31,37,and the LORD's tribute of sheep was 675.
Numbers,31,38,"The cattle were 36,000, of which the LORD's tribute was 72."
Numbers,31,39,"The donkeys were 30,500, of which the LORD's tribute was 61."
Numbers,31,40,"The persons were 16,000, of which the LORD's tribute was 32 persons."
Numbers,31,41,"And Moses gave the tribute, which was the contribution for the LORD, to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,31,42,"From the people of Israel's half, which Moses separated from that of the men who had served in the army--"

Numbers,31,44,"36,000 cattle,"
Numbers,31,45,"and 30,500 donkeys,"
Numbers,31,46,"and 16,000 persons--"
Numbers,31,47,"from the people of Israel's half Moses took one of every 50, both of persons and of beasts, and gave them to the Levites who kept guard over the tabernacle of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,31,48,"Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, came near to Moses"
Numbers,31,49,"and said to Moses, ""Your servants have counted the men of war who are under our command, and there is not a man missing from us."
Numbers,31,50,"And we have brought the LORD's offering, what each man found, articles of gold, armlets and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and beads, to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD."""
Numbers,31,51,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest received from them the gold, all crafted articles."
Numbers,31,52,"And all the gold of the contribution that they presented to the LORD, from the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, was 16,750 shekels."
Numbers,31,53,(The men in the army had each taken plunder for himself.)
Numbers,31,54,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, as a memorial for the people of Israel before the LORD."
Numbers,32,1,"Now the people of Reuben and the people of Gad had a very great number of livestock. And they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, and behold, the place was a place for livestock."
Numbers,32,2,"So the people of Gad and the people of Reuben came and said to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the chiefs of the congregation,"
Numbers,32,3,"""Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,"
Numbers,32,4,"the land that the LORD struck down before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock."""
Numbers,32,5,"And they said, ""If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession. Do not take us across the Jordan."""
Numbers,32,6,"But Moses said to the people of Gad and to the people of Reuben, ""Shall your brothers go to the war while you sit here?"
Numbers,32,7,Why will you discourage the heart of the people of Israel from going over into the land that the LORD has given them?
Numbers,32,8,"Your fathers did this, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land."
Numbers,32,9,"For when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the people of Israel from going into the land that the LORD had given them."
Numbers,32,10,"And the LORD's anger was kindled on that day, and he swore, saying,"
Numbers,32,11,"'Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not wholly followed me,"
Numbers,32,12,"none except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have wholly followed the LORD.'"
Numbers,32,13,"And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD was gone."
Numbers,32,14,"And behold, you have risen in your fathers' place, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more the fierce anger of the LORD against Israel!"
Numbers,32,15,"For if you turn away from following him, he will again abandon them in the wilderness, and you will destroy all this people."""
Numbers,32,16,"Then they came near to him and said, ""We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones,"
Numbers,32,17,"but we will take up arms, ready to go before the people of Israel, until we have brought them to their place. And our little ones shall live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land."
Numbers,32,18,We will not return to our homes until each of the people of Israel has gained his inheritance.
Numbers,32,19,"For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan to the east."""
Numbers,32,20,"So Moses said to them, ""If you will do this, if you will take up arms to go before the LORD for the war,"
Numbers,32,21,"and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before the LORD, until he has driven out his enemies from before him"
Numbers,32,22,"and the land is subdued before the LORD; then after that you shall return and be free of obligation to the LORD and to Israel, and this land shall be your possession before the LORD."
Numbers,32,23,"But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD, and be sure your sin will find you out."
Numbers,32,24,"Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do what you have promised."""
Numbers,32,25,"And the people of Gad and the people of Reuben said to Moses, ""Your servants will do as my lord commands."
Numbers,32,26,"Our little ones, our wives, our livestock, and all our cattle, shall remain there in the cities of Gilead,"
Numbers,32,27,"but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord orders."""
Numbers,32,28,So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel.
Numbers,32,29,"And Moses said to them, ""If the people of Gad and the people of Reuben, every man who is armed to battle before the LORD, will pass with you over the Jordan and the land shall be subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession."
Numbers,32,30,"However, if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan."""
Numbers,32,31,"And the people of Gad and the people of Reuben answered, ""What the LORD has said to your servants, we will do."
Numbers,32,32,"We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan."""
Numbers,32,33,"And Moses gave to them, to the people of Gad and to the people of Reuben and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land and its cities with their territories, the cities of the land throughout the country."
Numbers,32,34,"And the people of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,"
Numbers,32,35,"Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,"
Numbers,32,36,"Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran, fortified cities, and folds for sheep."
Numbers,32,37,"And the people of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,"
Numbers,32,38,"Nebo, and Baal-meon (their names were changed), and Sibmah. And they gave other names to the cities that they built."
Numbers,32,39,"And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and captured it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it."
Numbers,32,40,"And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he settled in it."
Numbers,32,41,"And Jair the son of Manasseh went and captured their villages, and called them Havvoth-jair."
Numbers,32,42,"And Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name."
Numbers,33,1,"These are the stages of the people of Israel, when they went out of the land of Egypt by their companies under the leadership of Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,33,2,"Moses wrote down their starting places, stage by stage, by command of the LORD, and these are their stages according to their starting places."
Numbers,33,3,"They set out from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month. On the day after the Passover, the people of Israel went out triumphantly in the sight of all the Egyptians,"
Numbers,33,4,"while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, whom the LORD had struck down among them. On their gods also the LORD executed judgments."

Deuteronomy,1,33,"who went before you in the way to seek you out a place to pitch your tents, in fire by night and in the cloud by day, to show you by what way you should go."
Deuteronomy,1,34,"""And the LORD heard your words and was angered, and he swore,"
Deuteronomy,1,35,"'Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers,"
Deuteronomy,1,36,"except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and to him and to his children I will give the land on which he has trodden, because he has wholly followed the LORD!'"
Deuteronomy,1,37,"Even with me the LORD was angry on your account and said, 'You also shall not go in there."
Deuteronomy,1,38,"Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it."
Deuteronomy,1,39,"And as for your little ones, who you said would become a prey, and your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there. And to them I will give it, and they shall possess it."
Deuteronomy,1,40,"But as for you, turn, and journey into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea.'"
Deuteronomy,1,41,"""Then you answered me, 'We have sinned against the LORD. We ourselves will go up and fight, just as the LORD our God commanded us.' And every one of you fastened on his weapons of war and thought it easy to go up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"And the LORD said to me, 'Say to them, Do not go up or fight, for I am not in your midst, lest you be defeated before your enemies.'"
Deuteronomy,1,43,"So I spoke to you, and you would not listen; but you rebelled against the command of the LORD and presumptuously went up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,44,Then the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do and beat you down in Seir as far as Hormah.
Deuteronomy,1,45,"And you returned and wept before the LORD, but the LORD did not listen to your voice or give ear to you."
Deuteronomy,1,46,"So you remained at Kadesh many days, the days that you remained there."
Deuteronomy,2,1,"""Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea, as the LORD told me. And for many days we traveled around Mount Seir."
Deuteronomy,2,2,"Then the LORD said to me,"
Deuteronomy,2,3,'You have been traveling around this mountain country long enough. Turn northward
Deuteronomy,2,4,"and command the people, ""You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So be very careful."
Deuteronomy,2,5,"Do not contend with them, for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession."
Deuteronomy,2,6,"You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat, and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink."
Deuteronomy,2,7,"For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He knows your going through this great wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing.""'"
Deuteronomy,2,8,"So we went on, away from our brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road from Elath and Ezion-geber.""And we turned and went in the direction of the wilderness of Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"And the LORD said to me, 'Do not harass Moab or contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the people of Lot for a possession.'"
Deuteronomy,2,10,"(The Emim formerly lived there, a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim."
Deuteronomy,2,11,"Like the Anakim they are also counted as Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim."
Deuteronomy,2,12,"The Horites also lived in Seir formerly, but the people of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, as Israel did to the land of their possession, which the LORD gave to them.)"
Deuteronomy,2,13,'Now rise up and go over the brook Zered.' So we went over the brook Zered.
Deuteronomy,2,14,"And the time from our leaving Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation, that is, the men of war, had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them."
Deuteronomy,2,15,"For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from the camp, until they had perished."
Deuteronomy,2,16,"""So as soon as all the men of war had perished and were dead from among the people,"
Deuteronomy,2,17,"the LORD said to me,"
Deuteronomy,2,18,'Today you are to cross the border of Moab at Ar.
Deuteronomy,2,19,"And when you approach the territory of the people of Ammon, do not harass them or contend with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.'"
Deuteronomy,2,20,(It is also counted as a land of Rephaim. Rephaim formerly lived there--but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim--
Deuteronomy,2,21,"a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim; but the LORD destroyed them before the Ammonites, and they dispossessed them and settled in their place,"
Deuteronomy,2,22,"as he did for the people of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites before them and they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day."
Deuteronomy,2,23,"As for the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their place.)"
Deuteronomy,2,24,"'Rise up, set out on your journey and go over the Valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession, and contend with him in battle."
Deuteronomy,2,25,"This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.'"
Deuteronomy,2,26,"""So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon the king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,27,'Let me pass through your land. I will go only by the road; I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left.
Deuteronomy,2,28,"You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink. Only let me pass through on foot,"
Deuteronomy,2,29,"as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I go over the Jordan into the land that the LORD our God is giving to us.'"
Deuteronomy,2,30,"But Sihon the king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him, for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might give him into your hand, as he is this day."
Deuteronomy,2,31,"And the LORD said to me, 'Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to take possession, that you may occupy his land.'"
Deuteronomy,2,32,"Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz."
Deuteronomy,2,33,"And the LORD our God gave him over to us, and we defeated him and his sons and all his people."
Deuteronomy,2,34,"And we captured all his cities at that time and devoted to destruction every city, men, women, and children. We left no survivors."
Deuteronomy,2,35,"Only the livestock we took as spoil for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities that we captured."
Deuteronomy,2,36,"From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. The LORD our God gave all into our hands."
Deuteronomy,2,37,"Only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not draw near, that is, to all the banks of the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, whatever the LORD our God had forbidden us."
Deuteronomy,3,1,"""Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"But the LORD said to me, 'Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.'"
Deuteronomy,3,3,"So the LORD our God gave into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people, and we struck him down until he had no survivor left."
Deuteronomy,3,4,"And we took all his cities at that time--there was not a city that we did not take from them--sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,5,"All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides very many unwalled villages."
Deuteronomy,3,6,"And we devoted them to destruction, as we did to Sihon the king of Heshbon, devoting to destruction every city, men, women, and children."
Deuteronomy,3,7,But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as our plunder.
Deuteronomy,3,8,"So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon"
Deuteronomy,3,9,"(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, while the Amorites call it Senir),"
Deuteronomy,3,10,"all the cities of the tableland and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,11,"(For only Og the king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bed was a bed of iron. Is it not in Rabbah of the Ammonites? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, according to the common cubit. )"
Deuteronomy,3,12,"""When we took possession of this land at that time, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory beginning at Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities."
Deuteronomy,3,13,"The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, that is, all the region of Argob, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (All that portion of Bashan is called the land of Rephaim."
Deuteronomy,3,14,"Jair the Manassite took all the region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called the villages after his own name, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.)"
Deuteronomy,3,15,"To Machir I gave Gilead,"
Deuteronomy,3,16,"and to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the Valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a border, as far over as the river Jabbok, the border of the Ammonites;"
Deuteronomy,3,17,"the Arabah also, with the Jordan as the border, from Chinnereth as far as the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east."
Deuteronomy,3,18,"""And I commanded you at that time, saying, 'The LORD your God has given you this land to possess. All your men of valor shall cross over armed before your brothers, the people of Israel."
Deuteronomy,3,19,"Only your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in the cities that I have given you,"
Deuteronomy,3,20,"until the LORD gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also occupy the land that the LORD your God gives them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his possession which I have given you.'"
Deuteronomy,3,21,"And I commanded Joshua at that time, 'Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. So will the LORD do to all the kingdoms into which you are crossing."
Deuteronomy,3,22,"You shall not fear them, for it is the LORD your God who fights for you.'"
Deuteronomy,3,23,"""And I pleaded with the LORD at that time, saying,"
Deuteronomy,3,24,"'O Lord GOD, you have only begun to show your servant your greatness and your mighty hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as yours?"
Deuteronomy,3,25,"Please let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon.'"
Deuteronomy,3,26,"But the LORD was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me. And the LORD said to me, 'Enough from you; do not speak to me of this matter again."
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward, and look at it with your eyes, for you shall not go over this Jordan."
Deuteronomy,3,28,"But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he shall go over at the head of this people, and he shall put them in possession of the land that you shall see.'"
Deuteronomy,3,29,So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,"""And now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the rules that I am teaching you, and do them, that you may live, and go in and take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you."
Deuteronomy,4,2,"You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you."
Deuteronomy,4,3,"Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal-peor, for the LORD your God destroyed from among you all the men who followed the Baal of Peor."
Deuteronomy,4,4,But you who held fast to the LORD your God are all alive today.
Deuteronomy,4,5,"See, I have taught you statutes and rules, as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should do them in the land that you are entering to take possession of it."
Deuteronomy,4,6,"Keep them and do them, for that will be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who, when they hear all these statutes, will say, 'Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.'"
Deuteronomy,4,7,"For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as the LORD our God is to us, whenever we call upon him?"
Deuteronomy,4,8,"And what great nation is there, that has statutes and rules so righteous as all this law that I set before you today?"
Deuteronomy,4,9,"""Only take care, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things that your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life. Make them known to your children and your children's children--"
Deuteronomy,4,10,"how on the day that you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, the LORD said to me, 'Gather the people to me, that I may let them hear my words, so that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children so.'"
Deuteronomy,4,11,"And you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, while the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, wrapped in darkness, cloud, and gloom."
Deuteronomy,4,12,"Then the LORD spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of words, but saw no form; there was only a voice."
Deuteronomy,4,13,"And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, that is, the Ten Commandments, and he wrote them on two tablets of stone."
Deuteronomy,4,14,"And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and rules, that you might do them in the land that you are going over to possess."
Deuteronomy,4,15,"""Therefore watch yourselves very carefully. Since you saw no form on the day that the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire,"
Deuteronomy,4,16,"beware lest you act corruptly by making a carved image for yourselves, in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,"
Deuteronomy,4,17,"the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air,"
Deuteronomy,4,18,"the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth."
Deuteronomy,4,19,"And beware lest you raise your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, you be drawn away and bow down to them and serve them, things that the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven."
Deuteronomy,4,20,"But the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be a people of his own inheritance, as you are this day."
Deuteronomy,4,21,"Furthermore, the LORD was angry with me because of you, and he swore that I should not cross the Jordan, and that I should not enter the good land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance."
Deuteronomy,4,22,For I must die in this land; I must not go over the Jordan. But you shall go over and take possession of that good land.
Deuteronomy,4,23,"Take care, lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make a carved image, the form of anything that the LORD your God has forbidden you."
Deuteronomy,4,24,"For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God."
Deuteronomy,4,25,"""When you father children and children's children, and have grown old in the land, if you act corruptly by making a carved image in the form of anything, and by doing what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God, so as to provoke him to anger,"
Deuteronomy,4,26,"I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess. You will not live long in it, but will be utterly destroyed."
Deuteronomy,4,27,"And the LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the LORD will drive you."
Deuteronomy,4,28,"And there you will serve gods of wood and stone, the work of human hands, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell."
Deuteronomy,4,29,"But from there you will seek the LORD your God and you will find him, if you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul."
Deuteronomy,4,30,"When you are in tribulation, and all these things come upon you in the latter days, you will return to the LORD your God and obey his voice."
Deuteronomy,4,31,For the LORD your God is a merciful God. He will not leave you or destroy you or forget the covenant with your fathers that he swore to them.
Deuteronomy,4,32,"""For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from one end of heaven to the other, whether such a great thing as this has ever happened or was ever heard of."
Deuteronomy,4,33,"Did any people ever hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and still live?"
Deuteronomy,4,34,"Or has any god ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, and by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by great deeds of terror, all of which the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?"
Deuteronomy,4,35,"To you it was shown, that you might know that the LORD is God; there is no other besides him."
Deuteronomy,4,36,"Out of heaven he let you hear his voice, that he might discipline you. And on earth he let you see his great fire, and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire."
Deuteronomy,4,37,"And because he loved your fathers and chose their offspring after them and brought you out of Egypt with his own presence, by his great power,"
Deuteronomy,4,38,"driving out before you nations greater and mightier than yourselves, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is this day,"
Deuteronomy,4,39,"know therefore today, and lay it to your heart, that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other."
Deuteronomy,4,40,"Therefore you shall keep his statutes and his commandments, which I command you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land that the LORD your God is giving you for all time."""
Deuteronomy,4,41,"Then Moses set apart three cities in the east beyond the Jordan,"
Deuteronomy,4,42,"that the manslayer might flee there, anyone who kills his neighbor unintentionally, without being at enmity with him in time past; he may flee to one of these cities and save his life:"
Deuteronomy,4,43,"Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland for the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites."
Deuteronomy,4,44,This is the law that Moses set before the people of Israel.
Deuteronomy,4,45,"These are the testimonies, the statutes, and the rules, which Moses spoke to the people of Israel when they came out of Egypt,"
Deuteronomy,4,46,"beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the people of Israel defeated when they came out of Egypt."

Deuteronomy,5,1,"And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, ""Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the rules that I speak in your hearing today, and you shall learn them and be careful to do them."
Deuteronomy,5,2,The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
Deuteronomy,5,3,"Not with our fathers did the LORD make this covenant, but with us, who are all of us here alive today."
Deuteronomy,5,4,"The LORD spoke with you face to face at the mountain, out of the midst of the fire,"
Deuteronomy,5,5,"while I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the LORD. For you were afraid because of the fire, and you did not go up into the mountain. He said:"

Deuteronomy,5,7,"""'You shall have no other gods before me."

Deuteronomy,7,6,"""For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth."
Deuteronomy,7,7,"It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples,"
Deuteronomy,7,8,"but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,7,9,"Know therefore that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations,"
Deuteronomy,7,10,"and repays to their face those who hate him, by destroying them. He will not be slack with one who hates him. He will repay him to his face."
Deuteronomy,7,11,You shall therefore be careful to do the commandment and the statutes and the rules that I command you today.
Deuteronomy,7,12,"""And because you listen to these rules and keep and do them, the LORD your God will keep with you the covenant and the steadfast love that he swore to your fathers."
Deuteronomy,7,13,"He will love you, bless you, and multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your wine and your oil, the increase of your herds and the young of your flock, in the land that he swore to your fathers to give you."
Deuteronomy,7,14,You shall be blessed above all peoples. There shall not be male or female barren among you or among your livestock.
Deuteronomy,7,15,"And the LORD will take away from you all sickness, and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you knew, will he inflict on you, but he will lay them on all who hate you."
Deuteronomy,7,16,"And you shall consume all the peoples that the LORD your God will give over to you. Your eye shall not pity them, neither shall you serve their gods, for that would be a snare to you."
Deuteronomy,7,17,"""If you say in your heart, 'These nations are greater than I. How can I dispossess them?'"
Deuteronomy,7,18,"you shall not be afraid of them but you shall remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt,"
Deuteronomy,7,19,"the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which the LORD your God brought you out. So will the LORD your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid."
Deuteronomy,7,20,"Moreover, the LORD your God will send hornets among them, until those who are left and hide themselves from you are destroyed."
Deuteronomy,7,21,"You shall not be in dread of them, for the LORD your God is in your midst, a great and awesome God."
Deuteronomy,7,22,"The LORD your God will clear away these nations before you little by little. You may not make an end of them at once, lest the wild beasts grow too numerous for you."
Deuteronomy,7,23,"But the LORD your God will give them over to you and throw them into great confusion, until they are destroyed."
Deuteronomy,7,24,"And he will give their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name perish from under heaven. No one shall be able to stand against you until you have destroyed them."
Deuteronomy,7,25,"The carved images of their gods you shall burn with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them or take it for yourselves, lest you be ensnared by it, for it is an abomination to the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,7,26,"And you shall not bring an abominable thing into your house and become devoted to destruction like it. You shall utterly detest and abhor it, for it is devoted to destruction."
Deuteronomy,8,1,"""The whole commandment that I command you today you shall be careful to do, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land that the LORD swore to give to your fathers."
Deuteronomy,8,2,"And you shall remember the whole way that the LORD your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not."
Deuteronomy,8,3,"And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD."
Deuteronomy,8,4,Your clothing did not wear out on you and your foot did not swell these forty years.
Deuteronomy,8,5,"Know then in your heart that, as a man disciplines his son, the LORD your God disciplines you."
Deuteronomy,8,6,So you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him.
Deuteronomy,8,7,"For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing out in the valleys and hills,"
Deuteronomy,8,8,"a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey,"
Deuteronomy,8,9,"a land in which you will eat bread without scarcity, in which you will lack nothing, a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper."
Deuteronomy,8,10,"And you shall eat and be full, and you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land he has given you."
Deuteronomy,8,11,"""Take care lest you forget the LORD your God by not keeping his commandments and his rules and his statutes, which I command you today,"
Deuteronomy,8,12,"lest, when you have eaten and are full and have built good houses and live in them,"
Deuteronomy,8,13,"and when your herds and flocks multiply and your silver and gold is multiplied and all that you have is multiplied,"
Deuteronomy,8,14,"then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery,"
Deuteronomy,8,15,"who led you through the great and terrifying wilderness, with its fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water, who brought you water out of the flinty rock,"
Deuteronomy,8,16,"who fed you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers did not know, that he might humble you and test you, to do you good in the end."
Deuteronomy,8,17,"Beware lest you say in your heart, 'My power and the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth.'"
Deuteronomy,8,18,"You shall remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your fathers, as it is this day."
Deuteronomy,8,19,"And if you forget the LORD your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, I solemnly warn you today that you shall surely perish."
Deuteronomy,8,20,"Like the nations that the LORD makes to perish before you, so shall you perish, because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,9,1,"""Hear, O Israel: you are to cross over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves, cities great and fortified up to heaven,"
Deuteronomy,9,2,"a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard it said, 'Who can stand before the sons of Anak?'"
Deuteronomy,9,3,"Know therefore today that he who goes over before you as a consuming fire is the LORD your God. He will destroy them and subdue them before you. So you shall drive them out and make them perish quickly, as the LORD has promised you."
Deuteronomy,9,4,"""Do not say in your heart, after the LORD your God has thrust them out before you, 'It is because of my righteousness that the LORD has brought me in to possess this land,' whereas it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is driving them out before you."
Deuteronomy,9,5,"Not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart are you going in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God is driving them out from before you, and that he may confirm the word that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
Deuteronomy,9,6,"""Know, therefore, that the LORD your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you are a stubborn people."
Deuteronomy,9,7,"Remember and do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD."
Deuteronomy,9,8,"Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you."
Deuteronomy,9,9,"When I went up the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water."
Deuteronomy,9,10,"And the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them were all the words that the LORD had spoken with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly."
Deuteronomy,9,11,"And at the end of forty days and forty nights the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant."
Deuteronomy,9,12,"Then the LORD said to me, 'Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them; they have made themselves a metal image.'"
Deuteronomy,9,13,"""Furthermore, the LORD said to me, 'I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stubborn people."
Deuteronomy,9,14,"Let me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.'"
Deuteronomy,9,15,"So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands."
Deuteronomy,9,16,"And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the LORD your God. You had made yourselves a golden calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you."
Deuteronomy,9,17,So I took hold of the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes.
Deuteronomy,9,18,"Then I lay prostrate before the LORD as before, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all the sin that you had committed, in doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke him to anger."
Deuteronomy,9,19,"For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure that the LORD bore against you, so that he was ready to destroy you. But the LORD listened to me that time also."
Deuteronomy,9,20,And the LORD was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to destroy him. And I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
Deuteronomy,9,21,"Then I took the sinful thing, the calf that you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. And I threw the dust of it into the brook that ran down from the mountain."
Deuteronomy,9,22,"""At Taberah also, and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked the LORD to wrath."
Deuteronomy,9,23,"And when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, 'Go up and take possession of the land that I have given you,' then you rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God and did not believe him or obey his voice."
Deuteronomy,9,24,You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.
Deuteronomy,9,25,"""So I lay prostrate before the LORD for these forty days and forty nights, because the LORD had said he would destroy you."
Deuteronomy,9,26,"And I prayed to the LORD, 'O Lord GOD, destroy not your people and your heritage, whom you have redeemed through your greatness, whom you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand."
Deuteronomy,9,27,"Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not regard the stubbornness of this people, or their wickedness or their sin,"
Deuteronomy,9,28,"lest the land from which you brought us say, ""Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness."""
Deuteronomy,9,29,"For they are your people and your heritage, whom you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.'"
Deuteronomy,10,1,"""At that time the LORD said to me, 'Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to me on the mountain and make an ark of wood."
Deuteronomy,10,2,"And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets that you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.'"
Deuteronomy,10,3,"So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two tablets of stone like the first, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand."
Deuteronomy,10,4,"And he wrote on the tablets, in the same writing as before, the Ten Commandments that the LORD had spoken to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly. And the LORD gave them to me."
Deuteronomy,10,5,"Then I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark that I had made. And there they are, as the LORD commanded me."""
Deuteronomy,10,6,"(The people of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried. And his son Eleazar ministered as priest in his place."
Deuteronomy,10,7,"From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with brooks of water."
Deuteronomy,10,8,"At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD to stand before the LORD to minister to him and to bless in his name, to this day."
Deuteronomy,10,9,"Therefore Levi has no portion or inheritance with his brothers. The LORD is his inheritance, as the LORD your God said to him.)"
Deuteronomy,10,10,"""I myself stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights, and the LORD listened to me that time also. The LORD was unwilling to destroy you."
Deuteronomy,10,11,"And the LORD said to me, 'Arise, go on your journey at the head of the people, so that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give them.'"
Deuteronomy,10,12,"""And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,"
Deuteronomy,10,13,"and to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD, which I am commanding you today for your good?"
Deuteronomy,10,14,"Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth with all that is in it."
Deuteronomy,10,15,"Yet the LORD set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day."
Deuteronomy,10,16,"Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn."
Deuteronomy,10,17,"For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe."
Deuteronomy,10,18,"He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing."
Deuteronomy,10,19,"Love the sojourner, therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,10,20,"You shall fear the LORD your God. You shall serve him and hold fast to him, and by his name you shall swear."
Deuteronomy,10,21,"He is your praise. He is your God, who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen."
Deuteronomy,10,22,"Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven."
Deuteronomy,11,1,"""You shall therefore love the LORD your God and keep his charge, his statutes, his rules, and his commandments always."
Deuteronomy,11,2,"And consider today (since I am not speaking to your children who have not known or seen it), consider the discipline of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand and his outstretched arm,"
Deuteronomy,11,3,"his signs and his deeds that he did in Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land,"
Deuteronomy,11,4,"and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and to their chariots, how he made the water of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD has destroyed them to this day,"
Deuteronomy,11,5,"and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place,"
Deuteronomy,11,6,"and what he did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, son of Reuben, how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel."
Deuteronomy,11,7,For your eyes have seen all the great work of the LORD that he did.
Deuteronomy,11,8,"""You shall therefore keep the whole commandment that I command you today, that you may be strong, and go in and take possession of the land that you are going over to possess,"
Deuteronomy,11,9,"and that you may live long in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Deuteronomy,11,10,"For the land that you are entering to take possession of it is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and irrigated it, like a garden of vegetables."
Deuteronomy,11,11,"But the land that you are going over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, which drinks water by the rain from heaven,"
Deuteronomy,11,12,"a land that the LORD your God cares for. The eyes of the LORD your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year to the end of the year."
Deuteronomy,11,13,"""And if you will indeed obey my commandments that I command you today, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,"
Deuteronomy,11,14,"he will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the later rain, that you may gather in your grain and your wine and your oil."
Deuteronomy,11,15,"And he will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full."
Deuteronomy,11,16,"Take care lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them;"
Deuteronomy,11,17,"then the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and he will shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain, and the land will yield no fruit, and you will perish quickly off the good land that the LORD is giving you."
Deuteronomy,11,18,"""You shall therefore lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes."

Deuteronomy,11,21,"that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth."
Deuteronomy,11,22,"For if you will be careful to do all this commandment that I command you to do, loving the LORD your God, walking in all his ways, and holding fast to him,"
Deuteronomy,11,23,"then the LORD will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves."

Deuteronomy,22,22,"""If a man is found lying with the wife of another man, both of them shall die, the man who lay with the woman, and the woman. So you shall purge the evil from Israel."
Deuteronomy,22,23,"""If there is a betrothed virgin, and a man meets her in the city and lies with her,"
Deuteronomy,22,24,"then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbor's wife. So you shall purge the evil from your midst."
