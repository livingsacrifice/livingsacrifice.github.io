Deuteronomy,29,15,But with future Israelites who do not stand here with us today before the Lord our God as well as with those who are here with us this day.
Deuteronomy,29,16,You know how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we came through the midst of the nations you crossed.
Deuteronomy,29,17,And you have seen their abominations and their idols of wood and stone of silver and gold which were among them.
Deuteronomy,29,18,Beware lest there should be among you a man or woman or family or tribe whose [mind and] heart turns away this day from the Lord our God to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a [poisonous] root that bears gall and wormwood
Deuteronomy,29,19,And lest when he hears the words of this curse and oath he flatters and congratulates himself in his [mind and] heart saying I shall have peace and safety though I walk in the stubbornness of my [mind and] heart [bringing down a hurricane of destruction] and sweep away the watered land with the dry.
Deuteronomy,29,20,The Lord will not pardon him but then the anger of the Lord and His jealousy will smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall settle on him; the Lord will blot out his very name from under the heavens.
Deuteronomy,29,21,And the Lord will single him out for ruin and destruction from all the tribes of Israel according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this Book of the Law
Deuteronomy,29,22,So that the next generation your children who rise up after you and the foreigner who shall come from a distant land shall say when they see the plagues of this land and the diseases with which the Lord has made it sick--
Deuteronomy,29,23,The whole land is brimstone and salt and a burned waste not sown or bearing anything where no grass can take root like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah with Admah and Zeboiim which the Lord overthrew in His anger and wrath--
Deuteronomy,29,24,Even all the nations shall say Why has the Lord done thus to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?
Deuteronomy,29,25,Then men shall say Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord the God of their fathers which He made with them when He brought them forth out of the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy,29,26,For they went and served other gods and worshiped them gods they knew not and that He had not given to them.
Deuteronomy,29,27,So the anger of the Lord was kindled against this land bringing upon it all the curses that are written in this book.
Deuteronomy,29,28,And the Lord rooted them out of their land in anger and in wrath and in great indignation and cast them into another land as it is this day.
Deuteronomy,29,29,The secret things belong unto the Lord our God but the things which are revealed belong to us and to our children forever that we may do all of the words of this law.
Deuteronomy,30,1,AND WHEN all these things have come upon you the blessings and the curses which I have set before you and you shall call them to mind among all the nations where the Lord your God has driven you
Deuteronomy,30,2,And shall return to the Lord your God and obey His voice according to all that I command you today you and your children with all your [mind and] heart and with all your being
Deuteronomy,30,3,Then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion upon you and will gather you again from all the nations where He has scattered you.
Deuteronomy,30,4,Even if any of your dispersed are in the uttermost parts of the heavens from there the Lord your God will gather you and from there will He bring you.
Deuteronomy,30,5,And the Lord your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed and you shall possess it; and He will do you good and multiply you above your fathers.
Deuteronomy,30,6,And the Lord your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants to love the Lord your God with all your [mind and] heart and with all your being that you may live.
Deuteronomy,30,7,And the Lord your God will put all these curses upon your enemies and on those who hate you who persecute you.
Deuteronomy,30,8,And you shall return and obey the voice of the Lord and do all His commandments which I command you today.
Deuteronomy,30,9,And the Lord your God will make you abundantly prosperous in every work of your hand in the fruit of your body of your cattle of your land for good; for the Lord will again delight in prospering you as He took delight in your fathers
Deuteronomy,30,10,If you obey the voice of the Lord your God to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this Book of the Law and if you turn to the Lord your God with all your [mind and] heart and with all your being.
Deuteronomy,30,11,For this commandment which I command you this day is not too difficult for you nor is it far off.
Deuteronomy,30,12,It is not [a secret laid up] in heaven that you should say Who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it to us that we may hear and do it?
Deuteronomy,30,13,Neither is it beyond the sea that you should say Who shall go over the sea for us and bring it to us that we may hear and do it?
Deuteronomy,30,14,But the word is very near you in your mouth and in your mind and in your heart so that you can do it.
Deuteronomy,30,15,See I have set before you this day life and good and death and evil.
Deuteronomy,30,16,[If you obey the commandments of the Lord your God which] I command you today to love the Lord your God to walk in His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His ordinances then you shall live and multiply and the Lord your God will bless you in the land into which you go to possess.
Deuteronomy,30,17,But if your [mind and] heart turn away and you will not hear but are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them
Deuteronomy,30,18,I declare to you today that you shall surely perish and you shall not live long in the land which you pass over the Jordan to enter and possess.
Deuteronomy,30,19,I call heaven and earth to witness this day against you that I have set before you life and death the blessings and the curses; therefore choose life that you and your descendants may live
Deuteronomy,30,20,And may love the Lord your God obey His voice and cling to Him. For He is your life and the length of your days that you may dwell in the land which the Lord swore to give to your fathers to Abraham Isaac and Jacob.
Deuteronomy,31,1,AND MOSES went on speaking these words to all Israel:
Deuteronomy,31,2,And he said to them I am 120 years old this day; I can no more go out and come in. And the Lord has said to me You shall not go over this Jordan.
Deuteronomy,31,3,The Lord your God will Himself go over before you and He will destroy these nations from before you and you shall dispossess them. And Joshua shall go over before you as the Lord has said.
Deuteronomy,31,4,And the Lord will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og the kings of the Amorites and to their land when He destroyed them.
Deuteronomy,31,5,And the Lord will give them over to you and you shall do to them according to all the commandments which I have commanded you.
Deuteronomy,31,6,Be strong courageous and firm; fear not nor be in terror before them for it is the Lord your God Who goes with you; He will not fail you or forsake you.
Deuteronomy,31,7,And Moses called to Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel Be strong courageous and firm for you shall go with this people into the land which the Lord has sworn to their fathers to give them and you shall cause them to possess it.
Deuteronomy,31,8,It is the Lord Who goes before you; He will [march] with you; He will not fail you or let you go or forsake you; [let there be no cowardice or flinching but] fear not neither become broken [in spirit--depressed dismayed and unnerved with alarm].
Deuteronomy,31,9,And Moses wrote this law and delivered it to the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord and to all the elders of Israel.
Deuteronomy,31,10,And Moses commanded them At the end of every seven years at the set time of the year of release [of debtors from their debts] at the Feast of Booths
Deuteronomy,31,11,When all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place which He chooses [for His sanctuary] you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
Deuteronomy,31,12,Assemble the people--men women and children and the stranger and the sojourner within your towns--that they may hear and learn [reverently] to fear the Lord your God and be watchful to do all the words of this law
Deuteronomy,31,13,And that their children who have not known it may hear and learn [reverently] to fear the Lord your God as long as you live in the land which you go over the Jordan to possess.
Deuteronomy,31,14,And the Lord said to Moses Behold your days are nearing when you must die. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the Tent of Meeting that I may give him his charge. And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the Tent of Meeting.
Deuteronomy,31,15,And the Lord appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.
Deuteronomy,31,16,And the Lord said to Moses Behold you shall sleep with your fathers and this people will rise up and play the harlot after the strange gods of the land where they go to be among them; and they will forsake Me and break My covenant which I have made with them.
Deuteronomy,31,17,Then My anger will be kindled against them in that day and I will forsake them and hide My face from them. And they shall be devoured and many evils and troubles shall befall them so that they will say in that day Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?
Deuteronomy,31,18,And I will surely hide My face in that day because of all the evil which they have done in turning to other gods.
Deuteronomy,31,19,And now write this song for yourselves and teach it to the Israelites; put it in their mouths that this song may be a witness for Me against the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,31,20,For when I have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers a land flowing with milk and honey and they have eaten and filled themselves and become fat then they will turn to other gods and serve them and despise and scorn Me and break My covenant.
Deuteronomy,31,21,And when many evils and troubles have befallen them this [sacred] song will confront them as a witness for it will never be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants. For I know their strong desire and the purposes which they are forming even now before I have brought them into the land which I swore to give them.
Deuteronomy,31,22,Moses wrote this song the same day and taught it to the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,31,23,And [the Lord] charged Joshua son of Nun Be strong and courageous and firm for you shall bring the Israelites into the land which I swore to give them and I will be with you.
Deuteronomy,31,24,And when Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book to the very end
Deuteronomy,31,25,He commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord
Deuteronomy,31,26,Take this Book of the Law and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God that it may be there for a witness against you.
Deuteronomy,31,27,For I know your rebellion and stubbornness; behold while I am yet alive with you today you have been rebellious against the Lord; and how much more after my death!
Deuteronomy,31,28,Gather to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers that I may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
Deuteronomy,31,29,For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days because you will do what is evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands.
Deuteronomy,31,30,And Moses spoke in the hearing of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song until they were ended:
Deuteronomy,32,1,GIVE EAR O heavens and I [Moses] will speak; and let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
Deuteronomy,32,2,My message shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the dew as the light rain upon the tender grass and as the showers upon the herb.
Deuteronomy,32,3,For I will proclaim the name [and presence] of the Lord. Concede and ascribe greatness to our God.
Deuteronomy,32,4,He is the Rock His work is perfect for all His ways are law and justice. A God of faithfulness without breach or deviation just and right is He.
Deuteronomy,32,5,They [Israel] have spoiled themselves. They are not sons to Him and that is their blemish--a perverse and crooked generation!
Deuteronomy,32,6,Do you thus repay the Lord you foolish and senseless people? Is not He your Father Who acquired you for His own Who made and established you [as a nation]?
Deuteronomy,32,7,Remember the days of old; consider the years of many generations. Ask your father and he will show you your elders and they will tell you.
Deuteronomy,32,8,When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance when He separated the children of men He set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,32,9,For the Lord's portion is His people; Jacob (Israel) is the lot of His inheritance.
Deuteronomy,32,10,He found him in a desert land in the howling void of the wilderness; He kept circling around him He scanned him [penetratingly] He kept him as the pupil of His eye.
Deuteronomy,32,11,As an eagle that stirs up her nest that flutters over her young He spread abroad His wings and He took them He bore them on His pinions.
Deuteronomy,32,12,So the Lord alone led him; there was no foreign god with Him.
Deuteronomy,32,13,He made Israel ride on the high places of the earth and he ate the increase of the field; and He made him suck honey out of the rock and oil out of the flinty rock
Deuteronomy,32,14,Butter and curds of the herd and milk of the flock with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of Bashan and he-goats with the finest of the wheat; and you drank wine of the blood of the grape.
Deuteronomy,32,15,But Jeshurun (Israel) grew fat and kicked. You became fat you grew thick you were gorged and sleek! Then he forsook God Who made him and forsook and despised the Rock of his salvation.

Deuteronomy,32,21,They have moved Me to jealousy with what is not God; they have angered Me with their idols. So I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people; I will anger them with a foolish nation.
Deuteronomy,32,22,For a fire is kindled by My anger and it burns to the depths of Sheol devours the earth with its increase and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.
Deuteronomy,32,23,And I will heap evils upon them; I will spend My arrows upon them.
Deuteronomy,32,24,They shall be wasted with hunger and devoured with burning heat and poisonous pestilence; and the teeth of beasts will I send against them with the poison of crawling things of the dust.
Deuteronomy,32,25,From without the sword shall bereave and in the chambers shall be terror destroying both young man and virgin the sucking child with the man of gray hairs.
Deuteronomy,32,26,I said I would scatter them afar and I would have made the remembrance of them to cease from among men
Deuteronomy,32,27,Had I not feared the provocation of the foe lest their enemies misconstrue it and lest they should say Our own hand has prevailed; all this was not the work of the Lord.
Deuteronomy,32,28,For they are a nation void of counsel and there is no understanding in them.
Deuteronomy,32,29,O that they were wise and would see through this [present triumph] to their ultimate fate!
Deuteronomy,32,30,How could one have chased a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their Rock had sold them and the Lord had delivered them up?

Deuteronomy,32,50,And die on the mountain which you ascend and be gathered to your people as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people
Deuteronomy,32,51,Because you broke faith with Me in the midst of the Israelites at the waters of Meribah-kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin and because you did not set Me apart as holy in the midst of the Israelites.

Joshua,2,16,And she said to them Get to the mountain lest the pursuers meet you; hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers have returned; and afterward you may go your way.
Joshua,2,17,The men said to her We will be blameless of this oath you have made us swear. [The responsibility is now yours.]
Joshua,2,18,Behold when we come into the land you shall bind this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down and you shall bring your father and mother your brothers and all your father's household into your house.
Joshua,2,19,And if anyone goes out of the doors of your house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless; but if a hand is laid upon anyone who is with you in the house his blood shall be on our head.
Joshua,2,20,But if you tell this business of ours we shall be guiltless of your oath which you made us swear.
Joshua,2,21,And she said According to your words so it is. Then she sent them away and they departed; and she bound the scarlet cord in the window.
Joshua,2,22,They left and went to the mountain and stayed there three days until the pursuers returned who had searched all along the way without finding them.
Joshua,2,23,So the two men descended from the mountain passed over [the Jordan] and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him all that had befallen them.
Joshua,2,24,They said to Joshua Truly the Lord has given all the land into our hands; for all the inhabitants of the country are faint because of us.
Joshua,3,1,JOSHUA ROSE early in the morning and they removed from Shittim and came to the Jordan he and all the Israelites and lodged there before passing over.
Joshua,3,2,After three days the officers went through the camp
Joshua,3,3,Commanding the people: When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God being borne by the Levitical priests set out from where you are and follow it.
Joshua,3,4,Yet a space must be kept between you and it about 2000 cubits by measure; come not near it that you may [be able to see the ark and] know the way you must go for you have not passed this way before.
Joshua,3,5,And Joshua said to the people Sanctify yourselves [that is separate yourselves for a special holy purpose] for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you.
Joshua,3,6,Joshua said to the priests Take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people. And they took it up and went on before the people.
Joshua,3,7,The Lord said to Joshua This day I will begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel so they may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with you.
Joshua,3,8,You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan you shall stand still in the Jordan.
Joshua,3,9,Joshua said to the Israelites Come near hear the words of the Lord your God.
Joshua,3,10,Joshua said Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you and that He will surely drive out from before you the Canaanites Hittites Hivites Perizzites Girgashites Amorites and Jebusites.
Joshua,3,11,Behold the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is passing over before you into the Jordan!
Joshua,3,12,So now take twelve men from the tribes of Israel one from each tribe.
Joshua,3,13,When the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the Lord of all the earth shall rest in the Jordan the waters of the Jordan coming down from above shall be cut off and they shall stand in one heap.
Joshua,3,14,So when the people set out from their tents to pass over the Jordan with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people
Joshua,3,15,And when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were in the brink of the water--for the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest--
Joshua,3,16,Then the waters which came down from above stood and rose up in a heap far off at Adam the city that is beside Zarethan; and those flowing down toward the Sea of the Arabah the Salt [Dead] Sea were wholly cut off. And the people passed over opposite Jericho.
Joshua,3,17,And while all Israel passed over on dry ground the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan until all the nation finished passing over the Jordan.
Joshua,4,1,WHEN ALL the nation had fully passed over the Jordan the Lord said to Joshua
Joshua,4,2,Take twelve men from among the people one man out of every tribe
Joshua,4,3,And command them Take twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan from the place where the priests' feet stood firm; carry them over with you and leave them at the place where you lodge tonight.
Joshua,4,4,Then Joshua called the twelve men of the Israelites whom he had appointed a man from each tribe.
Joshua,4,5,And Joshua said to them Pass over before the ark of the Lord your God in the midst of the Jordan and take up every man of you a stone on his shoulder as is the number of the tribes of the Israelites
Joshua,4,6,That this may be a sign among you when your children ask in time to come What do these stones mean to you?
Joshua,4,7,Then you shall tell them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; when it passed over the Jordan the waters of Jordan were cut off. So these stones shall be to the Israelites a memorial forever.
Joshua,4,8,And the Israelites did as Joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites as the Lord told Joshua and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged and laid them down there.
Joshua,4,9,And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood. And they are there to this day.
Joshua,4,10,For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the Lord commanded Joshua to tell the people according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. The people passed over in haste.
Joshua,4,11,When all the people had passed over the ark of the Lord and the priests went over in the presence of the people.
Joshua,4,12,And the sons of Reuben Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh passed over armed before the [other] Israelites as Moses had bidden them;
Joshua,4,13,About 40000 [of these] prepared for war passed over before the Lord to the plains of Jericho for battle.
Joshua,4,14,On that day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they stood in awe of him as they stood in awe of Moses all the days of his life.
Joshua,4,15,And the Lord said to Joshua
Joshua,4,16,Order the priests bearing the ark of the Testimony to come up out of the Jordan.
Joshua,4,17,So Joshua commanded the priests Come up out of the Jordan.
Joshua,4,18,And when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord had come up out of the midst of the Jordan and the soles of their feet were lifted up to the dry land the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and flowed over all its banks as they had before.
Joshua,4,19,And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and encamped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho.
Joshua,4,20,And those twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan Joshua set up in Gilgal.
Joshua,4,21,And he said to the Israelites When your children ask their fathers in time to come What do these stones mean?
Joshua,4,22,You shall let your children know Israel came over this Jordan on dry ground.
Joshua,4,23,For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you passed over as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea which He dried up for us until we passed over
Joshua,4,24,That all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the Lord is mighty and that you may reverence and fear the Lord your God forever.
Joshua,5,1,WHEN ALL the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites until we had crossed over their hearts melted and there was no spirit in them any more because of the Israelites.
Joshua,5,2,At that time the Lord said to Joshua Make knives of flint and circumcise the [new generation of] Israelites as before.
Joshua,5,3,So Joshua made knives of flint and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.
Joshua,5,4,And this is the reason Joshua circumcised them: all the males of the people who came out of Egypt all the men of war had died in the wilderness on the way after they came out of Egypt.
Joshua,5,5,Though all the people who came out were circumcised yet all the people who were born in the wilderness on the way after Israel came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
Joshua,5,6,For the Israelites walked forty years in the wilderness till all who were men of war who came out of Egypt perished because they did not hearken to the voice of the Lord; to them the Lord swore that He would not let them see the land which the Lord swore to their fathers to give us a land flowing with milk and honey.
Joshua,5,7,So it was their uncircumcised children whom He raised up in their stead whom Joshua circumcised because the rite had not been performed on the way.
Joshua,5,8,When they finished circumcising all the males of the nation they remained in their places in the camp till they were healed.
Joshua,5,9,And the Lord said to Joshua This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you. So the name of the place is called Gilgal [rolling] to this day.
Joshua,5,10,And the Israelites encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.
Joshua,5,11,And on that same day they ate the produce of the land: unleavened cakes and parched grain.
Joshua,5,12,And the manna ceased on the day after they ate of the produce of the land; and the Israelites had manna no more but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
Joshua,5,13,When Joshua was by Jericho he looked up and behold a Man stood near him with His drawn sword in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him Are you for us or for our adversaries?
Joshua,5,14,And He said No [neither] but as Prince of the Lord's host have I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped and said to Him What says my Lord to His servant?
Joshua,5,15,And the Prince of the Lord's host said to Joshua Loose your shoes from off your feet for the place where you stand is holy. And Joshua did so.
Joshua,6,1,NOW JERICHO [a fenced town with high walls] was tightly closed because of the Israelites; no one went out or came in.
Joshua,6,2,And the Lord said to Joshua See I have given Jericho its king and mighty men of valor into your hands.
Joshua,6,3,You shall march around the enclosure all the men of war going around the city once. This you shall do for six days.
Joshua,6,4,And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns; and on the seventh day you shall march around the enclosure seven times and the priests shall blow the trumpets.
Joshua,6,5,When they make a long blast with the ram's horn and you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the enclosure shall fall down in its place and the people shall go up [over it] every man straight before him.
Joshua,6,6,So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them Take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord.
Joshua,6,7,He said to the people Go on! March around the enclosure and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the Lord.
Joshua,6,8,When Joshua had spoken to the people the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the Lord and blew the trumpets and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them.
Joshua,6,9,The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets and the rear guard came after the ark the priests blowing the trumpets as they went.
Joshua,6,10,But Joshua commanded the people You shall not shout or let your voice be heard nor shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout!
Joshua,6,11,So he caused the ark of the Lord to go around the city once; and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp.
Joshua,6,12,Joshua rose early in the morning and the priests took up the ark of the Lord.
Joshua,6,13,And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord passed on blowing the trumpets continually; and the armed men went before them and the rear guard came after the ark of the Lord the priests blowing the trumpets as they went.
Joshua,6,14,On the second day they compassed the city enclosure once and returned to the camp. So they did for six days.
Joshua,6,15,On the seventh day they rose early at daybreak and marched around the city as usual only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
Joshua,6,16,And the seventh time when the priests had blown the trumpets Joshua said to the people Shout! For the Lord has given you the city.
Joshua,6,17,And the city and all that is in it shall be devoted to the Lord [for destruction]; only Rahab the harlot and all who are with her in her house shall live because she hid the messengers whom we sent.
Joshua,6,18,But you keep yourselves from the accursed and devoted things lest when you have devoted it [to destruction] you take of the accursed thing and so make the camp of Israel accursed and trouble it.
Joshua,6,19,But all the silver and gold and vessels of bronze and iron are consecrated to the Lord; they shall come into the treasury of the Lord.
Joshua,6,20,So the people shouted and the trumpets were blown. When the people heard the sound of the trumpet they raised a great shout and [Jericho's] wall fell down in its place so that the [Israelites] went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city.
Joshua,6,21,Then they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and woman young and old ox sheep and donkey with the edge of the sword.
Joshua,6,22,But Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land Go into the harlot's house and bring out the woman and all she has as you swore to her.
Joshua,6,23,So the young men the spies went in and brought out Rahab her father and mother her brethren and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred and set them outside the camp of Israel.
Joshua,6,24,And they burned the city with fire and all that was in it; only the silver the gold and the vessels of bronze and of iron they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord.
Joshua,6,25,So Joshua saved Rahab the harlot with her father's household and all that she had; and she lives in Israel even to this day because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
Joshua,6,26,Then Joshua laid this oath on them Cursed is the man before the Lord who rises up and rebuilds this city Jericho. With the loss of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up its gates.
Joshua,6,27,So the Lord was with Joshua and his fame was in all the land.
Joshua,7,1,BUT THE Israelites committed a trespass in regard to the devoted things; for Achan son of Carmi the son of Zabdi the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah took some of the things devoted [for destruction]. And the anger of the Lord burned against Israel.
Joshua,7,2,Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai which is near Beth-aven east of Bethel and said to them Go up and spy out the land. So the men went up and spied out Ai.
Joshua,7,3,And they returned to Joshua and said to him Let not all the men go up; but let about two thousand or three thousand go up and attack Ai; do not make the whole army toil up there for they of Ai are few.
Joshua,7,4,So about three thousand Israelites went up there but they fled before the men of Ai.
Joshua,7,5,And the men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them for they chased them from before the gate as far as Shebarim and slew them at the descent. And the hearts of the people melted and became as water.
Joshua,7,6,Then Joshua rent his clothes and lay on the earth upon his face before the ark of the Lord until evening he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.
Joshua,7,7,Joshua said Alas O Lord God why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all only to give us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? Would that we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan!
Joshua,7,8,O Lord what can I say now that Israel has turned to flee before their enemies!
Joshua,7,9,For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it and will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will You do for Your great name?
Joshua,7,10,The Lord said to Joshua Get up! Why do you lie thus upon your face?
Joshua,7,11,Israel has sinned; they have transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. They have taken some of the things devoted [for destruction]; they have stolen and lied and put them among their own baggage.
Joshua,7,12,That is why the Israelites could not stand before their enemies but fled before them; they are accursed and have become devoted [for destruction]. I will cease to be with you unless you destroy the accursed [devoted] things among you.
Joshua,7,13,Up sanctify (set apart for a holy purpose) the people and say Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the Lord the God of Israel: There are accursed things in the midst of you O Israel. You can not stand before your enemies until you take away from among you the things devoted [to destruction].
Joshua,7,14,In the morning therefore you shall present your tribes. And the tribe which the Lord takes shall come by families; and the family which the Lord takes shall come by households; and the household which the Lord takes shall come by persons.
Joshua,7,15,And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be [killed and his body] burned with fire he and all he has because he has transgressed the covenant of the Lord and because he has done a shameful and wicked thing in Israel.
Joshua,7,16,So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes and the tribe of Judah was taken.
Joshua,7,17,He brought near the family of Judah and the family of the Zerahites was taken; and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man and Zabdi was taken.
Joshua,7,18,He brought near his household man by man and Achan son of Carmi the son of Zabdi the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah was taken.
Joshua,7,19,And Joshua said to Achan My son give glory to the Lord the God of Israel and make confession to Him. And tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me.
Joshua,7,20,And Achan answered Joshua In truth I have sinned against the Lord the God of Israel and this have I done:
Joshua,7,21,When I saw among the spoils an attractive mantle from Shinar and two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels I coveted them and took them. Behold they are hidden in the earth inside my tent with the silver underneath.
Joshua,7,22,So Joshua sent messengers who ran to the tent and behold the spoil was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath.
Joshua,7,23,And they took them from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and laid them out before the Lord.
Joshua,7,24,And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan son of Zerah and the silver the garment the wedge of gold his sons his daughters his oxen his donkeys his sheep his tent and all that he had; and they brought them to the Valley of Achor.
Joshua,7,25,And Joshua said Why have you brought trouble on us? The Lord will trouble you this day. And all Israel stoned him and those with him with stones and afterward burned their bodies with fire.
Joshua,7,26,And they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Then the Lord turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Achor or Troubling to this day.
Joshua,8,1,AND THE Lord said to Joshua Fear not nor be dismayed. Take all the men of war with you and arise go up to Ai; see I have given into your hand the king of Ai his people his city and his land.
Joshua,8,2,And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king except that its spoil and its cattle [this time] you shall take as booty for yourselves. Lay an ambush against the city behind it.
Joshua,8,3,So Joshua arose and all the people of war to go up against Ai; [he] chose thirty thousand mighty men of strength and sent them forth by night.
Joshua,8,4,And he commanded them Behold you shall lie in wait against the city behind it. Do not go very far from the city but all of you be ready.
Joshua,8,5,And I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they come out against us as the first time we will flee before them
Joshua,8,6,Till we have drawn them from the city for they will say They are fleeing from us as before. So we will flee before them.
Joshua,8,7,Then you shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city for the Lord your God will deliver it into your hand.
Joshua,8,8,When you have taken the city you shall set it afire; as the Lord commanded you shall do. See I have commanded you.
Joshua,8,9,So Joshua sent them forth and they went to the place of ambush and remained between Bethel and Ai on the west side of Ai; but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
Joshua,8,10,Joshua rose up early in the morning and mustered the men and went up with the elders of Israel before the warriors to Ai.
Joshua,8,11,And all the fighting men who were with him went up and drew near before the city and encamped on the north side of [it] with a ravine between them and Ai.
Joshua,8,12,And he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai west of the city.
Joshua,8,13,So they stationed all the army--the main encampment that was north of the city and their men in ambush behind and on the west of the city--and Joshua went that night into the midst of the ravine.
Joshua,8,14,When the king [and people] of Ai saw it they hastily rose early and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle [at a time and place appointed] before the Arabah [plain]. But he did not know of the ambush against him behind the city.
Joshua,8,15,And Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten by them and fled toward the wilderness.
Joshua,8,16,So all the people in Ai were called together to pursue them and they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city.
Joshua,8,17,Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel. Leaving the city open they pursued Israel.
Joshua,8,18,Then the Lord said to Joshua Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai for I will give it into your hand. So Joshua stretched out the javelin in his hand toward the city.
Joshua,8,19,The men in the ambush arose quickly out of their place and ran when he stretched out his hand; and they entered the city and took it and then hastened and set it afire.
Joshua,8,20,When the men of Ai looked back behold the smoke of the city went up to the heavens and they had no power to flee this way or that way. Then the Israelites who fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
Joshua,8,21,When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city went up they turned again and slew the men of Ai.
Joshua,8,22,And the others came forth out of the city against them [of Ai] so that they were in the midst of Israel some on this side and some on that side. And [the Israelites] smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape.
Joshua,8,23,But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
Joshua,8,24,When Israel had finished slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field and in the wilderness into which they pursued them and they were all fallen by the sword until they were consumed then all the Israelites returned to Ai and smote it with the sword.
Joshua,8,25,And all that fell that day both men and women were twelve thousand including all the men of Ai.
Joshua,8,26,For Joshua drew not back his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
Joshua,8,27,Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty for themselves according to the word of the Lord which He commanded Joshua.
Joshua,8,28,So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap of ruins for ever even a desolation to this day.
Joshua,8,29,And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening; and at sunset Joshua commanded and they took the body down from the tree and cast it at the entrance of the city gate and raised a great heap of stones over it that is there to this day.
Joshua,8,30,Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord the God of Israel on Mount Ebal
Joshua,8,31,As Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the Israelites as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses an altar of unhewn stones upon which no man has lifted up an iron tool; and they offered on it burnt offerings to the Lord and sacrificed peace offerings.
Joshua,8,32,And there in the presence of the Israelites [Joshua] wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses.
Joshua,8,33,And all Israel sojourner as well as he who was born among them with their elders officers and judges stood on either side of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord half of them in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded before that they should bless the Israelites.
Joshua,8,34,Afterward Joshua read all the words of the law the blessings and cursings all that is written in the Book of the Law.
Joshua,8,35,There was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel and the women and little ones and the foreigners who were living among them.
Joshua,9,1,WHEN ALL the kings beyond the Jordan in the hill country and in the lowland and all along the coast of the Great [Mediterranean] Sea toward Lebanon the Hittites Amorites Canaanites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites heard this
Joshua,9,2,They gathered together with one accord to fight Joshua and Israel.
Joshua,9,3,But when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai
Joshua,9,4,They worked cunningly and went pretending to be ambassadors and took [provisions and] old sacks on their donkeys and wineskins old torn and mended
Joshua,9,5,And old and patched shoes on their feet and wearing old garments; and all their supply of food was dry and moldy.
Joshua,9,6,And they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel We have come from a far country; so now make a covenant with us.
Joshua,9,7,But the men of Israel said to the Hivites Perhaps you live among us; how then can we make a covenant with you?
Joshua,9,8,They said to Joshua We are your servants. And Joshua said to them Who are you? From where have you come?
Joshua,9,9,They said to him From a very far country your servants have come because of the name of the Lord your God. For we have heard the fame of Him and all that He did in Egypt
Joshua,9,10,And all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth.
Joshua,9,11,So our elders and all the residents of our country said to us Take provisions for the journey and go to meet [the Israelites] and say to them We are your servants; and now make a covenant with us.
Joshua,9,12,This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we set out to go to you; but now behold it is dry and has become moldy.
Joshua,9,13,These wineskins (bottles) which we filled were new and behold they are torn; and our garments and our shoes have become old because of the very long journey.
Joshua,9,14,So the [Israelite] men partook of their food and did not consult the Lord.
Joshua,9,15,Joshua made peace with them covenanting with them to let them live and the assembly's leaders swore to them.
Joshua,9,16,Then three days after they had made a covenant with [the strangers the Israelites] heard that they were their neighbors and that they dwelt among them.
Joshua,9,17,And the Israelites set out and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon Chephirah Beeroth and Kiriath-jearim.
Joshua,9,18,But the Israelites did not slay them because the leaders of the assembly had sworn to them by the Lord the God of Israel [to spare them]. And all the assembly murmured against the leaders.
Joshua,9,19,But all the leaders said to all the assembly We have sworn to them by the Lord the God of Israel so now we may not touch them.
Joshua,9,20,This we will do to them: we will let them live lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore to them.
Joshua,9,21,And the leaders said to them Let them live [and be our slaves]. So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the assembly just as the leaders had said of them.
Joshua,9,22,Joshua called the men and said Why did you deceive us saying We live very far from you when you dwell among us?
Joshua,9,23,Now therefore you are cursed and of you there shall always be slaves hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
Joshua,9,24,They answered Joshua Because it was surely told your servants that the Lord your God commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the land's inhabitants from before you. So we feared greatly for our lives because of you and have done this thing.
Joshua,9,25,And now behold we are in your hand; do as it seems good and right in your sight to do to us.
Joshua,9,26,So he did to them and delivered them out of the hand of the Israelites so that they did not kill them.
Joshua,9,27,But Joshua then made them hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord to this day in the place which He should choose.
Joshua,10,1,WHEN ADONI-ZEDEK king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai and had utterly destroyed it doing to Jericho and its king as he had done to Ai and its king and how the residents of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them
Joshua,10,2,He feared greatly because Gibeon was a great city like one of the royal cities and because it was greater than Ai and all its men were mighty.
Joshua,10,3,So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron to Piram king of Jarmuth to Japhia king of Lachish and to Debir king of Eglon saying
Joshua,10,4,Come up to me and help me and let us smite Gibeon for it has made peace with Joshua and with the Israelites.
Joshua,10,5,Then the five kings of the Amorites--the kings of Jerusalem Hebron Jarmuth Lachish and Eglon--gathered their forces and went up with all their armies and encamped before Gibeon to fight against it.
Joshua,10,6,And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal saying Do not relax your hand from your servants; come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered against us.
Joshua,10,7,So Joshua went up from Gilgal he and all the warriors with him and all the mighty men of valor.
Joshua,10,8,And the Lord said to Joshua Do not fear them for I have given them into your hand; there shall not a man of them stand before you.
Joshua,10,9,So Joshua came upon them suddenly having gone up from Gilgal all night.
Joshua,10,10,And the Lord caused [the enemies] to panic before Israel who slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon and chased them along the way that goes up to Beth-horon and smote them as far as Azekah and Makkedah.
Joshua,10,11,As they fled before Israel while they were descending [the pass] to Beth-horon the Lord cast great stones from the heavens on them as far as Azekah killing them. More died because of the hailstones than the Israelites slew with the sword.
Joshua,10,12,Then Joshua spoke to the Lord on the day when the Lord gave the Amorites over to the Israelites and he said in the sight of Israel Sun be silent and stand still at Gibeon and you moon in the Valley of Ajalon!
Joshua,10,13,And the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the nation took vengeance upon their enemies. Is not this written in the Book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of the heavens and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day.
Joshua,10,14,There was no day like it before or since when the Lord heeded the voice of a man. For the Lord fought for Israel.
Joshua,10,15,Then Joshua returned and all Israel with him to the camp at Gilgal.
Joshua,10,16,Those five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave of Makkedah.
Joshua,10,17,And it was told Joshua The five kings are hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua,10,18,Joshua said Roll great stones to the cave's mouth and set men to guard them.
Joshua,10,19,But do not stay. Pursue your enemies and fall upon their rear; do not allow them to enter their cities for the Lord your God has given them into your hand.
Joshua,10,20,When Joshua and the Israelites had ended slaying them until they were wiped out and the remnant remaining of them had entered into fortified cities
Joshua,10,21,All the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace; none moved his tongue against any of the Israelites.
Joshua,10,22,Then said Joshua Open the mouth of the cave and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.
Joshua,10,23,They brought the five kings out of the cave to him--the kings of Jerusalem Hebron Jarmuth Lachish and Eglon.
Joshua,10,24,When they brought out those kings to Joshua [he] called for all the Israelites and told the commanders of the men of war who went with him Come put your feet on the necks of these kings. And they came and put their feet on the [kings'] necks.
Joshua,10,25,Joshua said to them Fear not nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage. For thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies against whom you fight.
Joshua,10,26,Afterward Joshua smote and slew them and hanged their bodies on five trees and they hung on the trees until evening.
Joshua,10,27,At sunset Joshua ordered and they took the bodies down from the trees and cast them into the cave where the kings had hidden and laid great stones on the cave's mouth which remain to this very day.
Joshua,10,28,Joshua took Makkedah that day and smote it and its king with the sword and utterly destroyed everyone in it. He left none remaining. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
Joshua,10,29,Then Joshua and all Israel went from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked Libnah.
Joshua,10,30,And the Lord gave it also and its king into Israel's hands and Joshua smote it with the sword and all the people in it. He left none remaining in it. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.
Joshua,10,31,And Joshua passed from Libnah and all Israel with him to Lachish and encamped against it and attacked it.
Joshua,10,32,And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hands of Israel and Joshua took it on the second day and smote it with the sword and all the people in it as he had done to Libnah.
Joshua,10,33,Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish and Joshua smote him and his people--until he had left none remaining.
Joshua,10,34,From Lachish Joshua and all Israel went on to Eglon laid siege to it and attacked it.
Joshua,10,35,And they took it that day and smote it with the sword and utterly destroyed all who were in it that day as he had done to Lachish.
Joshua,10,36,Then Joshua with all Israel went up from Eglon to Hebron and they attacked it
Joshua,10,37,And took it and smote it with the sword and its king and all its towns and everyone in it. He left none remaining as he had done to Eglon and utterly destroyed it and all its people.
Joshua,10,38,And Joshua and all Israel with him returned to Debir and attacked it.
Joshua,10,39,And he took it with its king and all its towns and they smote them with the sword and utterly destroyed everyone in it. He left none remaining. As he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king so he did to Debir and its king.
Joshua,10,40,So Joshua smote all the land the hill country the South the lowland and the slopes and all their kings. He left none remaining but utterly destroyed all that breathed as the Lord the God of Israel commanded.
Joshua,10,41,And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gaza and all the country of Goshen even to Gibeon.
Joshua,10,42,Joshua took all these kings and their land at one time because the Lord the God of Israel fought for Israel.
Joshua,10,43,And Joshua returned and all Israel with him to the camp at Gilgal.
Joshua,11,1,WHEN JABIN king of Hazor heard of this he sent to Jobab king of Madon and to the kings of Shimron and Achshaph
Joshua,11,2,And to the kings who were in the north in the hill country and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth and in the lowland and in the heights of Dor on the west;
Joshua,11,3,To the Canaanites in the east and west; to the Amorites the Hittites the Perizzites the Jebusites in the hill country; and to the Hivites below [Mount] Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
Joshua,11,4,And they went out with all their hosts much people like the sand on the seashore in number with very many horses and chariots.
Joshua,11,5,And all these kings met and came and encamped together at the Waters of Merom to fight against Israel.
Joshua,11,6,But the Lord said to Joshua Do not be afraid because of them for tomorrow by this time I will give them up all slain to Israel; you shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.
Joshua,11,7,So Joshua and all the people of war with him came against them suddenly by the Waters of Merom and fell upon them.
Joshua,11,8,And the Lord gave them into the hand of Israel who smote them and chased them [toward] populous Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpah; they smote them until none remained.
Joshua,11,9,And Joshua did to them as the Lord had commanded him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
Joshua,11,10,And Joshua at that time turned back and took Hazor and smote its king with the sword; for Hazor previously was the head of all those kingdoms.
Joshua,11,11,They smote all the people in it with the sword utterly destroying them; none were left alive and he burned Hazor with fire.
Joshua,11,12,And Joshua took all the cities of those kings and all the kings and smote them with the sword utterly destroying them as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded.
Joshua,11,13,But Israel burned none of the cities that stood [fortified] on their mounds--except Hazor only which Joshua burned.
Joshua,11,14,And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock the Israelites took for their booty; but every man they smote with the sword until they had destroyed them and they left none who breathed.
Joshua,11,15,As the Lord had commanded Moses His servant so Moses commanded Joshua and so Joshua did; he left nothing undone of all that the Lord commanded Moses.
Joshua,11,16,So Joshua took all that land: the hill country all the South all the land of Goshen the lowland the Arabah [plain] the hill country of Israel and its lowland
Joshua,11,17,From Mount Halak which rises toward Seir as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and slew them.
Joshua,11,18,Joshua had waged war a long time [at least five years] with all those kings.
Joshua,11,19,Not a city made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites the people of Gibeon; all the others they took in battle.
Joshua,11,20,For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle that [Israel] might destroy them utterly and that without favor and mercy as the Lord commanded Moses.
Joshua,11,21,Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim [large in stature] from the hill country: from Hebron from Debir from Anab and from all the hill country of Judah and the hill country of Israel. Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.
Joshua,11,22,None of the Anakim were left in the land of the Israelites; only in Gaza Gath and Ashdod [of Philistia] did some remain.
Joshua,11,23,So Joshua took the whole land according to all that the Lord had spoken to Moses and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their allotments by tribes. And the land had rest from war.
Joshua,12,1,NOW THESE are the kings of the land whom the Israelites defeated and whose land they took possession of east of the Jordan from the river Arnon to Mount Hermon and all the Arabah eastward:
Joshua,12,2,Sihon king of the Amorites who dwelt in Heshbon and ruled from Aroer on the edge of the Valley of the [river] Arnon and from the middle of the valley as far as the river Jabbok the boundary of the Ammonites including half of Gilead;
Joshua,12,3,And the Arabah to the Sea of Chinneroth eastward and in the direction of Beth-jeshimoth to the Sea of the Arabah the Salt [or Dead] Sea southward to the foot of the slopes of Pisgah.
Joshua,12,4,And Og king of Bashan one of the remnant of the Rephaim who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei
Joshua,12,5,And ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and all of Bashan to the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites and over half of Gilead to the boundary of Sihon king of Heshbon.
Joshua,12,6,These Moses the servant of the Lord and the Israelites defeated; and Moses the servant of the Lord gave their land for a possession to the Reubenites the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua,12,7,These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the Israelites defeated on the west side of the Jordan from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak which rises toward Seir. Joshua gave their land to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their allotments
Joshua,12,8,In the hill country in the lowland in the Arabah on the slopes in the wilderness and in the Negeb--the lands of the Hittites Amorites Canaanites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites:

Joshua,12,23,The king of Dor in the heights of Dor one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal one;
Joshua,12,24,The king of Tirzah one. In all thirty-one kings.
Joshua,13,1,NOW JOSHUA was old and gone far in years [over 100] and the Lord said to him You have grown old and are gone far in years and very much of the land still remains to be possessed.
Joshua,13,2,This is the land that remains: all the regions of the Philistines and all those of the Geshurites:
Joshua,13,3,From the Shihor [River] which is east of Egypt northward to the boundary of Ekron all of it counted as Canaanite; there are five rulers of the Philistines those of Gaza Ashdod Ashkelon Gath and Ekron and those of the Avvites;
Joshua,13,4,In the south all the land of the Canaanites and Mearah which belongs to the Sidonians to Aphek to the boundary of the Amorites
Joshua,13,5,And the land of the Gebalites; and all Lebanon toward the east from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to the gate of Hamath.
Joshua,13,6,As for all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim even all the Sidonians I will Myself drive them out from before the Israelites; only allot the land to Israel for an inheritance as I have commanded you.
Joshua,13,7,So now divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua,13,8,With the other half-tribe of Manasseh the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward as Moses the servant of the Lord gave them:
Joshua,13,9,From Aroer on the edge of the Valley of the [river] Arnon and the city in the midst of the valley and all the tableland of Medeba as far as Dibon;
Joshua,13,10,And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites who ruled in Heshbon as far as the boundary of the Ammonites;
Joshua,13,11,And Gilead and the region of the Geshurites and Maacathites and all Mount Hermon and all Bashan to Salecah--
Joshua,13,12,All the kingdom of Og in Bashan who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei and alone was left of the Rephaim [giants]; for these Moses had defeated and driven out.
Joshua,13,13,Yet the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites but Geshur and Maacath dwell among [them] still.
Joshua,13,14,Only to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance; the sacrifices made by fire to the Lord the God of Israel are their inheritance as He said to him.
Joshua,13,15,And Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the Reubenites according to their families:
Joshua,13,16,Their territory was from Aroer on the edge of the Valley of the [river] Arnon and the city in the midst of the valley and all the tableland by Medeba;
Joshua,13,17,With Heshbon and all its cities which are on the plain; Dibon Bamoth-baal and Beth-baal-meon
Joshua,13,18,Jahaz Kedemoth Mephaath
Joshua,13,19,Kiriathaim Sibmah and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley
Joshua,13,20,Beth-peor Pisgah's slopes and Beth-jeshimoth
Joshua,13,21,All the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites who ruled in Heshbon whom Moses defeated along with the leaders of Midian Evi Rekem Zur Hur and Reba the princes of Sihon who lived in the land.
Joshua,13,22,Balaam son of Beor the soothsayer the Israelites also killed with the sword among the rest of their slain.
Joshua,13,23,And the border of the Reubenites was the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the Reubenites according to their families with their cities and villages.
Joshua,13,24,Moses gave an inheritance also to the tribe of the Gadites according to their families.
Joshua,13,25,Their territory was Jazer and all the cities of Gilead and half the land of the Ammonites as far as Aroer east of Rabbah;
Joshua,13,26,And from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim and from Mahanaim to the territory of Debir;
Joshua,13,27,And in the valley Beth-haram Beth-nimrah Succoth and Zaphon the rest of the realm of Sihon king of Heshbon with the Jordan as a boundary to the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth east of the Jordan.
Joshua,13,28,This is the inheritance of the Gadites according to their families with their cities and villages.
Joshua,13,29,And Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh; it was allotted to them according to their families.
Joshua,13,30,Their region extended from Mahanaim through all Bashan the entire kingdom of Og king of Bashan and all the towns of Jair which are in Bashan sixty cities
Joshua,13,31,And half of Gilead and Ashtaroth and Edrei cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan; these were allotted to the people of Machir son of Manasseh for half of the Machirites according to their families.
Joshua,13,32,These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan east of Jericho.
Joshua,13,33,But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance; the Lord the God of Israel is their inheritance as He told them.
Joshua,14,1,THESE ARE the inheritances in the land of Canaan distributed to the Israelites by Eleazar the priest Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the fathers' houses of their tribes.
Joshua,14,2,Their inheritance was by lot as the Lord commanded Moses for the nine and one-half tribes.
Joshua,14,3,For Moses had given an inheritance to the two and one-half tribes beyond the Jordan but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them
Joshua,14,4,For the people of Joseph were two tribes Manasseh and Ephraim. And no part was given in the land to the Levites except cities in which to live with their pasturelands for their livestock and for their possessions.
Joshua,14,5,As the Lord commanded Moses so the Israelites did and they divided the land.
Joshua,14,6,Then the people of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him You know what the Lord said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadesh-barnea.
Joshua,14,7,Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea to scout out the land. And I brought him a report as it was in my heart.
Joshua,14,8,But my brethren who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt; yet I wholly followed the Lord my God.
Joshua,14,9,And Moses swore on that day Surely the land on which your feet have walked shall be an inheritance to you and your children always because you have wholly followed the Lord my God.
Joshua,14,10,And now behold the Lord has kept me alive as He said these forty-five years since the Lord spoke this word to Moses while the Israelites wandered in the wilderness; and now behold I am this day eighty-five years old.
Joshua,14,11,Yet I am as strong today as I was the day Moses sent me; as my strength was then so is my strength now for war and to go out and to come in.
Joshua,14,12,So now give me this hill country of which the Lord spoke that day. For you heard then how the [giantlike] Anakim were there and that the cities were great and fortified; if the Lord will be with me I shall drive them out just as the Lord said.
Joshua,14,13,Then Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
Joshua,14,14,So Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day because he wholly followed the Lord the God of Israel.
Joshua,14,15,The name of Hebron before was Kiriath-arba [city of Arba]. This Arba was the greatest of the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.
Joshua,15,1,THE LOT for the tribe of Judah according to its families reached southward to the boundary of Edom to the Wilderness of Zin at its most southern part.
Joshua,15,2,And their south boundary was from the end of the Salt [Dead] Sea from the bay that faces southward;
Joshua,15,3,It went out south of the ascent of Akrabbim passed along to Zin and went up south of Kadesh-barnea along by Hezron up to Addar and turned about to Karka
Joshua,15,4,Passed along to Azmon went out by the Brook of Egypt and ended at the sea. This was their southern frontier.
Joshua,15,5,The eastern boundary was the Salt [Dead] Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan. The northern boundary was from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan;
Joshua,15,6,And the boundary went up to Beth-hogla and passed along north of Beth-arabah and [it] went up to the [landmark] Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
Joshua,15,7,And the boundary went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor and so northward turning toward Gilgal which is opposite the ascent to Adummim on the south side of the valley; and it passed on to the waters of En-shemesh and ended at En-rogel.
Joshua,15,8,Then the boundary went up by the Valley of Ben-hinnom [son of Hinnom] at the southern shoulder of the Jebusite [city]--that is Jerusalem; and the boundary went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the Valley of Hinnom on the west at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim.
Joshua,15,9,Then the boundary extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah and went on to the cities of Mount Ephron; then it bent round to Baalah that is Kiriath-jearim.
Joshua,15,10,And the boundary went around west of Baalah to Mount Seir passed along to the northern side of Mount Jearim which is Chesalon went down to Beth-shemesh and then passed on by Timnah.
Joshua,15,11,And the boundary went out to the shoulder of the hill north of Ekron then bent round to Shikkeron and passed along to Mount Baalah and went out to Jabneel. Then the boundary ended at the sea.
Joshua,15,12,And the west boundary was the Great Sea with its coastline. This is the boundary round about the people of Judah according to their families.
Joshua,15,13,And to Caleb son of Jephunneh [Joshua] gave a part among the people of Judah as the Lord commanded [him]; it was Kiriath-arba which is Hebron [named for] Arba the father of Anak.
Joshua,15,14,And Caleb drove from there the three sons of Anak--Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai--the descendants of Anak.
Joshua,15,15,He went up from there against the people of Debir. Debir was formerly named Kiriath-sepher.
Joshua,15,16,Caleb said He who smites Kiriath-sepher and takes it to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.
Joshua,15,17,And Othniel son of Kenaz Caleb's brother took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
Joshua,15,18,When Achsah came to Othniel she got his consent to ask her father for a field. Then she returned to Caleb and when she lighted off her donkey Caleb said What do you wish?
Joshua,15,19,Achsah answered Give me a present. Since you have set me in the [dry] Negeb give me also springs of water. And he gave her the [sloping field with] upper and lower springs.
Joshua,15,20,This is the inheritance of the tribe of Judah according to their families.

Joshua,15,63,But the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem the people of Judah could not drive out; so the Jebusites dwell with the people of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.
Joshua,16,1,THE ALLOTMENT for the people of Joseph went from the Jordan by Jericho east of the waters of Jericho into the wilderness going up from Jericho into the hill country to Bethel;
Joshua,16,2,Then it went from Bethel to Luz and passed on to Ataroth the border of the Archites.
Joshua,16,3,And it went down westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the outskirts of Lower Beth-horon then to Gezer and ended at the sea.
Joshua,16,4,The descendants of Joseph Manasseh and Ephraim received their inheritance.
Joshua,16,5,The boundary of the Ephraimites according to their families was thus: on the east side their border was Ataroth-addar as far as Upper Beth-horon.
Joshua,16,6,Then the boundary went from there to the sea; on the north was Michmethath; then on the east the boundary went out to Taanath-shiloh and eastward to Janoah
Joshua,16,7,Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah touched Jericho and ended at the Jordan [River].
Joshua,16,8,The border went out from Tappuah westward to the brook Kanah and ended at the [Mediterranean] Sea. This is the inheritance of the Ephraimites by their families
Joshua,16,9,With the towns set apart for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites all those towns with their villages.
Joshua,16,10,But they did not drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day and they became slaves required to do forced labor.
Joshua,17,1,ALLOTMENT WAS made for the tribe of Manasseh for he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Machir the firstborn of Manasseh the father of Gilead were allotted Gilead and Bashan because he was a man of war.
Joshua,17,2,Allotment was also made for the other Manassites by their families--for the sons of Abiezer of Helek Asriel Shechem Hepher and Shemida the male offspring of Manasseh son of Joseph by their families.
Joshua,17,3,But Zelophehad son of Hepher the son of Gilead the son of Machir the son of Manasseh had no sons but only daughters; their names were Mahlah Noah Hoglah Milcah and Tirzah.
Joshua,17,4,They came before Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and the leaders and said The Lord commanded Moses to give us an inheritance with our brethren. So according to the Lord's command Joshua gave them an inheritance among their father's brethren.
Joshua,17,5,So there fell ten portions to Manasseh besides the land of Gilead and Bashan which is on the other side of the Jordan
Joshua,17,6,Because the [five] daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his [five] sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the other [half] of the Manassites.
Joshua,17,7,The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Michmethah east of Shechem; and the border went along southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
Joshua,17,8,The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh but the town of Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the Ephraimites.
Joshua,17,9,Then the boundary went down to the brook Kanah. The cities south of the brook lying among the cities of Manasseh belonged to Ephraim. But Manasseh's boundary went on north of the brook and ended at the sea.
Joshua,17,10,The land to the south was Ephraim's and that to the north was Manasseh's and the sea was the boundary; on the north Asher was reached and on the east Issachar.
Joshua,17,11,Also Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher [these six towns] their inhabitants and their villages: Beth-shean Ibleam Dor Endor Taanach and Megiddo.
Joshua,17,12,Yet the sons of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities but the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land.
Joshua,17,13,When the Israelites became strong they put the Canaanites to forced labor but did not utterly drive them out.
Joshua,17,14,The tribe of Joseph spoke to Joshua saying Why have you given [us] but one lot and one portion as an inheritance when [we] are a great [abundant] people for until now the Lord has blessed [us]?
Joshua,17,15,Joshua replied If you are a great people get up to the forest and clear ground for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim since the Ephraim hill country is too narrow for you.
Joshua,17,16,The Josephites said The hill country is not enough for us and all the Canaanites who dwell in the valley have iron chariots both those in Beth-shean and its villages and in the Valley of Jezreel.
Joshua,17,17,And Joshua said to the house of Joseph to Ephraim and to Manasseh You are a great and numerous people and have great power; you shall not have only one lot
Joshua,17,18,But the hill country shall be yours; though it is a forest you shall clear and possess it to its farthest borders; for you shall drive out the Canaanites though they have iron chariots and are strong.
Joshua,18,1,AND THE whole congregation of the Israelites assembled at Shiloh and set up the Tent of Meeting there; and the land was subdued before them.
Joshua,18,2,And there remained among the Israelites seven tribes who had not yet divided their inheritance.
Joshua,18,3,Joshua asked the Israelites How long will you be slack to go in and possess the land which the Lord the God of your fathers has given you?
Joshua,18,4,Provide three men from each tribe and I will send them to go through the land and write a description of it according to their [tribal] inheritances; then they shall return to me.
Joshua,18,5,And they shall divide it into seven parts. Judah shall remain in its territory on the south and the house of Joseph shall remain in its territory on the north.
Joshua,18,6,You shall describe the land in seven divisions and bring the description here to me that I may cast lots for you here before the Lord our God.
Joshua,18,7,But the Levites have no portion among you for the priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance. Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance east of the Jordan which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them.
Joshua,18,8,So the men arose and went and Joshua charged them saying Go and walk through the land and describe it and come again to me and I will cast lots for you here before the Lord in Shiloh.
Joshua,18,9,And the men went and passed through the land and described it by cities in seven portions in a book; and they came again to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.
Joshua,18,10,Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the Lord and there [he] divided the land to the Israelites to each [tribe] his portion.
Joshua,18,11,And the lot of the Benjamites came up according to their families; and the territory of their lot fell between the tribes of Judah and Joseph.
Joshua,18,12,On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan; then it went up to the shoulder of Jericho on the north and up through the hill country westward and ended at the Beth-aven wilderness.
Joshua,18,13,Then the boundary passed over southward toward Luz to the shoulder of Luz (that is Bethel); then it went down to Ataroth-addar by the mountain that lies south of Lower Beth-horon.
Joshua,18,14,The boundary extended from there and turning about on the western side southward from the mountain that lies to the south opposite Beth-horon it ended at Kiriath-baal (that is Kiriath-jearim) a city of the tribe of Judah. This formed the western side [of Benjamin's territory].
Joshua,18,15,The southern side began at the edge of Kiriath-jearim and the boundary went on westward to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.
Joshua,18,16,Then the boundary went down to the edge of the mountain overlooking the Valley of Ben-hinnom [son of Hinnom] which is at the north end of the Valley of Rephaim; and it descended to the Valley of Hinnom south of the shoulder of the Jebusites and went on down to En-rogel.
Joshua,18,17,Then it bent toward the north and went on to En-shemesh and on to Geliloth which was opposite the ascent of Adummim and went down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
Joshua,18,18,And it went on to the north of the shoulder [of Beth]-Arabah and down to the Arabah.
Joshua,18,19,Then the boundary passed along to the north of the shoulder of Beth-hoglah and ended at the northern bay of the Salt [Dead] Sea at the south end of the Jordan. This was the southern border.
Joshua,18,20,And the Jordan was its boundary on the east side. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin by their boundaries round about according to their families.

Joshua,19,9,Out of the part assigned to the Judahites was the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon for the portion of the tribe of Judah was too large for them. Therefore the tribe of Simeon had its inheritance in the midst of Judah's inheritance.
Joshua,19,10,The third lot came up for the tribe of Zebulun according to their families. The border of its inheritance extended to Sarid.
Joshua,19,11,Then its boundary went up westward and on to Maralah and reached to Dabbesheth and to the brook east of Jokneam.
Joshua,19,12,And it turned from Sarid eastward to the border of Chisloth-tabor and it went out to Daberath and on up to Japhia

Joshua,19,46,Me-jarkon and Rakkon with the territory before Joppa.
Joshua,19,47,The territory of the tribe of Dan had to be extended [because of the crowding in of the Amorites and Philistines]; so the sons of Dan went up to fight against Leshem (Laish) and took it and smote it with the sword and possessed it and dwelt there and they called Leshem (Laish) Dan after Dan their [forefather].
Joshua,19,48,This is the inheritance of the tribe of Dan according to their families these cities with their villages.
Joshua,19,49,When they had finished dividing the land for inheritance by their boundaries the Israelites gave an inheritance among them to Joshua son of Nun.
Joshua,19,50,According to the word of the Lord they gave him the city for which he asked--Timnath-serah in the hills of Ephraim. And he built the city and dwelt in it.
Joshua,19,51,These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of Israel distributed by lot in Shiloh before the Lord at the door of the Tent of Meeting. So they finished dividing the land.
Joshua,20,1,THE LORD said also to Joshua
Joshua,20,2,Say to the Israelites Appoint among you cities of refuge of which I spoke to you through Moses
Joshua,20,3,That the slayer who kills anyone accidentally and unintentionally may flee there; and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
Joshua,20,4,He who flees to one of those cities shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and explain his case to the elders of that city; they shall receive him to [the protection of] that city and give him a place to dwell among them.
Joshua,20,5,If the avenger of blood pursues him they shall not deliver the slayer into his hand because he killed his neighbor unintentionally having had no hatred for him previously.
Joshua,20,6,And he shall dwell in that city until he has been tried before the congregation and until the death of him who is the high priest in those days. Then the slayer shall return to his own city from which he fled and to his own house.
Joshua,20,7,And they set apart and consecrated Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and Kiriath-arba (that is Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
Joshua,20,8,Beyond the Jordan east of Jericho they appointed Bezer in the wilderness tableland from the tribe of Reuben and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua,20,9,These cities were for all the Israelites and the stranger sojourning among them that whoever killed a person unintentionally might flee there and not be slain by the avenger of blood until he had been tried before the congregation.
Joshua,21,1,THEN THE heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites came to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the fathers' houses of the Israelite tribes.
Joshua,21,2,They said to them at Shiloh in Canaan The Lord commanded through Moses that we should be given cities to dwell in with their pasturelands (suburbs) for our cattle.
Joshua,21,3,So the Israelites gave to the Levites out of their own inheritance at the command of the Lord these cities and their suburbs.
Joshua,21,4,The [first] lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. So those Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest received by lot from the tribes of Judah Simeon and Benjamin thirteen cities.
Joshua,21,5,And the rest of the Kohathites received by lot from the families of the tribes of Ephraim Dan and the half-tribe of Manasseh ten cities.
Joshua,21,6,The Gershonites received by lot from the families of the tribes of Issachar Asher Naphtali and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan thirteen cities.
Joshua,21,7,The Merarites received according to their families from the tribes of Reuben Gad and Zebulun twelve cities.
Joshua,21,8,The Israelites gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their pasturelands (suburbs) as the Lord commanded through Moses.
Joshua,21,9,They gave from the tribes of Judah and Simeon the cities here mentioned by name
Joshua,21,10,Which went to the families of the descendants of Aaron of the Kohathite branch of the Levites for the lot fell to them first.
Joshua,21,11,They gave them [the city of] Kiriath-arba Arba being the father of Anak which city is Hebron in the hill country of Judah with its pasturelands round about it.
Joshua,21,12,But the city's fields and villages they gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his own.

Joshua,21,14,Jattir Eshtemoa
Joshua,21,15,Holon Debir

Joshua,21,19,The cities of the sons of Aaron the priests were thirteen with their suburbs.
Joshua,21,20,The rest of the Kohathites belonging to the Levitical families were allotted cities out of the tribe of Ephraim.
Joshua,21,21,To them were given each with its pasturelands (suburbs) Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim as the city of refuge for the slayer and Gezer

Joshua,21,24,Aijalon and Gath-rimmon; four cities each with its pasturelands (suburbs).
Joshua,21,25,And out of the half-tribe of Manasseh Taanach and [another] Gath-rimmon; two cities each with its pasturelands (suburbs).
Joshua,21,26,All the cities for the families of the remaining Kohathites were ten with their pasturelands (suburbs).
Joshua,21,27,And to the Gershonites of the families of the Levites they gave out of the other half-tribe of Manasseh the city of Golan in Bashan as the city of refuge for the slayer and Be-eshterah; two cities each with its pasturelands.
Joshua,21,28,Out of the tribe of Issachar Kishion Daberath

Joshua,21,30,Out of the tribe of Asher Mishal Abdon

Joshua,21,33,All the cities of the Gershonite families were thirteen with their pasturelands (suburbs).

Joshua,21,36,And out of the tribe of Reuben Bezer Jahaz

Joshua,21,38,And out of the tribe of Gad Ramoth in Gilead as the city of refuge for the slayer and Mahanaim
Joshua,21,39,Heshbon and Jazer; four cities in all each with its pasturelands (suburbs).
Joshua,21,40,So all the cities allotted to the Merarite families that is the remainder of the Levite families were twelve cities.
Joshua,21,41,The cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the Israelites were forty-eight cities in all with their pasturelands (suburbs).
Joshua,21,42,These cities all had their pasturelands (suburbs) around them.
Joshua,21,43,And the Lord gave to Israel all the land which He had sworn to give to their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt in it.
Joshua,21,44,The Lord gave them rest round about just as He had sworn to their fathers. Not one of all their enemies withstood them; the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hands.
Joshua,21,45,There failed no part of any good thing which the Lord had promised to the house of Israel; all came to pass.
Joshua,22,1,THEN JOSHUA called the Reubenites the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh
Joshua,22,2,And said to them You have kept all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you.
Joshua,22,3,You have not deserted your brethren [the other tribes] these many days to this day but have carefully kept the charge of the Lord your God.
Joshua,22,4,But now the Lord your God has given rest to your brethren as He promised them; so now go return to your homes in the land of your possession which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on the [east] side of the Jordan.
Joshua,22,5,But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord charged you: to love the Lord your God and to walk in all His ways and to keep His commandments and to cling to and unite with Him and to serve Him with all your heart and soul [your very life].
Joshua,22,6,So Joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went to their homes.
Joshua,22,7,Now to one-half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan but to the other half Joshua gave a possession on the west side of the Jordan among their brethren. So when Joshua sent them away to their homes he blessed them
Joshua,22,8,And he said to them Return with much riches to your tents and with very much livestock with silver gold bronze iron and very much clothing. Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
Joshua,22,9,So the Reubenites Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home parting from the [other] Israelites at Shiloh in the land of Canaan to go to the land of Gilead their own land of which they had been given possession by the command of the Lord through Moses.
Joshua,22,10,And when they came to the region of the Jordan in the land of Canaan the Reubenites Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan an altar great to behold.
Joshua,22,11,And the [other] Israelites heard it said Behold the Reubenites Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the edge of the land of Canaan in the region [west] of the Jordan in the passage [belonging to us] the Israelites.
Joshua,22,12,When the Israelites heard of it the whole congregation of the sons of Israel gathered at Shiloh to make war on them.
Joshua,22,13,And the [other] Israelites sent to the Reubenites Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest
Joshua,22,14,And with him ten chiefs one from each of the tribal families of Israel; and each one was a head of a father's house among the clans of Israel.
Joshua,22,15,And they came to the Reubenites Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead and they said to them
Joshua,22,16,The whole congregation of the Lord says What trespass is this that you have committed against the God of Israel to turn away this day from following the Lord in that you have built yourselves an altar to rebel this day against the Lord?
Joshua,22,17,Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us from which we are not cleansed even now although there came a plague [in which 24000 died] in the congregation of the Lord
Joshua,22,18,That you must turn away this day from following the Lord? The result will be since you rebel today against the Lord that tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
Joshua,22,19,But now if your land is unclean pass over into the Lord's land where the Lord's tabernacle resides and take for yourselves a possession among us. But do not rebel against the Lord or rebel against us by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the Lord our God.
Joshua,22,20,Did not Achan son of Zerah commit a trespass in the matter of taking accursed things [devoted to destruction] and wrath fall on all the congregation of Israel? And he did not perish alone in his perversity and iniquity.
Joshua,22,21,Then the Reubenites Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh said to the heads of the clans of Israel
Joshua,22,22,The Mighty One God the Lord! The Mighty One God the Lord! He knows and let Israel itself know! If it was in rebellion or in transgression against the Lord spare us not today.
Joshua,22,23,If we have built us an altar to turn away from following the Lord or if we did so to offer on it burnt offerings or cereal offerings or peace offerings may the Lord Himself take vengeance.
Joshua,22,24,No! But we did it for fear that in time to come your children might say to our children What have you to do with the Lord the God of Israel?
Joshua,22,25,For the Lord has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you you Reubenites and Gadites; you have no part in the Lord. So your children might make our children cease from fearing the Lord.
Joshua,22,26,So we said Let us now prepare to build us an altar not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice
Joshua,22,27,But to be a witness between us and you and between the generations after us that we will perform the service of the Lord before Him with our burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings; lest your children say to our children in time to come You have no portion in the Lord.
Joshua,22,28,So we thought if that should be said to us or to our descendants in time to come we can reply Behold the copy of the altar of the Lord which our fathers made not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices but to be a witness between us and you.
Joshua,22,29,Far be it from us that we should rebel against the Lord and turn away this day from following the Lord to build an altar for burnt offerings for cereal offerings or for sacrifices besides the altar of the Lord our God that is before His tabernacle.
Joshua,22,30,And when Phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the congregation and heads of the clans of Israel who were with him heard the words that the Reubenites Gadites and Manassites spoke it pleased them.
Joshua,22,31,Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest said to the Reubenites Gadites and Manassites Today we know the Lord is among us because you have not committed this trespass and treachery against the Lord; now you have saved the Israelites from the Lord's hand.
Joshua,22,32,Then Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest and the chiefs returned from the Reubenites and Gadites in the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan to the [other] Israelites and brought back word to them.
Joshua,22,33,The report pleased the Israelites and they blessed God; and they spoke no more of going to war against them to destroy the land in which the Reubenites and Gadites dwelt.
Joshua,22,34,The Reubenites and Gadites called the altar Ed [witness] saying It shall be: A Witness Between Us that the Lord is God.
Joshua,23,1,A LONG time after that when the Lord had given Israel rest from all their enemies round about and Joshua had grown old and advanced in years
Joshua,23,2,Joshua summoned all Israel their elders heads judges and officers and said to them I am old and advanced in years.
Joshua,23,3,And you have seen all that the Lord your God has done to all these nations for your sake; for it is the Lord your God Who has fought for you.
Joshua,23,4,Behold I have allotted to you as an inheritance for your tribes those nations that remain with all the nations I have cut off from the Jordan to the Great Sea on the west.
Joshua,23,5,The Lord your God will thrust them out from before you and drive them out of your sight and you shall possess their land as the Lord your God promised you.
Joshua,23,6,So be very courageous and steadfast to keep and do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses turning not aside from it to the right hand or the left
Joshua,23,7,That you may not mix with these nations that remain among you or make mention of the names of their gods or swear by them or serve them or bow down to them.
Joshua,23,8,But cling to the Lord your God as you have done to this day.
Joshua,23,9,For the Lord has driven out from before you great and strong nations; and as for you no man has been able to withstand you to this day.
Joshua,23,10,One man of you shall put to flight a thousand for it is the Lord your God Who fights for you as He promised you.
Joshua,23,11,Be very watchful of yourselves therefore to love the Lord your God.
Joshua,23,12,For if you turn back and adhere to the remnant of these nations left among you and make marriages with them you marrying their women and they yours
Joshua,23,13,Know with certainty that the Lord your God will not continue to drive these nations from before you; but they shall be a snare and trap to you and a scourge in your sides and thorns in your eyes until you perish from off this good land which the Lord your God has given you.
Joshua,23,14,And behold this day I am going the way of all the earth. Know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the Lord your God promised concerning you. All have come to pass for you; not one thing of them has failed.
Joshua,23,15,But just as all good things which the Lord promised you have come to you so will the Lord carry out [His] every [warning of] evil upon you until He has destroyed you from off this good land which the Lord your God has given you.
Joshua,23,16,If you transgress the covenant of the Lord your God which He commanded you if you serve other gods and bow down to them then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you and you shall perish quickly from off the good land He has given you.
Joshua,24,1,THEN JOSHUA gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and summoned the elders of Israel and their heads their judges and their officers; they presented themselves before God.
Joshua,24,2,Joshua said to all the people Thus says the Lord the God of Israel Your fathers dwelt in olden times beyond the Euphrates River including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor and they served other gods.
Joshua,24,3,And I took your father Abraham from beyond the Euphrates River and led him through all the land of Canaan and multiplied his offspring. I gave him Isaac
Joshua,24,4,And I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau. And I gave to Esau the hill country of Seir to possess but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.
Joshua,24,5,I sent Moses and Aaron and I plagued Egypt with what I did in the midst of it; and afterward I brought you out.
Joshua,24,6,I brought your fathers out of Egypt and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.
Joshua,24,7,When they cried to the Lord He put darkness between you and the Egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. And you lived in the wilderness a long time [forty years].
Joshua,24,8,I brought you into the land of the Amorites who lived on the other side of the Jordan; they fought with you and I gave them into your hand and you possessed their land and I destroyed them before you.
Joshua,24,9,Then Balak son of Zippor king of Moab arose and warred against Israel and sent and called Balaam son of Beor to curse you.
Joshua,24,10,But I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you; so I delivered you out of Balak's hand.
Joshua,24,11,You went over the Jordan and came to Jericho; and the men of Jericho fought against you as did the Amorites Perizzites Canaanites Hittites Girgashites Hivites and Jebusites and I gave them into your hands.
Joshua,24,12,I sent the hornet [that is the terror of you] before you which drove the two kings of the Amorites out before you; but it was not by your sword or by your bow.
Joshua,24,13,I have given you a land for which you did not labor and cities you did not build and you dwell in them; you eat from vineyards and olive yards you did not plant.
Joshua,24,14,Now therefore [reverently] fear the Lord and serve Him in sincerity and in truth; put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the [Euphrates] River and in Egypt and serve the Lord.
Joshua,24,15,And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell; but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord.
Joshua,24,16,The people answered Far be it from us to forsake the Lord to serve other gods;
Joshua,24,17,For it is the Lord our God Who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage Who did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way that we went and among all the peoples through whom we passed.
Joshua,24,18,And the Lord drove out before us all the people the Amorites who dwelt in the land. Therefore we also will serve the Lord for He is our God.
Joshua,24,19,And Joshua said to the people You cannot serve the Lord for He is a holy God; He is a jealous God. He will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.
Joshua,24,20,If you forsake the Lord and serve strange gods then He will turn and do you harm and consume you after having done you good.
Joshua,24,21,And the people said to Joshua No; but we will serve the Lord.
Joshua,24,22,Then Joshua said to the people You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the Lord to serve Him. And they said We are witnesses.
Joshua,24,23,Then put away said he the foreign gods that are among you and incline your hearts to the Lord the God of Israel.
Joshua,24,24,The people said to Joshua The Lord our God we will serve; His voice we will obey.
Joshua,24,25,So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day and made statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem.
Joshua,24,26,And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God; and he took a great stone and set it up there under an oak that was in [the court of] the sanctuary of the Lord.
Joshua,24,27,And Joshua said to all the people See this stone shall be a witness against us for it has heard all the words the Lord spoke to us; so it shall be a witness against you lest [afterward] you lie (pretend) and deny your God.
Joshua,24,28,So Joshua sent the people away every man to his inheritance.
Joshua,24,29,After this Joshua son of Nun the servant of the Lord died being 110 years old.
Joshua,24,30,They buried him at the edge of his inheritance in Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim on the north side of the hill of Gaash.
Joshua,24,31,Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua and of the elders who outlived Joshua and had known all the works the Lord had done for Israel.
Joshua,24,32,And the bones of Joseph which the Israelites brought up out of Egypt they buried in Shechem in the portion of ground Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for 100 pieces of money; and it became the inheritance of the Josephites.
Joshua,24,33,And Eleazar son of Aaron died; and they buried him at Gibeah [on the hill] of Phinehas his son which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim.
Judges,1,1,AFTER THE death of Joshua the Israelites asked the Lord Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites to fight against them?
Judges,1,2,And the Lord said Judah shall go up; behold I have delivered the land into his hand.
Judges,1,3,And Judah [the tribe] said to [the tribe of] Simeon his brother Come up with me into my allotted territory so that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your territory. So Simeon went with him.
Judges,1,4,Then Judah went up and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand and they smote 10000 of them in Bezek.
Judges,1,5,And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek and fought against him and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
Judges,1,6,Adoni-bezek fled but they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.
Judges,1,7,Adoni-bezek said Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off had to gather their food under my table. As I have done so God has repaid me. And they brought him to Jerusalem and there he died.
Judges,1,8,And the men of Judah fought against [Jebusite] Jerusalem and took it and smote it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.
Judges,1,9,Afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the hill country in the South (the Negeb) and in the lowland.
Judges,1,10,And Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron. The name of Hebron before was Kiriath-arba. And they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.
Judges,1,11,From there [Judah] went against the inhabitants of Debir. The name of Debir before was Kiriath-sepher [city of books and scribes].
Judges,1,12,And Caleb said Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and takes it to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.
Judges,1,13,And Othniel son of Kenaz Caleb's younger brother took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
Judges,1,14,And when she came to [Othniel] she got his consent to ask her father for a [sloping] field. And she alighted off her donkey and Caleb said to her What do you want?
Judges,1,15,And she said to him Give me a present; since you have set me in the land of the South (the Negeb) give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
Judges,1,16,And the descendants of the Kenite Moses' father-in-law went up with the Judahites from the City of Palms (Jericho) into the Wilderness of Judah which lies in the South (the Negeb) near Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people.
Judges,1,17,And [the tribe of] Judah went with Simeon his brother and they slew the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and utterly destroyed it. So the city was called Hormah [destruction].
Judges,1,18,Also Judah took Gaza Askelon and Ekron--each with its territory.
Judges,1,19,The Lord was with Judah and [Judah] drove out the inhabitants of the hill country but he could not drive out those inhabiting the [difficult] valley basin because they had chariots of iron.
Judges,1,20,Hebron was given to Caleb as Moses said and he expelled from there the three sons of Anak.
Judges,1,21,But the Benjamites did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; the Jebusites dwell with the Benjamites in Jerusalem to this day.
Judges,1,22,The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel and the Lord was with them.
Judges,1,23,And the house of Joseph was sent to spy out Bethel. The name of the city formerly had been Luz.
Judges,1,24,And the spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him Show us we pray you the way into the city and we will show you mercy.
Judges,1,25,When he showed them the entrance to the city they smote the city with the sword but they let the man and all his family go.
Judges,1,26,And the man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and called it Luz which is its name to this day.
Judges,1,27,Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages or of Taanach or Dor or Ibleam or Megiddo and their villages but the Canaanites remained in that land.
Judges,1,28,When Israel became strong they put the Canaanites to forced labor but did not utterly drive them out.
Judges,1,29,Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
Judges,1,30,Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or of Nahalol but the Canaanites dwelt among them and were put to forced labor.
Judges,1,31,Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or of Sidon or of Ahlab or of Achzib or of Helbah or of Aphik or of Rehob;
Judges,1,32,But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them out.
Judges,1,33,Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh or of Beth-anath but dwelt among the Canaanites the inhabitants of the land; but the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them.
Judges,1,34,The Amorites forced the Danites back into the hill country for they would not allow them to come down into the plain;
Judges,1,35,The Amorites remained fixed in Mount Heres [mountain of the sun] in Aijalon and in Shaalbim; yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed so that they became subject to forced labor.
Judges,1,36,And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim from the rock Sela and onward.
Judges,2,1,NOW THE Angel of the Lord went up from Gilgal to Bochim. And He said I brought you up from Egypt and have brought you to the land which I swore to give to your fathers and I said I will never break My covenant with you;
Judges,2,2,And you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; but you shall break down their altars. But you have not obeyed My voice. Why have you done this?
Judges,2,3,So now I say I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides and their gods shall be a snare to you.
Judges,2,4,When the Angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the Israelites the people lifted up their voice and wept.
Judges,2,5,They named that place Bochim [weepers] and they sacrificed there to the Lord.
Judges,2,6,And when Joshua had let the people go the Israelites went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.
Judges,2,7,And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the Lord which He did for Israel.
Judges,2,8,And Joshua son of Nun the servant of the Lord died being 110 years old.
Judges,2,9,And they buried him within the boundary of his inheritance in Timnath-heres in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash.
Judges,2,10,And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers and there arose another generation after them who did not know (recognize understand) the Lord or even the work which He had done for Israel.
Judges,2,11,And the people of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and served the Baals.
Judges,2,12,And they forsook the Lord the God of their fathers Who brought them out of the land of Egypt. They went after other gods of the peoples round about them and bowed down to them and provoked the Lord to anger.
Judges,2,13,And they forsook the Lord and served Baal [the god worshiped by the Canaanites] and the Ashtaroth [female deities such as Ashtoreth and Asherah].
Judges,2,14,So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and He gave them into the power of plunderers who robbed them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that they could no longer stand before their foes.
Judges,2,15,Whenever they went out the hand of the Lord was against them for evil as the Lord had said and as the Lord had sworn to them; and they were bitterly distressed.
Judges,2,16,But the Lord raised up judges who delivered them out of the hands of those who robbed them.
Judges,2,17,And yet they did not listen to their judges for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed down to them. They turned quickly out of the way in which their fathers had walked who had obeyed the commandments of the Lord and they did not so.
Judges,2,18,When the Lord raised them up judges then He was with the judge and delivered them out of the hands of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the Lord was moved to relent because of their groanings by reason of those who oppressed and vexed them.
Judges,2,19,But when the judge was dead they turned back and corrupted themselves more than their fathers following and serving other gods and bowing down to them. They did not cease from their practices or their stubborn way.
Judges,2,20,So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel; and He said Because this people have transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers and have not listened to My voice
Judges,2,21,I from now on will also not drive out from before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died
Judges,2,22,That through them I may prove Israel whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk in it as their fathers kept it or not.
Judges,2,23,So the Lord left those nations without driving them out at once nor had He delivered them into Joshua's power.
Judges,3,1,NOW THESE are the nations which the Lord left to prove Israel by them that is all in Israel who had not previously experienced war in Canaan;
Judges,3,2,It was only that the generations of the Israelites might know and be taught war at least those who previously knew nothing of it.
Judges,3,3,The remaining nations are: the five lords of the Philistines all the Canaanites the Sidonians and the Hivites who dwelt on Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath.
Judges,3,4,They were for the testing and proving of Israel to know whether Israel would listen and obey the commandments of the Lord which He commanded their fathers by Moses.
Judges,3,5,And the Israelites dwelt among the Canaanites Hittites Amorites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites;
Judges,3,6,And they married their daughters and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.
Judges,3,7,And the Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord and forgot the Lord their God and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth.
Judges,3,8,So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and He sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the Israelites served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.
Judges,3,9,But when the Israelites cried to the Lord the Lord raised up a deliverer for the people of Israel to deliver them Othniel son of Kenaz Caleb's younger brother.
Judges,3,10,The Spirit of the Lord came upon him and he judged Israel. He went out to war and the Lord delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand and his hand prevailed over Chushan-rishathaim.
Judges,3,11,And the land had rest forty years. Then Othniel son of Kenaz died.
Judges,3,12,And the Israelites again did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord strengthened Eglon king of Moab against Israel because they had done what was evil in the sight of the Lord.
Judges,3,13,And [Eglon] gathered to him the men of Ammon and Amalek and went and smote Israel and they possessed the City of Palm Trees (Jericho).
Judges,3,14,And the Israelites served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.
Judges,3,15,But when the Israelites cried to the Lord the Lord raised them up a deliverer Ehud son of Gera a Benjamite a left-handed man; and by him the Israelites sent tribute to Eglon king of Moab.
Judges,3,16,Ehud made for himself a sword a cubit long which had two edges and he girded it on his right thigh under his clothing.
Judges,3,17,And he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.
Judges,3,18,And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute he sent away the people who had carried it.
Judges,3,19,He himself went [with them] as far as the sculptured [boundary] stones near Gilgal and then turned back and came to Eglon and said I have a secret errand to you O king. Eglon commanded silence and all who stood by him went out from him.
Judges,3,20,When Ehud had come [near] to him as he was sitting alone in his cool upper apartment Ehud said I have a commission from God to execute to you. And the king arose from his seat.
Judges,3,21,Then Ehud put forth his left hand and took the sword from his right thigh and thrust it into Eglon's belly.
Judges,3,22,And the hilt also went in after the blade and the fat closed upon the blade for [Ehud] did not draw the sword out of his belly and the dirt came out.
Judges,3,23,Then Ehud went out into the vestibule and shut the doors of the upper room upon [Eglon] and locked them.
Judges,3,24,When [Ehud] had gone out [Eglon's] servants came. And when they saw the doors of the upper room were locked they thought Surely he [is seeking privacy while he] relieves himself in the closet of the cool chamber.
Judges,3,25,They waited a long time until they became embarrassed and uneasy but when he still did not open the doors of the upper room they took the key and opened them and there lay their master fallen to the floor dead!
Judges,3,26,Ehud escaped while they delayed and passed beyond the sculptured [boundary] stones (images) and escaped to Seirah.
Judges,3,27,When he arrived he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim and the Israelites went down from the hill country with him at their head.
Judges,3,28,And he said to them Follow me for the Lord has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and permitted not a man to pass over.
Judges,3,29,They slew at that time about 10000 Moabites all strong courageous men; not a man escaped.
Judges,3,30,So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel and the land had peace and rest for eighty years.
Judges,3,31,After [Ehud] was Shamgar son of Anath who slew 600 Philistine men with an oxgoad. He also delivered Israel.
Judges,4,1,BUT AFTER Ehud died the Israelites again did evil in the sight of the Lord.
Judges,4,2,So the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera who dwelt in Harosheth-hagoiim [fortress or city of the nations].
Judges,4,3,Then the Israelites cried to the Lord for [Jabin] had 900 chariots of iron and had severely oppressed the Israelites for twenty years.
Judges,4,4,Now Deborah a prophetess the wife of Lappidoth judged Israel at that time.
Judges,4,5,She sat under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim and the Israelites came up to her for judgment.
Judges,4,6,And she sent and called Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him Has not the Lord the God of Israel commanded [you] Go gather your men at Mount Tabor taking 10000 men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun?
Judges,4,7,And I will draw out Sisera the general of Jabin's army to meet you at the river Kishon with his chariots and his multitude and I will deliver him into your hand?
Judges,4,8,And Barak said to her If you will go with me then I will go; but if you will not go with me I will not go.
Judges,4,9,And she said I will surely go with you; nevertheless the trip you take will not be for your glory for the Lord will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh. [Fulfilled in Judg. 4:22.]
Judges,4,10,And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh and he went up with 10000 men at his heels and Deborah went up with him.
Judges,4,11,Now Heber the Kenite of the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses had separated from the Kenites and encamped as far away as the oak in Zaanannim which is near Kedesh.
Judges,4,12,When it was told Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor
Judges,4,13,Sisera gathered together all his chariots even 900 chariots of iron and all the men who were with him from Harosheth-hagoiim to the river Kishon.
Judges,4,14,And Deborah said to Barak Up! For this is the day when the Lord has given Sisera into your hand. Is not the Lord gone out before you? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10000 men following him.
Judges,4,15,And the Lord confused and terrified Sisera and all his chariot drivers and all his army before Barak with the sword. And Sisera alighted from his chariot and fled on foot.
Judges,4,16,But Barak pursued after the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoiim and all the army of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left.
Judges,4,17,But Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
Judges,4,18,And Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him Turn aside my lord turn aside to me; have no fear. So he turned aside to her into the tent and she covered him with a rug.
Judges,4,19,And he said to her Give me I pray you a little water to drink for I am thirsty. And she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him.
Judges,4,20,And he said to her Stand at the door of the tent and if any man comes and asks you Is there any man here? Tell him No.
Judges,4,21,But Jael Heber's wife took a tent pin and a hammer in her hand and went softly to him and drove the pin through his temple and into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep from weariness. So he died.
Judges,4,22,And behold as Barak pursued Sisera Jael came out to meet him and said to him Come and I will show you the man you seek. And when he came into her tent behold Sisera lay dead and the tent pin was in his temples.
Judges,4,23,So God subdued on that day Jabin king of Canaan before the Israelites.
Judges,4,24,And the hand of the Israelites bore more and more upon Jabin king of Canaan until they had destroyed [him].
Judges,5,1,THEN SANG Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam on that day saying
Judges,5,2,For the leaders who took the lead in Israel for the people who offered themselves willingly bless the Lord!
Judges,5,3,Hear O kings; give ear O princes; I will sing to the Lord. I will sing praise to the Lord the God of Israel.
Judges,5,4,Lord when You went forth out of Seir when You marched out of the field of Edom the earth trembled and the heavens also dropped yes the clouds dropped water.
Judges,5,5,The mountains quaked at the presence of the Lord yes yonder Sinai at the presence of the Lord the God of Israel.
Judges,5,6,After the days of Shamgar son of Anath after the days of Jael [meaning here Ehud] the caravans ceased travelers walked through byways.
Judges,5,7,The villages were unoccupied and rulers ceased in Israel until you arose--you Deborah arose--a mother in Israel.
Judges,5,8,[Formerly] they chose new gods; then war was in the gates. Was there a shield or spear seen among 40000 in Israel?
Judges,5,9,My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless the Lord!
Judges,5,10,Tell of it--you who ride on white donkeys you who sit on rich carpets and you who walk by the way.
Judges,5,11,Far from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the Lord even the righteous acts toward His villagers in Israel. Then the people of the Lord went down to the gates.
Judges,5,12,Awake awake Deborah! Awake awake utter a song! Arise Barak and lead away your captives you son of Abinoam.
Judges,5,13,Then down marched the remnant of the nobles the people of the Lord marched down for Me against the mighty.
Judges,5,14,Out of Ephraim they came down whose root is in Amalek after you Benjamin with your kinsmen. Out of Machir came down commanders and lawgivers and out of Zebulun those who handle the pen or stylus of the writer.
Judges,5,15,And the princes of Issachar came with Deborah and Issachar was faithful to Barak; into the valley they rushed forth at his heels. [But] among the clans of Reuben were great searchings of heart.
Judges,5,16,Why [Reuben] did you linger among the sheepfolds listening to the piping for the flocks? Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
Judges,5,17,Gilead remained beyond the Jordan and why did Dan stay with the ships? Asher sat still on the seacoast and remained by his creeks. [These came not forth to battle for God's people.]
Judges,5,18,But Zebulun was a people who endangered their lives to the death; Naphtali did also on the heights of the field.
Judges,5,19,The kings came and fought then fought the kings of Canaan at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo. Gain of booty they did not obtain.
Judges,5,20,From the heavens the stars fought from their courses they fought against Sisera.
Judges,5,21,The torrent Kishon swept [the foe] away the onrushing torrent the torrent Kishon. O my soul march on with strength!
Judges,5,22,Then the horses' hoofs beat loudly because of the galloping of [fleeing] valiant riders.
Judges,5,23,Curse Meroz said the messenger of the Lord. Curse bitterly its inhabitants because they came not to the help of the Lord to the help of the Lord against the mighty!
Judges,5,24,Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be; blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
Judges,5,25,[Sisera] asked for water and she gave [him] milk; she brought him curds in a lordly dish.
Judges,5,26,She put her [left] hand to the tent pin and her right hand to the workmen's hammer. And with the wooden hammer she smote Sisera she smote his head yes she struck and pierced his temple.
Judges,5,27,He sank he fell he lay still at her feet. At her feet he sank he fell; where he sank there he fell--dead!
Judges,5,28,The mother of Sisera looked out at a window and wailed through the lattice Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why do the hoofbeats of his chariots tarry?
Judges,5,29,Her wise ladies answered her yet she repeated her words to herself
Judges,5,30,Have they not found and been dividing the spoil? A maiden or two for every man a spoil of dyed garments for Sisera a spoil of dyed stuffs embroidered two pieces of dyed work embroidered for my neck as spoil?
Judges,5,31,So let all Your enemies perish O Lord! But let those who love Him be like the sun when it rises in its might. And the land had peace and rest for forty years.
Judges,6,1,BUT THE Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord gave them into the hand of Midian for seven years.
Judges,6,2,And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of Midian the Israelites made themselves the dens which are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds.
Judges,6,3,For whenever Israel had sown their seed the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east came up against them.
Judges,6,4,They would encamp against them and destroy the crops as far as Gaza and leave no nourishment for Israel and no ox or sheep or donkey.
Judges,6,5,For they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came like locusts for multitude; both they and their camels could not be counted. So they wasted the land as they entered it.
Judges,6,6,And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites and the Israelites cried to the Lord.
Judges,6,7,And when they cried to the Lord because of Midian
Judges,6,8,The Lord sent a prophet to the Israelites who said to them Thus says the Lord the God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage.
Judges,6,9,And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you and drove them out from before you and gave you their land.
Judges,6,10,And I said to you I am the Lord your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. But you have not obeyed My voice.
Judges,6,11,Now the Angel of the Lord came and sat under the oak (terebinth) at Ophrah which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite and his son Gideon was beating wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites.
Judges,6,12,And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him The Lord is with you you mighty man of [fearless] courage.
Judges,6,13,And Gideon said to him O sir if the Lord is with us why is all this befallen us? And where are all His wondrous works of which our fathers told us saying Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? But now the Lord has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian.
Judges,6,14,The Lord turned to him and said Go in this your might and you shall save Israel from the hand of Midian. Have I not sent you?
Judges,6,15,Gideon said to Him Oh Lord how can I deliver Israel? Behold my clan is the poorest in Manasseh and I am the least in my father's house.
Judges,6,16,The Lord said to him Surely I will be with you and you shall smite the Midianites as one man.
Judges,6,17,Gideon said to Him If now I have found favor in Your sight then show me a sign that it is You Who talks with me.
Judges,6,18,Do not leave here I pray You until I return to You and bring my offering and set it before You. And He said I will wait until you return.
Judges,6,19,Then Gideon went in and prepared a kid and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket and the broth in a pot and brought them to Him under the oak and presented them.
Judges,6,20,And the Angel of God said to him Take the meat and unleavened cakes and lay them on this rock and pour the broth over them. And he did so.
Judges,6,21,Then the Angel of the Lord reached out the tip of the staff that was in His hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes and there flared up fire from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. Then the Angel of the Lord vanished from his sight.
Judges,6,22,And when Gideon perceived that He was the Angel of the Lord Gideon said Alas O Lord God! For now I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face!
Judges,6,23,The Lord said to him Peace be to you do not fear; you shall not die.
Judges,6,24,Then Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and called it The Lord is Peace. To this day it still stands in Ophrah which belongs to the Abiezrites.
Judges,6,25,That night the Lord said to Gideon Take your father's bull the second bull seven years old and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has and cut down the Asherah [symbol of the goddess Asherah] that is beside it;
Judges,6,26,And build an altar to the Lord your God on top of this stronghold with stones laid in proper order. Then take the second bull and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down.
Judges,6,27,Then Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the Lord had told him but because he was too afraid of his father's household and the men of the city to do it by day he did it by night.
Judges,6,28,And when the men of the city arose early in the morning behold the altar of Baal was cast down and the Asherah was cut down that was beside it and the second bull was offered on the altar which had been built.
Judges,6,29,And they said to one another Who has done this thing? And when they searched and asked they were told Gideon son of Joash has done this thing.
Judges,6,30,Then the men of the city commanded Joash Bring out your son that he may die for he has pulled down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it.
Judges,6,31,But Joash said to all who stood against him Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? He who will contend for Baal let him be put to death while it is still morning. If Baal is a god let him contend for himself because one has pulled down his altar.
Judges,6,32,Therefore on that day he called Gideon Jerubbaal meaning Let Baal contend against him because he had pulled down his altar.
Judges,6,33,Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east came together and crossing the Jordan encamped in the Valley of Jezreel.
Judges,6,34,But the Spirit of the Lord clothed Gideon with Himself and took possession of him and he blew a trumpet and [the clan of] Abiezer was gathered to him.
Judges,6,35,And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh and the Manassites were called to follow him; and he sent messengers to Asher to Zebulun and to Naphtali and they came up to meet them.
Judges,6,36,And Gideon said to God If You will deliver Israel by my hand as You have said
Judges,6,37,Behold I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only and it is dry on all the ground then I shall know that You will deliver Israel by my hand as You have said.
Judges,6,38,And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the dew out of the fleece he wrung from it a bowlful of water.
Judges,6,39,And Gideon said to God Let not your anger be kindled against me and I will speak but this once. Let me make trial only this once with the fleece I pray you; let it now be dry only upon the fleece and upon all the ground let there be dew.
Judges,6,40,And God did so that night for it was dry on the fleece only and there was dew on all the ground.
Judges,7,1,THEN JERUBBAAL that is Gideon and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of Midian was north of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley.
Judges,7,2,The Lord said to Gideon The people who are with you are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hands lest Israel boast about themselves against Me saying My own hand has delivered me.
Judges,7,3,So now proclaim in the ears of the men saying Whoever is fearful and trembling let him turn back and depart from Mount Gilead. And 22000 of the men returned but 10000 remained.
Judges,7,4,And the Lord said to Gideon The men are still too many; bring them down to the water and I will test them for you there. And he of whom I say to you This man shall go with you shall go with you; and he of whom I say to you This man shall not go with you shall not go.
Judges,7,5,So he brought the men down to the water and the Lord said to Gideon Everyone who laps up the water with his tongue as a dog laps it you shall set by himself likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.
Judges,7,6,And the number of those who lapped putting their hand to their mouth was 300 men but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.
Judges,7,7,And the Lord said to Gideon With the 300 men who lapped I will deliver you and give the Midianites into your hand. Let all the others return every man to his home.
Judges,7,8,So the people took provisions and their trumpets in their hands and he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his home and retained those 300 men. And the host of Midian was below him in the valley.
Judges,7,9,That same night the Lord said to Gideon Arise go down against their camp for I have given it into your hand.
Judges,7,10,But if you fear to go down go with Purah your servant down to the camp
Judges,7,11,And you shall hear what they say and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp. Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the camp of the armed men.
Judges,7,12,And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the sons of the east lay along the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number as the sand on the seashore for multitude.
Judges,7,13,When Gideon arrived behold a man was telling a dream to his comrade. And he said Behold I dreamed a dream and behold a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian and came to the tent and struck it so that it fell and turned it upside down so that the tent lay flat.
Judges,7,14,And his comrade replied This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon son of Joash a man of Israel. Into his hand God has given Midian and all the host.
Judges,7,15,When Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation he worshiped and returned to the camp of Israel and said Arise for the Lord has given into your hand the host of Midian.
Judges,7,16,And he divided the 300 men into three companies and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets and empty pitchers with torches inside the pitchers.
Judges,7,17,And he said to them Look at me then do likewise. When I come to the edge of their camp do as I do.
Judges,7,18,When I blow the trumpet I and all who are with me then you blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and shout For the Lord and for Gideon!
Judges,7,19,So Gideon and the 100 men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch when the guards had just been changed and they blew the trumpets and smashed the pitchers that were in their hands.
Judges,7,20,And the three companies blew the trumpets and shattered the pitchers holding the torches in their left hands and in their right hands the trumpets to blow [leaving no chance to use swords] and they cried The sword for the Lord and Gideon!
Judges,7,21,They stood every man in his place round about the camp and all the [Midianite] army ran--they cried out and fled.
Judges,7,22,When [Gideon's men] blew the 300 trumpets the Lord set every [Midianite's] sword against his comrade and against all the army and the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel-meholah by Tabbath.
Judges,7,23,And the men of Israel were called together out of Naphtali and Asher and all Manasseh and they pursued Midian.
Judges,7,24,And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim saying Come down against the Midianites and take all the intervening fords as far as Beth-barah and also the Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together and took all the fords as far as Beth-barah and also the Jordan.
Judges,7,25,And [the men of Ephraim] took the two princes of Midian Oreb and Zeeb and they slew Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb and pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.
Judges,8,1,AND THE men of Ephraim said to Gideon Why have you treated us like this not calling us when you went to fight with Midian? And they quarreled with him furiously.
Judges,8,2,And he said to them What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of [your big tribe of] Ephraim better than the vintage of [my little clan of] Abiezer?
Judges,8,3,God has given into your hands the princes of Midian Oreb and Zeeb and what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their anger toward him was abated when he had said that.
Judges,8,4,And Gideon came to the Jordan and passed over he and the 300 men with him faint yet pursuing.
Judges,8,5,And he said to the men of Succoth Give I pray you loaves of bread to the people who follow me for they are faint and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna kings of Midian.
Judges,8,6,And the princes of Succoth said Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand that we should give bread to your army?
Judges,8,7,And Gideon said For that when the Lord has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand I will thresh your flesh with the thorns and briers of the wilderness!
Judges,8,8,And he went from there up to Penuel and made the same request and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had done.
Judges,8,9,And [Gideon] said to the men of Penuel When I come again in peace I will break down this tower.
Judges,8,10,Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army--about 15000 men all who were left of all the army of the sons of the east for there had fallen 120000 men who drew the sword.
Judges,8,11,And Gideon went up by the route of those who dwelt in tents east of Nobah and Jogbehah and smote their camp [unexpectedly] for the army thought itself secure.
Judges,8,12,And Zebah and Zalmunna fled and he pursued them and took the two kings of Midian Zebah and Zalmunna and terrified all the army.
Judges,8,13,Then Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres.
Judges,8,14,And he caught a young man of Succoth and inquired of him and [the youth] wrote down for him [the names of] the officials of Succoth and its elders seventy-seven men.
Judges,8,15,And he came to the men of Succoth and said Behold Zebah and Zalmunna about whom you scoffed at me saying Are Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand that we should give bread to your men who are faint?
Judges,8,16,And he took the elders of the city and thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them he taught the men of Succoth [a lesson].
Judges,8,17,And he broke down the tower of Penuel and slew the men of the city.
Judges,8,18,Then [Gideon] said to Zebah and Zalmunna What kind of men were they whom you slew at Tabor? And they replied They were like you each of them resembled the son of a king.
Judges,8,19,And he said They were my brothers the sons of my mother. As the Lord lives if you had saved them alive I would not slay you.
Judges,8,20,And [Gideon] said to Jether his firstborn [to embarrass them] Up and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword for he feared because he was yet a lad.
Judges,8,21,Then Zebah and Zalmunna said Rise yourself and fall on us; for as the man is so is his strength. And Gideon arose and slew Zebah and Zalmunna and took the [crescent-shaped] ornaments that were on their camels' necks.
Judges,8,22,Then the men of Israel said to Gideon Rule over us--you and your son and your son's son also--for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.
Judges,8,23,And Gideon said to them I will not rule over you and my son will not rule over you; the Lord will rule over you.
Judges,8,24,And Gideon said to them Let me make a request of you--every man of you give me the earrings of his spoil. For [the Midianites] had gold earrings because they were Ishmaelites [general term for all descendants of Keturah].
Judges,8,25,And they answered We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment and every man cast on it the earrings of his spoil.
Judges,8,26,And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1700 shekels of gold besides the crescents and pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian and the chains that were about their camels' necks.
Judges,8,27,And Gideon made an ephod [a sacred high priest's garment] of it and put it in his city of Ophrah and all Israel paid homage to it there and it became a snare to Gideon and to his family.
Judges,8,28,Thus was Midian subdued before the Israelites so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had peace and rest for forty years in the days of Gideon.
Judges,8,29,Jerubbaal (Gideon) son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
Judges,8,30,Now Gideon had seventy sons born to him for he had many wives.
Judges,8,31,And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son whom he named Abimelech.
Judges,8,32,Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
Judges,8,33,As soon as Gideon was dead the Israelites turned again and played the harlot after the Baals and made Baal-berith their god.
Judges,8,34,And the Israelites did not remember the Lord their God Who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;
Judges,8,35,Neither did they show kindness to the family of Jerubbaal that is Gideon in return for all the good which he had done for Israel.
Judges,9,1,NOW ABIMELECH son of Jerubbaal (Gideon) went to Shechem to his mother's kinsmen and said to them and to the whole clan of his mother's family
Judges,9,2,Say I pray you in the hearing of all the men of Shechem Which is better for you: that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal reign over you or that one man rule over you? Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
Judges,9,3,And his mother's kinsmen spoke all these words concerning him in the hearing of all the men of Shechem and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech for they said He is our brother.
Judges,9,4,And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and foolhardy men who followed him.
Judges,9,5,And he went to his father's house at Ophrah and slew his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal seventy men on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left for he hid himself.
Judges,9,6,And all the men of Shechem gathered together and all of Beth-millo and they went and made Abimelech king by the oak (terebinth) of the pillar at Shechem.
Judges,9,7,When it was told to Jotham he went and stood at the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted to them Hear me men of Shechem that God may hear you.
Judges,9,8,One time the trees went forth to anoint a king over them and they said to the olive tree Reign over us.
Judges,9,9,But the olive tree said to them Should I leave my fatness by which God and man are honored and go to wave over the trees?
Judges,9,10,Then the trees said to the fig tree You come and reign over us.
Judges,9,11,But the fig tree said to them Should I leave my sweetness and my good fruit and go to wave over the trees?
Judges,9,12,Then the trees said to the vine (grapevine) You come and reign over us.
Judges,9,13,And the vine (grapevine) replied Should I leave my new wine which rejoices God and man and go to wave over the trees?
Judges,9,14,Then all the trees said to the bramble You come and reign over us.
Judges,9,15,And the bramble said to the trees If in good faith you are anointing me king over you then come and take refuge in my shade; but if not let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
Judges,9,16,Now therefore if you acted sincerely and honorably when you made Abimelech king and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house and have done to him as his deeds deserved--
Judges,9,17,For my father fought for you jeopardized his life and rescued you from the hand of Midian;
Judges,9,18,And you have risen up against my father's house this day and have slain his sons seventy men on one stone and have made Abimelech son of his maidservant king over the people of Shechem because he is your kinsman--
Judges,9,19,If you then have acted sincerely and honorably with Jerubbaal and his house this day then rejoice in Abimelech and let him also rejoice in you;
Judges,9,20,But if not let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the people of Shechem and Beth-millo and let fire come out from the people of Shechem and Beth-millo and devour Abimelech.
Judges,9,21,And Jotham ran away and fled and went to Beer and dwelt there for fear of Abimelech his brother.
Judges,9,22,Abimelech reigned three years over Israel.
Judges,9,23,And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech
Judges,9,24,That the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come and that their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother who slew them and upon the men of Shechem who strengthened his hands to slay his brothers.
Judges,9,25,And the men of Shechem set men in ambush against [Abimelech] on the mountaintops and they robbed all who passed by them along that way; and it was told to Abimelech.
Judges,9,26,And Gaal son of Ebed came with his kinsmen and moved into Shechem and the men of Shechem put confidence in him.
Judges,9,27,And they went out into the field gathered their vineyard fruits and trod them and held a festival; and going into the house of their god they ate and drank and cursed Abimelech.
Judges,9,28,Gaal son of Ebed said Who is Abimelech and who are we of Shechem that we should serve him? Were not the son of Jerubbaal and Zebul his officer servants of the men of Hamor the father and founder of Shechem? Then why should we serve him?
Judges,9,29,Would that this people were under my hand! Then would I remove Abimelech and say to him Increase your army and come out.
Judges,9,30,When Zebul the city's mayor heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed his anger was kindled.
Judges,9,31,And he sent messengers to Abimelech slyly saying Behold Gaal son of Ebed and his kinsmen have come to Shechem; and behold they stir up the city to rise against you.
Judges,9,32,Now therefore rise up by night you and the men with you and lie in wait in the field.
Judges,9,33,Then in the morning as soon as the sun is up rise early and set upon the city; and when Gaal and the men with him come out against you do to them as opportunity permits.
Judges,9,34,And Abimelech rose up by night and all the men with him and they laid in wait against Shechem in four companies.
Judges,9,35,And Gaal son of Ebed came out and stood in the entrance of the city's gate. Then Abimelech and the men with him rose up from ambush.
Judges,9,36,When Gaal saw the men he said to Zebul Look men are coming down from the mountaintops! Zebul said to him The shadow of the mountains looks to you like men.
Judges,9,37,And Gaal spoke again and said See men are coming down from the center of the land and one company is coming from the direction of the oak of Meonenim [the sorcerers].
Judges,9,38,Then said Zebul to Gaal Where is your [big] mouth now you who said Who is Abimelech that we should serve him? Are not these the men whom you have despised? Go out now and fight with them.
Judges,9,39,And Gaal went out ahead of the men of Shechem and fought with Abimelech.
Judges,9,40,And Abimelech chased him and he fled before him; and many fell wounded--even to the entrance of the gate.
Judges,9,41,And Abimelech lodged at Arumah and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his kinsmen so that they could not live in Shechem.
Judges,9,42,The next day the men went out into the fields and Abimelech was told.
Judges,9,43,He took his men and divided them into three companies and laid in wait in the field; and he looked and behold the people were coming out of the city. And he rose up against them and smote them.
Judges,9,44,And Abimelech and the company with him rushed forward and stood in the entrance of the city's gate while the two other companies rushed upon all who were in the field and slew them.
Judges,9,45,And Abimelech fought against the city all that day. He took the city and slew the people who were in it. He demolished the city and sowed it with salt.
Judges,9,46,And when all the men of the Tower of Shechem heard of it they entered the stronghold of the house of El-berith [the god of Berith].
Judges,9,47,Abimelech was told that all the people of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together.
Judges,9,48,And Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon he and all the men with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand and cut down a bundle of brush picked it up and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the men with him What you have seen me do make haste to do also.
Judges,9,49,So each of the men cut down his bundle and following Abimelech put it against the stronghold and set [the stronghold] on fire over the people in it so that all the people of the Tower of Shechem also died about 1000 men and women.
Judges,9,50,Then Abimelech went to Thebez and encamped against Thebez and took it.
Judges,9,51,But there was a strong tower in the city and all the people of the city--men and women--fled to it shut themselves in and went to the roof of the tower.
Judges,9,52,And Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it and drew near the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
Judges,9,53,But a certain woman cast an upper millstone [down] upon Abimelech's head and broke his skull.
Judges,9,54,Then he called hastily to the young man his armor-bearer and said to him Draw your sword and slay me so that men may not say of me A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through and he died.
Judges,9,55,And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead they departed each man to his home.
Judges,9,56,Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech which he had done to his father [Gideon] by slaying his seventy brothers;
Judges,9,57,And all the wickedness of the men of Shechem God repaid upon their heads and caused to come upon them the curse of Jotham son of Jerubbaal.
Judges,10,1,AFTER ABIMELECH there arose to rescue Israel Tola son of Puah the son of Dodo a man of Issachar; and he lived at Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.
Judges,10,2,He judged Israel twenty-three years; then he died and was buried in Shamir.
Judges,10,3,After him arose Jair the Gileadite and he judged Israel twenty-two years.
Judges,10,4,And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts and they had thirty towns called Havvoth-jair [towns of Jair] which to this day are in the land of Gilead.
Judges,10,5,And Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
Judges,10,6,And the Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord served the Baals the Ashtaroth [female deities] the gods of Syria the gods of Sidon the gods of Moab the gods of the Ammonites and the gods of the Philistines. They forsook the Lord and did not serve Him.
Judges,10,7,And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites
Judges,10,8,And they oppressed and crushed and broke the Israelites that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites which is in Gilead.
Judges,10,9,And the Ammonites passed over the Jordan to fight against Judah Benjamin and the house of Ephraim so that Israel was sorely distressed.
Judges,10,10,And the Israelites cried to the Lord saying We have sinned against You because we have forsaken our God and have served the Baals.
Judges,10,11,And the Lord said to the Israelites Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians the Amorites the Ammonites and the Philistines?
Judges,10,12,Also when the Sidonians the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed and crushed you you cried to Me and I delivered you out of their hands.
Judges,10,13,Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods; therefore I will deliver you no more.
Judges,10,14,Go cry to the gods you have chosen; let them deliver you in your time of distress.
Judges,10,15,And the Israelites said to the Lord We have sinned do to us whatever seems good to You; only deliver us we pray You this day.
Judges,10,16,So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the Lord and His heart became impatient over the misery of Israel.
Judges,10,17,Then the Ammonites were gathered together and they encamped in Gilead. And the Israelites assembled and encamped at Mizpah.
Judges,10,18,And the leaders of Gilead [the Israelites] said one to another Who is the man who will begin to fight against the Ammonites? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
Judges,11,1,NOW JEPHTHAH the Gileadite was a mighty warrior but he was the son of a harlot. Gilead was Jephthah's father.
Judges,11,2,And Gilead's wife also bore him sons and when his wife's sons grew up they thrust Jephthah out and said to him You shall not have an inheritance in our father's house for you are the son of another woman.
Judges,11,3,Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and dwelt in the land of Tob; and worthless men gathered around Jephthah and went on raids with him.
Judges,11,4,And after a time the Ammonites made war against Israel.
Judges,11,5,And when the Ammonites made war against Israel the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah out of the land of Tob;
Judges,11,6,And they said to Jephthah Come and be our leader that we may fight with the Ammonites.
Judges,11,7,But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead Did you not hate me and drive me out of my father's house? Why have you come to me now when you are in trouble?
Judges,11,8,And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah This is why we have turned to you now that you may go with us and fight the Ammonites and be our head over all the citizens of Gilead.
Judges,11,9,Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead If you bring me home again to fight against the Ammonites and the Lord gives them over to me [understand that] I will be your head.
Judges,11,10,And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah The Lord is witness between us if we do not do as you have said.
Judges,11,11,So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead and the people made him head and leader over them. And Jephthah repeated all he had promised before the Lord at Mizpah.
Judges,11,12,And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites saying What have you to do with me that you have come against me to fight in my land?
Judges,11,13,The Ammonites' king replied to the messengers of Jephthah Because Israel took away my land [which was not true] when they came up out of Egypt [300 years before] from the Arnon even to Jabbok and to the Jordan; now therefore restore those lands peaceably.
Judges,11,14,And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the Ammonites
Judges,11,15,And said to him Thus says Jephthah Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites.
Judges,11,16,But when [Israel] came up from Egypt [they] walked through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.
Judges,11,17,Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom saying Let us we pray pass through your land but the king of Edom would not listen. Also they sent to the king of Moab but he would not consent. So Israel remained at Kadesh.
Judges,11,18,Then they went through the wilderness and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab and came by the east side of the land of Moab and camped on the other side of the Arnon; but they came not within the territory of Moab for the Arnon was the boundary of Moab.
Judges,11,19,Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites king of Heshbon and Israel said to him Let us pass we pray you through your land to our country.
Judges,11,20,But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory; so Sihon gathered all his people together and encamped at Jahaz and fought with Israel.
Judges,11,21,And the Lord the God of Israel gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel and they defeated them; so Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites the inhabitants of that country.
Judges,11,22,They possessed all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon even to the Jabbok and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.
Judges,11,23,So now the Lord God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites from before His people Israel and should you possess them?
Judges,11,24,Will you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? And all the Lord our God dispossessed before us we will possess.
Judges,11,25,Now are you any better than Balak son of Zippor king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel or did he ever go to war with them?
Judges,11,26,While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its villages and in Aroer and its villages and in all the cities along the banks of the Arnon for 300 years why did you not recover [your lost lands] during that time?
Judges,11,27,So I have not sinned against you but you are doing me wrong to war against me. The Lord the [righteous] Judge judge this day between the Israelites and the Ammonites.
Judges,11,28,But the king of the Ammonites did not listen to the message Jephthah sent him.
Judges,11,29,Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh and Mizpah of Gilead and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed on to the Ammonites.
Judges,11,30,And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord and said If You will indeed give the Ammonites into my hand
Judges,11,31,Then whatever or whoever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Ammonites it shall be the Lord's and I will offer it or him up as a burnt offering.
Judges,11,32,Then Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight with them and the Lord gave them into his hand.
Judges,11,33,And from Aroer to Minnith he smote them twenty cities and as far as Abel-cheramim [the meadow of vineyards] with a very great slaughter. So the Ammonites were subdued before the Israelites.
Judges,11,34,Then Jephthah came to Mizpah to his home and behold his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances! And she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
Judges,11,35,And when he saw her he rent his clothes and said Alas my daughter! You have brought me very low and you are the cause of great trouble to me; for I have opened my mouth [in a vow] to the Lord and I cannot take it back.
Judges,11,36,And she said to him My father if you have opened your mouth to the Lord do to me according to what you have vowed since the Lord has taken vengeance for you on your enemies the Ammonites.
Judges,11,37,And she said to her father Let this thing be done for me; let me alone two months that I may go and wander upon the mountains and bewail my virginity I and my companions.
Judges,11,38,And he said Go. And he sent her away for two months and she went with her companions and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
Judges,11,39,At the end of two months she returned to her father who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed. She never mated with a man. This became a custom in Israel--
Judges,11,40,That the daughters of Israel went yearly to mourn the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
Judges,12,1,THE MEN of Ephraim were summoned together and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah Why did you cross over to fight with the Ammonites and did not summon us to go with you? We will burn your house over you with fire.
Judges,12,2,And Jephthah said to them I and my people were in a severe conflict with the Ammonites and I when I called you you did not rescue me from their hands.
Judges,12,3,And when I saw that you would not rescue me I put my life in my hands and crossed over against the Ammonites and the Lord delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?
Judges,12,4,Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim because they had said You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim in the midst of Ephraim and Manasseh.
Judges,12,5,And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan before the Ephraimites; and when any of those Ephraimites who had escaped said Let me go over the men of Gilead said to him Are you an Ephraimite? If he said No
Judges,12,6,They said to him Then say Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and slew him at the fords of the Jordan. And there fell at that time 42000 of the Ephraimites.
Judges,12,7,Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
Judges,12,8,And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
Judges,12,9,And he had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he gave [to husbands] outside his tribe and thirty daughters [daughters-in-law] whom he brought in from outside his tribe for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
Judges,12,10,Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.
Judges,12,11,After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel and he judged Israel ten years.
Judges,12,12,Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
Judges,12,13,And after him Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
Judges,12,14,And he had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkey colts; and he judged Israel eight years.
Judges,12,15,Then Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim in the hill country of the Amalekites.
Judges,13,1,AND THE Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord gave them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years.
Judges,13,2,And there was a certain man of Zorah of the tribe of the Danites whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren and had no children.
Judges,13,3,And the Angel of the Lord appeared to the woman and said to her Behold you are barren and have no children but you shall become pregnant and bear a son.
Judges,13,4,Therefore beware and drink no wine or strong drink and eat nothing unclean.
Judges,13,5,For behold you shall become pregnant and bear a son. No razor shall come upon his head for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from birth and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hands of the Philistines.
Judges,13,6,Then the woman went and told her husband saying A Man of God came to me and his face was like the face of the Angel of God to be greatly and reverently feared. I did not ask him from where he came and he did not tell me his name.
Judges,13,7,But he said to me Behold you shall become pregnant and bear a son and now drink no wine or strong drink and eat nothing unclean for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from birth to the day of his death.
Judges,13,8,Then Manoah entreated the Lord and said O Lord let the Man of God whom You sent come again to us and teach us what we shall do with the child that shall be born.
Judges,13,9,And God listened to the voice of Manoah and the Angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her.
Judges,13,10,And the woman ran in haste and told her husband and said to him Behold the Man who came to me the other day has appeared to me.
Judges,13,11,And Manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the Man and said to him Are you the Man who spoke to this woman? And he said I am.
Judges,13,12,And Manoah said Now when your words come true how shall we manage the child and what is he to do?
Judges,13,13,And the Angel of the Lord said to Manoah Let the mother beware of all that I told her.
Judges,13,14,She may not eat of anything that comes from the grapevine nor drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing. All that I commanded her let her observe.
Judges,13,15,And Manoah said to the Angel of the Lord Pray let us detain you that we may prepare a kid for you.
Judges,13,16,And the Angel of the Lord said to Manoah Though you detain me I will not eat of your food but if you make ready a burnt offering offer it to the Lord. For Manoah did not know that he was the Angel of the Lord.
Judges,13,17,And Manoah said to the Angel of the Lord What is your name so that when your words come true we may do you honor?
Judges,13,18,And the Angel of the Lord said to him Why do you ask my name seeing it is wonderful?
Judges,13,19,So Manoah took the kid with the cereal offering and offered it upon a rock to the Lord the Angel working wonders while Manoah and his wife looked on.
Judges,13,20,For when the flame went up toward the heavens from the altar the Angel of the Lord ascended in the altar flame. And Manoah and his wife looked on and they fell on their faces to the ground.
Judges,13,21,The Angel of the Lord did not appear again to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the Angel of the Lord.
Judges,13,22,And Manoah said to his wife We shall surely die because we have seen God.
Judges,13,23,But his [sensible] wife said to him If the Lord were pleased to kill us He would not have received a burnt offering and a cereal offering from our hands nor have shown us all these things or now have announced such things as these.
Judges,13,24,And the woman [in due time] bore a son and called his name Samson; and the child grew and the Lord blessed him.
Judges,13,25,And the Spirit of the Lord began to move him at times in Mahaneh-dan [the camp of Dan] between Zorah and Eshtaol.
Judges,14,1,SAMSON WENT down to Timnah and at Timnah saw one of the daughters of the Philistines.
Judges,14,2,And he came up and told his father and mother I saw one of the daughters of the Philistines at Timnah; now get her for me as my wife.
Judges,14,3,But his father and mother said to him Is there not a woman among the daughters of your kinsmen or among all our people that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father Get her for me for she is all right in my eyes.
Judges,14,4,His father and mother did not know that it was of the Lord and that He sought an occasion for assailing the Philistines. At that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.
Judges,14,5,Then Samson and his father and mother went down to Timnah and came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold a young lion roared against him.
Judges,14,6,And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him and he tore the lion as he would have torn a kid and he had nothing in his hand; but he did not tell his father or mother what he had done.
Judges,14,7,And he went down and talked with the woman and she pleased Samson well.
Judges,14,8,And after a while he returned to take her and he turned aside to see the body of the lion and behold a swarm of bees and honey were in the body of the lion.
Judges,14,9,And he scraped some of the honey out into his hands and went along eating. And he came to his father and mother and gave them some and they ate it; but he did not tell them he had taken the honey from the body of the lion.
Judges,14,10,His father went down to the woman and Samson made a feast there for that was the customary thing for young men to do.
Judges,14,11,And when the people saw him they brought thirty companions to be with him.
Judges,14,12,And Samson said to them I will now put forth a riddle to you; if you can tell me what it is within the seven days of the feast and find it out then I will give you thirty linen undergarments and thirty changes of raiment.
Judges,14,13,But if you cannot declare it to me then shall you give me thirty linen undergarments and thirty changes of festive [costly] raiment. And they said to him Put forth your riddle that we may hear it.
Judges,14,14,And he said to them Out of the eater came forth food and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not solve the riddle in three days.
Judges,14,15,And on the seventh day they said to Samson's wife Entice your husband to declare to us the riddle lest we burn you and your father's household with fire. Have you invited us to make us poor? Is this not true?
Judges,14,16,And Samson's wife wept before him and said You only hate me you do not love me; you have put forth a riddle to my countrymen and have not told the answer to me. And he said to her Behold I have not told my father or my mother and shall I tell you?
Judges,14,17,And Samson's wife wept before him the seven days their feast lasted and on the seventh day he told her because she pressed him with entreaties. Then she told the riddle to her countrymen.
Judges,14,18,And the men of the city said to [Samson] on the seventh day before sundown What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion? And he said to them If you had not plowed with my heifer you would not have solved my riddle.
Judges,14,19,And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him and he went down to Ashkelon and slew thirty men of them and took their apparel [as spoil] and gave the changes of garments to those who explained the riddle. And his anger was kindled and he went up to his father's house.
Judges,14,20,But Samson's wife was [given] to his companion who was his [best] friend.
Judges,15,1,BUT SOME days later in the time of wheat harvest Samson went to visit his wife taking along a kid [as a token of reconciliation]; and he said I will go unto my wife in the inner chamber. But her father would not allow him to go in.
Judges,15,2,And her father said I truly thought you utterly hated her so I gave her to your companion. Is her younger sister not fairer than she? Take her I pray you instead.
Judges,15,3,And Samson said of them This time shall I be blameless as regards the Philistines though I do them evil.
Judges,15,4,So Samson went and caught 300 foxes or jackals and took torches and turning the foxes tail to tail he put a torch between each pair of tails.
Judges,15,5,And when he had set the torches ablaze he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines and he burned up the shocks and the standing grain along with the olive orchards.
Judges,15,6,Then the Philistines said Who has done this? And they were told Samson the son-in-law of the Timnite because he [the Timnite] has taken his [Samson's] wife and has given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.
Judges,15,7,And Samson said to them If this is the way you act surely I will take revenge on you and after that I will quit.
Judges,15,8,And he smote them hip and thigh [unsparingly] a great slaughter; and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
Judges,15,9,Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and spread themselves in Lehi.
Judges,15,10,And the men of Judah said Why have you come up against us? And they answered We have come up to bind Samson to do to him as he has done to us.
Judges,15,11,Then 3000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock Etam and said to Samson Have you not known that the Philistines are rulers over us? What is this that you have done to us? He said to them As they did to me so have I done to them.
Judges,15,12,And they said to him We have come down to bind you that we may deliver you into the hands of the Philistines. And Samson said to them Swear to me that you will not fall upon me yourselves.
Judges,15,13,And they said to him No we will bind you fast and give you into their hand; but surely we will not kill you. So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.
Judges,15,14,And when he came to Lehi the Philistines came shouting to meet him. And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon [Samson] and the ropes on his arms became as flax that had caught fire and his bonds melted off his hands.
Judges,15,15,And he found a still moist jawbone of a donkey and reached out and took it and slew 1000 men with it.
Judges,15,16,And Samson said With the jawbone of a donkey heaps upon heaps with the jawbone of a donkey I have slain 1000 men!
Judges,15,17,And when he stopped speaking he cast the jawbone from his hand; and that place was called Ramath-lehi [the hill of the jawbone].
Judges,15,18,Samson was very thirsty and he prayed to the Lord and said You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?
Judges,15,19,And God split open the hollow place that was at Lehi and water came out of it. And when he drank his spirit returned and he revived. Therefore the name of it was called En-hakkore [the spring of him who prayed] which is at Lehi to this day.
Judges,15,20,And [Samson] judged (defended) Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
Judges,16,1,THEN SAMSON went to Gaza and saw a harlot there and went in to her.
Judges,16,2,The Gazites were told Samson has come here. So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city. They were quiet all night saying In the morning when it is light we will kill him.
Judges,16,3,But Samson lay until midnight and [then] he arose and took hold of the doors of the city's gate and the two posts and pulling them up bar and all he put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that is before Hebron.
Judges,16,4,After this he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah.
Judges,16,5,And the lords of the Philistines came to her and said to her Entice him and see in what his great strength lies and by what means we may overpower him that we may bind him to subdue him. And we will each give you 1100 pieces of silver.
Judges,16,6,And Delilah said to Samson Tell me I pray you wherein your great strength lies and with what you might be bound to subdue you.
Judges,16,7,And Samson said to her If they bind me with seven fresh strong gutstrings still moist then shall I be weak and be like any other man.
Judges,16,8,Then the Philistine lords brought to her seven fresh strong bowstrings still moist and she bound him with them.
Judges,16,9,Now she had men lying in wait in an inner room. And she said to him The Philistines are upon you Samson! And he broke the bowstrings as a string of tow breaks when it touches the fire. So the secret of his strength was not known.
Judges,16,10,And Delilah said to Samson Behold you have mocked me and told me lies; now tell me I pray you how you might be bound.
Judges,16,11,And he said to her If they bind me fast with new ropes that have not been used then I shall become weak and be like any other man.
Judges,16,12,So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him The Philistines are upon you Samson! And the men lying in wait were in the inner room. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like [sewing] thread.
Judges,16,13,And Delilah said to Samson Until now you have mocked me and told me lies; tell me with what you might be bound. And he said to her If you weave the seven braids of [the hair of] my head with the web.
Judges,16,14,And she did so and fastened it with the pin and said to him The Philistines are upon you Samson! And he awoke out of his sleep and went away with the pin of the [weaver's] beam and with the web.
Judges,16,15,And she said to him How can you say I love you when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times and have not told me in what your great strength lies.
Judges,16,16,And when she pressed him day after day with her words and urged him he was vexed to death.
Judges,16,17,Then he told her all his mind and said to her A razor has never come upon my head for I have been a Nazirite to God from my birth. If I am shaved then my strength will go from me and I shall become weak and be like any other man.
Judges,16,18,And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his mind she went and called for the Philistine lords saying Come up this once for he has told me all he knows. Then the Philistine lords came up to her and brought the money in their hands.
Judges,16,19,And she made Samson sleep upon her knees and she called a man and caused him to shave off the seven braids of his head. Then she began to torment [Samson] and his strength went from him.
Judges,16,20,She said The Philistines are upon you Samson! And he awoke out of his sleep and said I will go out as I have time after time and shake myself free. For Samson did not know that the Lord had departed from him.
Judges,16,21,But the Philistines laid hold of him bored out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with [two] bronze fetters; and he ground at the mill in the prison.
Judges,16,22,But the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.
Judges,16,23,Then the Philistine lords gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice for they said Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hands.
Judges,16,24,And when the people saw Samson they praised their god for they said Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy the ravager of our country who has slain many of us.
Judges,16,25,And when their hearts were merry they said Call for Samson that he may make sport for us. So they called [blind] Samson out of the prison and he made sport before them. They made him stand between the pillars.
Judges,16,26,And Samson said to the lad who held him by the hand Allow me to feel the pillars upon which the house rests that I may lean against them.
Judges,16,27,Now the house was full of men and women; all the Philistine princes were there and on the roof were about 3000 men and women who looked on while Samson made sport.
Judges,16,28,Then Samson called to the Lord and said O Lord God [earnestly] remember me I pray You and strengthen me I pray You only this once O God and let me have one vengeance upon the Philistines for both my eyes.
Judges,16,29,And Samson laid hold of the two middle pillars by which the house was borne up one with his right hand and the other with his left.
Judges,16,30,And Samson cried Let me die with the Philistines! And he bowed himself mightily and the house fell upon the princes and upon all the people that were in it. So the dead whom he slew at his death were more than they whom he slew in his life.
Judges,16,31,Then his kinsmen and all the tribal family of his father came down took his body and brought it up; and they buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial place of Manoah his father. He had judged Israel [that is had defended the Israelites] twenty years.
Judges,17,1,THERE WAS a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah.
Judges,17,2,And he said to his mother The 1100 shekels of silver that were taken from you about which you cursed and also spoke about in my hearing behold I have the silver with me; I took it. And his mother said Blessed be you by the Lord my son!
Judges,17,3,He restored the 1100 shekels of silver to his mother and she said I had truly dedicated the silver to the Lord from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image; now therefore I will restore it to you.
Judges,17,4,So when he restored the money to his mother she took 200 pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith who made of it a graven image and a molten image; and they were in the house of Micah.
Judges,17,5,And the man Micah had a house of gods and he made an ephod and teraphim and dedicated one of his sons who became his priest.
Judges,17,6,In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
Judges,17,7,And there was a young man in Bethlehem of Judah of the family of Judah who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.
Judges,17,8,And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place and as he journeyed he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah.
Judges,17,9,And Micah said to him From where do you come? And he said to him I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.
Judges,17,10,And Micah said to him Dwell with me and be to me a father and a priest and I will give you ten pieces of silver each year a suit of clothes and your living. So the Levite went in.
Judges,17,11,And the Levite was content to dwell with the man and the young man was to Micah as one of his sons.
Judges,17,12,And Micah consecrated the Levite and the young man became his priest and was in the house of Micah.
Judges,17,13,Then said Micah Now I know that the Lord will favor me since I have a Levite to be my priest.
Judges,18,1,IN THOSE days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites sought for itself an inheritance to dwell in for until then no [sufficient] inheritance had been acquired by them among the tribes of Israel.
Judges,18,2,So the Danites sent from the whole number of their tribe five brave men from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and to explore it and they said to them Go explore the land. They came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah and lodged there.
Judges,18,3,When they went by the house of Micah they recognized the voice of the young Levite and they turned aside there and said to him Who brought you here? And what do you do in this place? And what have you here?
Judges,18,4,And he said to them Thus and thus Micah deals with me and has hired me and I am his priest.
Judges,18,5,And they said to him Ask counsel we pray you of God that we may know whether our journey will be successful.
Judges,18,6,And the priest said to them Go in peace. The way in which you go is before (under the eye of) the Lord.
Judges,18,7,Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were there how they dwelt securely after the manner of the Sidonians quiet and feeling safe; and there was no magistrate in the land who might put them to shame in anything or injure them; and they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone.
Judges,18,8,The five men came back to their brethren at Zorah and Eshtaol and their brethren said to them What do you say?
Judges,18,9,They said Arise let us go up against them for we have seen the land and behold it is very fertile. And will you do nothing? Do not be slow to go and enter in and possess the land.
Judges,18,10,When you go you will come to people [feeling] safe and secure. The land is broad [widely extended on all sides]; and God has given it into your hands--a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth.
Judges,18,11,And there went from there of the tribe of the Danites out of Zorah and Eshtaol 600 men armed with weapons of war.
Judges,18,12,And they went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. Therefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan [camp of Dan] to this day; it is west of Kiriath-jearim.
Judges,18,13,And they passed from there to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah's house.
Judges,18,14,Then the five men who had gone to spy out the country of Laish said to their brethren Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod teraphim a graven image and a molten image? Now therefore consider what you have to do.
Judges,18,15,And they turned in that direction and came to the house of the young Levite at the home of Micah and saluted him.
Judges,18,16,Now the 600 Danites with their weapons of war stood at Micah's gate.
Judges,18,17,And the five men who had gone to spy out the land went up and entered the house and took the graven image the ephod the teraphim and the molten image while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed with weapons of war.
Judges,18,18,And when these went into Micah's house and took the carved image the ephod the teraphim and the molten image the priest said to them What are you doing?
Judges,18,19,And they said to him Be still put your hand over your mouth and come with us and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man or that you be a priest to a tribe and family in Israel?
Judges,18,20,And the priest's heart was glad and he took the ephod the teraphim and the graven image and went in the midst of the people.
Judges,18,21,So they turned and departed and put the little ones the cattle and the baggage in front of them.
Judges,18,22,When they were a good way from the house of Micah the men who were Micah's near neighbors were called out and overtook the Danites.
Judges,18,23,They shouted to the Danites who turned and said to Micah What ails you that you come with such a company?
Judges,18,24,And he said You take away my gods which I made and the priest and go away; and what have I left? How can you say to me What ails you?
Judges,18,25,And the men of Dan said to him Let not your voice be heard among us lest angry fellows fall upon you and you lose your life with the lives of your household.
Judges,18,26,And the Danites went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him he turned and went back to his house.
Judges,18,27,And they took the things which Micah had made and his priest and came to Laish to a people quiet and feeling secure and they smote them with the sword and burned the city.
Judges,18,28,And there was no deliverer because it was far from Sidon and they had no business with anyone. It was in the valley which belongs to Beth-rehob. And they rebuilt the city and dwelt in it.
Judges,18,29,They named the city Dan after Dan their forefather who was born to Israel; however the name of the city was Laish at first.
Judges,18,30,And the Danites set up the graven image for themselves; and Jonathan son of Gershom the son of Moses and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.
Judges,18,31,So they set them up Micah's graven image which he made as long as the house of God was at Shiloh.
Judges,19,1,IN THOSE days when there was no king in Israel a certain Levite was living temporarily in the most remote part of the hill district of Ephraim who took to himself a concubine [of inferior status than a wife] from Bethlehem in Judah.
Judges,19,2,And his concubine was untrue to him and went away from him to her father's house at Bethlehem of Judah and stayed there the space of four months.
Judges,19,3,Then her husband arose and went after her to speak kindly to her [to her heart] and to bring her back having with him his servant and a couple of donkeys. And she brought him into her father's house and when her father saw him he rejoiced to meet him.
Judges,19,4,And his father-in-law the girl's father [insistently] detained him and he remained with him three days. So they ate and drank and he lodged there.
Judges,19,5,On the fourth day they arose early in the morning and the [Levite] prepared to leave but the girl's father said to his son-in-law Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread and afterward go your way.
Judges,19,6,So both men sat down and ate and drank together and the girl's father said to the man Consent to stay all night and let your heart be merry.
Judges,19,7,And when the man rose up to depart his father-in-law urged him; so he lodged there again.
Judges,19,8,And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart but the girl's father said Strengthen your heart and tarry until toward evening. So they ate both of them.
Judges,19,9,And when the man and his concubine and his servant rose up to leave his father-in-law the girl's father said to him Behold now the day draws toward evening I pray you stay all night. Behold now the day grows to an end lodge here and let your heart be merry and tomorrow get early on your way and go home.
Judges,19,10,But the man would not stay that night; so he rose up and departed and came opposite to Jebus which is Jerusalem. With him were two saddled donkeys [and his servant] and his concubine.
Judges,19,11,When they were near Jebus it was late and the servant said to his master Come I pray and let us turn into this Jebusite city and lodge in it.
Judges,19,12,His master said to him We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners where there are no Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah.
Judges,19,13,And he said to his servant Come and let us go to one of these places and spend the night in Gibeah or in Ramah.
Judges,19,14,So they passed on and went their way and the sun went down on them near Gibeah which belongs to Benjamin
Judges,19,15,And they turned aside there to go in and lodge at Gibeah. And the Levite went in and sat down in the open square of the city for no man took them into his house to spend the night.
Judges,19,16,And behold an old man was coming from his work in the field at evening. He was from the hill country of Ephraim but was living temporarily in Gibeah but the men of the place were Benjamites.
Judges,19,17,And when he looked up he saw the wayfarer in the city square and the old man said Where are you going? And from where did you come?
Judges,19,18,The Levite replied We are passing from Bethlehem of Judah to the rear side of the hill country of Ephraim; I am from there. I went to Bethlehem of Judah but I am [now] going [home] to the house of the Lord [where I serve] and there is no man who receives me into his house.
Judges,19,19,Yet we have both straw and provender for our donkeys and bread and wine also for me your handmaid and the young man who is with your servants; there is no lack of anything.
Judges,19,20,And the old man said Peace be to you but leave all your wants to me; only do not lodge in the street.
Judges,19,21,So he brought him into his house and gave provender to the donkeys. And the guests washed their feet and ate and drank.
Judges,19,22,Now as they were making their hearts merry behold the men of the city certain worthless fellows beset the house round about beat on the door and said to the master of the house the old man Bring forth the man who came to your house that we may have intercourse with him.
Judges,19,23,And the man the master of the house went out and said to them No my kinsmen I pray you do not act so wickedly; seeing that this man is my guest do not do this [wicked] folly.
Judges,19,24,Behold here are my virgin daughter and this man's concubine; them I will bring out now; debase them and do with them what seems good to you but to this man do not so vile a thing.
Judges,19,25,But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and forced her forth to them and they had intercourse with her and abused her all the night until morning. And when the dawn began to break they let her go.
Judges,19,26,At daybreak the woman came and fell down and lay at the door of the man's house where her master was till it was light.
Judges,19,27,And her master rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way; and behold his concubine had fallen down at the door of the house and her hands were upon the threshold.
Judges,19,28,And he said to her Up and let us be going. But there was no answer [for she was dead]. Then he put her [body] upon the donkey and the man rose up and went home.
Judges,19,29,And when he came into his house he took a knife and took hold of his dead concubine and divided her [body] limb by limb into twelve pieces and sent her [body] throughout all the territory of Israel.
Judges,19,30,And all who saw it said There was no such deed done or seen from the day that the Israelites came up out of the land of Egypt to this day; consider it take counsel and speak [your minds].
Judges,20,1,THEN ALL the Israelites came out and the congregation assembled as one man to the Lord at Mizpah from Dan even to Beersheba including the land of Gilead.
Judges,20,2,And the chiefs of all the people of all the tribes of Israel presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God 400000 men on foot who drew the sword.
Judges,20,3,(Now the Benjamites [among whom the vile tragedy occurred] heard that the [other] Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) There the Israelites asked How did this wickedness happen?
Judges,20,4,And the Levite the husband of the woman who was murdered replied I came to Gibeah which belongs to Benjamin I and my concubine to spend the night.
Judges,20,5,And the men of Gibeah rose against me and beset the house round about me by night; they meant to kill me and they raped my concubine and she is dead.
Judges,20,6,And I took my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel for they have committed abomination and [wicked] folly in Israel.
Judges,20,7,Behold you Israelites all of you give here your advice and counsel.
Judges,20,8,And all the people arose as one man saying Not any of us will go to his tent and none of us will return to his home.
Judges,20,9,But now this we will do to Gibeah: we will go up by lot against it
Judges,20,10,And we will take ten men of 100 throughout all the tribes of Israel and 100 of 1000 and 1000 out of 10000 to bring provisions for the men that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin they may do to them according to all the [wicked] folly which they have committed in Israel.
Judges,20,11,So all the men of Israel gathered against the city united as one man.
Judges,20,12,And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin saying What wickedness is this that has been done among you?
Judges,20,13,Now therefore give up the men [involved] the base fellows in Gibeah that we may put them to death and put away evil from Israel. But the Benjamites would not listen to the voice of their kinsmen the Israelites.
Judges,20,14,But the Benjamites out of the cities assembled at Gibeah to go out to battle against the other Israelites.
Judges,20,15,And the Benjamites mustered out of their cities at that time 26000 men who drew the sword besides the inhabitants of Gibeah who mustered 700 chosen men.
Judges,20,16,Among all these were 700 chosen left-handed men; every one could sling stones at a hair and not miss.
Judges,20,17,And the men of Israel other than Benjamin mustered 400000 men who drew the sword; all these were men of war.
Judges,20,18,The Israelites arose and went up to the house of God [Bethel] and asked counsel of God and said Which of us shall take the lead to battle against the Benjamites? And the Lord said Judah shall go up first.
Judges,20,19,Then the Israelites rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.
Judges,20,20,And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin and set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.
Judges,20,21,The Benjamites came forth out of Gibeah and felled to the ground that day 22000 men of the Israelites.
Judges,20,22,But the people the men of Israel took courage and strengthened themselves and again set their battle line in the same place where they formed it the first day.
Judges,20,23,And the Israelites went up and wept before the Lord until evening and asked of the Lord Shall we go up again to battle against our brethren the Benjamites? And the Lord said Go up against them.
Judges,20,24,So the Israelites came near against the Benjamites the second day.
Judges,20,25,And Benjamin went forth out of Gibeah against them the second day and felled to the ground the Israelites again 18000 men all of whom were swordsmen.
Judges,20,26,Then all the Israelites the whole army went up and came to the house of God [Bethel] and wept; and they sat there before the Lord and fasted that day until evening and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord.
Judges,20,27,And the Israelites inquired of the Lord--for the ark of the covenant of God was there [at Bethel] in those days
Judges,20,28,And Phinehas son of Eleazar the son of Aaron ministered before it in those days--saying Shall we yet again go out to battle against our brethren the Benjamites or shall we quit? And the Lord said Go up for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.
Judges,20,29,So Israel set men in ambush round about Gibeah.
Judges,20,30,And the Israelites went up against the Benjamites on the third day and set themselves in array against Gibeah as at other times.
Judges,20,31,And the Benjamites went out against their army and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite and kill some of the people as at other times in the highways one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah and in the open country--about thirty men of Israel.
Judges,20,32,And the Benjamites said They are routed before us as at first. But the Israelites said Let us flee and draw them from the city to the highways.
Judges,20,33,And all the men of Israel rose out of their places and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar and the men of Israel in ambush rushed out of their place in the meadow of Geba.
Judges,20,34,And there came against Gibeah 10000 chosen men out of all Israel and the battle was hard; but the Benjamites did not know disaster was close upon them.
Judges,20,35,And the Lord overcame Benjamin before Israel and the Israelites destroyed of the Benjamites that day 25100 men all of whom were swordsmen.
Judges,20,36,So the Benjamites saw that they were defeated. The men of Israel gave ground to the Benjamites because they trusted in the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah.
Judges,20,37,And the men in ambush quickly rushed upon Gibeah and the liers-in-wait moved out and smote all the city with the sword.
Judges,20,38,Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that when they made a great cloud of smoke arise from the city
Judges,20,39,The men of Israel should all turn back in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to smite and kill some of the men of Israel about thirty persons. They said Surely they are falling before us as in the first battle.
Judges,20,40,But when the [signal] cloud began to rise out of the city in a pillar of smoke the Benjamites looked behind them and behold the whole of the city went up in smoke to the heavens.
Judges,20,41,When the men of Israel turned back again the men of Benjamin were dismayed for they saw that disaster had come upon them.
Judges,20,42,Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel and fled toward the wilderness but the battle followed close behind and overtook them; and the inhabitants of the cities destroyed those [Benjamites] who came through them in their midst.
Judges,20,43,They surrounded the Benjamites pursued them and overtook and trod them down at their resting-place as far as opposite Gibeah toward the east.
Judges,20,44,And there fell 18000 men of Benjamin all of them men of valor.
Judges,20,45,And [the Benjamites] turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon and Israel picked off on the highways 5000 men of them; they pursued hard after them to Gidom and slew 2000 more of them.
Judges,20,46,So that all of Benjamin who fell that day were 25000 men who drew the sword all of them men of valor.
Judges,20,47,But 600 men turned and fled to the wilderness to the rock Rimmon and remained at the rock Rimmon four months.
Judges,20,48,And the men of Israel turned back against the Benjamites and smote them with the sword men and beasts and all that they found. Also they set on fire all the towns to which they came.
Judges,21,1,NOW THE men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah None of us shall give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin.
Judges,21,2,And the Israelites came to the house of God [Bethel] and sat there until evening before God and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly.
Judges,21,3,And they said O Lord the God of Israel why has this come to pass in Israel that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?
Judges,21,4,And next morning the people rose early and built there an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
Judges,21,5,And the Israelites said Which among all the tribes of Israel did not come up with the assembly to the Lord? For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the Lord to Mizpah saying He shall surely die.
Judges,21,6,And the Israelites changed their purpose [and had compassion] for the Benjamites their kinsmen and said There is one tribe cut off from Israel today.
Judges,21,7,What shall we do for wives for those who are left seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them our daughters as wives?
Judges,21,8,And they said Which one is there of the tribes of Israel that did not come up to Mizpah to the Lord? And behold no one had come to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.
Judges,21,9,For when the people were mustered behold not one of the citizens of Jabesh-gilead was there.
Judges,21,10,And the congregation sent there 12000 of the bravest men saying Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the sword also the women and the little ones.
Judges,21,11,And this is what you shall do; utterly destroy every male and every woman who is not a virgin.
Judges,21,12,And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins who had known no man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan.
Judges,21,13,And the whole congregation sent word to the Benjamites who were at the rock of Rimmon and invited them to be friendly with them.
Judges,21,14,And Benjamin returned at that time and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead; and yet there were not enough for them.
Judges,21,15,And the people had compassion on Benjamin because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
Judges,21,16,Then the elders of the congregation said What shall we do for wives for those who are left since the women of Benjamin are destroyed?
Judges,21,17,And they said There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin so that a tribe shall not be wiped out of Israel.
Judges,21,18,But we cannot give them wives of our daughters for the Israelites have sworn Cursed be he who gives a wife to Benjamin.
Judges,21,19,So they said Behold there is the yearly feast of the Lord at Shiloh which is north of Bethel on the east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem and south of Lebonah.
Judges,21,20,So they commanded the Benjamites Go and lie in wait in the vineyards
Judges,21,21,And watch; if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances then come out of the vineyards and catch every man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh and go to the land of Benjamin.
Judges,21,22,And when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain we will say to them Grant them graciously unto us because we did not reserve a wife for each of them in battle neither did you give wives to them for that would have made you guilty [of breaking your oath].
Judges,21,23,And the Benjamites did so and took wives according to their number from the dancers whom they carried off; then they went and returned to their inheritance and repaired the towns and dwelt in them.
Judges,21,24,And the Israelites left there then every man to his tribe and family and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.
Judges,21,25,In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
Ruth,1,1,IN THE days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem of Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab he his wife and his two sons.
Ruth,1,2,The man's name was Elimelech and his wife's name was Naomi and his two sons were named Mahlon [invalid] and Chilion [pining]; they were Ephrathites from Bethlehem of Judah. They went to the country of Moab and continued there.
Ruth,1,3,But Elimelech who Naomi's husband died and she was left with her two sons.
Ruth,1,4,And they took wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. They dwelt there about ten years;
Ruth,1,5,And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them so the woman was bereft of her two sons and her husband.
Ruth,1,6,Then she arose with her daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab for she had heard in Moab how the Lord had visited His people in giving them food.
Ruth,1,7,So she left the place where she was her two daughters-in-law with her and they started on the way back to Judah.
Ruth,1,8,But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law Go return each of you to her mother's house. May the Lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me.
Ruth,1,9,The Lord grant that you may find a home and rest each in the house of her husband! Then she kissed them and they wept aloud.
Ruth,1,10,And they said to her No we will return with you to your people.
Ruth,1,11,But Naomi said Turn back my daughters why will you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb that may become your husbands?
Ruth,1,12,Turn back my daughters go; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope even if I should have a husband tonight and should bear sons
Ruth,1,13,Would you therefore wait till they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No my daughters; it is far more bitter for me than for you that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.
Ruth,1,14,Then they wept aloud again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law [good-bye] but Ruth clung to her.
Ruth,1,15,And Naomi said See your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.
Ruth,1,16,And Ruth said Urge me not to leave you or to turn back from following you; for where you go I will go and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people and your God my God.
Ruth,1,17,Where you die I will die and there will I be buried. The Lord do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you.
Ruth,1,18,When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her she said no more.
Ruth,1,19,So they both went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when they arrived in Bethlehem the whole town was stirred about them and said Is this Naomi?
Ruth,1,20,And she said to them Call me not Naomi [pleasant]; call me Mara [bitter] for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
Ruth,1,21,I went out full but the Lord has brought me home again empty. Why call me Naomi since the Lord has testified against me and the Almighty has afflicted me?
Ruth,1,22,So Naomi returned and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her who returned from the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.
Ruth,2,1,NOW NAOMI had a kinsman of her husband's a man of wealth of the family of Elimelech whose name was Boaz.
Ruth,2,2,And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi Let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor. Naomi said to her Go my daughter.
Ruth,2,3,And [Ruth] went and gleaned in a field after the reapers; and she happened to stop at the part of the field belonging to Boaz who was of the family of Elimelech.
Ruth,2,4,And behold Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers The Lord be with you! And they answered him The Lord bless you!
Ruth,2,5,Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers Whose maiden is this?
Ruth,2,6,And the servant set over the reapers answered She is the Moabitish girl who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab.
Ruth,2,7,And she said I pray you let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came and has continued from early morning until now except when she rested a little in the house.
Ruth,2,8,Then Boaz said to Ruth Listen my daughter do not go to glean in another field or leave this one but stay here close by my maidens.
Ruth,2,9,Watch which field they reap and follow them. Have I not charged the young men not to molest you? And when you are thirsty go to the vessels and drink what the young men have drawn.
Ruth,2,10,Then she fell on her face bowing to the ground and said to him Why have I found favor in your eyes that you should notice me when I am a foreigner?
Ruth,2,11,And Boaz said to her I have been made fully aware of all you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband and how you have left your father and mother and the land of your birth and have come to a people unknown to you before.
Ruth,2,12,The Lord recompense you for what you have done and a full reward be given you by the Lord the God of Israel under Whose wings you have come to take refuge!
Ruth,2,13,Then she said Let me find favor in your sight my lord. For you have comforted me and have spoken to the heart of your maidservant though I am not as one of your maidservants.
Ruth,2,14,And at mealtime Boaz said to her Come here and eat of the bread and dip your morsel in the sour wine [mixed with oil]. And she sat beside the reapers; and he passed her some parched grain and she ate until she was satisfied and she had some left [for Naomi].
Ruth,2,15,And when she got up to glean Boaz ordered his young men Let her glean even among the sheaves and do not reproach her.
Ruth,2,16,And let fall some handfuls for her on purpose and let them lie there for her to glean and do not rebuke her.
Ruth,2,17,So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned. It was about an ephah of barley.
Ruth,2,18,And she took it up and went into the town; she showed her mother-in-law what she had gleaned and she also brought forth and gave her the food she had reserved after she was satisfied.
Ruth,2,19,And her mother-in-law said to her Where have you gleaned today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who noticed you. So [Ruth] told [her] The name of him with whom I worked today is Boaz.
Ruth,2,20,And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law Blessed be he of the Lord who has not ceased his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her The man is a near relative of ours one who has the right to redeem us.
Ruth,2,21,And Ruth the Moabitess said He said to me also Stay close to my young men until they have harvested my entire crop.
Ruth,2,22,And Naomi said to Ruth It is good my daughter for you to go out with his maidens lest in any other field you be molested.
Ruth,2,23,So she kept close to the maidens of Boaz gleaning until the end of the barley and wheat harvests. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
Ruth,3,1,THEN NAOMI her mother-in-law said to Ruth My daughter shall I not seek rest or a home for you that you may prosper?
Ruth,3,2,And now is not Boaz with whose maidens you were our relative? See he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.
Ruth,3,3,Wash and anoint yourself therefore and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing floor but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
Ruth,3,4,But when he lies down notice the place where he lies; then go and uncover his feet and lie down. And he will tell you what to do.
Ruth,3,5,And Ruth said to her All that you say to me I will do.
Ruth,3,6,So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had told her.
Ruth,3,7,And when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then [Ruth] came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down.
Ruth,3,8,At midnight the man was startled and he turned over and behold a woman lay at his feet!
Ruth,3,9,And he said Who are you? And she answered I am Ruth your maidservant. Spread your wing [of protection] over your maidservant for you are a next of kin.
Ruth,3,10,And he said Blessed be you of the Lord my daughter. For you have made this last loving-kindness greater than the former for you have not gone after young men whether poor or rich.
Ruth,3,11,And now my daughter fear not. I will do for you all you require for all my people in the city know that you are a woman of strength (worth bravery capability).
Ruth,3,12,It is true that I am your near kinsman; however there is a kinsman nearer than I.
Ruth,3,13,Remain tonight and in the morning if he will perform for you the part of a kinsman good; let him do it. But if he will not do the part of a kinsman for you then as the Lord lives I will do the part of a kinsman for you. Lie down until the morning.
Ruth,3,14,And she lay at his feet until the morning but arose before one could recognize another; for he said Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.
Ruth,3,15,Also he said Bring the mantle you are wearing and hold it. So [Ruth] held it and he measured out six measures of barley and laid it on her. And she went into the town.
Ruth,3,16,And when she came home her mother-in-law said How have you fared my daughter? And Ruth told her all that the man had done for her.
Ruth,3,17,And she said He gave me these six measures of barley for he said to me Do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law.
Ruth,3,18,Then said she Sit still my daughter until you learn how the matter turns out; for the man will not rest until he finishes the matter today.
Ruth,4,1,THEN BOAZ went up to the city's gate and sat down there and behold the kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken came by. He said to him Ho! Turn aside and sit down here. So he turned aside and sat down.
Ruth,4,2,And Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city and said Sit down here. And they sat down.
Ruth,4,3,And he said to the kinsman Naomi who has returned from the country of Moab has sold the parcel of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech.
Ruth,4,4,And I thought to let you hear of it saying Buy it in the presence of those sitting here and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it redeem it; but if you will not redeem it then say so that I may know; for there is no one besides you to redeem it and I am [next of kin] after you. And he said I will redeem it.
Ruth,4,5,Then Boaz said The day you buy the field of Naomi you must buy also Ruth the Moabitess the widow of the dead man to restore the name of the dead to his inheritance.
Ruth,4,6,And the kinsman said I cannot redeem it for myself lest [by marrying a Moabitess] I endanger my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself for I cannot redeem it.
Ruth,4,7,Now formerly in Israel this was the custom concerning redeeming and exchanging. To confirm a transaction a man pulled off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the way of attesting in Israel.
Ruth,4,8,Therefore when the kinsman said to Boaz Buy it for yourself he pulled off his sandal.
Ruth,4,9,And Boaz said to the elders and to all the people You are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech's and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's from the hand of Naomi.
Ruth,4,10,Also Ruth the Moabitess the widow of Mahlon I have bought to be my wife to restore the name of the dead to his inheritance that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his birthplace. You are witnesses this day.
Ruth,4,11,And all the people at the gate and the elders said We are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah the two who built the household of Israel. May you do worthily and get wealth (power) in Ephratah and be famous in Bethlehem.
Ruth,4,12,And let your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah because of the offspring which the Lord will give you by this young woman.
Ruth,4,13,So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. And he went in to her and the Lord caused her to conceive and she bore a son.
Ruth,4,14,And the women said to Naomi Blessed be the Lord Who has not left you this day without a close kinsman and may his name be famous in Israel.
Ruth,4,15,And may he be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher and supporter in your old age for your daughter-in-law who loves you who is better to you than seven sons has borne him.
Ruth,4,16,Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her bosom and became his nurse.
Ruth,4,17,And her neighbor women gave him a name saying A son is born to Naomi. They named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse the father of David [the ancestor of Jesus Christ].
Ruth,4,18,Now these are the descendants of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron
Ruth,4,19,Hezron of Ram Ram of Amminadab
Ruth,4,20,Amminadab of Nahshon Nahshon of Salmon
Ruth,4,21,Salmon of Boaz Boaz of Obed
Ruth,4,22,Obed of Jesse and Jesse of David [the ancestor of Jesus Christ].
1 Samuel,1,1,THERE WAS a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim named Elkanah son of Jeroham the son of Elihu the son of Tohu the son of Zuph an Ephraimite.
1 Samuel,1,2,He had two wives one named Hannah and the other named Peninnah. Peninnah had children but Hannah had none.
1 Samuel,1,3,This man went from his city year by year to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of hosts at Shiloh where Hophni and Phinehas the two sons of Eli were the Lord's priests.
1 Samuel,1,4,When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed he would give to Peninnah his wife and all her sons and daughters portions [of the sacrificial meat].
1 Samuel,1,5,But to Hannah he gave a double portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord had given her no children.
1 Samuel,1,6,[This embarrassed and grieved Hannah] and her rival provoked her greatly to vex her because the Lord had left her childless.
1 Samuel,1,7,So it was year after year; whenever Hannah went up to the Lord's house Peninnah provoked her so she wept and did not eat.
1 Samuel,1,8,Then Elkanah her husband said to her Hannah why do you cry? And why do you not eat? And why are you grieving? Am I not more to you than ten sons?
1 Samuel,1,9,So Hannah rose after they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat beside a post of the temple (tent) of the Lord.
1 Samuel,1,10,And [Hannah] was in distress of soul praying to the Lord and weeping bitterly.
1 Samuel,1,11,She vowed saying O Lord of hosts if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your handmaid and [earnestly] remember and not forget Your handmaid but will give me a son I will give him to the Lord all his life; no razor shall touch his head.
1 Samuel,1,12,And as she continued praying before the Lord Eli noticed her mouth.
1 Samuel,1,13,Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought she was drunk.
1 Samuel,1,14,Eli said to her How long will you be intoxicated? Put wine away from you.
1 Samuel,1,15,But Hannah answered No my lord I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but I was pouring out my soul before the Lord.
1 Samuel,1,16,Regard not your handmaid as a wicked woman; for out of my great complaint and bitter provocation I have been speaking.
1 Samuel,1,17,Then Eli said Go in peace and may the God of Israel grant your petition which you have asked of Him.
1 Samuel,1,18,Hannah said Let your handmaid find grace in your sight. So [she] went her way and ate her countenance no longer sad.
1 Samuel,1,19,The family rose early the next morning worshiped before the Lord and returned to their home in Ramah. Elkanah knew Hannah his wife and the Lord remembered her.
1 Samuel,1,20,Hannah became pregnant and in due time bore a son and named him Samuel [heard of God] Because she said I have asked him of the Lord.
1 Samuel,1,21,And Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the Lord the yearly sacrifice and pay his vow.
1 Samuel,1,22,But Hannah did not go for she said to her husband I will not go until the child is weaned and then I will bring him that he may appear before the Lord and remain there as long as he lives.
1 Samuel,1,23,Elkanah her husband said to her Do what seems best to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may the Lord establish His word. So Hannah remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.
1 Samuel,1,24,When she had weaned him she took him with her with a three-year-old bull an ephah of flour and a skin bottle of wine [to pour over the burnt offering for a sweet odor] and brought Samuel to the Lord's house in Shiloh. The child was growing.
1 Samuel,1,25,Then they slew the bull and brought the child to Eli.
1 Samuel,1,26,Hannah said Oh my lord! As your soul lives my lord I am the woman who stood by you here praying to the Lord.
1 Samuel,1,27,For this child I prayed and the Lord has granted my petition made to Him.
1 Samuel,1,28,Therefore I have given him to the Lord; as long as he lives he is given to the Lord. And they worshiped the Lord there.
1 Samuel,2,1,HANNAH PRAYED and said My heart exults and triumphs in the Lord; my horn (my strength) is lifted up in the Lord. My mouth is no longer silent for it is opened wide over my enemies because I rejoice in Your salvation.
1 Samuel,2,2,There is none holy like the Lord there is none besides You; there is no Rock like our God.
1 Samuel,2,3,Talk no more so very proudly; let not arrogance go forth from your mouth for the Lord is a God of knowledge and by Him actions are weighed.
1 Samuel,2,4,The bows of the mighty are broken and those who stumbled are girded with strength.
1 Samuel,2,5,Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger. The barren has borne seven but she who has many children languishes and is forlorn.
1 Samuel,2,6,The Lord slays and makes alive; He brings down to Sheol and raises up.
1 Samuel,2,7,The Lord makes poor and makes rich; He brings low and He lifts up.
1 Samuel,2,8,He raises up the poor out of the dust and lifts up the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with nobles and inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's and He has set the world upon them.
1 Samuel,2,9,He will guard the feet of His godly ones but the wicked shall be silenced and perish in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
1 Samuel,2,10,The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces; against them will He thunder in heaven. The Lord will judge [all peoples] to the ends of the earth; and He will give strength to His king (King) and exalt the power of His anointed (Anointed His Christ).
1 Samuel,2,11,Elkanah and his wife Hannah returned to Ramah to his house. But the child ministered to the Lord before Eli the priest.
1 Samuel,2,12,The sons of Eli were base and worthless; they did not know or regard the Lord.
1 Samuel,2,13,And the custom of the priests with the people was this: when any man offered sacrifice the priest's servant came while the flesh was boiling with a fleshhook of three prongs in his hand;
1 Samuel,2,14,And he thrust it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh with all the Israelites who came there.
1 Samuel,2,15,Also before they burned the fat the priest's servant came and said to the man who sacrificed Give the priest meat to roast for he will not accept boiled meat from you but raw.
1 Samuel,2,16,And if the man said to him Let them burn the fat first and then you may take as much as you want the priest's servant would say No! Give it to me now or I will take it by force.
1 Samuel,2,17,So the sin of the [two] young men was very great before the Lord for they despised the offering of the Lord.
1 Samuel,2,18,But Samuel ministered before the Lord a child girded with a linen ephod.
1 Samuel,2,19,Moreover his mother made him a little robe and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
1 Samuel,2,20,And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say May the Lord give you children by this woman for the gift she asked for and gave to the Lord. Then they would go to their own home.
1 Samuel,2,21,And the Lord visited Hannah so that she bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the Lord.
1 Samuel,2,22,Now Eli was very old and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel and how they lay with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
1 Samuel,2,23,And he said to them Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people.
1 Samuel,2,24,No my sons; it is no good report which I hear the Lord's people spreading abroad.
1 Samuel,2,25,If one man wrongs another God will mediate for him; but if a man wrongs the Lord who shall intercede for him? Yet they did not listen to their father for it was the Lord's will to slay them.
1 Samuel,2,26,Now the boy Samuel grew and was in favor both with the Lord and with men.
1 Samuel,2,27,A man of God came to Eli and said to him Thus has the Lord said: I plainly revealed Myself to the house of your father [forefather Aaron] when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh's house.
1 Samuel,2,28,Moreover I selected him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest to offer on My altar to burn incense to wear an ephod before Me. And I gave [from then on] to the house of your father [forefather] all the offerings of the Israelites made by fire.
1 Samuel,2,29,Why then do you kick [trample upon treat with contempt] My sacrifice and My offering which I commanded and honor your sons above Me by fattening yourselves upon the choicest part of every offering of My people Israel?
1 Samuel,2,30,Therefore the Lord the God of Israel says I did promise that your house and that of your father [forefather Aaron] should go in and out before Me forever. But now the Lord says Be it far from Me. For those who honor Me I will honor and those who despise Me shall be lightly esteemed.
1 Samuel,2,31,Behold the time is coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your own father's house that there shall not be an old man in your house.
1 Samuel,2,32,And you shall behold the distress of My house even in all the prosperity which God will give Israel and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.
1 Samuel,2,33,Yet I will not cut off from My altar every man of yours; some shall survive to weep and mourn [over the family's ruin] but all the increase of your house shall die in their best years.
1 Samuel,2,34,And what befalls your two sons Hophni and Phinehas shall be a sign to you--in one day they both shall die. [Fulfilled in I Sam. 4:17 18.]
1 Samuel,2,35,And I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest (Priest) who shall do according to what is in My heart and mind. And I will build him a sure house and he shall walk before My anointed (Anointed) forever.
1 Samuel,2,36,Everyone who is left in your house shall come crouching to him for a piece of silver and a bit of bread and say Put me I pray you into a priest's office so I may have a piece of bread.
1 Samuel,3,1,NOW THE boy Samuel ministered to the Lord before Eli. The word of the Lord was rare and precious in those days; there was no frequent or widely spread vision.
1 Samuel,3,2,At that time Eli whose eyesight had dimmed so that he could not see was lying down in his own place.
1 Samuel,3,3,The lamp of God had not yet gone out in the temple of the Lord where the ark of God was and Samuel was lying down
1 Samuel,3,4,When the Lord called Samuel! And he answered Here I am.
1 Samuel,3,5,He ran to Eli and said Here I am for you called me. Eli said I did not call you; lie down again. So he went and lay down.
1 Samuel,3,6,And the Lord called again Samuel! And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said Here am I; you did call me. Eli answered I did not call my son; lie down again.
1 Samuel,3,7,Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord and the word of the Lord was not yet revealed to him.
1 Samuel,3,8,And the Lord called Samuel the third time. And he went to Eli and said Here I am for you did call me. Then Eli perceived that the Lord was calling the boy.
1 Samuel,3,9,So Eli said to Samuel Go lie down. And if He calls you you shall say Speak Lord for Your servant is listening. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
1 Samuel,3,10,And the Lord came and stood and called as at other times Samuel! Samuel! Then Samuel answered Speak Lord for Your servant is listening.
1 Samuel,3,11,The Lord told Samuel Behold I am about to do a thing in Israel at which both ears of all who hear it shall tingle.
1 Samuel,3,12,On that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house from beginning to end.
1 Samuel,3,13,And I [now] announce to him that I will judge and punish his house forever for the iniquity of which he knew for his sons were bringing a curse upon themselves [blaspheming God] and he did not restrain them.
1 Samuel,3,14,Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for or purged with sacrifice or offering forever.
1 Samuel,3,15,Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the Lord's house. And [he] was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.
1 Samuel,3,16,But Eli called Samuel and said Samuel my son. And he answered Here I am.
1 Samuel,3,17,Eli said What is it He told you? Pray do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also if you hide anything from me of all that He said to you.
1 Samuel,3,18,And Samuel told him everything hiding nothing. And Eli said It is the Lord; let Him do what seems good to Him.
1 Samuel,3,19,Samuel grew; the Lord was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.
1 Samuel,3,20,And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord.
1 Samuel,3,21,And the Lord continued to appear in Shiloh for the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh through the word of the Lord.
1 Samuel,4,1,AND THE word of [the Lord through] Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines and encamped beside Ebenezer; the Philistines encamped at Aphek.
1 Samuel,4,2,The Philistines drew up against Israel and when the battle spread Israel was smitten by the Philistines who slew about 4000 men on the battlefield.
1 Samuel,4,3,When the troops had come into the camp the elders of Israel said Why has the Lord smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord here from Shiloh that He may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies.
1 Samuel,4,4,So the people sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts Who dwells above the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli Hophni and Phinehas were with the ark of the covenant of God.
1 Samuel,4,5,And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp all Israel shouted with a great shout so that the earth resounded.
1 Samuel,4,6,And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout they said What does this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean? When they understood that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp
1 Samuel,4,7,The Philistines were afraid for they said God has come into the camp. And they said Woe to us! For such a thing has not happened before.
1 Samuel,4,8,Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that smote the Egyptians with every kind of plague in the wilderness.
1 Samuel,4,9,Be strong and acquit yourselves like men O you Philistines that you may not become servants to the Hebrews as they have been to you; behave yourselves like men and fight!
1 Samuel,4,10,And the Philistines fought; Israel was smitten and they fled every man to his own home. There was a very great slaughter; for 30000 foot soldiers of Israel fell.
1 Samuel,4,11,And the ark of God was taken and the two sons of Eli Hophni and Phinehas were slain. [Foretold in I Sam. 2:34.]
1 Samuel,4,12,Now a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh that day with his clothes torn and earth on his head.
1 Samuel,4,13,When he arrived Eli was sitting by the road watching for his heart trembled for the ark of God. When the man told the news in the city all the city [people] cried out.
1 Samuel,4,14,When Eli heard the noise of the crying he said What is this uproar? And the man came hastily and told Eli.
1 Samuel,4,15,Now Eli was 98 years old; his eyes were dim so that he could not see.
1 Samuel,4,16,The man said to Eli I have come from the battle; I fled from the battle today. Eli said How did it go my son?
1 Samuel,4,17,The messenger replied Israel fled before the Philistines and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Also your two sons Hophni and Phinehas are dead and the ark of God is captured.
1 Samuel,4,18,And when he mentioned the ark of God Eli fell off the seat backward by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died for he was an old man and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.
1 Samuel,4,19,Now his daughter-in-law Phinehas' wife was with child about to be delivered. And when she heard that the ark of God was captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead she bowed herself and gave birth for her pains came upon her.
1 Samuel,4,20,And about the time of her death the women attending her said to her Fear not for you have borne a son. But she did not answer or notice.
1 Samuel,4,21,And she named the child Ichabod saying The glory is departed from Israel!--because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
1 Samuel,4,22,She said The glory is gone from Israel for the ark of God has been taken.
1 Samuel,5,1,THE PHILISTINES brought the ark of God from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
1 Samuel,5,2,They took the ark of God into the house of Dagon and set it beside Dagon [their idol].
1 Samuel,5,3,When they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow behold Dagon had fallen upon his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord. So they took Dagon and set him in his place again.
1 Samuel,5,4,But when they arose early the next morning behold Dagon had again fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord and [his] head and both the palms of his hands were lying cut off on the threshold; only the trunk of Dagon was left him.
1 Samuel,5,5,This is the reason neither the priests of Dagon nor any who come into Dagon's house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
1 Samuel,5,6,But the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the people of Ashdod and He caused [mice to spring up and there was] very deadly destruction and He smote the people with [very painful] tumors or boils both Ashdod and its territory.
1 Samuel,5,7,When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so they said The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us for His hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god.
1 Samuel,5,8,So they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them and said What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? They answered Let [it] be carried around to Gath. So they carried the ark of the God of Israel there.
1 Samuel,5,9,But after they had carried it to Gath the hand of the Lord was against the city causing an exceedingly great panic [at the deaths from the plague] for He afflicted the people of the city both small and great and tumors or boils broke out on them.
1 Samuel,5,10,So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And as [it] came the people of Ekron cried out They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us to slay us and our people!
1 Samuel,5,11,So they sent and assembled all the lords of the Philistines and said Send away the ark of the God of Israel; let it return to its own place that it may not slay us and our people. For there was a deadly panic throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
1 Samuel,5,12,The men who had not died were stricken with very painful tumors or boils and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1 Samuel,6,1,THE ARK of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
1 Samuel,6,2,And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners saying What shall we do to the ark of the Lord? Tell us with what we shall send it to its place.
1 Samuel,6,3,And they said If you send away the ark of the God of Israel do not send it empty but at least return to Him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed [and healing granted you].
1 Samuel,6,4,Then they said What shall be the guilt offering which we shall return to Him? They answered Five golden tumors and five golden mice according to the number of the Philistine lords for one plague was on you all even on your lords.
1 Samuel,6,5,Therefore you must make images of your tumors and of your mice that destroy the land and give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps He will lighten His hand from off you and your gods and your land.
1 Samuel,6,6,Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He had done wonders and made a mock of them did they not let the people go and they departed?
1 Samuel,6,7,Now then make and prepare a new cart and two milch cows on which no yoke has ever come; and yoke the cows to the cart but take their calves home away from them.
1 Samuel,6,8,And take the ark of the Lord and place it upon the cart and put in a box at its side the figures of gold which you are returning to Him as a guilt offering. Then send it away and let it be gone.
1 Samuel,6,9,And watch. If it goes up by the way of its own land to Beth-shemesh then He has done us this great evil. But if not then we shall know that it was not His hand that struck us; it happened to us by chance.
1 Samuel,6,10,And the men did so and took two milch cows and yoked them to the cart and shut up their calves at home.
1 Samuel,6,11,And they put the ark of the Lord on the cart and along with it the box with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.
1 Samuel,6,12,And the cows went straight toward Beth-shemesh along the highway lowing as they went and turned not aside to the right or the left. And the Philistine lords followed them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.
1 Samuel,6,13,Now the men of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark and rejoiced to see it.
1 Samuel,6,14,The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there. A great stone was there; and the men split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord.
1 Samuel,6,15,The Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the box beside it in which were the figures of gold and put them upon the great stone. And the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices that day to the Lord.
1 Samuel,6,16,When the five lords of the Philistines saw it they returned that day to Ekron.
1 Samuel,6,17,And these are the tumors of gold which the Philistines returned for a guilt offering to the Lord: one each for Ashdod Gaza Ashkelon Gath and Ekron;
1 Samuel,6,18,Also the mice of gold was according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords both fortified cities and country villages. The great stone on which they set the ark of the Lord remains as a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.
1 Samuel,6,19,And the Lord slew some of the men of Beth-shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the Lord; He slew seventy men of them and the people mourned because the Lord had made a great slaughter among them.
1 Samuel,6,20,And the men of Beth-shemesh said Who is able to stand before the Lord this holy God? And to whom shall He go away from us?
1 Samuel,6,21,And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim saying The Philistines have returned the ark of the Lord. Come down and take it up to you.
1 Samuel,7,1,SO THE men of Kiriath-jearim came and took the ark of the Lord and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill and consecrated Eleazar his son to have charge of the ark of the Lord.
1 Samuel,7,2,And the ark remained in Kiriath-jearim a very long time [nearly 100 years through Samuel's entire judgeship Saul's reign and well into David's when it was brought to Jerusalem]. For it was twenty years before all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord.
1 Samuel,7,3,Then Samuel said to all the house of Israel If you are returning to the Lord with all your hearts then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth [female deities] from among you and direct your hearts to the Lord and serve Him only and He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
1 Samuel,7,4,So the Israelites put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth and served the Lord only.
1 Samuel,7,5,Samuel said Gather all Israel to Mizpah and I will pray to the Lord for you.
1 Samuel,7,6,So they gathered at Mizpah and drew water and poured it out before the Lord and fasted on that day and said there We have sinned against the Lord. And Samuel judged the Israelites at Mizpah.
1 Samuel,7,7,Now when the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the Israelites heard of it they were afraid of the Philistines.
1 Samuel,7,8,And the Israelites said to Samuel Do not cease to cry to the Lord our God for us that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines.
1 Samuel,7,9,So Samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord; and Samuel cried to the Lord for Israel and the Lord answered him.
1 Samuel,7,10,As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering the Philistines drew near to attack Israel. But the Lord thundered with a great voice that day against the Philistines and threw them into confusion and they were defeated before Israel.
1 Samuel,7,11,And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and smote them as far as below Beth-car.
1 Samuel,7,12,Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen and he called the name of it Ebenezer [stone of help] saying Heretofore the Lord has helped us.
1 Samuel,7,13,So the Philistines were subdued and came no more into Israelite territory. And the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
1 Samuel,7,14,The cities the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel from Ekron to Gath and Israel rescued [the cities'] territory from the Philistines. There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites.
1 Samuel,7,15,And Samuel judged Israel all his days.
1 Samuel,7,16,And he went from year to year on a circuit to Bethel Gilgal and Mizpah and was judge for Israel in all those places.
1 Samuel,7,17,Then he would return to Ramah for his home was there; there he judged Israel and there he built an altar to the Lord.
1 Samuel,8,1,WHEN SAMUEL was old he made his sons judges over Israel.
1 Samuel,8,2,Now the name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba.
1 Samuel,8,3,His sons did not walk in his ways but turned aside after gain took bribes and perverted justice.
1 Samuel,8,4,All the elders of Israel assembled and came to Samuel at Ramah
1 Samuel,8,5,And said to him Behold you are old and your sons do not walk in your ways; now appoint us a king to rule over us like all the other nations.
1 Samuel,8,6,But it displeased Samuel when they said Give us a king to govern us. And Samuel prayed to the Lord.
1 Samuel,8,7,And the Lord said to Samuel Hearken to the voice of the people in all they say to you; for they have not rejected you but they have rejected Me that I should not be King over them.
1 Samuel,8,8,According to all the works which they have done since I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day forsaking Me and serving other gods so they also do to you.
1 Samuel,8,9,So listen now to their voice; only solemnly warn them and show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them.
1 Samuel,8,10,So Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who asked of him a king.
1 Samuel,8,11,And he said These will be the ways of the king who shall reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen and to run before his chariots.
1 Samuel,8,12,He will appoint them for himself to be commanders over thousands and over fifties and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his implements of war and equipment for his chariots.
1 Samuel,8,13,He will take your daughters to be perfumers cooks and bakers.
1 Samuel,8,14,He will take your fields your vineyards and your olive orchards even the best of them and give them to his servants.
1 Samuel,8,15,He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants.
1 Samuel,8,16,He will take your men and women servants and the best of your cattle and your donkeys and put them to his work.
1 Samuel,8,17,He will take a tenth of your flocks and you yourselves shall be his slaves.
1 Samuel,8,18,In that day you will cry out because of your king you have chosen for yourselves but the Lord will not hear you then.
1 Samuel,8,19,Nevertheless the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel and they said No! We will have a king over us
1 Samuel,8,20,That we also may be like all the nations and that our king may govern us and go out before us and fight our battles.
1 Samuel,8,21,Samuel heard all the people's words and repeated them in the Lord's ears.
1 Samuel,8,22,And the Lord said to Samuel Hearken to their voice and appoint them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel Go every man to his city.
1 Samuel,9,1,THERE WAS a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish son of Abiel the son of Zeror the son of Becorath the son of Aphiah a Benjamite a mighty man of wealth and valor.
1 Samuel,9,2,Kish had a son named Saul a choice young man and handsome; among all the Israelites there was not a man more handsome than he. He was a head taller than any of the people.
1 Samuel,9,3,The donkeys of Kish Saul's father were lost. Kish said to Saul Take a servant with you and go look for the donkeys.
1 Samuel,9,4,And they passed through the hill country of Ephraim and the land of Shalishah but did not find them. Then they went through the land of Shaalim and the land of Benjamin but did not find them.
1 Samuel,9,5,And when they came to the land of Zuph Saul said to his servant Come let us return lest my father stop worrying about the donkeys and become concerned about us.
1 Samuel,9,6,The servant said to him Behold now there is in this city a man of God a man held in honor; all that he says surely comes true. Now let us go there. Perhaps he can show us where we should go.
1 Samuel,9,7,Then Saul said to his servant But if we go what shall we bring the man? The bread in our sacks is gone and there is no gift for the man of God. What have we?
1 Samuel,9,8,The servant replied I have here a quarter of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God to tell us our way--
1 Samuel,9,9,(Formerly in Israel when a man went to inquire of God he said Come let us go to the seer for he that is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.)
1 Samuel,9,10,Saul said to his servant Well said; come let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.
1 Samuel,9,11,As they went up the hill to the city they met young maidens going out to draw water and said to them Is the seer here?
1 Samuel,9,12,They answered He is; behold he is just beyond you. Hurry for he came today to the city because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place.
1 Samuel,9,13,As you enter the city you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not eat until he comes to ask the blessing on the sacrifice. Afterward those who are invited eat. So go on up for about now you will find him.
1 Samuel,9,14,So they went up to the city and as they were entering behold Samuel came toward them going up to the high place.
1 Samuel,9,15,Now a day before Saul came the Lord had revealed to Samuel in his ear
1 Samuel,9,16,Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin and you shall anoint him to be leader over My people Israel; and he shall save them out of the hand of the Philistines. For I have looked upon the distress of My people because their cry has come to Me.
1 Samuel,9,17,When Samuel saw Saul the Lord told him There is the man of whom I told you. He shall have authority over My people.
1 Samuel,9,18,Then Saul came near to Samuel in the gate and said Tell me where is the seer's house?
1 Samuel,9,19,Samuel answered Saul I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place for you shall eat with me today and tomorrow I will let you go and will tell you all that is on your mind.
1 Samuel,9,20,As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago do not be thinking about them for they are found. And for whom are all the desirable things of Israel? Are they not for you and for all your father's house?
1 Samuel,9,21,And Saul said Am I not a Benjamite of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And is not my family the least of all the families of the clans of Benjamin? Why then do you speak this way to me?
1 Samuel,9,22,Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the guest room [at the high place] and had them sit in the chief place among the persons--about thirty of them--who were invited. [The other people feasted outside.]
1 Samuel,9,23,And Samuel said to the cook Bring the portion which I gave you of which I said to you Set it aside.
1 Samuel,9,24,And the cook lifted high the shoulder and what was on it [indicating that it was the priest's honored portion] and set it before Saul. [Samuel] said See what was reserved for you. Eat for until the hour appointed it was kept for you ever since I invited the people. So Saul ate that day with Samuel.
1 Samuel,9,25,When they had come down from the high place into the city Samuel conversed with Saul on the top of the house.
1 Samuel,9,26,They arose early and about dawn Samuel called Saul [who was sleeping] on the top of the house saying Get up that I may send you on your way. Saul arose and both he and Samuel went out on the street.
1 Samuel,9,27,And as they were going down to the outskirts of the city Samuel said to Saul Bid the servant pass on before us--and he passed on--but you stand still first that I may cause you to hear the word of God.
1 Samuel,10,1,THEN SAMUEL took the vial of oil and poured it on Saul's head and kissed him and said Has not the Lord anointed you to be prince over His heritage Israel?
1 Samuel,10,2,When you have left me today you will meet two men by Rachel's tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah and they will say to you The donkeys you sought are found. And your father has quit caring about them and is anxious for you asking What shall I do about my son?
1 Samuel,10,3,Then you will go on from there and you will come to the oak of Tabor and three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there one carrying three kids another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a skin bottle of wine.
1 Samuel,10,4,They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread which you shall accept from their hand.
1 Samuel,10,5,After that you will come to the hill of God where the garrison of the Philistines is; and when you come to the city you will meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with harp tambourine flute and lyre before them prophesying.
1 Samuel,10,6,Then the Spirit of the Lord will come upon you mightily and you will show yourself to be a prophet with them; and you will be turned into another man.
1 Samuel,10,7,When these signs meet you do whatever you find to be done for God is with you.
1 Samuel,10,8,You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. You shall wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you shall do.
1 Samuel,10,9,And when [Saul] had turned his back to leave Samuel God gave him another heart and all these signs came to pass that day.
1 Samuel,10,10,When they came to the hill [Gibeah] behold a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily upon him and he spoke under divine inspiration among them.
1 Samuel,10,11,And when all who knew Saul before saw that he spoke by inspiration among the [schooled] prophets the people said one to another What has come over [him who is nobody but] the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
1 Samuel,10,12,One from that same place answered But who is the father of the others? So it became a proverb Is Saul also among the prophets?
1 Samuel,10,13,When [Saul] had ended his inspired speaking he went to the high place.
1 Samuel,10,14,Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant Where did you go? And Saul said To look for the donkeys and when we found them nowhere we went to Samuel.
1 Samuel,10,15,Saul's uncle said Tell me what did Samuel say to you?
1 Samuel,10,16,And Saul said to his uncle He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But of the matter of the kingdom of which Samuel spoke he told him nothing.
1 Samuel,10,17,And Samuel called the people together to the Lord at Mizpah
1 Samuel,10,18,And said to the Israelites Thus says the Lord the God of Israel: It was I Who brought up Israel out of Egypt and delivered you out of the hands of the Egyptians and of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.
1 Samuel,10,19,But you have this day rejected your God Who Himself saves you from all your calamities and distresses; and you have said to Him No! Set a king over us. So now present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and by your thousands.
1 Samuel,10,20,And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near the tribe of Benjamin was taken [probably by lot].
1 Samuel,10,21,When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families the family of Matri was taken. And Saul son of Kish was taken. But when they looked for him he could not be found.
1 Samuel,10,22,Therefore they inquired of the Lord further if the man would yet come back. And the Lord answered Behold he has hidden himself among the baggage.
1 Samuel,10,23,They ran and brought him from there. And when he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of them.
1 Samuel,10,24,And Samuel said to all the people Do you see him whom the Lord has chosen that none like him is among all the people? And all the people shouted and said Long live the king!
1 Samuel,10,25,Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom [defining the position of the king in relation to God and to the people] and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the Lord. And Samuel sent all the people away each one to his home.
1 Samuel,10,26,Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of valiant men whose hearts God had touched.
1 Samuel,10,27,But some worthless fellows said How can this man save us? And they despised him and brought him no gift. But he held his peace and was as if deaf.
1 Samuel,11,1,AND NAHASH the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash Make a treaty with us and we will serve you.
1 Samuel,11,2,But Nahash the Ammonite told them On this condition I will make a treaty with you that I thrust out all your right eyes and thus lay disgrace on all Israel.
1 Samuel,11,3,The elders of Jabesh said to Nahash Give us seven days' time that we may send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then if there is no man to save us we will come out to you.
1 Samuel,11,4,Then messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and told the news in the ears of the people; and all the people wept aloud.
1 Samuel,11,5,Now Saul came out of the field after the oxen and [he] said What ails the people that they are weeping? And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh.
1 Samuel,11,6,The Spirit of God came mightily upon Saul when he heard those tidings and his anger was greatly kindled.
1 Samuel,11,7,And he took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hands of messengers saying Whoever does not come forth after Saul and Samuel so shall it be done to his oxen! And terror from the Lord fell on the people and they came out with one consent.
1 Samuel,11,8,And he numbered them at Bezek and the Israelites were 300000 and the men of Judah 30000.
1 Samuel,11,9,The messengers who came were told Say to the men of Jabesh-gilead Tomorrow by the time the sun is hot you shall have help. The messengers came and reported to the men of Jabesh and they were glad.
1 Samuel,11,10,So the men of Jabesh said to Nahash Tomorrow we will come out to you and you may do to us all that seems good to you.
1 Samuel,11,11,The next day Saul put the men in three companies; and they came into the midst of the enemy's camp in the [darkness of the] morning watch and slew the Ammonites until midday; and the survivors were scattered so that no two of them remained together.
1 Samuel,11,12,The people said to Samuel Who is he who said Shall Saul reign over us? Bring the men that we may put them to death.
1 Samuel,11,13,But Saul said There shall not a man be put to death this day for today the Lord has brought deliverance to Israel.
1 Samuel,11,14,Samuel said to the people Come let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingdom.
1 Samuel,11,15,All the people went to Gilgal and there they made Saul king before the Lord. And there they sacrificed peace offerings before the Lord and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
1 Samuel,12,1,AND SAMUEL said to all Israel I have listened to you in all that you have said to me and have made a king over you.
1 Samuel,12,2,And now behold the king walks before you. And I am old and gray and behold my sons are with you. And I have walked before you from my childhood to this day.
1 Samuel,12,3,Here I am; testify against me before the Lord and Saul His anointed. Whose ox or donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded or oppressed? Or from whose hand have I received any bribe to blind my eyes? Tell me and I will restore it to you.
1 Samuel,12,4,And they said You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from any man's hand.
1 Samuel,12,5,And Samuel said to them The Lord is witness against you and His anointed is witness this day that you have not found anything in my hand. And they answered He is witness.
1 Samuel,12,6,And Samuel said to the people It is the Lord Who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your fathers up out of Egypt.
1 Samuel,12,7,Now present yourselves that I may plead with you before the Lord concerning all the righteous acts of the Lord which He did for you and for your fathers.
1 Samuel,12,8,When Jacob and his sons had come into Egypt [and the Egyptians oppressed them] and your fathers cried to the Lord then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place.
1 Samuel,12,9,But when they forgot the Lord their God He sold them into the hand of Sisera commander of Hazor's army and into the hands of the Philistines and of the king of Moab and they fought those foes.
1 Samuel,12,10,And they cried to the Lord saying We have sinned because we have forsaken the Lord and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth; but now deliver us from the hands of our enemies and we will serve You.
1 Samuel,12,11,And the Lord sent Jerubbaal and Barak and Jephthah and Samuel and He delivered you out of the hands of your enemies on every side and you dwelt safely.
1 Samuel,12,12,But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites came against you you said to me No! A king shall reign over us--when the Lord your God was your King!
1 Samuel,12,13,Now see the king whom you have chosen and for whom you have asked; behold the Lord has set a king over you.
1 Samuel,12,14,If you will revere and fear the Lord and serve Him and hearken to His voice and not rebel against His commandment and if both you and your king will follow the Lord your God it will be good!
1 Samuel,12,15,But if you will not hearken to the Lord's voice but rebel against His commandment then the hand of the Lord will be against you as it was against your fathers.
1 Samuel,12,16,So stand still and see this great thing the Lord will do before your eyes now.
1 Samuel,12,17,Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call to the Lord and He will send thunder and rain; then you shall know and see that your wickedness is great which you have done in the sight of the Lord in asking for a king for yourselves.
1 Samuel,12,18,So Samuel called to the Lord and He sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel.
1 Samuel,12,19,And [they] all said to Samuel Pray for your servants to the Lord your God that we may not die for we have added to all our sins this evil--to ask for a king.
1 Samuel,12,20,And Samuel said to the people Fear not. You have indeed done all this evil; yet turn not aside from following the Lord but serve Him with all your heart.
1 Samuel,12,21,And turn not aside after vain and worthless things which cannot profit or deliver you for they are empty and futile.
1 Samuel,12,22,The Lord will not forsake His people for His great name's sake for it has pleased Him to make you a people for Himself.
1 Samuel,12,23,Moreover as for me far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and right way.
1 Samuel,12,24,Only fear the Lord and serve Him faithfully with all your heart; for consider how great are the things He has done for you.
1 Samuel,12,25,But if you still do wickedly both you and your king shall be swept away.
1 Samuel,13,1,SAUL WAS [forty] years old when he began to reign; and when he had reigned two years over Israel
1 Samuel,13,2,Saul chose 3000 men of Israel; 2000 were with [him] in Michmash and the hill country of Bethel and 1000 with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent away each one to his home.
1 Samuel,13,3,Jonathan smote the Philistine garrison at Geba and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land saying Let the Hebrews hear!
1 Samuel,13,4,All Israel heard that Saul had defeated the Philistine garrison and also that Israel had become an abomination to the Philistines. And the people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal.
1 Samuel,13,5,And the Philistines gathered to fight with Israel 30000 chariots and 6000 horsemen and troops like sand on the seashore in multitude. They came up and encamped at Michmash east of Beth-aven.
1 Samuel,13,6,When the men of Israel saw that they were in a tight situation--for their troops were hard pressed--they hid in caves holes rocks tombs and pits or cisterns.
1 Samuel,13,7,Some Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul he was still in Gilgal and all the people followed him trembling.
1 Samuel,13,8,Saul waited seven days according to the set time Samuel had appointed. But Samuel had not come to Gilgal and the people were scattering from Saul.
1 Samuel,13,9,So Saul said Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering [which he was forbidden to do].
1 Samuel,13,10,And just as he finished offering the burnt offering behold Samuel came! Saul went out to meet and greet him.
1 Samuel,13,11,Samuel said What have you done? Saul said Because I saw that the people were scattering from me and that you did not come within the days appointed and that the Philistines were assembled at Michmash
1 Samuel,13,12,I thought The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal and I have not made supplication to the Lord. So I forced myself to offer a burnt offering.
1 Samuel,13,13,And Samuel said to Saul You have done foolishly! You have not kept the commandment of the Lord your God which He commanded you; for the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever;
1 Samuel,13,14,But now your kingdom shall not continue; the Lord has sought out [David] a man after His own heart and the Lord has commanded him to be prince and ruler over His people because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you.
1 Samuel,13,15,And Samuel went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were left with him [only] about 600.
1 Samuel,13,16,Saul and Jonathan his son and the people with them remained in Gibeah of Benjamin but the Philistines encamped at Michmash.
1 Samuel,13,17,And raiders came out of the Philistine camp in three companies; one company turned toward Ophrah to the land of Shual
1 Samuel,13,18,Another turned toward Beth-horon and another toward the border overlooking the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
1 Samuel,13,19,Now there was no metal worker to be found throughout all the land of Israel for the Philistines said Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears.
1 Samuel,13,20,But each of the Israelites had to go down to the Philistines to get his plowshare mattock axe or sickle sharpened.
1 Samuel,13,21,And the price for plowshares and mattocks was a pim and a third of a shekel for axes and for setting goads [with resulting blunt edges on the sickles mattocks forks axes and goads.]
1 Samuel,13,22,So on the day of battle neither sword nor spear was found in the hand of any of the men who were with Saul and Jonathan; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them.
1 Samuel,13,23,And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
1 Samuel,14,1,ONE DAY Jonathan son of Saul said to his armor-bearer Come let us go over to the Philistine garrison on the other side. But he did not tell his father.
1 Samuel,14,2,Saul was remaining in the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron; and with him were about 600 men
1 Samuel,14,3,And Ahijah son of Ahitub Ichabod's brother the son of Phinehas the son of Eli the Lord's priest in Shiloh was wearing the ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan was gone.
1 Samuel,14,4,Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side; one was named Bozez and the other Seneh.
1 Samuel,14,5,The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash and the other on the south in front of Geba.
1 Samuel,14,6,And Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer Come and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that the Lord will work for us. For there is nothing to prevent the Lord from saving by many or by few.
1 Samuel,14,7,And his armor-bearer said to him Do all that is in your mind; I am with you in whatever you think [best].
1 Samuel,14,8,Jonathan said We will pass over to these men and we will let them see us.
1 Samuel,14,9,If they say to us Wait until we come to you then we will stand still in our place and will not go up to them.
1 Samuel,14,10,But if they say Come up to us we will go up for the Lord has delivered them into our hand and this will be our sign.
1 Samuel,14,11,So both of them let the Philistine garrison see them. And the Philistines said Behold the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.
1 Samuel,14,12,The garrison men said to Jonathan and his armor-bearer Come up to us and we will show you a thing. Jonathan said to his armor-bearer Come up after me for the Lord has given them into Israel's hand.
1 Samuel,14,13,Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet his armor-bearer after him; and the enemy fell before Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed them after him.
1 Samuel,14,14,And that first slaughter which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made was about twenty men within about a half acre of land [which a yoke of oxen might plow].
1 Samuel,14,15,And there was trembling and panic in the [Philistine] camp in the field and among all the men; the garrison and even the raiders trembled; the earth quaked and it became a terror from God.
1 Samuel,14,16,Saul's watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin looked and behold the multitude melted away and went hither and thither.
1 Samuel,14,17,Then Saul said to the men with him Number and see who is gone from us. When they numbered behold Jonathan and his armor-bearer were missing.
1 Samuel,14,18,Saul said to Ahijah Bring here the ark of God--for at that time the ark of God was with the children of Israel.
1 Samuel,14,19,While Saul talked to the priest the tumult in the Philistine camp kept increasing. Then Saul said to the priest Withdraw your hand.
1 Samuel,14,20,Then Saul and all the people with him rallied and went into the battle and behold every [Philistine's] sword was against his fellow in wild confusion.
1 Samuel,14,21,Moreover the Hebrews who were with the Philistines before that time who went up with them into the camp from the country round about even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
1 Samuel,14,22,Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill country of Ephraim when they heard that the Philistines fled they also went after them in hot pursuit in the battle.
1 Samuel,14,23,So the Lord delivered Israel that day and the battle passed beyond Beth-aven.
1 Samuel,14,24,But the men of Israel were distressed that day for Saul had caused them to take an oath saying Cursed be the man who eats any food before evening and until I have taken vengeance on my enemies. So none of the men tasted any food.
1 Samuel,14,25,And all the people of the land came to a wood and there was honey on the ground.
1 Samuel,14,26,When the men entered the wood behold the honey was dripping but no man tasted it for the men feared the oath.
1 Samuel,14,27,But Jonathan had not heard when his father charged the people with the oath. So he dipped the end of the rod in his hand into a honeycomb and put it to his mouth and his [weary] eyes brightened.
1 Samuel,14,28,Then one of the men told him Your father strictly charged the men with an oath saying Cursed be the man who eats any food today. And the people were exhausted and faint.
1 Samuel,14,29,Then Jonathan said My father has troubled the land. See how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey.
1 Samuel,14,30,How much better if the men had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found! For now the slaughter of the Philistines has not been great.
1 Samuel,14,31,They smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint.
1 Samuel,14,32,[When night came and the oath expired] the men flew upon the spoil. They took sheep oxen and calves slew them on the ground and ate them [raw] with the blood.
1 Samuel,14,33,Then Saul was told Behold the men are sinning against the Lord by eating with the blood. And he said You have transgressed; roll a great stone to me here.
1 Samuel,14,34,Saul said Disperse yourselves among the people and tell them Bring me every man his ox or his sheep and butcher them here and eat; and sin not against the Lord by eating the blood. So all the men brought each one his ox that night and butchered it there.
1 Samuel,14,35,And Saul built an altar to the Lord; it was the first altar he built to the Lord.
1 Samuel,14,36,Then Saul said Let us go down after the Philistines by night and seize and plunder them until daylight and let us not leave a man of them. They said Do whatever seems good to you. Then the priest said Let us draw near here to God.
1 Samuel,14,37,And Saul asked counsel of God Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You deliver them into the hand of Israel? But He did not answer him that day.
1 Samuel,14,38,Then Saul said Draw near all the chiefs of the people and let us see how this sin [causing God's silence] arose today.
1 Samuel,14,39,For as the Lord lives Who delivers Israel though it be in Jonathan my son he shall surely die. But not a man among all the people answered him.
1 Samuel,14,40,Then he said to all Israel You be on one side; and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. The people said to Saul Do what seems good to you.
1 Samuel,14,41,Therefore Saul said to the Lord the God of Israel Give a perfect lot and show the right. And Saul and Jonathan were taken [by lot] but the other men went free.
1 Samuel,14,42,Saul said Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
1 Samuel,14,43,Saul said to Jonathan Tell me what you have done. And Jonathan said I tasted a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand. And behold I must die.
1 Samuel,14,44,Saul answered May God do so and more also for you shall surely die Jonathan.
1 Samuel,14,45,But the people said to Saul Shall Jonathan who has wrought this great deliverance to Israel die? God forbid! As the Lord lives there shall not one hair of his head perish for he has wrought this great deliverance with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan and he did not die.
1 Samuel,14,46,Then Saul ceased pursuing the Philistines and they went to their own place.
1 Samuel,14,47,When Saul took over the kingdom of Israel he fought against all his enemies on every side: Moab the Ammonites Edom the kings of Zobah and the Philistines. Wherever he turned he made it worse for them.
1 Samuel,14,48,He did valiantly and smote the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.
1 Samuel,14,49,Now Saul's sons were Jonathan Ishvi and Malchi-shua; and the names of his two daughters were of the firstborn Merab; and of the younger Michal.
1 Samuel,14,50,The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The commander of his army was Abner son of Ner Saul's uncle.
1 Samuel,14,51,Kish the father of Saul and Ner the father of Abner were sons of Abiel.
1 Samuel,14,52,There was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul and whenever Saul saw any mighty or [outstandingly] courageous man he attached him to himself.
1 Samuel,15,1,SAMUEL TOLD Saul The Lord sent me to anoint you king over His people Israel. Now listen and heed the words of the Lord.
1 Samuel,15,2,Thus says the Lord of hosts I have considered and will punish what Amalek did to Israel how he set himself against him in the way when [Israel] came out of Egypt.
1 Samuel,15,3,Now go and smite Amalek and utterly destroy all they have; do not spare them but kill both man and woman infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and donkey.
1 Samuel,15,4,So Saul assembled the men and numbered them at Telaim--200000 men on foot and 10000 men of Judah.
1 Samuel,15,5,And Saul came to the city of Amalek and laid wait in the valley.
1 Samuel,15,6,Saul warned the Kenites Go depart get down from among the Amalekites lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
1 Samuel,15,7,Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur which is east of Egypt.
1 Samuel,15,8,And he took Agag king of the Amalekites alive though he utterly destroyed all the rest of the people with the sword.
1 Samuel,15,9,Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep oxen fatlings lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them; but all that was undesirable or worthless they destroyed utterly.
1 Samuel,15,10,Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel saying
1 Samuel,15,11,I regret making Saul king for he has turned back from following Me and has not performed My commands. And Samuel was grieved and angry [with Saul] and he cried to the Lord all night.
1 Samuel,15,12,When Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning he was told Saul came to Carmel and behold he set up for himself a monument or trophy [of his victory] and passed on and went down to Gilgal.
1 Samuel,15,13,And Samuel came to Saul and Saul said to him Blessed are you of the Lord. I have performed what the Lord ordered.
1 Samuel,15,14,And Samuel said What then means this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
1 Samuel,15,15,Saul said They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to the Lord your God but the rest we have utterly destroyed.
1 Samuel,15,16,Then Samuel said to Saul Stop! I will tell you what the Lord said to me tonight. Saul said to him Say on.
1 Samuel,15,17,Samuel said When you were small in your own sight were you not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord anointed you king over Israel?
1 Samuel,15,18,And the Lord sent you on a mission and said Go utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites; and fight against them until they are consumed.
1 Samuel,15,19,Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord but swooped down upon the plunder and did evil in the Lord's sight?
1 Samuel,15,20,Saul said to Samuel Yes I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and have brought Agag king of Amalek and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
1 Samuel,15,21,But the people took from the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the things to be utterly destroyed to sacrifice to the Lord your God in Gilgal.
1 Samuel,15,22,Samuel said Has the Lord as great a delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams.
1 Samuel,15,23,For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim (household good luck images). Because you have rejected the word of the Lord He also has rejected you from being king.
1 Samuel,15,24,And Saul said to Samuel I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord and your words because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.
1 Samuel,15,25,Now I pray you pardon my sin and go back with me that I may worship the Lord.
1 Samuel,15,26,And Samuel said to Saul I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the Lord and the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel.
1 Samuel,15,27,And as Samuel turned to go away Saul seized the skirt of Samuel's mantle and it tore.
1 Samuel,15,28,And Samuel said to him The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you.
1 Samuel,15,29,And also the Strength of Israel will not lie or repent; for He is not a man that He should repent.
1 Samuel,15,30,Saul said I have sinned; yet honor me now I pray you before the elders of my people and before Israel and return with me that I may worship the Lord your God.
1 Samuel,15,31,So Samuel turned back after Saul and Saul worshiped the Lord.
1 Samuel,15,32,Then Samuel said Bring here to me Agag king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said Surely the bitterness of death is past.
1 Samuel,15,33,Samuel said As your sword has made women childless so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.
1 Samuel,15,34,Then Samuel went to Ramah but Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul.
1 Samuel,15,35,And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death though Samuel grieved over Saul. And the Lord repented that He had made Saul king over Israel.
1 Samuel,16,1,THE LORD said to Samuel How long will you mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill your horn with oil; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite. For I have provided for Myself a king among his sons.
1 Samuel,16,2,Samuel said How can I go? If Saul hears it he will kill me. And the Lord said Take a heifer with you and say I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.
1 Samuel,16,3,And invite Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for Me the one I name to you.
1 Samuel,16,4,And Samuel did what the Lord said and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said Have you come peaceably?
1 Samuel,16,5,And he said Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice. And he consecrated Jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice.
1 Samuel,16,6,When they had come he looked on Eliab [the eldest son] and said Surely the Lord's anointed is before Him.
1 Samuel,16,7,But the Lord said to Samuel Look not on his appearance or at the height of his stature for I have rejected him. For the Lord sees not as man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance but the Lord looks on the heart.
1 Samuel,16,8,Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. But Samuel said Neither has the Lord chosen this one.
1 Samuel,16,9,Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. Samuel said Nor has the Lord chosen him.
1 Samuel,16,10,Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse The Lord has not chosen any of these.
1 Samuel,16,11,Then [he] said to Jesse Are all your sons here? [Jesse] said There is yet the youngest; he is tending the sheep. Samuel said to Jesse Send for him; for we will not sit down to eat until he is here.
1 Samuel,16,12,Jesse sent and brought him. David had a healthy reddish complexion and beautiful eyes and was fine-looking. The Lord said [to Samuel] Arise anoint him; this is he.
1 Samuel,16,13,Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed David in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon David from that day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Ramah.
1 Samuel,16,14,But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented and troubled him.
1 Samuel,16,15,Saul's servants said to him Behold an evil spirit from God torments you.
1 Samuel,16,16,Let our lord now command your servants here before you to find a man who plays skillfully on the lyre; and when the evil spirit from God is upon you he will play it and you will be well.
1 Samuel,16,17,Saul told his servants Find me a man who plays well and bring him to me.
1 Samuel,16,18,One of the young men said I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who plays skillfully a valiant man a man of war prudent in speech and eloquent an attractive person; and the Lord is with him.
1 Samuel,16,19,So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said Send me David your son who is with the sheep.
1 Samuel,16,20,And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread a skin of wine and a kid and sent them by David his son to Saul.
1 Samuel,16,21,And David came to Saul and served him. Saul became very fond of him and he became his armor-bearer.
1 Samuel,16,22,Saul sent to Jesse saying Let David remain in my service for he pleases me.
1 Samuel,16,23,And when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul David took a lyre and played it; so Saul was refreshed and became well and the evil spirit left him.
1 Samuel,17,1,NOW THE Philistines gathered their armies for battle and were assembled at Socoh which belongs to Judah and encamped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim.
1 Samuel,17,2,Saul and the men of Israel were encamped in the Valley of Elah and drew up in battle array against the Philistines.
1 Samuel,17,3,And the Philistines stood on a mountain on one side and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side with the valley between them.
1 Samuel,17,4,And a champion went out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of Gath whose height was six cubits and a span [almost ten feet].
1 Samuel,17,5,And he had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of mail and the coat weighed 5000 shekels of bronze.
1 Samuel,17,6,He had bronze shin armor on his legs and a bronze javelin across his shoulders.
1 Samuel,17,7,And the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam; his spear's head weighed 600 shekels of iron. And a shield bearer went before him.
1 Samuel,17,8,Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me.
1 Samuel,17,9,If he is able to fight with me and kill me then we will be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him then you shall be our servants and serve us.
1 Samuel,17,10,And the Philistine said I defy the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man that we may fight together.
1 Samuel,17,11,When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid.
1 Samuel,17,12,David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah named Jesse who had eight sons. [Jesse] in the days of Saul was old advanced in years.
1 Samuel,17,13,[His] three eldest sons had followed Saul into battle. Their names were Eliab the firstborn; next Abinadab; and third Shammah.
1 Samuel,17,14,David was the youngest. The three eldest followed Saul
1 Samuel,17,15,But David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
1 Samuel,17,16,The Philistine came out morning and evening presenting himself for forty days.
1 Samuel,17,17,And Jesse said to David his son Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain and these ten loaves and carry them quickly to your brothers at the camp.
1 Samuel,17,18,Also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand. See how your brothers fare and bring some token from them.
1 Samuel,17,19,Now Saul and the brothers and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah fighting with the Philistines.
1 Samuel,17,20,So David rose up early next morning left the sheep with a keeper took the provisions and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the encampment as the host going forth to the battleground shouted the battle cry.
1 Samuel,17,21,And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array army against army.
1 Samuel,17,22,David left his packages in the care of the baggage keeper and ran into the ranks and came and greeted his brothers.
1 Samuel,17,23,As they talked behold Goliath the champion the Philistine of Gath came forth from the Philistine ranks and spoke the same words as before and David heard him.
1 Samuel,17,24,And all the men of Israel when they saw the man fled from him terrified.
1 Samuel,17,25,And the Israelites said Have you seen this man who has come out? Surely he has come out to defy Israel; and the man who kills him the king will enrich with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free [from taxes and service] in Israel.
1 Samuel,17,26,And David said to the men standing by him What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?
1 Samuel,17,27,And the [men] told him Thus shall it be done for the man who kills him.
1 Samuel,17,28,Now Eliab his eldest brother heard what he said to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David and he said Why did you come here? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumption and evilness of heart; for you came down that you might see the battle.
1 Samuel,17,29,And David said What have I done now? Was it not a harmless question?
1 Samuel,17,30,And David turned away from Eliab to another and he asked the same question and again the men gave him the same answer.
1 Samuel,17,31,When David's words were heard they were repeated to Saul and he sent for him.
1 Samuel,17,32,David said to Saul Let no man's heart fail because of this Philistine; your servant will go out and fight with him.
1 Samuel,17,33,And Saul said to David You are not able to go to fight against this Philistine. You are only an adolescent and he has been a warrior from his youth.
1 Samuel,17,34,And David said to Saul Your servant kept his father's sheep. And when there came a lion or again a bear and took a lamb out of the flock
1 Samuel,17,35,I went out after it and smote it and delivered the lamb out of its mouth; and when it arose against me I caught it by its beard and smote it and killed it.
1 Samuel,17,36,Your servant killed both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them for he has defied the armies of the living God!
1 Samuel,17,37,David said The Lord Who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear He will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David Go and the Lord be with you!
1 Samuel,17,38,Then Saul clothed David with his armor; he put a bronze helmet on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail.
1 Samuel,17,39,And David girded his sword over his armor. Then he tried to go but could not for he was not used to it. And David said to Saul I cannot go with these for I am not used to them. And David took them off.
1 Samuel,17,40,Then he took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in his shepherd's [lunch] bag [a whole kid's skin slung from his shoulder] in his pouch and his sling was in his hand and he drew near the Philistine.
1 Samuel,17,41,The Philistine came on and drew near to David the man who bore the shield going before him.
1 Samuel,17,42,And when the Philistine looked around and saw David he scorned and despised him for he was but an adolescent with a healthy reddish color and a fair face.
1 Samuel,17,43,And the Philistine said to David Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
1 Samuel,17,44,The Philistine said to David Come to me and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field.
1 Samuel,17,45,Then said David to the Philistine You come to me with a sword a spear and a javelin but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts the God of the ranks of Israel Whom you have defied.
1 Samuel,17,46,This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand and I will smite you and cut off your head. And I will give the corpses of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
1 Samuel,17,47,And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord's and He will give you into our hands.
1 Samuel,17,48,When the Philistine came forward to meet David David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.
1 Samuel,17,49,David put his hand into his bag and took out a stone and slung it and it struck the Philistine sinking into his forehead and he fell on his face to the earth.
1 Samuel,17,50,So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and struck down the Philistine and slew him. But no sword was in David's hand.
1 Samuel,17,51,So he ran and stood over the Philistine took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their mighty champion was dead they fled.
1 Samuel,17,52,And the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron. So the wounded Philistines fell along the way from Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron.
1 Samuel,17,53,The Israelites returned from their pursuit of the Philistines and plundered their tents.
1 Samuel,17,54,David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem but he put his armor in his tent.
1 Samuel,17,55,When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine he said to Abner the captain of the host Abner whose son is this youth? And Abner said As your soul lives O king I cannot tell.
1 Samuel,17,56,And the king said Inquire whose son the stripling is.
1 Samuel,17,57,When David returned from killing Goliath the Philistine Abner brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
1 Samuel,17,58,And Saul said to him Whose son are you young man? And David answered I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.
1 Samuel,18,1,WHEN DAVID had finished speaking to Saul the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David and Jonathan loved him as his own life.
1 Samuel,18,2,Saul took David that day and would not let him return to his father's house.
1 Samuel,18,3,Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as his own life.
1 Samuel,18,4,And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David and his armor even his sword his bow and his girdle.
1 Samuel,18,5,And David went out wherever Saul sent him and he prospered and behaved himself wisely; and Saul set him over the men of war. And it was satisfactory both to the people and to Saul's servants.
1 Samuel,18,6,As they were coming home when David returned from killing the Philistine the women came out of all the Israelite towns singing and dancing to meet King Saul with timbrels songs of joy and instruments of music.
1 Samuel,18,7,And the women responded as they laughed and frolicked saying Saul has slain his thousands and David his ten thousands.
1 Samuel,18,8,And Saul was very angry for the saying displeased him; and he said They have ascribed to David ten thousands but to me they have ascribed only thousands. What more can he have but the kingdom?
1 Samuel,18,9,And Saul [jealously] eyed David from that day forward.
1 Samuel,18,10,The next day an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul and he raved [madly] in his house while David played [the lyre] with his hand as at other times; and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.
1 Samuel,18,11,And Saul cast the javelin for he thought I will pin David to the wall. And David evaded him twice.
1 Samuel,18,12,Saul was afraid of David because the Lord was with him but had departed from Saul.
1 Samuel,18,13,So Saul removed David from him and made him his commander over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
1 Samuel,18,14,David acted wisely in all his ways and succeeded and the Lord was with him.
1 Samuel,18,15,When Saul saw how capable and successful David was he stood in awe of him.
1 Samuel,18,16,But all Israel and Judah loved David for he went out and came in before them.
1 Samuel,18,17,Saul said to David My elder daughter Merab I will give you as wife; only serve me courageously and fight the Lord's battles. For Saul thought Let not my hand but the Philistines' hand be upon him.
1 Samuel,18,18,David said to Saul Who am I and what is my life or my father's family in Israel that I should be the king's son-in-law?
1 Samuel,18,19,But at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife.
1 Samuel,18,20,Now Michal Saul's daughter loved David; and they told Saul and it pleased him.
1 Samuel,18,21,Saul thought I will give her to him that she may be a snare to him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. So Saul said to David a second time You shall now be my son-in-law.
1 Samuel,18,22,And Saul commanded his servants to speak to David privately and say The king delights in you and all his servants love you; now then become [his] son-in-law.
1 Samuel,18,23,Saul's servants told those words to David. David said Does it seem to you a light thing to be a king's son-in-law seeing I am a poor man and lightly esteemed?
1 Samuel,18,24,And the servants of Saul told him what David said.
1 Samuel,18,25,Saul said Say this to David The king wants no dowry but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines to avenge himself of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the Philistines' hands.
1 Samuel,18,26,When his servants told David these words it pleased [him] well to become the king's son-in-law. Before the days expired
1 Samuel,18,27,David went he and his men and slew two hundred Philistine men and brought their foreskins and gave them in full number to the king that he might become the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife.
1 Samuel,18,28,When Saul saw and knew that the Lord was with David and that Michal [his] daughter loved him
1 Samuel,18,29,Saul was still more afraid of David; and Saul became David's constant enemy.
1 Samuel,18,30,Then the Philistine princes came out to battle and when they did so David had more success and behaved himself more wisely than all Saul's servants so that his name was very dear and highly esteemed.
1 Samuel,19,1,NOW SAUL told Jonathan his son and all his servants that they must kill David.
1 Samuel,19,2,But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David and he told David Saul my father is seeking to kill you. Now therefore take heed to yourself in the morning and stay in a secret place and hide yourself.
1 Samuel,19,3,And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are; and I will converse with my father about you and if I learn anything I will tell you.
1 Samuel,19,4,And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him Let not the king sin against his servant David for he has not sinned against you and his deeds have been of good service to you.
1 Samuel,19,5,For he took his life in his hands and slew the Philistine and the Lord wrought a great deliverance for all Israel; you saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood and kill David without a cause?
1 Samuel,19,6,Saul heeded Jonathan and swore As the Lord lives David shall not be slain.
1 Samuel,19,7,So Jonathan called David and told him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul and he was in his presence as in times past.
1 Samuel,19,8,Then there was war again and David went out and fought with the Philistines and made a great slaughter among them and they fled before him.
1 Samuel,19,9,Then an evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing [the lyre] with his hand.
1 Samuel,19,10,Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear but he slipped away so that Saul struck the spear into the wall. Then David fled and escaped that night.
1 Samuel,19,11,Saul sent messengers that night to David's house to watch him that he might kill him in the morning. But Michal David's wife told him If you do not save your life tonight tomorrow you will be killed.
1 Samuel,19,12,So Michal let David down through the window and he fled and escaped.
1 Samuel,19,13,And Michal took the teraph (household good luck image) and laid it in the bed put a pillow of goats' hair at its head and covered it with a bedspread.
1 Samuel,19,14,And when Saul sent messengers to take David she said He is sick.
1 Samuel,19,15,Then Saul sent the messengers again to see David saying Bring him up to me in the bed that I may slay him.
1 Samuel,19,16,And when the messengers came in behold there was an image in the bed with a pillow of goats' hair at its head.
1 Samuel,19,17,Saul said to Michal Why have you deceived me so and sent away my enemy so that he has escaped? Michal answered Saul He said to me Let me go. Why should I kill you?
1 Samuel,19,18,So David fled and escaped and came to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
1 Samuel,19,19,And it was told Saul Behold David is at Naioth in Ramah.
1 Samuel,19,20,And Saul sent messengers to take David; and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and Samuel standing as appointed head over them the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul and they also prophesied.
1 Samuel,19,21,When it was told Saul he sent other messengers and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time and they also prophesied.
1 Samuel,19,22,Then Saul himself went to Ramah and came to a great well that is in Secu; and he asked Where are Samuel and David? And he was told They are at Naioth in Ramah.
1 Samuel,19,23,So he went on to Naioth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him also and as he went on he prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
1 Samuel,19,24,He took off his royal robes and prophesied before Samuel and lay down stripped thus all that day and night. So they say Is Saul also among the prophets?
1 Samuel,20,1,DAVID FLED from Naioth in Ramah and came and said to Jonathan What have I done? Of what am I guilty? What is my sin before your father that he seeks my life?
1 Samuel,20,2,Jonathan said God forbid! You shall not die. My father does nothing great or small but what he tells me. And why should [he] hide this thing from me? It is not so.
1 Samuel,20,3,But David replied Your father certainly knows that I have found favor in your eyes and he thinks Let not Jonathan know this lest he be grieved. But truly as the Lord lives and as your soul lives there is but a step between me and death.
1 Samuel,20,4,Then Jonathan said to David Whatever you desire I will do for you.
1 Samuel,20,5,David said to Jonathan Tomorrow is the New Moon [festival] and I should not fail to sit at the table with the king; but let me go that I may hide myself in the field till the third day at evening.
1 Samuel,20,6,If your father misses me at all then say David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
1 Samuel,20,7,If he says All right then it will be well with your servant; but if he is angry then be sure that evil is determined by him.
1 Samuel,20,8,Therefore deal kindly with your servant for you have brought [me] into a covenant of the Lord with you. But if there is guilt in me kill me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?
1 Samuel,20,9,And Jonathan said Far be it from you! If I knew that evil was determined for you by my father would I not tell you?
1 Samuel,20,10,Then said David to Jonathan Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?
1 Samuel,20,11,Jonathan said Come let us go into the field. So they went into the field.
1 Samuel,20,12,Jonathan said to David The Lord the God of Israel be witness. When I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow or the third day behold if he is well inclined toward David and I do not send and let you know it
1 Samuel,20,13,The Lord do so and much more to Jonathan. But if it please my father to do you harm then I will disclose it to you and send you away that you may go in safety. And may the Lord be with you as He has been with my father.
1 Samuel,20,14,While I am still alive you shall not only show me the loving-kindness of the Lord so that I die not
1 Samuel,20,15,But also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever--no not even when the Lord has cut off every enemy of David from the face of the earth.
1 Samuel,20,16,So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David saying And the Lord will require that this covenant be kept at the hands of David's enemies.
1 Samuel,20,17,And Jonathan caused David to swear again by his love for him for Jonathan loved him as he loved his own life.
1 Samuel,20,18,Then Jonathan said to David Tomorrow is the New Moon festival; and you will be missed for your seat will be empty.
1 Samuel,20,19,On the third day you will go quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself when the matter was in hand and remain by the stone Ezel.
1 Samuel,20,20,And I will shoot three arrows on the side of it as though I shot at a mark.
1 Samuel,20,21,And I will send a lad saying Go find the arrows. If I expressly say to the lad Look the arrows are on this side of you take them--then you are to come for it is safe for you and there is no danger as the Lord lives.
1 Samuel,20,22,But if I say to the youth Look the arrows are beyond you--then go for the Lord has sent you away.
1 Samuel,20,23,And as touching the matter of which you and I have spoken behold the Lord is between you and me forever.
1 Samuel,20,24,So David hid himself in the field and when the New Moon [festival] came the king sat down to eat food.
1 Samuel,20,25,The king sat as at other times on his seat by the wall and Jonathan sat opposite and Abner sat by Saul's side but David's place was empty.
1 Samuel,20,26,Yet Saul said nothing that day for he thought Something has befallen him and he is not clean--surely he is not clean.
1 Samuel,20,27,But on the morrow the second day after the new moon David's place was empty; and Saul said to Jonathan his son Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal either yesterday or today?
1 Samuel,20,28,And Jonathan answered David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem.
1 Samuel,20,29,He said Let me go I pray for our family holds a sacrifice in the city and my brother commanded me to be there. Now if I have found favor in your eyes let me get away and see my brothers. That is why he has not come to the king's table.
1 Samuel,20,30,Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan and he said to him You son of a perverse rebellious woman do not I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother who bore you?
1 Samuel,20,31,For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the earth you shall not be established nor shall your kingdom. So now send and bring him to me for he shall surely die.
1 Samuel,20,32,Jonathan answered Saul his father Why should he be killed? What has he done?
1 Samuel,20,33,But Saul cast his spear at him to smite him by which Jonathan knew that his father had determined to kill David.
1 Samuel,20,34,So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food that second day of the month for he grieved for David because his father had disgraced him.
1 Samuel,20,35,In the morning Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David and a little lad was with him.
1 Samuel,20,36,And he said to his lad Run find the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond him.
1 Samuel,20,37,When the lad came to the place where Jonathan had shot the arrow Jonathan called to [him] Is not the arrow beyond you?
1 Samuel,20,38,And Jonathan cried after the lad Make speed haste stay not! The lad gathered up the arrow and came to his master.
1 Samuel,20,39,But the lad knew nothing; only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
1 Samuel,20,40,Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad and told him Go carry them to the city.
1 Samuel,20,41,And as soon as the lad was gone David arose from beside the heap of stones and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times. And they kissed one another and wept with one another until David got control of himself.
1 Samuel,20,42,And Jonathan told David Go in peace forasmuch as we have sworn to each other in the name of the Lord saying The Lord shall be between me and you and between my descendants and yours forever. And Jonathan arose and departed into the city.
1 Samuel,21,1,THEN DAVID went to Nob to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech was afraid at meeting David and said to him Why are you alone and no man with you?
1 Samuel,21,2,David said to Ahimelech the priest The king has charged me with a matter and has told me Let no man know anything of the mission on which I send you and with what I have charged you. I have appointed the young men to a certain place.
1 Samuel,21,3,Now what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever you may have.
1 Samuel,21,4,And the priest answered David There is no common bread on hand but there is hallowed bread--if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
1 Samuel,21,5,And David told the priest Truly women have been kept from us in these three days since I came out and the food bags and utensils of the young men are clean and although the bread will be used in a secular way it will be set apart in the clean bags.
1 Samuel,21,6,So the priest gave him holy bread for there was no bread there but the showbread which was taken from before the Lord to put hot bread in its place the day when it was taken away.
1 Samuel,21,7,Now a certain man of Saul's servants was there that day detained before the Lord; his name was Doeg the Edomite the chief of Saul's herdsmen.
1 Samuel,21,8,David said to Ahimelech Do you have at hand a sword or spear? The king's business required haste and I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me.
1 Samuel,21,9,The priest said The sword of Goliath the Philistine whom you slew in the Valley of Elah see it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if you will take that do so for there is no other here. And David said There is none like that; give it to me.
1 Samuel,21,10,David arose and fled that day from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath.
1 Samuel,21,11,The servants of Achish said to him Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing one to another of him in their dances: Saul has slain his thousands and David his ten thousands?
1 Samuel,21,12,David took these words to heart and was much afraid of Achish king of Gath.
1 Samuel,21,13,And he changed his behavior before them and pretended to be insane in their [Philistine] hands and scribbled on the gate doors and drooled on his beard.
1 Samuel,21,14,Then said Achish to his servants You see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me?
1 Samuel,21,15,Have I need of madmen that you bring this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?
1 Samuel,22,1,SO DAVID departed and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it they went down there to him.
1 Samuel,22,2,And everyone in distress or in debt or discontented gathered to him and he became a commander over them. And there were with him about 400 men.
1 Samuel,22,3,And David went from there to Mizpah of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab Let my father [of Moabite descent] and my mother I pray you come out [of Judah] and be with you till I know what God will do for me.
1 Samuel,22,4,And he brought them before the king of Moab and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold [in Moab].
1 Samuel,22,5,Then the prophet Gad said to David Do not remain in the stronghold; leave and get into the land of Judah. So David left and went into the forest of Hareth.
1 Samuel,22,6,Saul heard that David was discovered and the men that were with him. Saul was sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the height his spear in his hand and all his servants standing about him.
1 Samuel,22,7,Saul said to his servants who stood about him Hear now you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards and make you all commanders of thousands and hundreds
1 Samuel,22,8,That all of you have conspired against me? No one discloses to me when my son makes a league with the son of Jesse. None of you is sorry for me or discloses that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait as he does this day?
1 Samuel,22,9,Then Doeg the Edomite who stood with Saul's servants said I saw the son of Jesse come to Nob to Ahimelech son of Ahitub.
1 Samuel,22,10,And [Ahimelech] inquired of the Lord for him and gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
1 Samuel,22,11,Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest the son of Ahitub and all his father's house the priests who were at Nob and they all came to the king.
1 Samuel,22,12,Saul said Hear now you son of Ahitub. He replied Here I am my lord.
1 Samuel,22,13,Saul said to him Why have you conspired against me you and the son of Jesse giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him so he could rise against me to lie in wait as he does this day?
1 Samuel,22,14,Then Ahimelech answered the king And who is so faithful among all your servants as David who is the king's son-in-law and is taken into your council and honored in your house?
1 Samuel,22,15,Have I only today begun inquiring of God for him? No! Let not the king impute any wrong to his servant or to all the house of my father for your servant has known nothing of all this little or much.
1 Samuel,22,16,[Saul] said You shall surely die Ahimelech you and all your father's house.
1 Samuel,22,17,And the king said to the guard that stood about him Turn and slay the Lord's priests because their hand also is with David and because they knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hands against the Lord's priests.
1 Samuel,22,18,The king said to Doeg You turn and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned and attacked the priests and slew that day eighty-five persons who wore the priest's linen ephod.
1 Samuel,22,19,And Nob the city of the priests he smote with the sword; both men and women children and sucklings oxen and donkeys and sheep he put to the sword.
1 Samuel,22,20,And one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub named Abiathar escaped and fled after David.
1 Samuel,22,21,And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the Lord's priests.
1 Samuel,22,22,David said to Abiathar I knew that day when Doeg the Edomite was there that he would surely tell Saul. I have occasioned the death of all your father's house.
1 Samuel,22,23,Stay with me fear not; for he who seeks my life seeks your life. But with me you shall be safeguarded.
1 Samuel,23,1,THEN THEY told David Behold the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are robbing the threshing floors.
1 Samuel,23,2,So David inquired of the Lord Shall I go and attack these Philistines? And the Lord said to David Go smite the Philistines and save Keilah.
1 Samuel,23,3,David's men said to him Behold we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
1 Samuel,23,4,Then David inquired of the Lord again. And the Lord answered him Arise go down to Keilah for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.
1 Samuel,23,5,So David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines with a great slaughter and brought away their cattle. So David delivered the people of Keilah.
1 Samuel,23,6,When Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah he came with an ephod in his hand.
1 Samuel,23,7,Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. Saul said God has delivered him into my hand for he is shut in by going into a town that has gates and bars.
1 Samuel,23,8,Saul summoned all the men for war to go to Keilah to besiege David and his men.
1 Samuel,23,9,David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest Bring the ephod here.
1 Samuel,23,10,Then David said O Lord the God of Israel Your servant has surely heard that Saul intends to come and destroy the city of Keilah on my account.
1 Samuel,23,11,Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down as Your servant has heard? O Lord God of Israel I beseech You tell Your servant. And the Lord said He will come down.
1 Samuel,23,12,Then David asked Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into Saul's hand? The Lord said They will deliver you up.
1 Samuel,23,13,Then David and his men about 600 arose and left Keilah going wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah he gave up going there.
1 Samuel,23,14,David remained in the wilderness strongholds in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day but God did not give him into his hands.
1 Samuel,23,15,David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the Wilderness of Ziph in the wood [at Horesh].
1 Samuel,23,16,And Jonathan Saul's son rose and went into the wood to David [at Horesh] and strengthened his hand in God.
1 Samuel,23,17,He said to him Fear not; the hand of Saul my father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel and I shall be next to you. Saul my father knows that too.
1 Samuel,23,18,And the two of them made a covenant before the Lord. And David remained in the wood [at Horesh] and Jonathan went to his house.
1 Samuel,23,19,Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah saying Does not David hide himself with us in strongholds in the wood [at Horesh] on the hill of Hachilah which is south of Jeshimon?
1 Samuel,23,20,Now come down O king according to all your heart's desire to come down and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hands.
1 Samuel,23,21,And Saul said The Lord bless you for you have compassion on me.
1 Samuel,23,22,Go make yet more sure; and know and see where his haunt is and who has seen him there; for I am told he deals very craftily.
1 Samuel,23,23,See and take note of all his hiding places and come back to me with the certain facts and I will go with you. If he is in the land I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.
1 Samuel,23,24,So they arose and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon.
1 Samuel,23,25,Saul and his men went to seek him. And David was told; so he went down to the rock in the Wilderness of Maon and stayed. When Saul heard that he pursued David in the Wilderness of Maon.
1 Samuel,23,26,And Saul went on one side of the mountain and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. And David made haste to get away for fear of Saul for Saul and his men were surrounding [him] and his men to capture them.
1 Samuel,23,27,But a messenger came to Saul saying Make haste and come for the Philistines have made a raid on the land.
1 Samuel,23,28,So Saul returned from pursuing David and went against the Philistines. So they called that place the Rock of Escape.
1 Samuel,23,29,David went up from there and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi.
1 Samuel,24,1,WHEN SAUL returned from following the Philistines he was told Behold David is in the Wilderness of En-gedi.
1 Samuel,24,2,Then Saul took 3000 chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men among the Rocks of the Wild Goats.
1 Samuel,24,3,He came to the sheepfolds on the way where there was a cave and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the cave's innermost recesses.
1 Samuel,24,4,David's men said to him Behold the day of which the Lord said to you Behold I will deliver your enemy into your hands and you shall do to him as seems good to you. Then David arose [in the darkness] and stealthily cut off the skirt of Saul's robe.
1 Samuel,24,5,Afterward David's heart smote him because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
1 Samuel,24,6,He said to his men The Lord forbid that I should do this to my master the Lord's anointed to put my hand out against him when he is the anointed of the Lord.
1 Samuel,24,7,So David checked his men with these words and did not let them rise against Saul. But Saul rose up and left the cave and went on his way.
1 Samuel,24,8,David also arose afterward and went out of the cave and called after Saul saying My lord the king! And when Saul looked behind him David bowed with his face to the earth and did obeisance.
1 Samuel,24,9,And David said to Saul Why do you listen to the words of men who say David seeks to do you harm?
1 Samuel,24,10,Behold your eyes have seen how the Lord gave you today into my hands in the cave. Some told me to kill you but I spared you; I said I will not put forth my hand against my lord for he is the Lord's anointed.
1 Samuel,24,11,See my father see the skirt of your robe in my hand! Since I cut off the skirt of your robe and did not kill you you know and see that there is no evil or treason in my hands. I have not sinned against you yet you hunt my life to take it.
1 Samuel,24,12,May the Lord judge between me and you and may the Lord avenge me upon you but my hand shall not be upon you.
1 Samuel,24,13,As the proverb of the ancients says Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be against you.
1 Samuel,24,14,After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom do you pursue? After a dead dog? After a flea?
1 Samuel,24,15,May the Lord be judge and judge between me and you and see and plead my cause and deliver me out of your hands.
1 Samuel,24,16,When David had said this to Saul Saul said Is this your voice my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.
1 Samuel,24,17,He said to David You are more upright in God's eyes than I for you have repaid me good but I have rewarded you evil.
1 Samuel,24,18,You have declared today how you have dealt well with me; for when the Lord gave me into your hand you did not kill me.
1 Samuel,24,19,For if a man finds his enemy will he let him go away unharmed? Therefore may the Lord reward you with good for what you have done for me this day.
1 Samuel,24,20,And now behold I well know that you shall surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hands.
1 Samuel,24,21,Swear now therefore to me by the Lord that you will not cut off my descendants after me and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house.
1 Samuel,24,22,David gave Saul his oath; and Saul went home but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
1 Samuel,25,1,NOW SAMUEL died and all the Israelites assembled and mourned for him and buried him at his house in Ramah. David arose and went to the Wilderness of Paran.
1 Samuel,25,2,A very rich man was in Maon whose possessions and business were in Carmel. He had 3000 sheep and 1000 goats and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
1 Samuel,25,3,The man's name was Nabal and his wife's name was Abigail; she was a woman of good understanding and beautiful. But the man was rough and evil in his doings; he was a Calebite.
1 Samuel,25,4,David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
1 Samuel,25,5,And David sent out ten young men and said to [them] Go up to Carmel to Nabal and greet him in my name;
1 Samuel,25,6,And salute him thus: Peace be to you and to your house and to all that you have.
1 Samuel,25,7,I have heard that you have shearers. Now your shepherds have been with us and we did them no harm and they missed nothing all the time they were in Carmel.
1 Samuel,25,8,Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your sight for we come at an opportune time. I pray you give whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.
1 Samuel,25,9,And when David's young men came they said all this to Nabal in the name of David and then paused.
1 Samuel,25,10,And Nabal answered David's servants and said Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants nowadays who are each breaking away from his master.
1 Samuel,25,11,Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers and give it to men when I do not know where they belong?
1 Samuel,25,12,So David's young men turned away and came and told him all that was said.
1 Samuel,25,13,And David said to his men Every man gird on his sword. And they did so and David also girded on his sword; and there went up after David about 400 men and 200 remained with the baggage.
1 Samuel,25,14,But one of Nabal's young men told Abigail Nabal's wife Behold David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master and he railed at them.
1 Samuel,25,15,But David's men were very good to us and we were not harmed nor did we miss anything as long as we went with them when we were in the fields.
1 Samuel,25,16,They were a wall to us night and day all the time we were with them keeping the sheep.
1 Samuel,25,17,So know this and consider what you will do for evil is determined against our master and all his house. For he is such a wicked man that one cannot speak to him.
1 Samuel,25,18,Then Abigail made haste and took 200 loaves two skins of wine five sheep already dressed five measures of parched grain 100 clusters of raisins and 200 cakes of figs and laid them on donkeys.
1 Samuel,25,19,And she said to her servants Go on before me; behold I come after you. But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
1 Samuel,25,20,As she rode on her donkey she came down hidden by the mountain and behold David and his men came down opposite her and she met them.
1 Samuel,25,21,Now David had said Surely in vain have I protected all that this fellow has in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him; and he has repaid me evil for good.
1 Samuel,25,22,May God do so and more also to David if I leave of all who belong to him one male alive by morning.
1 Samuel,25,23,When Abigail saw David she hastened and lighted off the donkey and fell before David on her face and did obeisance.
1 Samuel,25,24,Kneeling at his feet she said Upon me alone let this guilt be my lord. And let your handmaid I pray you speak in your presence and hear the words of your handmaid.
1 Samuel,25,25,Let not my lord I pray you regard this foolish and wicked fellow Nabal for as his name is so is he--Nabal [foolish wicked] is his name and folly is with him. But I your handmaid did not see my lord's young men whom you sent.
1 Samuel,25,26,So now my lord as the Lord lives and as your soul lives seeing that the Lord has prevented you from bloodguiltiness and from avenging yourself with your own hand now let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal.
1 Samuel,25,27,And now this gift which your handmaid has brought my lord let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.
1 Samuel,25,28,Forgive I pray you the trespass of your handmaid for the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house because my lord is fighting the Lord's battles and evil has not been found in you all your days.
1 Samuel,25,29,Though man is risen up to pursue you and to seek your life yet the life of my lord shall be bound in the living bundle with the Lord your God. And the lives of your enemies--them shall He sling out as out of the center of a sling.
1 Samuel,25,30,And when the Lord has done to my lord according to all the good that He has promised concerning you and has made you ruler over Israel
1 Samuel,25,31,This shall be no staggering grief to you or cause for pangs of conscience to my lord either that you have shed blood without cause or that my lord has avenged himself. And when the Lord has dealt well with my lord then [ earnestly] remember your handmaid.
1 Samuel,25,32,And David said to Abigail Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel Who sent you this day to meet me.
1 Samuel,25,33,And blessed be your discretion and advice and blessed be you who have kept me today from bloodguiltiness and from avenging myself with my own hand.
1 Samuel,25,34,For as the Lord the God of Israel lives Who has prevented me from hurting you if you had not hurried and come to meet me surely by morning there would not have been left so much as one male to Nabal.
1 Samuel,25,35,So David accepted what she had brought him and said to her Go up in peace to your house. See I have hearkened to your voice and have granted your petition.
1 Samuel,25,36,And Abigail came to Nabal and behold he was holding a feast in his house like the feast of a king. And [his] heart was merry for he was very drunk; so she told him nothing at all until the morning light.
1 Samuel,25,37,But in the morning when the wine was gone out of Nabal and his wife told him these things his heart died within him and he became [paralyzed helpless as] a stone.
1 Samuel,25,38,And about ten days after that the Lord smote Nabal and he died.
1 Samuel,25,39,When David heard that Nabal was dead he said Blessed be the Lord Who has pleaded the cause of my reproach at the hand of Nabal and kept His servant from evil. For the Lord has returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail to take her to him as his wife.
1 Samuel,25,40,And when the servants of David had come to Abigail at Carmel they said to her David sent us to you to take you to him to be his wife.
1 Samuel,25,41,And she arose and bowed herself to the earth and said Behold let your handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
1 Samuel,25,42,And Abigail hastened and arose and rode on a donkey with five of her maids who followed her and she went after the messengers of David and became his wife.
1 Samuel,25,43,David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel and they both became his wives.
1 Samuel,25,44,Saul had given Michal his daughter David's wife to Phalti son of Laish who was of Gallim.
1 Samuel,26,1,THE ZIPHITES came to Saul at Gibeah saying Does not David hide himself on the hill of Hachilah east of Jeshimon?
1 Samuel,26,2,So Saul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph with 3000 chosen men of Israel to seek David [there].
1 Samuel,26,3,Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah which is beside the road east of Jeshimon. But David remained in the wilderness. And when he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness
1 Samuel,26,4,David sent out spies and learned that Saul had actually come.
1 Samuel,26,5,David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped and saw where Saul lay with Abner son of Ner commander of his army; and Saul was lying in the encampment with the army encamped around him.
1 Samuel,26,6,Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai son of Zeruiah brother of Joab Who will go down with me into the camp of Saul? And Abishai said I will go down with you.
1 Samuel,26,7,So David and Abishai went to the army by night and there Saul lay sleeping within the encampment with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the army lay round about him.
1 Samuel,26,8,Then said Abishai to David God has given your enemy into your hands this day. Now therefore let me smite him to the earth at once with one stroke of the spear and I will not strike him twice.
1 Samuel,26,9,David said to Abishai Do not destroy him; for who can raise his hand against the Lord's anointed and be guiltless?
1 Samuel,26,10,David said As the Lord lives [He] will smite him; or his day will come to die or he will go down in battle and perish.
1 Samuel,26,11,The Lord forbid that I should raise my hand against the Lord's anointed; but take now the spear that is at his head and the bottle of water and let us go.
1 Samuel,26,12,So David took the spear and the bottle of water from Saul's head and they got away. And no man saw or knew or wakened for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen upon them.
1 Samuel,26,13,Then David went over to the other side and stood on the top of the mountain afar off a great space being between them.
1 Samuel,26,14,David called to the army and Abner son of Ner Will you answer Abner? Abner replied Who are you calling [and disturbing] the king?
1 Samuel,26,15,David said to Abner Are you not a valiant man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came in [to your camp] to destroy the king your lord.
1 Samuel,26,16,This thing is not good that you have done. As the Lord lives you deserve to die because you have not guarded your master the Lord's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is and the bottle of water that was at his head.
1 Samuel,26,17,And Saul knew David's voice and said Is this your voice my son David? And David said My voice my lord O king!
1 Samuel,26,18,And David said Why does my lord thus pursue his servant? What have I done? Or what evil is in my hand [tonight]?
1 Samuel,26,19,Now therefore I pray you let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the Lord has stirred you up against me let Him accept an offering; but if it is men may they be cursed before the Lord for they have driven me out this day that I should have no share in the inheritance of the Lord saying Go serve other gods.
1 Samuel,26,20,Now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the Lord; for the king of Israel is come out to seek one flea as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains.
1 Samuel,26,21,Then said Saul I have sinned. Return my son David for I will no more do you harm because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold I have played the fool and have erred exceedingly.
1 Samuel,26,22,David answered See the king's spear! Let one of the young men come and get it.
1 Samuel,26,23,The Lord rewards every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the Lord delivered you into my hands today but I would not stretch forth my hand against the Lord's anointed.
1 Samuel,26,24,And behold as your life was precious today in my sight so let my life be precious in the sight of the Lord and let Him deliver me out of all tribulation.
1 Samuel,26,25,Then Saul said to David May you be blessed my son David; you will both do mightily and surely prevail. So David went on his way and Saul returned to his place.
1 Samuel,27,1,BUT DAVID said in his heart I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of seeking me any more within the borders of Israel and I shall escape out of his hand.
1 Samuel,27,2,So David arose and went over with the 600 men who were with him to Achish son of Maoch king of Gath.
1 Samuel,27,3,And David dwelt with Achish at Gath he and his men every man with his household and David with his two wives Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the Carmelitess Nabal's widow.
1 Samuel,27,4,When it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath he sought for him no more.
1 Samuel,27,5,And David said to Achish If I have now found favor in your eyes let me be given a place to dwell in some country town; for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?
1 Samuel,27,6,Then Achish gave David the town of Ziklag that day. Therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day.
1 Samuel,27,7,The time David dwelt in the Philistines' country was a year and four months.
1 Samuel,27,8,Now David and his men went up and made attacks on the Geshurites Girzites and Amalekites [enemies of Israel Joshua had failed to exterminate]. For from of old those nations inhabited the land as one goes to Shur even to the land of Egypt.
1 Samuel,27,9,And David smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive and took away the sheep oxen donkeys camels and the apparel and returned to Achish.
1 Samuel,27,10,Achish would ask Against whom have you made a raid today? And David would reply Against the South (Negeb) of Judah or of the Jerahmeelites or of the Kenites.
1 Samuel,27,11,And David saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to Gath thinking Lest they should say about us So did David and so will he do as long as he dwells in the Philistines' country.
1 Samuel,27,12,And Achish believed David saying He has made his people Israel utterly abhor him; so he shall be my servant always.
1 Samuel,28,1,IN THOSE days the Philistines gathered their forces for war against Israel. Achish said to David Understand that you and your men shall go with me to battle.
1 Samuel,28,2,David said to Achish All right you shall know what your servant can do. Achish said to David Therefore I will make you my bodyguard always.
1 Samuel,28,3,Now Samuel was dead and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah his own city. And Saul had put the mediums and the wizards out of the land.
1 Samuel,28,4,And the Philistines assembled and came and encamped at Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel and they encamped at Gilboa.
1 Samuel,28,5,When Saul saw the Philistine host he was afraid; his heart trembled greatly.
1 Samuel,28,6,When Saul inquired of the Lord He refused to answer him either by dreams or by Urim [a symbol worn by the priest when seeking the will of God for Israel] or by the prophets.
1 Samuel,28,7,Then Saul said to his servants Find me a woman who is a medium [between the living and the dead] that I may go and inquire of her. His servants said Behold there is a woman who is a medium at Endor.
1 Samuel,28,8,So Saul disguised himself put on other raiment and he and two men with him went and came to the woman at night. He said to her Perceive for me by the familiar spirit and bring up for me the dead person whom I shall name to you.
1 Samuel,28,9,The woman said See here you know what Saul has done how he has cut off those who are mediums and wizards out of the land. Why then do you lay a trap for my life to cause my death?
1 Samuel,28,10,And Saul swore to her by the Lord saying As the Lord lives there shall no punishment come to you for this.
1 Samuel,28,11,The woman said Whom shall I bring up for you? He said Bring up Samuel for me.
1 Samuel,28,12,And when the woman saw Samuel she screamed and she said to Saul Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!
1 Samuel,28,13,The king said to her Be not afraid; what do you see? The woman said to Saul I see a god [terrifying superhuman being] coming up out of the earth!
1 Samuel,28,14,He said to her In what form is he? And she said An old man comes up covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel and he stooped with his face to the ground and made obeisance.
1 Samuel,28,15,And Samuel said to Saul Why have you disturbed me to bring me up? Saul answered I am bitterly distressed; for the Philistines make war against me and God has departed from me and answers me no more either by prophets or by dreams. Therefore I have called you that you may make known to me what I should do.
1 Samuel,28,16,Samuel said Why then do you ask me seeing that the Lord has turned from you and has become your enemy?
1 Samuel,28,17,The Lord has done to you as He said through me He would do; for [He] has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to your neighbor David.
1 Samuel,28,18,Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord or execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek therefore the Lord has done this thing to you this day.
1 Samuel,28,19,Moreover the Lord will also give Israel with you into the hands of the Philistines and tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me [among the dead]. The Lord also will give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.
1 Samuel,28,20,Then immediately Saul fell full length upon the earth floor [of the medium's house] and was exceedingly afraid because of Samuel's words. There was no strength in him for he had eaten nothing all day and all night.
1 Samuel,28,21,The woman came to Saul and seeing that he was greatly troubled she said to him Behold your handmaid has obeyed you and I have put my life in my hands and have listened to what you said to me.
1 Samuel,28,22,So now I pray you listen also to the voice of your handmaid and let me set a morsel of food before you and eat so you may have strength when you go on your way.
1 Samuel,28,23,But he said I will not eat. But his servants together with the woman urged him and he heeded their words. So he arose from the ground and sat upon the bed.
1 Samuel,28,24,The woman had a fat calf in the house; she hurried and killed it and took flour kneaded it and baked unleavened bread.
1 Samuel,28,25,Then she brought it before Saul and his servants and they ate. Then they rose up and went away that night.
1 Samuel,29,1,NOW THE Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek and the Israelites encamped by the fountain in Jezreel.
1 Samuel,29,2,As the Philistine lords were passing on by hundreds and by thousands and David and his men were in the rear with Achish
1 Samuel,29,3,The Philistine princes said What are these Hebrews doing here? Achish said to the Philistine princes Is not this David the servant of Saul king of Israel who has been with me these days and years and I have found no fault in him since he deserted to me to this day?
1 Samuel,29,4,And the Philistine princes were angry with Achish and they said to him Make this fellow return that he may go again to his place where you have assigned him and let him not go down with us to battle lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For how could David reconcile himself to his master? Would it not be with the heads of the men here?
1 Samuel,29,5,Is not this David of whom they sang to one another in dances Saul slew his thousands and David his ten thousands?
1 Samuel,29,6,Then Achish called David and said to him As surely as the Lord lives you have been honest and upright and for you to go out and come in with me in the army is good in my sight; for I have found no evil in you from the day of your coming to me to this day. Yet the lords do not approve of you.
1 Samuel,29,7,So return now and go peaceably so as not to displease the Philistine lords.
1 Samuel,29,8,David said to Achish But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant as long as I have been with you to this day that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
1 Samuel,29,9,And Achish said to David I know that you are as blameless in my sight as an angel of God; nevertheless the princes of the Philistines have said He shall not go up with us to the battle.
1 Samuel,29,10,So now rise up early in the morning with your master's servants who have come with you and as soon as you are up and have light depart.
1 Samuel,29,11,So David and his men rose up early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. But the Philistines went up to Jezreel [to fight against Israel].
1 Samuel,30,1,NOW WHEN David and his men came home to Ziklag on the third day they found that the Amalekites had made a raid on the South (the Negeb) and on Ziklag and had struck Ziklag and burned it with fire
1 Samuel,30,2,And had taken the women and all who were there both great and small captive. They killed no one but carried them off and went on their way.
1 Samuel,30,3,So David and his men came to the town and behold it was burned and their wives and sons and daughters were taken captive.
1 Samuel,30,4,Then David and the men with him lifted up their voices and wept until they had no more strength to weep.
1 Samuel,30,5,David's two wives also had been taken captive Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite.
1 Samuel,30,6,David was greatly distressed for the men spoke of stoning him because the souls of them all were bitterly grieved each man for his sons and daughters. But David encouraged and strengthened himself in the Lord his God.
1 Samuel,30,7,David said to Abiathar the priest Ahimelech's son I pray you bring me the ephod. And Abiathar brought him the ephod.
1 Samuel,30,8,And David inquired of the Lord saying Shall I pursue this troop? Shall I overtake them? The Lord answered him Pursue for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all.
1 Samuel,30,9,So David went he and the 600 men with him and came to the brook Besor; there those remained who were left behind.
1 Samuel,30,10,But David pursued he and 400 men for 200 stayed behind who were too exhausted and faint to cross the brook Besor.
1 Samuel,30,11,They found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David and gave him bread and he ate and water to drink
1 Samuel,30,12,And a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins; and when he had eaten his spirit returned to him for he had eaten no food or drunk any water for three days and three nights.
1 Samuel,30,13,And David said to him To whom do you belong? And from where have you come? He said I am a young man of Egypt servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me because three days ago I fell sick.
1 Samuel,30,14,We had made a raid on the South (Negeb) of the Cherethites and upon that which belongs to Judah and upon the South (Negeb) of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag with fire.
1 Samuel,30,15,And David said to him Can you take me down to this band? And he said Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master and I will bring you down to this band.
1 Samuel,30,16,And when he had brought David down behold the raiders were spread abroad over all the land eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
1 Samuel,30,17,And David smote them from twilight even to the evening of the next day and not a man of them escaped except 400 youths who rode camels and fled.
1 Samuel,30,18,David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken and rescued his two wives.
1 Samuel,30,19,Nothing was missing small or great sons or daughters spoil or anything that had been taken; David recovered all.
1 Samuel,30,20,Also David captured all the flocks and herds [which the enemy had] and the people drove those animals before him and said This is David's spoil.
1 Samuel,30,21,And David came to the 200 men who were so exhausted and faint that they could not follow [him] and had been left at the brook Besor [with the baggage]. They came to meet David and those with him and when he came near to the men he saluted them.
1 Samuel,30,22,Then all the wicked and base men who went with David said Because they did not go with us we will give them nothing of the spoil we have recovered except that every man may lead away his wife and children and depart.
1 Samuel,30,23,David said You shall not do so my brethren with what the Lord has given us. He has preserved us and has delivered into our hands the troop that came against us.
1 Samuel,30,24,Who would listen to you in this matter? For as is the share of him who goes into the battle so shall his share be who stays by the baggage. They shall share alike.
1 Samuel,30,25,And from that day to this he made it a statute and ordinance for Israel.
1 Samuel,30,26,When David came to Ziklag he sent part of the spoil to the elders of Judah his friends saying Here is a gift for you of the spoil of the enemies of the Lord:
1 Samuel,30,27,For those in Bethel Ramoth of the Negeb Jattir
1 Samuel,30,28,Aroer Siphmoth Eshtemoa
1 Samuel,30,29,Racal the cities of the Jerahmeelites the cities of the Kenites
1 Samuel,30,30,Hormah Bor-ashan Athach
1 Samuel,30,31,Hebron and for those in all the places David and his men had habitually haunted.
1 Samuel,31,1,NOW THE Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled before [them] and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
1 Samuel,31,2,And the Philistines pursued Saul and his sons and slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua Saul's sons.
1 Samuel,31,3,The battle went heavily against Saul and the archers severely wounded him.
1 Samuel,31,4,Saul said to his armor-bearer Draw your sword and thrust me through lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse and mock me. But his armor-bearer would not for he was terrified. So Saul took a sword and fell upon it.
1 Samuel,31,5,When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead he likewise fell upon his sword and died with him.
1 Samuel,31,6,So Saul his three sons his armor-bearer and all his men died that day together.
1 Samuel,31,7,And when the men of Israel on the other side of the valley and beyond the Jordan saw that the Israelites had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead they forsook the cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
1 Samuel,31,8,The next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
1 Samuel,31,9,They cut off Saul's head and stripped off his armor and sent them round about the land of the Philistines to publish it in the house of their idols and among the people.
1 Samuel,31,10,And they put Saul's armor in the house of the Ashtaroth [the idols representing the female deities Ashtoreth and Asherah] and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
1 Samuel,31,11,When the people of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul
1 Samuel,31,12,All the valiant men arose and went all night and they took the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth-shan and came to Jabesh and cremated them there.
1 Samuel,31,13,And they took their bones and buried them under a tree at Jabesh and fasted seven days.
2 Samuel,1,1,NOW AFTER the death of Saul when David returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites he had stayed two days in Ziklag
2 Samuel,1,2,When on the third day a man came from Saul's camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head. When he came to David he fell to the ground and did obeisance.
2 Samuel,1,3,David said to him Where have you come from? He said I have escaped from the camp of Israel.
2 Samuel,1,4,David said to him How did it go? Tell me. He answered The men have fled from the battle. Many have fallen and are dead; Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
2 Samuel,1,5,David said to the young man How do you know Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?
2 Samuel,1,6,The young man said By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa and I saw Saul leaning on his spear and behold the chariots and horsemen were close behind him.
2 Samuel,1,7,When he looked behind him he saw me and called to me. I answered Here I am.
2 Samuel,1,8,He asked me Who are you? I answered An Amalekite.
2 Samuel,1,9,He said to me Rise up against me and slay me; for terrible dizziness has come upon me yet my life is still in me [and I will be taken alive].
2 Samuel,1,10,So I stood up against him and slew him because I was sure he could not live after he had fallen. So I took the crown on his head and the bracelet on his arm and have brought them here to my lord.
2 Samuel,1,11,Then David grasped his own clothes and tore them; so did all the men with him.
2 Samuel,1,12,They mourned and wept for Saul and Jonathan his son and fasted until evening for the Lord's people and the house of Israel because of their defeat in battle.
2 Samuel,1,13,David said to the young man who told him Where are you from? He answered I am the son of a foreigner an Amalekite.
2 Samuel,1,14,David said to him Why were you not afraid to stretch forth your hand to destroy the Lord's anointed?
2 Samuel,1,15,David called one of the young men and said Go near and fall upon him. And he smote him so that he died.
2 Samuel,1,16,David said to [the fallen man] Your blood be upon your own head; for you have testified against yourself saying I have slain the Lord's anointed.
2 Samuel,1,17,David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and Jonathan his son
2 Samuel,1,18,And he commanded to teach it [the lament of ] the bow to the Israelites. Behold it is written in the Book of Jashar:
2 Samuel,1,19,Your glory O Israel is slain upon your high places. How have the mighty fallen!
2 Samuel,1,20,Tell it not in Gath announce it not in the streets of Ashkelon lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.
2 Samuel,1,21,O mountains of Gilboa let there be no dew or rain upon you or fields with offerings. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled the shield of Saul as though he were not anointed with oil.
2 Samuel,1,22,From the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the bow of Jonathan turned not back and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
2 Samuel,1,23,Saul and Jonathan beloved and lovely! In their lives and in their deaths they were not divided. They were swifter than eagles they were stronger than lions.
2 Samuel,1,24,You daughters of Israel weep over Saul who clothed you in scarlet with [other] delights who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
2 Samuel,1,25,How have the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan lies slain upon your high places.
2 Samuel,1,26,I am distressed for you my brother Jonathan; very pleasant have you been to me. Your love to me was wonderful passing the love of women.
2 Samuel,1,27,How have the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished!
2 Samuel,2,1,AFTER THIS David inquired of the Lord saying Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the Lord said to him Go up. David said To which shall I go up? And He said To Hebron.
2 Samuel,2,2,So David went up there with his two wives Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
2 Samuel,2,3,And David brought up his men who were with him each one with his household and they dwelt in the towns of Hebron.
2 Samuel,2,4,And the men of Judah came and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told David The men of Jabesh-gilead buried Saul.
2 Samuel,2,5,And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead saying May the Lord bless you because you showed kindness and loyalty to Saul your king and buried him.
2 Samuel,2,6,And now may the Lord show loving-kindness and faithfulness to you. I also will do well by you because you have done this.
2 Samuel,2,7,So now let your hands be strengthened and be valiant for your master Saul is dead and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.
2 Samuel,2,8,Now Abner son of Ner commander of Saul's army took Ish-bosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim.
2 Samuel,2,9,And he made him king over Gilead the Ashurites Jezreel Ephraim Benjamin and all Israel.
2 Samuel,2,10,Ish-bosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began his two-year reign over Israel. But the house of Judah followed David.
2 Samuel,2,11,And David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah for seven years and six months.
2 Samuel,2,12,And Abner son of Ner and the servants of Ish-bosheth son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
2 Samuel,2,13,Joab son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out also; and the two groups met by the pool of Gibeon seating themselves with one group on either side of the pool.
2 Samuel,2,14,And Abner said to Joab Let the young men now arise and have a contest before us. And Joab said Let them arise.
2 Samuel,2,15,Then there arose and went over by number--twelve of Benjamin who were with Ish-bosheth son of Saul and twelve of the servants of David.
2 Samuel,2,16,And each caught his opponent by the head and thrust his sword into his side; so they all fell together. Therefore that place was called the Field of Sharp Knives which is at Gibeon.
2 Samuel,2,17,A very fierce battle followed and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.
2 Samuel,2,18,Three sons of Zeruiah [the half sister of David] were there: Joab Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe or antelope.
2 Samuel,2,19,Asahel pursued Abner and as he ran he turned not to the right hand or to the left from following Abner.
2 Samuel,2,20,Then Abner looked behind him and said Are you Asahel? He answered I am.
2 Samuel,2,21,Abner said to him Turn aside to your right or left and seize one of the young men and take his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
2 Samuel,2,22,And Abner said again to Asahel Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then should I be able to face Joab your brother?
2 Samuel,2,23,Asahel refused to turn aside; so Abner with the rear end of his spear smote him through the abdomen and he fell and died where he fell. And all who came to the place where Asahel fell and died stood still.
2 Samuel,2,24,But Joab and Abishai [his brothers] pursued Abner; the sun was going down as they came to the hill of Ammah before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
2 Samuel,2,25,And the Benjamites gathered together behind Abner and became one troop and took their stand on the top of a hill.
2 Samuel,2,26,Then Abner called to Joab Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that bitterness will be the result? How long will it be then before you bid the people to stop pursuing their brethren?
2 Samuel,2,27,Joab said As God lives if you had not spoken surely the men would have stopped pursuing their brethren in the morning.
2 Samuel,2,28,So Joab blew a trumpet and all the people stood still and pursued Israel no more nor did they fight any more.
2 Samuel,2,29,Abner and his men went all night through the Arabah [plain] crossed the Jordan and went through the whole Bithron [district of ravines] and came to Mahanaim.
2 Samuel,2,30,Joab returned from pursuing Abner and when he had gathered all the people together there were missing of David's servants nineteen men besides Asahel.
2 Samuel,2,31,But the servants of David had slain of Benjamin 360 of Abner's men.
2 Samuel,2,32,And they took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father at Bethlehem. And Joab and his men walked all night and came to Hebron at daybreak.
2 Samuel,3,1,THERE WAS a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. But David grew stronger and stronger and the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.
2 Samuel,3,2,Sons were born to David in Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
2 Samuel,3,3,His second Chileab by Abigail widow of Nabal of Carmel; the third Absalom the son of Maacah daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
2 Samuel,3,4,The fourth Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth Shephatiah the son of Abital;
2 Samuel,3,5,And the sixth Ithream by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
2 Samuel,3,6,While there was war between the houses of Saul and David Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.
2 Samuel,3,7,Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ish-bosheth said to Abner Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?
2 Samuel,3,8,Then Abner was very angry at the words of Ish-bosheth and said Am I a dog's head [despicable and hostile] against Judah? This day I keep showing kindness and loyalty to the house of Saul your father to his brothers and his friends and have not delivered you into the hands of David; and yet you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman!
2 Samuel,3,9,May God do so to Abner and more also if I do not do for David what the Lord has sworn to him
2 Samuel,3,10,To transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and set the throne of David over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba.
2 Samuel,3,11,And Ish-bosheth could not answer Abner a word because he feared him.
2 Samuel,3,12,And Abner sent messengers to David where he was [at Hebron] saying Whose is the land? Make your league with me and my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel over to you.
2 Samuel,3,13,And David said Good. I will make a league with you. But I require one thing of you: that is you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal Saul's daughter when you come to see me.
2 Samuel,3,14,And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul's son saying Give me my wife Michal whom I betrothed for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
2 Samuel,3,15,And Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her [second] husband from Paltiel son of Laish [to whom Saul had given her].
2 Samuel,3,16,But her husband went with her weeping behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him Go back. And he did so.
2 Samuel,3,17,Abner talked with the seniors of Israel saying In times past you sought to make David king over you.
2 Samuel,3,18,Now then do it! For the Lord has spoken of David saying By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hands of the Philistines and of all their enemies.
2 Samuel,3,19,Abner also spoke to [the men of] Benjamin. Then [he] went to Hebron to tell David all that seemed good to Israel and the whole house of Benjamin to do.
2 Samuel,3,20,So Abner came to David at Hebron and twenty men along with him. And David made Abner and the men with him a feast.
2 Samuel,3,21,Abner said to David I will go and gather all Israel to my lord the king that they may make a league with you and that you may reign over all that your heart desires. So David sent Abner away in peace.
2 Samuel,3,22,Then the servants of David came with Joab from pursuing a troop and brought much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David in Hebron for he had sent him away and he had gone in peace.
2 Samuel,3,23,When Joab and all the army with him had come it was told to Joab Abner son of Ner came to the king and he has sent him away and he is gone in peace.
2 Samuel,3,24,Then Joab came to the king and said What have you done? Behold Abner came to you. Why is it you have sent him away and he is quite gone?
2 Samuel,3,25,You know that Abner son of Ner came to deceive you and to know your going out and coming in and all you are doing.
2 Samuel,3,26,When Joab came from seeing David he sent messengers after Abner and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David did not know it.
2 Samuel,3,27,And when Abner returned to Hebron Joab took him aside to the center of the gate to speak to him privately and there he smote Abner in the abdomen so that he died to avenge the blood of Asahel Joab's brother.
2 Samuel,3,28,When David heard of it he said I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord forever of the blood of Abner son of Ner.
2 Samuel,3,29,Let it fall on the head of Joab and on all his father's house; and let the house of Joab never be without one who has a discharge or is a leper or walks with a crutch or is a distaff holder [unfit for war] or who falls by the sword or lacks food!
2 Samuel,3,30,So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
2 Samuel,3,31,And David said to Joab and to all the people with him Rend your clothes gird yourselves with sackcloth and mourn before Abner. And King David followed the bier.
2 Samuel,3,32,They buried Abner in Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner and all the people wept.
2 Samuel,3,33,And the king lamented over Abner and said Should Abner die as a fool dies?
2 Samuel,3,34,Your hands were not bound or your feet put into fetters; as a man falls before wicked men so you fell. And all the people wept again over him.
2 Samuel,3,35,All the people came to urge David to eat food while it was yet day; but David took an oath saying May God do so to me and more also if I taste bread or anything else till the sun is down.
2 Samuel,3,36,And all the people took notice of it and it pleased them as whatever the king did pleased all the people.
2 Samuel,3,37,For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not the king's will to slay Abner son of Ner.
2 Samuel,3,38,King David said to his servants Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
2 Samuel,3,39,And I am this day weak though anointed [but not crowned] king; these sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. May the Lord repay the evildoer according to his wickedness!
2 Samuel,4,1,WHEN ISH-BOSHETH Saul's son [king over Israel] heard that Abner was dead in Hebron his courage failed and all the Israelites were troubled and dismayed.
2 Samuel,4,2,Saul's son had two men who were captains of raiding bands. One was named Baanah and the other Rechab sons of Rimmon the Beerothite of Benjamin--for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin
2 Samuel,4,3,And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been sojourners there to this day.
2 Samuel,4,4,Jonathan Saul's son had a son who was a cripple in his feet. He was five years old when the news came out of Jezreel [of the deaths] of Saul and Jonathan. And the boy's nurse took him up and fled; and in her haste he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.
2 Samuel,4,5,Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite Rechab and Baanah went about in the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth who lay resting on his bed at noon.
2 Samuel,4,6,And they came into the interior of the house as though they were delivering wheat and they smote him in the body; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
2 Samuel,4,7,Now when they had come into the house and he lay on his bed in his bedroom they [not only] smote and slew him [but] beheaded him and took his head and went by the way of the plain all night.
2 Samuel,4,8,And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king Behold the head of Ish-bosheth son of Saul your enemy who sought your life; and the Lord has avenged my lord the king this day on Saul and on his offspring.
2 Samuel,4,9,And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother sons of Rimmon the Beerothite As the Lord lives Who redeemed my life out of all adversity
2 Samuel,4,10,When one told me Behold Saul is dead thinking he was bringing good news I seized and slew him in Ziklag who expected me to give him a reward for his news.
2 Samuel,4,11,How much more--when wicked men have slain a just man in his own house on his bed--shall I not now require his blood of your hand and remove you from the earth!
2 Samuel,4,12,David commanded his young men and they slew them and cut off their hands and feet and hanged them over the pool in Hebron. But they took Ish-bosheth's head and buried it in Hebron in the tomb of Abner [his relative and once chief supporter].
2 Samuel,5,1,THEN ALL the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said Behold we are your bone and your flesh.
2 Samuel,5,2,In times past when Saul was king over us it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the Lord told you You shall feed My people Israel and be prince over [them].
2 Samuel,5,3,So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron and King David made a covenant with them [there] before the Lord and they anointed [him] king over Israel.
2 Samuel,5,4,David was thirty years old when he began his forty-year reign.
2 Samuel,5,5,In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
2 Samuel,5,6,And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites the inhabitants of the land who said to David You shall not enter here for the blind and the lame will prevent you; they thought David cannot come in here.
2 Samuel,5,7,Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion that is the City of David.
2 Samuel,5,8,David said on that day Whoever smites the Jebusites let him get up through the water shaft and smite the lame and the blind who are detested by David's soul. So they say The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
2 Samuel,5,9,So David dwelt in the stronghold and called it the City of David. And he built round about from the Millo and inward.
2 Samuel,5,10,David became greater and greater for the Lord God of hosts was with him.
2 Samuel,5,11,Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David and cedar trees carpenters and masons; and they built David a house.
2 Samuel,5,12,And David perceived that the Lord had established him king over Israel and that He had exalted his kingdom for His people Israel's sake.
2 Samuel,5,13,And David took more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem after he came from Hebron and other sons and daughters were born to [him].
2 Samuel,5,14,And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua Shobab Nathan Solomon
2 Samuel,5,15,Ibhar Elishua Nepheg Japhia
2 Samuel,5,16,Elishama Eliada and Eliphelet.
2 Samuel,5,17,When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel they all went up to find [him] but [he] heard of it and went down to the stronghold.
2 Samuel,5,18,The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the Valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel,5,19,David inquired of the Lord saying Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said to David Go up for I will surely deliver [them] into your hand.
2 Samuel,5,20,And David came to Baal-perazim and he smote them there and said The Lord has broken through my enemies before me like the bursting out of great waters. So he called the name of that place Baal-perazim [Lord of breaking through].
2 Samuel,5,21,There the Philistines left their images and David and his men took them away.
2 Samuel,5,22,The Philistines came up again and spread themselves out in the Valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel,5,23,When David inquired of the Lord He said You shall not go up but go around behind them and come upon them over opposite the mulberry (or balsam) trees.
2 Samuel,5,24,And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees then bestir yourselves for then has the Lord gone out before you to smite the army of the Philistines.
2 Samuel,5,25,And David did as the Lord had commanded him and smote the Philistines from Geba to Gezer.
2 Samuel,6,1,AGAIN DAVID gathered together all the chosen men of Israel 30000.
2 Samuel,6,2,And [he] arose and went with all the people who were with him to Baale-judah [Kiriath-jearim] to bring up from there the ark of God which is called by the name of the Lord of hosts Who sits enthroned above the cherubim.
2 Samuel,6,3,And they set the ark of God upon a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio sons of Abinadab drove the new cart.
2 Samuel,6,4,And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was on the hill with the ark of God; and Ahio went before the ark.
2 Samuel,6,5,And David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord with all their might with songs lyres harps tambourines castanets and cymbals.
2 Samuel,6,6,And when they came to Nacon's threshing floor Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it for the oxen stumbled and shook it.
2 Samuel,6,7,And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for touching the ark and he died there by the ark of God.
2 Samuel,6,8,David was grieved and offended because the Lord had broken forth upon Uzzah and that place is called Perez-uzzah [the breaking forth upon Uzzah] to this day.
2 Samuel,6,9,David was afraid of the Lord that day and said How can the ark of the Lord come to me?
2 Samuel,6,10,So David was not willing to take the ark of the Lord to him into the City of David; but he took it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
2 Samuel,6,11,And the ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months and the Lord blessed Obed-edom and all his household.
2 Samuel,6,12,And it was told King David The Lord has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the City of David with rejoicing;
2 Samuel,6,13,And when those who bore the ark of the Lord had gone six paces he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.
2 Samuel,6,14,And David danced before the Lord with all his might clad in a linen ephod [a priest's upper garment].
2 Samuel,6,15,So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet.
2 Samuel,6,16,As the ark of the Lord came into the City of David Michal Saul's daughter [David's wife] looked out of the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord and she despised him in her heart.
2 Samuel,6,17,They brought in the ark of the Lord and set it in its place inside the tent which David had pitched for it and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord.
2 Samuel,6,18,When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings he blessed the people in the name [and presence] of the Lord of hosts
2 Samuel,6,19,And distributed among all the people the whole multitude of Israel both to men and women to each a cake of bread a portion of meat and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed each to his house.
2 Samuel,6,20,Then David returned to bless his household. And [his wife] Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said How glorious was the king of Israel today who stripped himself of his kingly robes and uncovered himself in the eyes of his servants' maids as one of the worthless fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!
2 Samuel,6,21,David said to Michal It was before the Lord Who chose me above your father and all his house to appoint me as prince over Israel the people of the Lord. Therefore will I make merry [in pure enjoyment] before the Lord.
2 Samuel,6,22,I will be still more lightly esteemed than this and will humble and lower myself in my own sight [and yours]. But by the maids you mentioned I will be held in honor.
2 Samuel,6,23,And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
2 Samuel,7,1,WHEN KING David dwelt in his house and the Lord had given him rest from all his surrounding enemies
2 Samuel,7,2,The king said to Nathan the prophet See now I dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of God dwells within curtains.
2 Samuel,7,3,And Nathan said to the king Go do all that is in your heart for the Lord is with you.
2 Samuel,7,4,That night the word of the Lord came to Nathan saying
2 Samuel,7,5,Go and tell My servant David Thus says the Lord: Shall you build Me a house in which to dwell?
2 Samuel,7,6,For I have not dwelt in a house since I brought the Israelites out of Egypt to this day but have moved about with a tent for My dwelling.
2 Samuel,7,7,In all the places where I have moved with all the Israelites did I speak a word to any from the tribes of Israel whom I commanded to be shepherd of My people Israel asking Why do you not build Me a house of cedar?
2 Samuel,7,8,So now say this to My servant David Thus says the Lord of hosts: I took you from the pasture from following the sheep to be prince over My people Israel.
2 Samuel,7,9,And I was with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great name like [that] of the great men of the earth.
2 Samuel,7,10,And I will appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and be moved no more. And wicked men shall afflict them no more as formerly
2 Samuel,7,11,And as from the time that I appointed judges over My people Israel; and I will cause you to rest from all your enemies. Also the Lord declares to you that He will make for you a house:
2 Samuel,7,12,And when your days are fulfilled and you sleep with your fathers I will set up after you your offspring who shall be born to you and I will establish his kingdom.
2 Samuel,7,13,He shall build a house for My Name [and My Presence] and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
2 Samuel,7,14,I will be his Father and he shall be My son. When he commits iniquity I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the sons of men.
2 Samuel,7,15,But My mercy and loving-kindness shall not depart from him as I took [them] from Saul whom I took away from before you.
2 Samuel,7,16,And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before you; your throne shall be established forever.
2 Samuel,7,17,In accordance with all these words and all this vision Nathan spoke to David.
2 Samuel,7,18,Then King David went in and sat before the Lord and said Who am I O Lord God and what is my house that You have brought me this far?
2 Samuel,7,19,Then as if this were a little thing in Your eyes O Lord God You have spoken also of Your servant's house in the far distant future. And this is the law for man O Lord God!
2 Samuel,7,20,What more can David say to You? For You know Your servant O Lord God.
2 Samuel,7,21,Because of Your promise and as Your own heart dictates You have done all these astounding things to make Your servant know and understand.
2 Samuel,7,22,Therefore You are great O Lord God; for none is like You nor is there any God besides You according to all [You have made] our ears to hear.
2 Samuel,7,23,What [other] one nation on earth is like Your people Israel whom God went to redeem to be a people for Himself and to make for Himself a name? You have done great and terrible things for Yourself and for Your land before Your people whom You redeemed and delivered for Yourself from Egypt from the nations and their gods.
2 Samuel,7,24,And You have established for Yourself Your people Israel to be Your people forever and You Lord became their God.
2 Samuel,7,25,Now O Lord God confirm forever the word You have given as to Your servant and his house; and do as You have said
2 Samuel,7,26,And Your name [and presence] shall be magnified forever saying The Lord of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of Your servant David will be made firm before You.
2 Samuel,7,27,For You O Lord of hosts God of Israel have revealed this to Your servant: I will build you a house. So Your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to You.
2 Samuel,7,28,And now O Lord God You are God and Your words are truth and You have promised this good thing to Your servant.
2 Samuel,7,29,Therefore now let it please You to bless the house of Your servant that it may continue forever before You; for You O Lord God have spoken it and with Your blessing let [his] house be blessed forever.
2 Samuel,8,1,AFTER THIS David smote the Philistines and subdued them and he took Metheg-ammah out of the hands of the Philistines.
2 Samuel,8,2,He defeated Moab and measured them with a line making them lie down on the ground; two lines he measured to be put to death and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David bringing tribute.
2 Samuel,8,3,David also defeated Hadadezer son of Rehob king of Zobah as he went to restore his power at the river [Euphrates].
2 Samuel,8,4,David took from him 1700 horsemen and 20000 foot soldiers; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses except he reserved enough of them for 100 chariots.
2 Samuel,8,5,And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah David slew 22000 of them.
2 Samuel,8,6,David put garrisons in Syrian Damascus and the Syrians became [his] servants and brought tribute. The Lord preserved and gave victory to David wherever he went.
2 Samuel,8,7,And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel,8,8,And from Betah and Berothai cities of Hadadezer King David exacted an immense amount of bronze.
2 Samuel,8,9,When Toi king of Hamath heard about David's defeat of all the forces of Hadadezer
2 Samuel,8,10,[He] sent Joram his son to King David to salute and congratulate him about his battle and defeat of Hadadezer. For Hadadezer had had wars with Toi. Joram brought vessels of silver gold and bronze.
2 Samuel,8,11,These King David dedicated to the Lord with the silver and gold that he had dedicated from all the nations he subdued:
2 Samuel,8,12,From Syria Moab the Ammonites the Philistines Amalek and from the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob king of Zobah.
2 Samuel,8,13,David won renown. When he returned he slew 18000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
2 Samuel,8,14,He put garrisons throughout all Edom and all the Edomites became his servants. And the Lord preserved and gave victory to [him] wherever he went.
2 Samuel,8,15,So David reigned over all Israel and executed justice and righteousness for all his people.
2 Samuel,8,16,Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder;
2 Samuel,8,17,Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were the [chief] priests and Seraiah was the scribe;
2 Samuel,8,18,Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and Pelethites [the king's bodyguards]; and David's sons were chief [confidential] assistants to the king.
2 Samuel,9,1,AND DAVID said Is there still anyone left of the house of Saul to whom I may show kindness for Jonathan's sake?
2 Samuel,9,2,And of the house of Saul there was a servant whose name was Ziba. When they had called him to David he said to him Are you Ziba? He said I your servant am he.
2 Samuel,9,3,The king said Is there not still someone of the house of Saul to whom I may show the [unfailing unsought unlimited] mercy and kindness of God? Ziba replied Jonathan has yet a son who is lame in his feet.
2 Samuel,9,4,And the king said Where is he? Ziba replied He is in the house of Machir son of Ammiel in Lo-debar.
2 Samuel,9,5,Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir son of Ammiel at Lo-debar.
2 Samuel,9,6,And Mephibosheth son of Jonathan the son of Saul came to David and fell on his face and did obeisance. David said Mephibosheth! And he answered Behold your servant!
2 Samuel,9,7,David said to him Fear not for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father's sake and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father [grandfather] and you shall eat at my table always.
2 Samuel,9,8,And [the cripple] bowed himself and said What is your servant that you should look upon such a dead dog as I am?
2 Samuel,9,9,Then the king called to Ziba Saul's servant and said to him I have given your master's son [grandson] all that belonged to Saul and to all his house.
2 Samuel,9,10,And you shall till the land for him you your sons and your servants and you shall bring in the produce that your master's heir may have food to eat; but Mephibosheth your master's son [grandson] shall eat always at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
2 Samuel,9,11,Then Ziba said to the king Your servant will do according to all my lord the king commands. So Mephibosheth ate at David's table as one of the king's sons.
2 Samuel,9,12,Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Micha. And all who dwelt in Ziba's house were servants to Mephibosheth.
2 Samuel,9,13,So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem for he ate continually at the king's table [even though] he was lame in both feet.
2 Samuel,10,1,LATER THE king of the Ammonites died and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
2 Samuel,10,2,David said I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash as his father did to me. So David sent his servants to console him for his father's death; and they came into the land of the Ammonites
2 Samuel,10,3,But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord Do you think that it is because David honors your father that he has sent comforters to you? Has he not rather sent his servants to you to search the city spy it out and overthrow it?
2 Samuel,10,4,So Hanun took David's servants and shaved off half their beards and cut off their garments in the middle at their hips and sent them away.
2 Samuel,10,5,When it was told David he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said Tarry at Jericho until your beards are grown and then return.
2 Samuel,10,6,And when the Ammonites saw that they had made themselves obnoxious and disgusting to David they sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob and of Zobah 20000 foot soldiers and of the king of Maacah 1000 men and of Tob 12000 men.
2 Samuel,10,7,When David heard of it he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men.
2 Samuel,10,8,And the Ammonites came out and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate but the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were stationed by themselves in the open country.
2 Samuel,10,9,When Joab saw that the battlefront was against him before and behind he picked some of all the choice men of Israel and put them in array against the Syrians.
2 Samuel,10,10,The rest of the men Joab gave over to Abishai his brother that he might put them in array against the Ammonites.
2 Samuel,10,11,Joab said If the Syrians are too strong for me then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you I will come and help you.
2 Samuel,10,12,Be of good courage; let us play the man for our people and the cities of our God. And may the Lord do what seems good to Him.
2 Samuel,10,13,And Joab and the people who were with him drew near to battle against the Syrians and they fled before him.
2 Samuel,10,14,And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians had fled they also fled before Abishai and entered the city. So Joab returned from battling against the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel,10,15,When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel they gathered together.
2 Samuel,10,16,Hadadezer sent and brought the Syrians who were beyond the river [Euphrates]; and they came to Helam with Shobach commander of the army of Hadadezer leading them.
2 Samuel,10,17,When David was told he gathered all Israel crossed the Jordan and came to Helam. Then the Syrians set themselves in array against David and fought with him.
2 Samuel,10,18,The Syrians fled before Israel and David slew of [them] the men of 700 chariots and 40000 horsemen and smote Shobach captain of their army who died there.
2 Samuel,10,19,And when all the kings serving Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel they made peace with Israel and served them. So the Syrians were afraid to help the Ammonites any more.
2 Samuel,11,1,IN THE spring when kings go forth to battle David sent Joab with his servants and all Israel and they ravaged the Ammonites [country] and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem.
2 Samuel,11,2,One evening David arose from his couch and was walking on the roof of the king's house when from there he saw a woman bathing; and she was very lovely to behold.
2 Samuel,11,3,David sent and inquired about the woman. One said Is not this Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
2 Samuel,11,4,And David sent messengers and took her. And she came in to him and he lay with her--for she was purified from her uncleanness. Then she returned to her house.
2 Samuel,11,5,And the woman became pregnant and sent and told David I am with child.
2 Samuel,11,6,David sent to Joab saying Send me Uriah the Hittite. So Joab sent [him] Uriah.
2 Samuel,11,7,When Uriah had come to him David asked him how Joab was how the people fared and how the war progressed.
2 Samuel,11,8,David said to Uriah Go down to your house and wash your feet. Uriah went out of the king's house and there followed him a mess of food [a gift] from the king.
2 Samuel,11,9,But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord and did not go down to his house.
2 Samuel,11,10,When they told David Uriah did not go down to his house David said to Uriah Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?
2 Samuel,11,11,Uriah said to David The ark and Israel and Judah live in tents and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Shall I then go to my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife? As you live and as my soul lives I will not do this thing.
2 Samuel,11,12,And David said to Uriah Remain here today also and tomorrow I will let you depart. So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.
2 Samuel,11,13,David invited him and he ate with him and drank so that he made him drunk; but that night he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord and did not go down to his house.
2 Samuel,11,14,In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.
2 Samuel,11,15,And he wrote in the letter Put Uriah in the front line of the heaviest fighting and withdraw from him that he may be struck down and die.
2 Samuel,11,16,So when Joab was besieging the city he assigned Uriah opposite where he knew the enemy's most valiant men were.
2 Samuel,11,17,And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab and some of the servants of David fell. Uriah the Hittite died also.
2 Samuel,11,18,Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war.
2 Samuel,11,19,And he charged the messenger When you have finished reporting matters of the war to the king
2 Samuel,11,20,Then if the king's anger rises and he says to you Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Did you not know they would shoot from the wall?
2 Samuel,11,21,Who killed Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth (Gideon)? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall so that he died in Thebez? Why did you go near the wall? Then say Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
2 Samuel,11,22,So the messenger went and told David all for which Joab had sent him.
2 Samuel,11,23,The messenger said to David Surely the men prevailed against us and came out to us in to the field but we were upon them even to the entrance of the gate.
2 Samuel,11,24,Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall. Some of the king's servants are dead and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
2 Samuel,11,25,Then David said to the messenger Say to Joab Let not this thing disturb you for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your attack upon the city and overthrow it. And encourage Joab.
2 Samuel,11,26,When Uriah's wife heard that her husband was dead she mourned for Uriah.
2 Samuel,11,27,And when the mourning was past David sent and brought her to his house and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of the Lord.
2 Samuel,12,1,AND THE Lord sent Nathan to David. He came and said to him There were two men in a city one rich and the other poor.
2 Samuel,12,2,The rich man had very many flocks and herds
2 Samuel,12,3,But the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb which he had bought and brought up and it grew up with him and his children. It ate of his own morsel drank from his own cup lay in his bosom and was like a daughter to him.
2 Samuel,12,4,Now a traveler came to the rich man and to avoid taking one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the wayfaring man who had come to him he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for his guest.
2 Samuel,12,5,Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan As the Lord lives the man who has done this is a son [worthy] of death.
2 Samuel,12,6,He shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and had no pity.
2 Samuel,12,7,Then Nathan said to David You are the man! Thus says the Lord the God of Israel: I anointed you king of Israel and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.
2 Samuel,12,8,And I gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your bosom and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little I would have added that much again.
2 Samuel,12,9,Why have you despised the commandment of the Lord doing evil in His sight? You have slain Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife to be your wife. You have murdered him with the sword of the Ammonites.
2 Samuel,12,10,Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house because [you have not only despised My command but] you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.
2 Samuel,12,11,Thus says the Lord Behold I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
2 Samuel,12,12,For you did it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun. [Fulfilled in II Sam. 16:21 22.]
2 Samuel,12,13,And David said to Nathan I have sinned against the Lord. And Nathan said to David The Lord also has put away your sin; you shall not die.
2 Samuel,12,14,Nevertheless because by this deed you have utterly scorned the Lord and given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme the child that is born to you shall surely die.
2 Samuel,12,15,Then Nathan departed to his house. And the Lord struck the child that Uriah's widow bore to David and he was very sick.
2 Samuel,12,16,David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted and went in and lay all night [repeatedly] on the floor.
2 Samuel,12,17,His older house servants arose [in the night] and went to him to raise him up from the floor but he would not nor did he eat food with them.
2 Samuel,12,18,And on the seventh day the child died. David's servants feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said While the child was yet alive we spoke to him and he would not listen to our voices; will he then harm himself if we tell him the child is dead?
2 Samuel,12,19,But when David saw that his servants whispered he perceived that the child was dead. So he said to them Is the child dead? And they said He is.
2 Samuel,12,20,Then David arose from the floor washed anointed himself changed his apparel and went into the house of the Lord and worshiped. Then he came to his own house and when he asked they set food before him and he ate.
2 Samuel,12,21,Then his servants said to him What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept while the child was alive but when the child was dead you arose and ate food.
2 Samuel,12,22,David said While the child was still alive I fasted and wept; for I said Who knows whether the Lord will be gracious to me and let the child live?
2 Samuel,12,23,But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him but he will not return to me.
2 Samuel,12,24,David comforted Bathsheba his wife and went to her and lay with her; and she bore a son and she called his name Solomon. And the Lord loved [the child];
2 Samuel,12,25,He sent [a message] by the hand of Nathan the prophet and [Nathan] called the boy's [special] name Jedidiah [beloved of the Lord] because the Lord [loved the child].
2 Samuel,12,26,Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and took the royal city.
2 Samuel,12,27,And Joab sent messengers to David and said I have fought against Rabbah and have taken the city of waters.
2 Samuel,12,28,Now therefore assemble the rest of the men encamp against the city and take it lest I take the city and it be called after my name.
2 Samuel,12,29,So David gathered all the men went to Rabbah fought against it and took it.
2 Samuel,12,30,And he took the crown of their king [of Malcham] from his head; the weight of it was a talent of gold and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth exceedingly much spoil from the city.
2 Samuel,12,31,And he brought forth the people who were there and put them to [work with] saws and iron threshing sledges and axes and made them labor at the brickkiln. And he did this to all the Ammonite cities. Then [he] and all the men returned to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel,13,1,ABSALOM SON of David had a fair sister whose name was Tamar and Amnon [her half brother] son of David loved her.
2 Samuel,13,2,And Amnon was so troubled that he fell sick for his [half] sister Tamar for she was a virgin and Amnon thought it impossible for him to do anything to her.
2 Samuel,13,3,But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab son of Shimeah David's brother; and Jonadab was a very crafty man.
2 Samuel,13,4,He said to Amnon Why are you the king's son so lean and weak-looking from day to day? Will you not tell me? And Amnon said to him I love Tamar my [half] brother Absalom's sister.
2 Samuel,13,5,Jonadab said to him Go to bed and pretend you are sick; and when your father David comes to see you say to him Let my sister Tamar come and give me food and prepare it in my sight that I may see it and eat it from her hand.
2 Samuel,13,6,So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick; and when the king came to see him Amnon said to the king I pray you let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that I may eat from her hand.
2 Samuel,13,7,Then David sent home and told Tamar Go now to your brother Amnon's house and prepare food for him.
2 Samuel,13,8,So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house and he was in bed. And she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked them.
2 Samuel,13,9,She took the pan and emptied it out before him but he refused to eat. And Amnon said Send everyone out from me. So everyone went out from him.
2 Samuel,13,10,Then Amnon said to Tamar Bring the food here into the bedroom so I may eat from your hand. So Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother.
2 Samuel,13,11,And when she brought them to him he took hold of her and said Come lie with me my sister.
2 Samuel,13,12,She replied No my brother! Do not force and humble me for no such thing should be done in Israel! Do not do this foolhardy scandalous thing!
2 Samuel,13,13,And I how could I rid myself of my shame? And you you will be [considered] one of the stupid fools in Israel. Now therefore I pray you speak to the king for he will not withhold me from you.
2 Samuel,13,14,But he would not listen to her and being stronger than she he forced her and lay with her.
2 Samuel,13,15,Then Amnon hated her exceedingly so that his hatred for her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her Get up and get out!
2 Samuel,13,16,But she said No! This great evil of sending me away is worse than what you did to me. But he would not listen to her.
2 Samuel,13,17,He called the servant who served him and said Put this woman out of my presence now and bolt the door after her!
2 Samuel,13,18,Now [Tamar] was wearing a long robe with sleeves and of various colors for in such robes were the king's virgin daughters clad of old. Then Amnon's servant brought her out and bolted the door after her.
2 Samuel,13,19,And [she] put ashes on her head and tore the long sleeved robe which she wore and she laid her hand on her head and went away shrieking and wailing.
2 Samuel,13,20,And Absalom her brother said to her Has your brother Amnon been with you? Be quiet now my sister. He is your brother; take not this matter to heart. So Tamar dwelt in her brother Absalom's house a desolate woman.
2 Samuel,13,21,But when King David heard of all these things he was very angry.
2 Samuel,13,22,And Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon because he had humbled his sister Tamar.
2 Samuel,13,23,After two full years Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal-hazor near Ephraim and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
2 Samuel,13,24,Absalom came to the king and said Behold your servant has sheepshearers; I pray you let the king and his servants go with your servant.
2 Samuel,13,25,And the king said to Absalom No my son let us not all go lest we be burdensome to you. Absalom urged David; still he would not go but he blessed him.
2 Samuel,13,26,Then said Absalom If not I pray you let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him Why should he go with you?
2 Samuel,13,27,But Absalom urged him and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
2 Samuel,13,28,Now Absalom commanded his servants Notice now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine and when I say to you Strike Amnon then kill him. Fear not; have I not commanded you? Be courageous and brave.
2 Samuel,13,29,And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose and every man mounted his mule and fled.
2 Samuel,13,30,While they were on the way the word came to David Absalom has killed all the king's sons and not one of them is left.
2 Samuel,13,31,Then the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the floor; and all his servants standing by tore their clothes.
2 Samuel,13,32,But Jonadab son of Shimeah David's brother said Let not my lord suppose they have killed all the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead. This purpose has shown itself on Absalom's determined mouth ever since the day Amnon humiliated his sister Tamar.
2 Samuel,13,33,So let not my lord the king take the thing to heart and think all the king's sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.
2 Samuel,13,34,But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch looked up and behold many people were coming by the way of the hillside behind him.
2 Samuel,13,35,And Jonadab said to the king See the king's sons are coming. It is as your servant said.
2 Samuel,13,36,And as he finished speaking the king's sons came and lifted up their voices and wept; and the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly.
2 Samuel,13,37,But Absalom fled and went to [his mother's father] Talmai son of Ammihud king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son [Amnon] every day.
2 Samuel,13,38,So Absalom fled to Geshur and was there three years.
2 Samuel,13,39,And the spirit of King David longed to go forth to Absalom for he was comforted about Amnon seeing that he was dead.
2 Samuel,14,1,NOW JOAB son of Zeruiah knew that the king's heart was toward Absalom.
2 Samuel,14,2,And Joab sent to Tekoah and brought from there a wise woman and said to her Pretend to be a mourner; put on mourning apparel do not anoint yourself with oil but act like a woman who has long been mourning for the dead.
2 Samuel,14,3,And go to the king and speak thus to him. And Joab told her what to say.
2 Samuel,14,4,When the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance and said Help O king!
2 Samuel,14,5,The king asked her What troubles you? She said I am a widow; my husband is dead.
2 Samuel,14,6,And your handmaid had two sons and they quarreled with one another in the field. There was no one to separate them and one struck the other and killed him.
2 Samuel,14,7,And behold our whole family has risen against your handmaid and they say Deliver him who slew his brother that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew; and so they would destroy the heir also. And so quenching my coal which is left they would leave to my husband neither name nor remnant upon the earth.
2 Samuel,14,8,David said to the woman Go home and I will give orders concerning you.
2 Samuel,14,9,And the woman of Tekoah said to the king My lord O king let the guilt be on me and on my father's house; let the king and his throne be guiltless.
2 Samuel,14,10,The king said If anyone says anything to you bring him to me and he shall not touch you again.
2 Samuel,14,11,Then she said I pray you let the king remember the Lord your God that the avenger of blood destroy not any more lest they destroy my son. And David said As the Lord lives there shall not one hair of your son fall to the earth.
2 Samuel,14,12,Then the woman said Let your handmaid I pray you speak one word to my lord the king. He said Say on.
2 Samuel,14,13,[She] said Why then have you planned such a thing against God's people? For in speaking this word the king is like one who is guilty in that [he] does not bring home his banished one.
2 Samuel,14,14,We must all die; we are like water spilled on the ground which cannot be gathered up again. And God does not take away life but devises means so that he who is banished may not be an utter outcast from Him.
2 Samuel,14,15,And now I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. And I thought I will speak to the king; it may be that he will perform the request of his servant.
2 Samuel,14,16,For the king will hear to deliver his handmaid from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from [Israel] the inheritance of God.
2 Samuel,14,17,And the woman said The word of my lord the king will now give me rest and security for as an angel of God is my lord the king to hear and discern good and evil. May the Lord your God be with you!
2 Samuel,14,18,Then the king said to the woman Hide not from me anything I ask you. And the woman said Let my lord the king speak.
2 Samuel,14,19,The king said Is the hand of Joab with you in all this? And the woman answered As your soul lives my lord the king none can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything my lord the king has said. It was your servant Joab who directed me; he put all these words in my mouth.
2 Samuel,14,20,In order to change the course of matters [between Absalom and his father] your servant Joab did this. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God--to know all things that are on the earth.
2 Samuel,14,21,Then the king said to Joab Behold now I grant this; go bring back the young man Absalom.
2 Samuel,14,22,And Joab fell to the ground on his face and did obeisance and thanked the king. And Joab said Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight my lord O king in that the king has performed the request of his servant.
2 Samuel,14,23,So Joab arose went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel,14,24,And the king said Let him go to his own house and let him not see my face. So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the king's face.
2 Samuel,14,25,But in all Israel there was none so much to be praised for his beauty as Absalom; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
2 Samuel,14,26,And when he cut the hair of his head he weighed it--for at each year's end he cut it because its weight was a burden to him--and it weighed 200 shekels by the king's weight.
2 Samuel,14,27,There were born to Absalom three sons and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a beautiful woman.
2 Samuel,14,28,Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem and did not see the king's face.
2 Samuel,14,29,So Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king but he would not come to him; even when he sent again the second time he would not come.
2 Samuel,14,30,Therefore Absalom said to his servants See Joab's field is near mine and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. So Absalom's servants set the field afire.
2 Samuel,14,31,Then Joab arose and went to Absalom at his house and said to him Why have your servants set my field on fire?
2 Samuel,14,32,Absalom answered Joab I sent to you saying Come here that I may send you to the king to ask Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still. Now therefore [Joab] let me see the king and if there is iniquity and guilt in me let him kill me.
2 Samuel,14,33,So Joab came to the king and told him. And when David had called for Absalom he came to him and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and [David] kissed Absalom.
2 Samuel,15,1,AFTER THIS Absalom got a chariot and horses and fifty men to run before him.
2 Samuel,15,2,And [he] rose up early and stood beside the gateway; and when any man who had a controversy came to the king for judgment Absalom called to him Of what city are you? And he would say Your servant is of such and such a tribe of Israel.
2 Samuel,15,3,Absalom would say to him Your claims are good and right but there is no man appointed as the king's agent to hear you.
2 Samuel,15,4,Absalom added Oh that I were judge in the land! Then every man with any suit or cause might come to me and I would do him justice!
2 Samuel,15,5,And whenever a man came near to do obeisance to him he would put out his hand take hold of him and kiss him.
2 Samuel,15,6,Thus Absalom did to all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
2 Samuel,15,7,And after [four] years Absalom said to the king I pray you let me go to Hebron [his birthplace] and pay my vow to the Lord.
2 Samuel,15,8,For your servant vowed while I dwelt at Geshur in Syria If the Lord will bring me again to Jerusalem then I will serve the Lord [by offering a sacrifice].
2 Samuel,15,9,And the king said to him Go in peace. So he arose and went to Hebron.
2 Samuel,15,10,But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel saying As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet then say Absalom is king at Hebron.
2 Samuel,15,11,With Absalom went 200 men from Jerusalem who were invited [as guests to his sacrificial feast]; and they went in their simplicity and they knew not a thing.
2 Samuel,15,12,And while Absalom was offering the sacrifices he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite David's counselor from his city Giloh. And the conspiracy was strong; the people with Absalom increased continually.
2 Samuel,15,13,And there came a messenger to David saying The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.
2 Samuel,15,14,David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem Arise and let us flee or else none of us will escape from Absalom. Make haste to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us and smite the city with the sword.
2 Samuel,15,15,And the king's servants said to the king Behold your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king says.
2 Samuel,15,16,So the king and all his household after him went forth. But he left ten women who were concubines to keep the house.
2 Samuel,15,17,The king went forth with all the people after him and halted at the last house.
2 Samuel,15,18,All David's servants passed on beside him along with [his bodyguards] all the Cherethites Pelethites; also all the Gittites 600 men who came after him from Gath passed on before the king.
2 Samuel,15,19,The king said to Ittai the Gittite Why do you go with us also? Return to your place and remain with the king [Absalom] for you are a foreigner and an exile.
2 Samuel,15,20,Since you came only yesterday should I make you go up and down with us? Since I must go where I may you return and take back your brethren with you. May loving-kindness and faithfulness be with you.
2 Samuel,15,21,But Ittai answered the king As the Lord lives and as my lord the king lives wherever my lord the king shall be whether for death or life even there also will your servant be.
2 Samuel,15,22,So David said to Ittai Go on and pass over [the Kidron]. And Ittai the Gittite passed over and all his men and all the little ones who were with him.
2 Samuel,15,23,All the country wept with a loud voice as all the people passed over. The king crossed the brook Kidron and all the people went on toward the wilderness.
2 Samuel,15,24,Abiathar [the priest] and behold Zadok came also and all the Levites with him bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God until all the people had gone from the city.
2 Samuel,15,25,Then the king told Zadok Take back the ark of God to the city. If I find favor in the Lord's eyes He will bring me back and let me see both it and His house.
2 Samuel,15,26,But if He says I have no delight in you then here I am; let Him do to me what seems good to Him.
2 Samuel,15,27,The king also said to Zadok the priest Are you not a seer? [You and Abiathar] return to the city in peace and your two sons with you Ahimaaz your son and Jonathan son of Abiathar.
2 Samuel,15,28,See I will wait at the fords [at the Jordan] of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.
2 Samuel,15,29,Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem and they stayed there.
2 Samuel,15,30,And David went up over the Mount of Olives and wept as he went barefoot and his head covered. And all the people who were with him covered their heads weeping as they went.
2 Samuel,15,31,David was told Ahithophel [your counselor] is among the conspirators with Absalom. David said O Lord I pray You turn Ahithophel's counsel into foolishness.
2 Samuel,15,32,When David came to the summit [of Olivet] where he worshiped God behold Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head.
2 Samuel,15,33,David said to him If you go with me you will be a burden to me.
2 Samuel,15,34,But if you return to the city and say to Absalom I will be your servant O king; as I have been your father's servant in the past so will I be your servant now then you may defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
2 Samuel,15,35,Will not Zadok and Abiathar the priests be with you? So whatever you hear from the king's house just tell it to [them].
2 Samuel,15,36,Behold their two sons are there with them Ahimaaz Zadok's son and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them send to me everything you hear.
2 Samuel,15,37,So Hushai David's friend returned and Absalom also came into Jerusalem.
2 Samuel,16,1,WHEN DAVID was a little past the top [of Olivet] behold Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of donkeys saddled and upon them 200 loaves of bread 100 bunches of raisins 100 summer fruits and a skin of wine.
2 Samuel,16,2,The king said to Ziba What do you mean by these? Ziba said The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine is for those to drink who become faint in the wilderness.
2 Samuel,16,3,The king said And where is your master's son [grandson Mephibosheth]? Ziba said to the king Behold he remains in Jerusalem for he said Today the house of Israel will give me back the kingdom of my father [grandfather Saul].
2 Samuel,16,4,Then the king said to Ziba Behold all that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours. Ziba said I do obeisance; let me ever find favor in your sight my lord O king.
2 Samuel,16,5,When King David came to Bahurim a man of the family of the house of Saul Shimei son of Gera came out and cursed continually as he came.
2 Samuel,16,6,And he cast stones at David and at all the servants of King David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
2 Samuel,16,7,Shimei said as he cursed Get out get out you man of blood you base fellow!
2 Samuel,16,8,The Lord has avenged upon you all the blood of the house of Saul in whose stead you have reigned; and the Lord has delivered the kingdom into the hands of Absalom your son. Behold the calamity is upon you because you are a bloody man!
2 Samuel,16,9,Then said [David's nephew] Abishai son of Zeruiah to the king Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head.
2 Samuel,16,10,The king said What have I to do with you you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the Lord said to him Curse David who then shall ask Why have you done so?
2 Samuel,16,11,And David said to Abishai and to all his servants Behold my son who was born to me seeks my life. With how much more reason now may this Benjamite do it? Let him alone; and let him curse for the Lord has bidden him to do it.
2 Samuel,16,12,It may be that the Lord will look on the iniquity done me and will recompense me with good for his cursing this day.
2 Samuel,16,13,So David and his men went by the road and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite David and cursed as he went and threw stones and dust at him.
2 Samuel,16,14,And the king and all the people who were with him came [to the Jordan] weary and he refreshed himself there.
2 Samuel,16,15,And Absalom and all the people the men of Israel came to Jerusalem and Ahithophel with him.
2 Samuel,16,16,And when Hushai the Archite David's friend came to Absalom Hushai said to [him] Long live the king! Long live the king!
2 Samuel,16,17,Absalom said to Hushai Is this your kindness and loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?
2 Samuel,16,18,Hushai said to Absalom No for whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel choose his will I be and with him I will remain.
2 Samuel,16,19,And again whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? As I have served your father so will I serve you.
2 Samuel,16,20,Then Absalom said to Ahithophel Give your counsel. What shall we do?
2 Samuel,16,21,And Ahithophel said to Absalom Go in to your father's concubines whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be made strong.
2 Samuel,16,22,So they spread for Absalom a tent on the top of the [king's] house and Absalom went in to his father's harem in the sight of all Israel.
2 Samuel,16,23,And the counsel of Ahithophel in those days was as if a man had consulted the word of God; so was all Ahithophel's counsel considered both by David and by Absalom.
2 Samuel,17,1,MOREOVER AHITHOPHEL said to Absalom Let me choose 12000 men and I will set out and pursue David this night.
2 Samuel,17,2,I will come upon him while he is exhausted and weak and cause him to panic; all the people with him will flee. Then I will strike down the king alone.
2 Samuel,17,3,I will bring back all the people to you. [The removal of] the man whom you seek is the assurance that all will return; and all the people will be at peace.
2 Samuel,17,4,And what he said pleased Absalom well and all the elders of Israel.
2 Samuel,17,5,Absalom said Now call Hushai the Archite also and let us hear what he says.
2 Samuel,17,6,When Hushai came Absalom said to him Ahithophel has counseled thus. Shall we do what he says? If not speak up.
2 Samuel,17,7,And Hushai said to Absalom The counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good at this time.
2 Samuel,17,8,For said Hushai you know your father and his men that they are mighty men and they are embittered and enraged like a bear robbed of her whelps in the field. And your father is a man of war and will not lodge with the people.
2 Samuel,17,9,Behold he is hidden even now in some pit or other place; and when some of them are overthrown at the first whoever hears it will say There is a slaughter among the followers of Absalom.
2 Samuel,17,10,And even he who is brave whose heart is as the heart of a lion will utterly melt for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and that those who are with him are brave men.
2 Samuel,17,11,Therefore I counsel that all [the men of] Israel be gathered to you from Dan even to Beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for multitude and that you go to battle in your own person.
2 Samuel,17,12,So shall we come upon [David] some place where he shall be found and we will light upon him as the dew settles [unseen and unheard] on the ground; and of him and of all the men with him there shall not be left so much as one.
2 Samuel,17,13,If he withdraws into a city then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city and we will drag it into the ravine until not one pebble is left there.
2 Samuel,17,14,Absalom and all the men of Israel said The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than that of Ahithophel. For the Lord had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel so that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom.
2 Samuel,17,15,Then said Hushai to Zadok and Abiathar the priests Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel and thus and thus have I counseled.
2 Samuel,17,16,Now send quickly and tell David Lodge not this night at the fords [at the Jordan] of the wilderness but by all means pass over lest the king be swallowed up and all the people with him.
2 Samuel,17,17,Now [the youths] Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed at En-rogel for they must not be seen coming into the city. But a maidservant went and told them and they went and told King David.
2 Samuel,17,18,But a lad saw them and told Absalom; but they left quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim who had a well in his court and they went down into it.
2 Samuel,17,19,And the woman spread a covering over the well's mouth and spread ground corn on it; and the thing was not discovered.
2 Samuel,17,20,For when Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house they said Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them They went over the brook of water. When they had sought and could not find them they returned to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel,17,21,After they had departed the boys came up out of the well and went and told King David and said Arise and pass quickly over the river Jordan; for thus and so has Ahithophel counseled against you.
2 Samuel,17,22,David arose and all the people with him and passed over the Jordan. By daybreak not one was left who had not crossed.
2 Samuel,17,23,But when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed he saddled his donkey went home to his city put his household in order and hanged himself and died and was buried in the tomb of his father.
2 Samuel,17,24,Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan he and all the men of Israel with him.
2 Samuel,17,25,Absalom made Amasa captain of the army instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of an [Ishmaelite] named Ithra who married Abigail daughter of Nahash [half sister of David and] sister of Zeruiah Joab's mother.
2 Samuel,17,26,So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
2 Samuel,17,27,When David came to Mahanaim Shobi son of Nahash of Rabbah of the Ammonites and Machir son of Ammiel of Lo-debar and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim
2 Samuel,17,28,Brought beds basins earthen vessels wheat barley meal parched grain beans lentils parched [pulse--seeds of peas and beans]
2 Samuel,17,29,Honey curds sheep and cheese of cows for David and the people with him to eat; for they said The people are hungry weary and thirsty in the wilderness.
2 Samuel,18,1,DAVID NUMBERED the men who were with him and set over them commanders of thousands and of hundreds.
2 Samuel,18,2,David sent forth the army a third under command of Joab a third under Abishai son of Zeruiah Joab's brother and a third under Ittai the Gittite. [He] told the men I myself will go out with you also.
2 Samuel,18,3,But the men said You shall not go out. For if we flee they will not care about us; if half of us die they will not care about us. But you are worth 10000 such as we are. So now it is better that you be able to help us from the city.
2 Samuel,18,4,The king said to them Whatever seems best to you I will do. So he stood beside the gate and all the army came out by hundreds and by thousands.
2 Samuel,18,5,The king commanded Joab Abishai and Ittai saying Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave orders to all the commanders about Absalom.
2 Samuel,18,6,So the army went out into the field against Israel and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim.
2 Samuel,18,7,[Absalom's] men of Israel were defeated by the servants of David and there was a great slaughter that day of 20000 men.
2 Samuel,18,8,For the battle spread over the face of all the country and the forest devoured more men that day than did the sword.
2 Samuel,18,9,Then Absalom [unavoidably] met the servants of David. Absalom rode on a mule and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak and Absalom's head caught fast [in a fork] of the oak; and the mule under him ran away leaving him hanging between the heavens and the earth.
2 Samuel,18,10,A certain man saw it and told Joab Behold I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.
2 Samuel,18,11,Joab said to the man You saw him! Why did you not strike him down to the ground? I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a girdle.
2 Samuel,18,12,The man told Joab Though I should receive 1000 pieces of silver yet I would not put forth my hand against the king's son. For in our hearing the king charged you Abishai and Ittai Have a care whoever you be for the young man Absalom.
2 Samuel,18,13,Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life--for nothing is hidden from the king--you yourself would have taken sides against me.
2 Samuel,18,14,Joab said I will not tarry thus with you. He took three darts in his hand and thrust them into the body of Absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
2 Samuel,18,15,And ten young men Joab's armor-bearers surrounded and struck Absalom and killed him.
2 Samuel,18,16,Then Joab blew the trumpet and the troops returned from pursuing Israel for Joab restrained and spared them.
2 Samuel,18,17,They took Absalom and cast him into a great pit in the forest and raised a very great heap of stones upon him. And all Israel fled everyone to his own home.
2 Samuel,18,18,Now Absalom in his lifetime had reared up for himself a pillar which is in the King's Valley for he said I have no son to keep my name in remembrance. He called the pillar after his own name and to this day it is called Absalom's Monument.
2 Samuel,18,19,Then said Ahimaaz son of Zadok Let me now run and bear the king tidings of how the Lord has avenged David of his enemies.
2 Samuel,18,20,Joab told him You shall not carry news today but another time. Today you shall bear no news for the king's son is dead.
2 Samuel,18,21,Then said Joab to the Cushite [an Ethiopian] Go tell the king what you have seen. And the Cushite bowed to Joab and ran.
2 Samuel,18,22,Then said Ahimaaz son of Zadok again to Joab But anyhow let me I pray you also run after the Cushite. Joab said Why should you run my son seeing you will have no reward for you have not sufficient tidings?
2 Samuel,18,23,But he said Let me run anyhow. So Joab said to him Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and outran the Cushite.
2 Samuel,18,24,Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate by the wall and when he looked he saw a man running alone.
2 Samuel,18,25,The watchman called out and told the king. The king said If he is alone he has news to tell. And he came on and drew near.
2 Samuel,18,26,Then the watchman saw another man running and the watchman called to the gatekeeper Behold another man running alone. The king said He also brings news.
2 Samuel,18,27,The watchman said I think the man in front runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok. The king said He is a good man and comes with good tidings.
2 Samuel,18,28,And Ahimaaz called and said to the king All is well! And he fell down to the ground on his face before the king and said Blessed be the Lord your God Who has shut up the men who lifted up their hands against my lord the king.
2 Samuel,18,29,The king said Is the young man Absalom safe? Ahimaaz answered When Joab sent the king's servant and me your servant I saw a great tumult but I do not know what it was.
2 Samuel,18,30,The king told him Turn aside; stand here. And he turned aside and stood still.
2 Samuel,18,31,And behold the Cushite (Ethiopian) came and he said News my lord the king! For the Lord has delivered you this day from all who rose up against you.
2 Samuel,18,32,The king said to the Cushite Is the young man Absalom safe? The Cushite replied May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise against you to do evil be like that young man is.
2 Samuel,18,33,And the king was deeply moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. And as he went he said O my son Absalom my son my son Absalom! Would to God I had died for you O Absalom my son my son!
2 Samuel,19,1,IT WAS told Joab Behold the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.
2 Samuel,19,2,So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the people for they heard it said The king grieves for his son.
2 Samuel,19,3,The people slipped into the city stealthily that day as humiliated people steal away when they flee in battle.
2 Samuel,19,4,But the king covered his face and cried with a loud voice O my son Absalom O Absalom my son my son!
2 Samuel,19,5,And Joab came into the house to the king and said You have today covered the faces of all your servants with shame who this day have saved your life and the lives of your sons and your daughters and the lives of your wives and concubines.
2 Samuel,19,6,For you love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have declared today that princes and servants are nothing to you; for today I see that if Absalom had lived and all the rest of us had died you would be well pleased.
2 Samuel,19,7,So now arise go out and speak kindly and encouragingly to your servants; for I swear by the Lord that if you do not go not a man will remain with you this night. And this will be worse for you than all the evil that has befallen you from your youth until now.
2 Samuel,19,8,Then the king arose and sat in the gate. And all [his followers] were told The king is sitting in the gate and they all came before the king. Now Israel [Absalom's troops] had fled every man to his home.
2 Samuel,19,9,And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel saying The king delivered us from the hands of our enemies and he saved us from the hands of the Philistines. And now he has fled out of the land from Absalom.
2 Samuel,19,10,And Absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle. So now why do you say nothing about bringing back the king?
2 Samuel,19,11,And King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests saying Say to the elders of Judah Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house when the word of all Israel has come to the king to bring him to his house?
2 Samuel,19,12,You are my kinsmen; you are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?
2 Samuel,19,13,And say to Amasa Are you not of my bone and of my flesh? May God do so to me and more also if you are not commander of my army hereafter in place of Joab.
2 Samuel,19,14,He inclined the hearts of all the men of Judah as one man so they sent word to [him] Return you and all your servants.
2 Samuel,19,15,So [David] returned and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king to conduct him over the Jordan.
2 Samuel,19,16,And Shimei son of Gera a Benjamite of Bahurim hastily came down with the men of Judah to meet King David
2 Samuel,19,17,And 1000 men of Benjamin with him. And Ziba the servant of the house of Saul and his fifteen sons and twenty servants with him rushed to the Jordan and pressed quickly into the king's presence.
2 Samuel,19,18,And there went over a ferryboat to bring over the king's household and to do what he thought good. And Shimei son of Gera fell down before the king as David came to the Jordan
2 Samuel,19,19,And said to the king Let not my lord impute iniquity to me and hold me guilty nor remember what your servant did the day my lord went out of Jerusalem [when Shimei grossly insulted David]; may the king not take it to heart.
2 Samuel,19,20,For your servant knows that I have sinned; therefore behold I am today the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.
2 Samuel,19,21,But Abishai son of Zeruiah said Shall not Shimei be put to death for this because he cursed the Lord's anointed?
2 Samuel,19,22,David said What have I to do with you you sons of Zeruiah that you should be an adversary to me today? Shall anyone be put to death today in Israel? For do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?
2 Samuel,19,23,Therefore the king said to Shimei You shall not die [at my hand]. And the king gave him his oath.
2 Samuel,19,24,Mephibosheth the son [grandson] of Saul came down to meet the king and had not dressed his feet trimmed his beard or washed his clothes from the day the king left until he returned in peace and safety.
2 Samuel,19,25,And when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king David said to him Why did you not go with me Mephibosheth?
2 Samuel,19,26,He said My lord O king my servant [Ziba] deceived me; for I said Saddle me the donkey that I may ride on it and go to the king for your servant is lame [but he took the donkey and left without me].
2 Samuel,19,27,He has slandered your servant to my lord the king. But the king is as an angel of God; so do what is good in your eyes.
2 Samuel,19,28,For all of my father's house were but doomed to death before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I to cry any more to the king?
2 Samuel,19,29,The king said to him Why speak any more of your affairs? I say You and Ziba divide the land.
2 Samuel,19,30,Mephibosheth said to the king Oh let him take it all since my lord the king has returned home in safety and peace.
2 Samuel,19,31,Now Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and went on to the Jordan with the king to conduct him over the Jordan.
2 Samuel,19,32,Now Barzillai was a very aged man even eighty years old; and he had provided the king with food while he remained at Mahanaim for he was a very great man.
2 Samuel,19,33,And the king said to Barzillai Come over with me and I will provide for you with me in Jerusalem.
2 Samuel,19,34,And Barzillai said to the king How much longer have I to live that it would be worthwhile for me to go up with the king to Jerusalem?
2 Samuel,19,35,I am this day eighty years old. Could I now [be useful as a counselor to] discern between good and evil? Can your servant appreciate what I eat or drink? Can I any longer enjoy the voices of singing men and women? Why then should your servant be still a burden to my lord the king?
2 Samuel,19,36,Your servant will only go over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward?
2 Samuel,19,37,Let your servant turn back again that I may die in my own city and be buried by the grave of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king. And do to him what shall seem good to you.
2 Samuel,19,38,The king answered Chimham shall go over with me and I will do to him what seems good to you; and whatever you ask of me I will do for you.
2 Samuel,19,39,So all the people went over the Jordan. When the king had crossed over he kissed Barzillai and blessed him and [the great man] returned to his own place.
2 Samuel,19,40,Then the king went on to Gilgal and Chimham went with him; and all the people of Judah and also half the people of Israel escorted the king.
2 Samuel,19,41,And all the men of Israel came to the king and said to him Why have our kinsmen the men of Judah stolen you away and have brought the king and his household over the Jordan and all David's men with him?
2 Samuel,19,42,But all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel Because the king is near of kin to us. Why then be angry about it? Have we eaten at all at the king's expense? Or has he given us any gift?
2 Samuel,19,43,Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah We have ten [tribes'] shares in the king; and we have more right to David than you have. Why then did you despise and ignore us? Were we not the first to speak of our bringing back our king? But the words of the men of Judah were more violent than the charges of the men of Israel.
2 Samuel,20,1,THERE HAPPENED to be there a base and contemptible fellow named Sheba son of Bichri a Benjamite. He blew a trumpet and said We have no portion in David and no inheritance in the son of Jesse! Every man to his tents O Israel!
2 Samuel,20,2,So all the men of Israel withdrew from David and followed Sheba son of Bichri; but the men of Judah stayed faithfully with their king from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel,20,3,So David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten women his concubines whom he had left to keep the house and put them away under guard and provided for them but did not go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death living in widowhood.
2 Samuel,20,4,Then said the king to Amasa Assemble the men of Judah to me within three days and you be present here.
2 Samuel,20,5,So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah but he tarried longer than the set time which had been appointed him.
2 Samuel,20,6,And David said to Abishai Now will Sheba son of Bichri do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your lord's servants and pursue him lest he get for himself fenced cities and snatch away our very eyes.
2 Samuel,20,7,And there went after him Joab's men and [David's bodyguards] the Cherethites and Pelethites and all the mighty men; they went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bichri.
2 Samuel,20,8,When they were at the great stone in Gibeon Amasa came to meet them. Joab was wearing a soldier's garment and over it was a sheathed sword fastened around his hips; and as he went forward it fell out.
2 Samuel,20,9,Joab said to Amasa Are you well my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand [as if] to kiss him.
2 Samuel,20,10,But Amasa did not notice the sword in Joab's hand. So [Joab] struck him [who was to have been his successor] with it in the body shedding his bowels to the ground without another blow; and [soon] he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba son of Bichri.
2 Samuel,20,11,And one of Joab's men stood by him and said Whoever favors Joab and is for David follow Joab!
2 Samuel,20,12,And Amasa wallowed in his blood in the highway. And when the man saw that all the people who came by stood still he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field and spread a cloth over him.
2 Samuel,20,13,When Amasa was removed from the highway all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bichri.
2 Samuel,20,14,Joab went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth-maacah and all the Berites assembled and also went after [Sheba] ardently.
2 Samuel,20,15,And they came and besieged Sheba in Abel of Beth-maacah and they cast up a siege mound against the city and it stood against the rampart; and all the men with Joab battered and undermined the wall to make it fall.
2 Samuel,20,16,Then a wise woman of the city cried Hear hear! Say to Joab Come here so I can speak to you.
2 Samuel,20,17,And when he came near her the woman said Are you Joab? He answered I am. Then she said to him Hear the words of your handmaid. He answered I am listening.
2 Samuel,20,18,Then she said People used to say Let them but ask counsel at Abel and so they settled the matter.
2 Samuel,20,19,I am one of the peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city which is a mother in Israel. Why will you swallow up the inheritance of the Lord?
2 Samuel,20,20,Joab answered Far be it far be it from me that I should swallow up or destroy!
2 Samuel,20,21,That is not true. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim Sheba son of Bichri has lifted up his hand against King David. Deliver him only and I will depart from the city. And the woman said Behold his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.
2 Samuel,20,22,Then the woman in her wisdom went to all the people. And they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bichri and cast it down to Joab. So he blew the trumpet and they retired from the city every man to his own home. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
2 Samuel,20,23,Joab was over the host of Israel; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over [the king's bodyguards] the Cherethites and Pelethites;
2 Samuel,20,24,Adoram was over the tribute; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder;
2 Samuel,20,25,Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests;
2 Samuel,20,26,Also Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David.
2 Samuel,21,1,THERE WAS a three-year famine in the days of David year after year; and David inquired of the Lord. The Lord replied It is on account of Saul and his bloody house for he put to death the Gibeonites.
2 Samuel,21,2,So the king called the Gibeonites--now the Gibeonites were not Israelites but of the remnant of the Amorites. The Israelites had sworn to spare them but Saul in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah had sought to slay the Gibeonites--
2 Samuel,21,3,So David said to the Gibeonites What shall I do for you? How can I make atonement that you may bless the Lord's inheritance?
2 Samuel,21,4,The Gibeonites said to him We will accept no silver or gold of Saul or of his house; neither for us shall you kill any man in Israel. David said I will do for you what you say.
2 Samuel,21,5,They said to the king The man who consumed us and planned to prevent us from remaining in any territory of Israel
2 Samuel,21,6,Let seven men of his sons be delivered to us and we will hang them up before the Lord at Gibeah of Saul [on the mountain] of the Lord. And the king said I will give them.
2 Samuel,21,7,But the king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan the son of Saul because of the Lord's oath that was between David and Jonathan son of Saul.
2 Samuel,21,8,But the king took the two sons of Rizpah daughter of Aiah whom she bore to Saul Armoni and Mephibosheth and the five sons of [Merab] daughter of Saul whom she bore to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
2 Samuel,21,9,He delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites and they hung them up on the hill before the Lord and all seven perished together. They were put to death in the first days of barley harvest.
2 Samuel,21,10,Rizpah daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock from the beginning of harvest until rain fell on them and she did not allow either the birds of the air to come upon them by day or the beasts of the field by night.
2 Samuel,21,11,It was told David what Rizpah daughter of Aiah the concubine of Saul had done.
2 Samuel,21,12,And David went and took the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead who had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan where the Philistines had hung them up when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa.
2 Samuel,21,13,He brought from there the bones of Saul and of Jonathan his son and they gathered the bones of those who were hung up.
2 Samuel,21,14,And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son they buried in the country of Benjamin in Zelah in the tomb of Kish [Saul's] father and they did all that the king commanded. And after that God heard and answered when His people prayed for the land.
2 Samuel,21,15,The Philistines had war again with Israel. And David went down and his servants with him and fought against the Philistines and David became faint.
2 Samuel,21,16,Ishbi-benob who was of the sons of the giants the weight of whose spear was 300 shekels of bronze was girded with a new sword and thought to kill David.
2 Samuel,21,17,But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David's aid and smote and killed the Philistine. Then David's men charged him You shall no more go out with us to battle lest you quench the lamp of Israel.
2 Samuel,21,18,After this there was again war with the Philistines at Gob (Gezer). Then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph (Sippai) who was a descendant of the giant.
2 Samuel,21,19,There was again war at Gob with the Philistines and Elhanan son of Jaare-oregim a Bethlehemite slew Goliath the Gittite whose spear shaft was like a weaver's beam.
2 Samuel,21,20,And there was again war at Gath where there was a man of great stature who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot twenty-four in number; he also was a descendant of the giants.
2 Samuel,21,21,And when he defied Israel Jonathan son of Shimei brother of David slew him.
2 Samuel,21,22,These four were descended from the giant in Gath and they fell by the hands of David and his servants.
2 Samuel,22,1,DAVID SPOKE to the Lord the words of this song on the day when the Lord delivered him from the hands of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.
2 Samuel,22,2,He said: The Lord is my Rock [of escape from Saul] and my Fortress [in the wilderness] and my Deliverer;
2 Samuel,22,3,My God my Rock in Him will I take refuge; my Shield and the Horn of my salvation; my Stronghold and my Refuge my Savior--You save me from violence.
2 Samuel,22,4,I call on the Lord Who is worthy to be praised and I am saved from my enemies.
2 Samuel,22,5,For the waves of death enveloped me; the torrents of destruction made me afraid.
2 Samuel,22,6,The cords of Sheol were entangling me; I encountered the snares of death.
2 Samuel,22,7,In my distress I called upon the Lord; I cried to my God and He heard my voice from His temple; my cry came into His ears.
2 Samuel,22,8,Then the earth reeled and quaked the foundations of the heavens trembled and shook because He was angry.
2 Samuel,22,9,Smoke went up from His nostrils and devouring fire from His mouth; coals were kindled by it.
2 Samuel,22,10,He bowed the heavens and came down; thick darkness was under His feet.
2 Samuel,22,11,He rode on a cherub and flew; He was seen upon the wings of the wind.
2 Samuel,22,12,He made darkness His canopy around Him gathering of waters thick clouds of the skies.
2 Samuel,22,13,Out of the brightness before Him coals of fire flamed forth.
2 Samuel,22,14,The Lord thundered from heaven and the Most High uttered His voice.
2 Samuel,22,15,He sent out arrows and scattered them; lightning confused and troubled them.
2 Samuel,22,16,The channels of the sea were visible the foundations of the world were uncovered at the rebuke of the Lord at the blast of the breath of His nostrils.
2 Samuel,22,17,He sent from above He took me; He drew me out of great waters.
2 Samuel,22,18,He delivered me from my strong enemy from those who hated me for they were too mighty for me.
2 Samuel,22,19,They came upon me in the day of my calamity but the Lord was my stay.
2 Samuel,22,20,He brought me forth into a large place; He delivered me because He delighted in me.
2 Samuel,22,21,The Lord rewarded me according to my uprightness with Him; He compensated and benefited me according to the cleanness of my hands.
2 Samuel,22,22,For I have kept the ways of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God.
2 Samuel,22,23,For all His ordinances were before me; and from His statutes I did not turn aside.
2 Samuel,22,24,I was also blameless before Him and kept myself from guilt and iniquity.
2 Samuel,22,25,Therefore the Lord has recompensed me according to my righteousness according to my cleanness in His [holy] sight.
2 Samuel,22,26,Toward the loving and loyal You will show Yourself loving and loyal and with the upright and blameless You will show Yourself upright and blameless.
2 Samuel,22,27,To the pure You will show Yourself pure and to the willful You will show Yourself willful.
2 Samuel,22,28,And the afflicted people You will deliver but Your eyes are upon the haughty whom You will bring down.
2 Samuel,22,29,For You O Lord are my Lamp; the Lord lightens my darkness.
2 Samuel,22,30,For by You I run through a troop; by my God I leap over a wall.
2 Samuel,22,31,As for God His way is perfect; the word of the Lord is tried. He is a Shield to all those who trust and take refuge in Him.
2 Samuel,22,32,For who is God but the Lord? And who is a Rock except our God?
2 Samuel,22,33,God is my strong Fortress; He guides the blameless in His way and sets him free.
2 Samuel,22,34,He makes my feet like the hinds' [firm and able]; He sets me secure and confident upon the heights.
2 Samuel,22,35,He trains my hands for war so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
2 Samuel,22,36,You have also given me the shield of Your salvation; and Your condescension and gentleness have made me great.
2 Samuel,22,37,You have enlarged my steps under me so that my feet have not slipped.
2 Samuel,22,38,I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them; and I did not turn back until they were consumed.
2 Samuel,22,39,I consumed them and thrust them through so that they did not arise; they fell at my feet.
2 Samuel,22,40,For You girded me with strength for the battle; those who rose up against me You subdued under me.
2 Samuel,22,41,You have made my enemies turn their backs to me that I might cut off those who hate me.
2 Samuel,22,42,They looked but there was none to save--even to the Lord but He did not answer them.
2 Samuel,22,43,Then I beat them small as the dust of the earth; I crushed them as the mire of the street and scattered them abroad.
2 Samuel,22,44,You also have delivered me from strife with my people; You kept me as the head of the nations. People whom I had not known served me.
2 Samuel,22,45,Foreigners yielded feigned obedience to me; as soon as they heard of me they became obedient to me.
2 Samuel,22,46,Foreigners faded away; they came limping and trembling from their strongholds.
2 Samuel,22,47,The Lord lives; blessed be my Rock and exalted be God the Rock of my salvation.
2 Samuel,22,48,It is God Who executes vengeance for me and Who brought down [and disciplined] the peoples under me
2 Samuel,22,49,Who brought me out from my enemies. You also lifted me up above those who rose up against me; You delivered me from the violent man.
2 Samuel,22,50,For this I will give thanks and extol You O Lord among the nations; I will sing praises to Your name.
2 Samuel,22,51,He is a Tower of salvation and great deliverance to His king and shows loving-kindness to His anointed to David and his offspring forever.
2 Samuel,23,1,NOW THESE are the last words of David: David son of Jesse says and the man who was raised on high the anointed of the God of Jacob and the sweet psalmist of Israel says
2 Samuel,23,2,The Spirit of the Lord spoke in and by me and His word was upon my tongue.
2 Samuel,23,3,The God of Israel spoke the Rock of Israel said to me When one rules over men righteously ruling in the fear of God
2 Samuel,23,4,He dawns on them like the morning light when the sun rises on a cloudless morning when the tender grass springs out of the earth through clear shining after rain.
2 Samuel,23,5,Truly does not my house stand so with God? For He has made with me an everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure. For will He not cause to prosper all my help and my desire?
2 Samuel,23,6,But wicked godless and worthless lives are all like thorns to be thrust away because they cannot be taken with the hand.
2 Samuel,23,7,But the man who touches them arms himself with iron and the shaft of a spear and they are utterly consumed with fire on the spot.
2 Samuel,23,8,These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite chief of the Three [heroes] known also as Adino the Eznite; he wielded his spear and went against 800 men who were slain at one time.
2 Samuel,23,9,Next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar son of Dodo son of Ahohi. He was with David when they defied the Philistines assembled there for battle and the men of Israel had departed.
2 Samuel,23,10,[Eleazar] arose and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary and clung to the sword. The Lord wrought a great deliverance and victory that day; the men returned after him only to take the spoil.
2 Samuel,23,11,Next to [Eleazar] was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines were gathered at Lehi on a piece of ground full of lentils; and the [Israelites] fled from the Philistines.
2 Samuel,23,12,But he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the Philistines; and the Lord wrought a great victory.
2 Samuel,23,13,And three of the thirty chief men went down at harvest time to David in the cave of Adullam and a troop of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel,23,14,And David was then in the stronghold and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
2 Samuel,23,15,And David said longingly Oh that someone would give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem by the gate!
2 Samuel,23,16,And the three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem by the gate and brought it to David. But he would not drink it but poured it out to the Lord.
2 Samuel,23,17,And he said Be it far from me O Lord to drink this. Is it not [the same as] the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives? So he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
2 Samuel,23,18,Now Abishai the brother of Joab son of Zeruiah was chief of the Three. He wielded his spear against 300 men and slew them and won a name beside the Three.
2 Samuel,23,19,Was he not most renowned of the Three? So he was their captain; however he did not attain to the Three.
2 Samuel,23,20,And Benaiah son of Jehoiada a valiant man of Kabzeel who had done many notable acts slew two lionlike men of Moab. He went down also and slew a lion in a pit on a snowy day.
2 Samuel,23,21,And he slew an Egyptian a handsome man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand but Benaiah went down to him with a staff snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and slew the man with his own spear.
2 Samuel,23,22,These things Benaiah son of Jehoiada did and won a name beside the three mighty men.
2 Samuel,23,23,He was more renowned than the Thirty but he attained not to the [first] Three. David set him over his guard or council.
2 Samuel,23,24,Asahel brother of Joab was one of the Thirty; then Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem
2 Samuel,23,25,Shammah of Harod Elika of Harod

2 Samuel,23,38,Ira the Ithrite Gareb the Ithrite
2 Samuel,23,39,Uriah the Hittite--thirty-seven in all.
2 Samuel,24,1,AGAIN THE anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and He moved David against them saying Go number Israel and Judah.
2 Samuel,24,2,For the king said to Joab the captain of the host who was with him Go now through all the tribes of Israel from Dan even to Beersheba and count the people that I may know their number.
2 Samuel,24,3,And Joab said to the king May the Lord your God add a hundred times as many people as there are and let the eyes of my lord the king see it; but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?
2 Samuel,24,4,But the king's word prevailed against Joab and the commanders of the army. So they went from the king's presence to number the Israelites.
2 Samuel,24,5,They passed over the Jordan and encamped in Aroer on the south side of the city lying in the midst of the ravine [of the Arnon] toward Gad and on to Jazer.
2 Samuel,24,6,Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi and they came to Dan-jaan [Dan in the forest] and around to Sidon
2 Samuel,24,7,And came to the stronghold of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites; and they went out to the South (the Negeb) of Judah at Beersheba.
2 Samuel,24,8,So when they had gone through all the land [taking the census] they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
2 Samuel,24,9,And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to the king. There were in Israel 800000 valiant men who drew the sword and the men of Judah were 500000.
2 Samuel,24,10,But David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people. David said to the Lord I have sinned greatly in what I have done. I beseech You O Lord take away the iniquity of Your servant for I have done very foolishly.
2 Samuel,24,11,When David arose in the morning the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad David's seer saying
2 Samuel,24,12,Go and say to David Thus says the Lord I hold over you three choices; select one of them so I may bring it upon you.
2 Samuel,24,13,So Gad came to David and told him and said Shall seven years of famine come to your land? Or will you flee three months before your pursuing enemies? Or do you prefer three days of pestilence in your land? Consider and see what answer I shall return to Him Who sent me.
2 Samuel,24,14,And David said to Gad I am in great distress. Let us fall into the hands of the Lord for His mercies are many and great; but let me not fall into the hands of man.
2 Samuel,24,15,So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba 70000 men.
2 Samuel,24,16,And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it the Lord relented of the evil and reversed His judgment and said to the destroying angel It is enough; now stay your hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
2 Samuel,24,17,When David saw the angel who was smiting the people he spoke to the Lord and said Behold I have sinned and I have done wickedly; but these sheep what have they done? Let Your hand I pray You be [only] against me and against my father's house.
2 Samuel,24,18,Then Gad came to David and said Go up rear an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
2 Samuel,24,19,So David went up according to Gad's word as the Lord commanded.
2 Samuel,24,20,Araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming toward him; and [he] went out and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
2 Samuel,24,21,Araunah said Why has my lord the king come to his servant? And David said To buy the threshing floor from you to build there an altar to the Lord that the plague may be stayed from the people.
2 Samuel,24,22,And Araunah said to David Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Behold here are oxen for burnt sacrifice and threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for wood.
2 Samuel,24,23,All this O king Araunah gives to the king. And Araunah said to the king The Lord your God accept you.
2 Samuel,24,24,But King David said to Araunah No but I will buy it of you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God of that which costs me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
2 Samuel,24,25,David built there an altar to the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the Lord heeded the prayers for the land and Israel's plague was stayed.
1 Kings,1,1,AND KING David was old and advanced in years; they covered him with [bed]clothes but he could not get warm.
1 Kings,1,2,So his servants [the physicians] said to him Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin and let her wait on and be useful to the king; let her lie in your bosom that my lord the king may get warm.
1 Kings,1,3,So they sought a fair maiden through all the territory of Israel and found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her to the king.
1 Kings,1,4,The maiden was beautiful; and she waited on and nursed him. But the king had no intercourse with her.
1 Kings,1,5,Then Adonijah son of [David's wife] Haggith exalted himself saying I [the eldest living son] will be king. And he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen with fifty men to run before him.
1 Kings,1,6,David his father had never in his life displeased him by asking Why have you done so? He was also a very attractive man and was born after Absalom.
1 Kings,1,7,He conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah [David's half sister] and with Abiathar the priest and they followed Adonijah and helped him.
1 Kings,1,8,But Zadok the priest Benaiah son of Jehoiada Nathan the prophet Shimei Rei and David's mighty men did not side with Adonijah.
1 Kings,1,9,Adonijah sacrificed sheep oxen and fatlings by the Stone of Zoheleth which is beside [the well] En-rogel; and he invited all his brothers the king's sons and all the royal officials of Judah.
1 Kings,1,10,But Nathan the prophet Benaiah the mighty men and Solomon his brother he did not invite.
1 Kings,1,11,Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns and David our lord does not know it?
1 Kings,1,12,Come now let me advise you how to save your own life and your son Solomon's.
1 Kings,1,13,Go to King David and say Did you not my lord O king swear to your handmaid saying Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?
1 Kings,1,14,Behold while you are still talking there with the king I also will come in after you and confirm your words.
1 Kings,1,15,So Bathsheba went in to the king in his chamber. Now the king was very old and feeble and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to [him].
1 Kings,1,16,Bathsheba bowed and did obeisance to the king. The king said What do you wish?
1 Kings,1,17,And she said to him My lord you swore by the Lord your God to your handmaid saying Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me and sit upon my throne.
1 Kings,1,18,And now behold Adonijah is reigning and my lord the king you do not know it.
1 Kings,1,19,He has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance and has invited all the king's sons and Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army. But he did not invite Solomon your servant.
1 Kings,1,20,Now my lord O king the eyes of all Israel are on you to tell who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after you.
1 Kings,1,21,Otherwise when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers I and my son Solomon shall be counted as offenders.
1 Kings,1,22,While she was still talking with the king Nathan the prophet also came in.
1 Kings,1,23,The king was told Here is Nathan the prophet. And when he came before the king he bowed himself before him with his face to the ground.
1 Kings,1,24,And Nathan said My lord the king have you said Adonijah shall reign after me and he shall sit on my throne?
1 Kings,1,25,He has gone this day and sacrificed oxen fatlings and sheep in abundance and has invited all the king's sons the captains of the host and Abiathar the priest; and they eat and drink before him and say Long live King Adonijah!
1 Kings,1,26,But me your servant and Zadok the priest and Benaiah son of Jehoiada and your servant Solomon he has not invited.
1 Kings,1,27,Is this done by my lord the king and you have not shown your servants who shall succeed my lord the king?
1 Kings,1,28,Then King David answered Call Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence and stood before him.
1 Kings,1,29,And the king took an oath and said As the Lord lives Who has redeemed my soul out of all distress
1 Kings,1,30,Even as I swore to you by the Lord the God of Israel saying Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead--even so will I certainly do this day.
1 Kings,1,31,Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground and did obeisance to the king and said Let my lord King David live forever!
1 Kings,1,32,King David said Call Zadok the priest Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
1 Kings,1,33,The king told them Take the servants of your lord and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule and bring him down to Gihon [in the Kidron Valley].
1 Kings,1,34,And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel. Then blow the trumpet and say Long live King Solomon!
1 Kings,1,35,Then you shall come up after him and he shall come and sit on my throne for he shall be king in my stead; I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah.
1 Kings,1,36,And Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king and said Amen! May the Lord the God of my lord the king say so too.
1 Kings,1,37,As the Lord has been with my lord the king even so may He be with Solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.
1 Kings,1,38,So Zadok the priest Nathan the prophet Benaiah son of Jehoiada the Cherethites and the Pelethites [the king's bodyguards] went down and caused Solomon to ride upon King David's mule and brought him to Gihon.
1 Kings,1,39,Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the tent and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet and all the people said Long live King Solomon!
1 Kings,1,40,All the people followed him; they played on pipes and rejoiced greatly so that the earth [resounded] with the joyful sound.
1 Kings,1,41,And Adonijah and all the guests with him heard it as they finished feasting. When Joab heard the trumpet sound he said What does this uproar in the city mean?
1 Kings,1,42,While he was still speaking behold Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest came. And Adonijah said Come in for you are a trustworthy man and bring good news.
1 Kings,1,43,Jonathan replied Adonijah truly our lord King David has made Solomon king!
1 Kings,1,44,The king has sent him with Zadok the priest Nathan the prophet Benaiah son of Jehoiada the Cherethites and the Pelethites and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule.
1 Kings,1,45,Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; they have come up from there rejoicing so the city resounds. This is the noise you heard.
1 Kings,1,46,Solomon sits on the royal throne.
1 Kings,1,47,Moreover the king's servants came to congratulate our lord King David saying May God make the name of Solomon better than your name and make his throne greater than your throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed
1 Kings,1,48,And said Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel Who has granted me to see one of my offspring sitting on my throne this day.
1 Kings,1,49,And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid and rose up and went every man his way.
1 Kings,1,50,And Adonijah feared because of Solomon and arose and went [to the tabernacle tent on Mt. Zion] and caught hold of the horns of the altar [as a fugitive's refuge].
1 Kings,1,51,And it was told Solomon Behold Adonijah fears King Solomon for behold he has caught hold of the horns of the altar saying Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
1 Kings,1,52,Solomon said If he will show himself to be a worthy man not a hair of him shall fall to the ground; but if wickedness is found in him he shall die.
1 Kings,1,53,So King Solomon sent and they brought Adonijah down from the altar [in front of the tabernacle]. He came and bowed himself to King Solomon and Solomon said to him Go to your house.
1 Kings,2,1,WHEN DAVID'S time to die was near he charged Solomon his son saying
1 Kings,2,2,I go the way of all the earth. Be strong and show yourself a man;
1 Kings,2,3,Keep the charge of the Lord your God walk in His ways keep His statutes His commandments His precepts and His testimonies as it is written in the Law of Moses that you may do wisely and prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn
1 Kings,2,4,That the Lord may fulfill His promise to me saying If your sons take heed to their way to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and mind and with all their soul there shall not fail you [to have] a man on the throne of Israel.
1 Kings,2,5,You know also what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether whom he murdered avenging in time of peace blood shed in war and putting innocent blood of war on the girdle on his loins and on the sandals of his feet.
1 Kings,2,6,Do therefore according to your wisdom but let not his hoary head go down to Sheol (the place of the dead) in peace.
1 Kings,2,7,But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite and let them be among those who eat at your table; for with such kindness they met me when I fled because of Absalom your brother.
1 Kings,2,8,And you have with you Shimei son of Gera the Benjamite of Bahurim who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at the Jordan [on my return] and I swore to him by the Lord saying I will not put you to death with the sword.
1 Kings,2,9,So do not hold him guiltless; for you are a wise man and know what you should do to him. His hoary head bring down to the grave with blood.
1 Kings,2,10,So David slept with his fathers and was buried in the City of David.
1 Kings,2,11,David reigned over Israel forty years--seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
1 Kings,2,12,Then Solomon sat on the throne of David his father and his kingdom was firmly established.
1 Kings,2,13,Adonijah the son of [David and] Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. She said Do you come peaceably? And he said Peaceably.
1 Kings,2,14,He said I have something to say to you. And she said Say on.
1 Kings,2,15,He said You know that the kingdom belonged to me [as the eldest living son] and all Israel looked to me to reign. However the kingdom has passed from me to my brother; for it was his from the Lord.
1 Kings,2,16,Now I make one request of you; do not deny me. And she said Say on.
1 Kings,2,17,He said I pray you ask King Solomon for he will not refuse you to give me Abishag the Shunammite to be my wife.
1 Kings,2,18,And Bathsheba said Very well; I will speak for you to the king.
1 Kings,2,19,So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. The king rose to meet her bowed to her sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set at his right hand for her the king's mother.
1 Kings,2,20,Then she said I have one small request to make of you; do not refuse me. The king said to her Ask on my mother for I will not refuse you.
1 Kings,2,21,She said Give Abishag the Shunammite to Adonijah your brother to be his wife.
1 Kings,2,22,King Solomon answered his mother And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also--for he is my elder brother--[ask it] even for him and for [his supporters] Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah.
1 Kings,2,23,Then King Solomon swore by the Lord saying May God do so to me and more also if Adonijah has not requested this against his own life.
1 Kings,2,24,Therefore as the Lord lives Who has established me and set me on the throne of David my father and Who has made me a house as He promised Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
1 Kings,2,25,So King Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada who attacked [Adonijah] and he died.
1 Kings,2,26,And to Abiathar the priest the king said Get to Anathoth to your own estate; for you deserve death but I will not put you to death now because you bore the ark of the Lord God before my father David and were afflicted in all my father endured.
1 Kings,2,27,So Solomon expelled Abiathar [descendant of Eli] from being priest to the Lord fulfilling the word of the Lord which He spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
1 Kings,2,28,When the news came to Joab for Joab had followed Adonijah though he had not followed Absalom [he] fled to the tent (tabernacle) of the Lord and caught hold of the horns of the altar [before it].
1 Kings,2,29,King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the Lord and was at the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada saying Go strike him down.
1 Kings,2,30,So Benaiah came to the tent of the Lord and told Joab The king commands Come forth. But Joab said No I will die here. Then Benaiah brought the king word again Thus said Joab and thus he answered me.
1 Kings,2,31,The king said to him Do as he has said. Strike him down and bury him that you may take away from [me and from] my father's house the innocent blood which Joab shed.
1 Kings,2,32,The Lord shall return his bloody deeds upon his own head for he fell upon two men more [uncompromisingly] righteous and honorable than he and slew them with the sword without my father knowing of it: Abner son of Ner captain of the host of Israel and Amasa son of Jether captain of the host of Judah.
1 Kings,2,33,So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab and of his descendants forever. But upon David his descendants his house and his throne there shall be peace from the Lord forever.
1 Kings,2,34,So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck and killed Joab and he was buried at his own house in the wilderness.
1 Kings,2,35,The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada in Joab's place over the army and put Zadok the priest in place of Abiathar.
1 Kings,2,36,The king sent for Shimei and said to him Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there and do not leave there.
1 Kings,2,37,For on the day you go out and pass over the brook Kidron know with certainty that you shall die; your blood shall be upon your own head.
1 Kings,2,38,And Shimei said to the king The saying is good. As my lord the king has said so your servant will do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
1 Kings,2,39,But after three years two of Shimei's servants ran away to Achish son of Maacah king of Gath. And Shimei was told Behold your [runaway] servants are in Gath.
1 Kings,2,40,So Shimei arose saddled his donkey and went to Gath to King Achish to seek his servants and brought them from Gath.
1 Kings,2,41,It was told Solomon that Shimei went from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned.
1 Kings,2,42,And the king sent for Shimei and said to him Did I not make you swear by the Lord and warn you saying Know with certainty on the day you go out and walk abroad anywhere you shall surely die? And you said to me I have heard your word. It is accepted.
1 Kings,2,43,Why then have you not kept the oath of the Lord and the command with which I have charged you?
1 Kings,2,44,The king also said to Shimei You are aware in your own heart of all the evil you did to my father David; so the Lord will return your evil upon your own head.
1 Kings,2,45,But King Solomon shall be blessed and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord forever.
1 Kings,2,46,So the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada who went out and struck down Shimei and he died. And the kingdom was established in the hands of Solomon.
1 Kings,3,1,AND SOLOMON made an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt and took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the City of David until he had finished building his own house and the house of the Lord and the wall around Jerusalem.
1 Kings,3,2,But the people sacrificed [to God] in the high places [as the heathen did to their idols] for there was no house yet built to the Name of the Lord.
1 Kings,3,3,Solomon loved the Lord walking [at first] in the statutes and practices of David his father only he sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.
1 Kings,3,4,The king went to Gibeon [near Jerusalem where stood the tabernacle and the bronze altar] to sacrifice there for that was the great high place. One thousand burnt offerings Solomon offered on that altar.
1 Kings,3,5,In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night. And God said Ask what I shall give you.
1 Kings,3,6,Solomon said You have shown to Your servant David my father great mercy and loving-kindness according as he walked before You in faithfulness righteousness and uprightness of heart with You; and You have kept for him this great kindness and steadfast love that You have given him a son to sit on his throne this day.
1 Kings,3,7,Now O Lord my God You have made Your servant king instead of David my father and I am but a lad [in wisdom and experience]; I know not how to go out (begin) or come in (finish).
1 Kings,3,8,Your servant is in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen a great people who cannot be counted for multitude.
1 Kings,3,9,So give Your servant an understanding mind and a hearing heart to judge Your people that I may discern between good and bad. For who is able to judge and rule this Your great people?
1 Kings,3,10,It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this.
1 Kings,3,11,God said to him Because you have asked this and have not asked for long life or for riches nor for the lives of your enemies but have asked for yourself understanding to recognize what is just and right
1 Kings,3,12,Behold I have done as you asked. I have given you a wise discerning mind so that no one before you was your equal nor shall any arise after you equal to you.
1 Kings,3,13,I have also given you what you have not asked both riches and honor so that there shall not be any among the kings equal to you all your days.
1 Kings,3,14,And if you will go My way keep My statutes and My commandments as your father David did then I will lengthen your days.
1 Kings,3,15,Solomon awoke and behold it was a dream. He came to Jerusalem stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and made a feast for all his servants.
1 Kings,3,16,Then two women who had become mothers out of wedlock came and stood before the king.
1 Kings,3,17,And one woman said O my lord I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
1 Kings,3,18,And the third day after I was delivered this woman also was delivered. And we were together; no stranger was with us just we two in the house.
1 Kings,3,19,And this woman's child died in the night because she lay on him.
1 Kings,3,20,And she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while your handmaid slept and laid him in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom.
1 Kings,3,21,And when I rose to nurse my child behold he was dead. But when I had considered him in the morning behold it was not the son I had borne.
1 Kings,3,22,But the other woman said No! But the living one is my son and the dead one is your son! And this one said No! But the dead son is your son and the living is my son. Thus they spoke before the king.
1 Kings,3,23,The king said One says This is my son that is alive and yours is the dead one. The other woman says No! But your son is the dead one and mine is the living one.
1 Kings,3,24,And the king said Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword to the king.
1 Kings,3,25,And the king said Divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the other.
1 Kings,3,26,Then the mother of the living child said to the king for she yearned over her son O my lord give her the living baby and by no means slay him. But the other said Let him not be mine or yours but divide him.
1 Kings,3,27,Then the king said Give her [who pleads for his life] the living baby and by no means slay him. She is the child's mother.
1 Kings,3,28,And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had made and they stood in awe of him for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do justice.

1 Kings,5,4,But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side so that there is neither adversary nor evil confronting me.
1 Kings,5,5,And I purpose to build a house to the Name of the Lord my God as the Lord said to David my father Your son whom I will set on your throne in your place shall build the house to My Name and Presence.
1 Kings,5,6,So Hiram command them to hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; my servants shall join yours and I will give you whatever wages you set for your servants. For you know that no one among us can equal the skill of the Sidon men in cutting timber.
1 Kings,5,7,When Hiram heard the words of Solomon he rejoiced greatly and said Blessed be the Lord this day Who has given David a wise son to be over this great people.
1 Kings,5,8,And Hiram sent to Solomon saying I have considered the things for which you sent to me; I will do all you wish concerning the cedar and cypress timber.
1 Kings,5,9,My servants shall bring the logs down from Lebanon to the sea make them into rafts and float them by sea to the place that you direct. I will have them released there and you shall take them away. And you shall fulfill my desire by providing food for my household.
1 Kings,5,10,So Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar and cypress trees he desired
1 Kings,5,11,And Solomon gave Hiram 20000 measures of wheat for food for his household and 20 measures of pure beaten oil. He gave these to Hiram yearly.
1 Kings,5,12,The Lord gave Solomon wisdom as He promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon and they made a treaty.
1 Kings,5,13,King Solomon raised a levy [of forced labor] out of all Israel; and the levy was 30000 men.
1 Kings,5,14,He sent them to Lebanon 10000 a month by divisions; one month they were in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was over the levy.
1 Kings,5,15,And Solomon had 70000 burden bearers and 80000 hewers [of stone] in the hill country of Judah
1 Kings,5,16,Besides Solomon's 3300 overseers in charge of the people doing the work.
1 Kings,5,17,The king commanded and they hewed and brought out great costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stone.
1 Kings,5,18,Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the men of Gebal did the hewing and prepared the timber and stones to build the house.
1 Kings,6,1,AND 480 years after the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel in the second month Ziv he began to build the Lord's house.
1 Kings,6,2,The length of the house Solomon built for the Lord was sixty cubits its breadth twenty and its height thirty cubits.
1 Kings,6,3,The length of the vestibule in front of the temple was twenty cubits equal to the width of the house and its depth in front of the house was ten cubits.
1 Kings,6,4,For the house he made narrow [latticed] windows.
1 Kings,6,5,Against the wall of the house he built chambers running round the walls of the house both of the Holy Place and of the Holy of Holies; and he made side chambers all around.
1 Kings,6,6,The first story's side chambers were five cubits wide those of the middle story six cubits wide and of the third story seven cubits wide; for around the outside of the wall of the house he made offsets in order that the supporting beams should not be thrust into the walls of the house.
1 Kings,6,7,When the house was being built its stone was made ready at the quarry and no hammer ax or tool of iron was heard in the house while it was in building.
1 Kings,6,8,The entrance to the lowest side chamber was on the right [or south] side of the house; and one went up winding stairs into the middle chamber and from the middle into the third.
1 Kings,6,9,So Solomon built the temple building and finished it and roofed the house with beams and boards of cedar.
1 Kings,6,10,Then he built the stories of chambers [the lean-to] against all the house each [story] five cubits high; and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar.
1 Kings,6,11,Now the word of the Lord came to Solomon saying
1 Kings,6,12,Concerning this house which you are building if you will walk in My statutes execute My precepts and keep all My commandments to walk in them then I will fulfill to you My promises which I made to David your father.
1 Kings,6,13,And I will dwell among the Israelites and will not forsake My people Israel.
1 Kings,6,14,So Solomon built the house and finished it.
1 Kings,6,15,He built the walls of the house (the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies) within with boards of cedar from the floor of the house to the rafters of the ceiling. He covered the inside with wood and the floor of the house with boards of cypress.
1 Kings,6,16,He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the rafters; he built it within for the sanctuary the Holy of Holies.
1 Kings,6,17,The [rest of the] house that is the temple in front of the Holy of Holies was forty cubits long.
1 Kings,6,18,The cedar on the house within was carved with gourds and open flowers. All was cedar; no stone was visible.
1 Kings,6,19,And he prepared the Holy of Holies in the inner room in which to set the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
1 Kings,6,20,The Holy of Holies was twenty cubits in length in breadth and in height. He overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid the cedar altar.
1 Kings,6,21,Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold and he drew chains of gold across in front of the Holy of Holies and overlaid it with gold.
1 Kings,6,22,And the whole house he overlaid with gold until all the house was finished. Also the whole [incense] altar that [stood outside the door but] belonged to the Holy of Holies he overlaid with gold.
1 Kings,6,23,Within the Holy of Holies he made two cherubim of olive wood each ten cubits high.
1 Kings,6,24,Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub and five cubits its other wing; from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other was ten cubits.
1 Kings,6,25,The wings of the other cherub were also ten cubits. Both cherubim were the same
1 Kings,6,26,The height of one cherub ten cubits as was the other.
1 Kings,6,27,He put the cherubim within the inner sanctuary. Their wings were stretched out so that the wing of one touched one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall and their inner wings touched in the midst of the room.
1 Kings,6,28,Solomon overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1 Kings,6,29,He carved all the walls of the house (these two holy rooms) round about with figures of cherubim palm trees and open flowers within and without.
1 Kings,6,30,The floor of the house he overlaid with gold inside and out.
1 Kings,6,31,For the Holy of Holies he made [folding] doors of olive wood; their entire width was one-fifth that of the wall.
1 Kings,6,32,On the two doors of olive wood he carved cherubim palm trees and open flowers; he overlaid them with gold and spread gold on the cherubim and palm trees.
1 Kings,6,33,Also he made for the door of the Holy Place four-sided posts of olive wood.
1 Kings,6,34,The two doors were of cypress wood; the two leaves of each door were folding.
1 Kings,6,35,He carved on them cherubim palm trees and open flowers covered with gold evenly applied on the carved work.
1 Kings,6,36,He built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams.
1 Kings,6,37,In the fourth year the foundation of the Lord's house was laid in the [second] month Ziv.
1 Kings,6,38,In the eleventh year in Bul the eighth month the house was finished throughout according to all its specifications. So he was seven years in building it.
1 Kings,7,1,SOLOMON WAS building his own house thirteen years and he finished all of it.
1 Kings,7,2,He built also the Forest of Lebanon House; its length was a hundred cubits its breadth fifty and its height thirty cubits upon four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams upon the pillars.
1 Kings,7,3,And it was covered with cedar above the side chambers that were upon the forty-five pillars fifteen in a row.
1 Kings,7,4,There were window frames in three rows and window opposite window in three tiers.
1 Kings,7,5,All the doorways and windows were square cut and window was opposite window in three tiers.
1 Kings,7,6,He also made the Hall of Pillars; its length was fifty cubits and its breadth thirty cubits. There was a porch in front and pillars and a cornice before them.
1 Kings,7,7,He made the porch for the throne where he was to judge the Porch of Judgment; it was covered with cedar from floor to ceiling.
1 Kings,7,8,His house where he was to dwell had another court behind the Porch of Judgment of similar work. Solomon also made a house like this porch for Pharaoh's daughter whom he had married.
1 Kings,7,9,All were of costly stones hewn according to measure sawed with saws back and front even from foundation to coping and from the outside to the great court.
1 Kings,7,10,The foundation was of costly stones even great stones of eight and ten cubits.
1 Kings,7,11,And above were costly stones hewn according to measure and cedar timbers.
1 Kings,7,12,Also the great encircling court had three courses of hewn stone and a course of cedar beams like was around the inner court of the house of the Lord and the porch of the house.
1 Kings,7,13,King Solomon brought Hiram from Tyre.
1 Kings,7,14,He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali and his father was a man of Tyre a worker in bronze. He was full of wisdom understanding and skill to do any kind of work in bronze. So he came to King Solomon and did all his [bronze] work.
1 Kings,7,15,He fashioned the two pillars of bronze each eighteen cubits high and a line of twelve cubits measured its circumference.
1 Kings,7,16,He made two capitals of molten bronze to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of each capital was five cubits.
1 Kings,7,17,Nets of checkerwork and wreaths of chainwork for the capitals were on the tops of the pillars seven for each capital.
1 Kings,7,18,So Hiram made the pillars. There were two rows of pomegranates encircling each network to cover the capitals that were upon the top.
1 Kings,7,19,The capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work [design] four cubits.
1 Kings,7,20,The capitals were upon the two pillars and also above the rounded projection beside the network. There were 200 pomegranates in two rows round about and so with the other capital.
1 Kings,7,21,Hiram set up the pillars of the porch of the temple; he set up the right pillar and called its name Jachin [he will establish] and he set up the left pillar and called its name Boaz [in strength].
1 Kings,7,22,On the tops of the pillars was lily work [design]. So the work of the pillars was finished.
1 Kings,7,23,He made a round molten Sea ten cubits from brim to brim five cubits high and thirty cubits in circumference.
1 Kings,7,24,Under its brim were gourds encircling the Sea ten to a cubit; the gourds were in two rows cast in one piece with it.
1 Kings,7,25,It stood upon twelve oxen three facing north three west three south and three east; the Sea was set upon them and all their rears pointed inward.
1 Kings,7,26,It was a handbreadth thick and its brim was made like the brim of a cup like a lily blossom. It held 2000 baths [Hebrew liquid measurement].
1 Kings,7,27,Hiram made ten bronze bases [for the lavers]; their length and breadth were four cubits and the height three cubits.
1 Kings,7,28,This is the way the bases were made: they had panels between the ledges.
1 Kings,7,29,On the panels between the ledges were lions oxen and cherubim; and upon the ledges there was a pedestal above. Beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.
1 Kings,7,30,And every base had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze and at the four corners were supports for a laver. Beneath the laver the supports were cast with wreaths at the side of each.
1 Kings,7,31,Its mouth within the capital projected upward a cubit and its mouth was round like the work of a pedestal a cubit and a half. Also upon its mouth were carvings and their borders were square not round.
1 Kings,7,32,Under the borders were four wheels and the axles of the wheels were one piece with the base. And the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.
1 Kings,7,33,The wheels were made like a chariot wheel: their axles their rims their spokes and their hubs were all cast.
1 Kings,7,34,There were four supports to the four corners of each base; the supports were part of the base itself.
1 Kings,7,35,On the top of the base there was a circular elevation half a cubit high and on the top of the base its stays and panels were of one piece with it.
1 Kings,7,36,And on the surface of its stays and its panels Hiram carved cherubim lions and palm trees according to the space of each with wreaths round about.
1 Kings,7,37,Thus he made the ten bases. They all had one casting one measure and one form.
1 Kings,7,38,Then he made ten lavers of bronze; each laver held forty baths and measured four cubits and there was one laver on each of the ten bases.
1 Kings,7,39,He put the bases five on the south side of the house and five on the north side; and he set the Sea at the southeast corner of the house.
1 Kings,7,40,Hiram made the lavers the shovels and the basins. So Hiram finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the Lord:
1 Kings,7,41,The two pillars; and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the two pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls;
1 Kings,7,42,And the 400 pomegranates for the two networks two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;
1 Kings,7,43,The ten bases and the ten lavers on the bases;
1 Kings,7,44,One Sea and the twelve oxen under it;
1 Kings,7,45,The pots the shovels and the basins. All these vessels which Hiram made for King Solomon in the house of the Lord were of burnished bronze.
1 Kings,7,46,In the Jordan plain the king cast them in clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
1 Kings,7,47,Solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they were so many; the weight of the bronze was not found out.
1 Kings,7,48,Solomon made all the other vessels of the Lord's house: the [incense] altar of gold; the table of gold for the showbread;
1 Kings,7,49,The lampstands of pure gold five on the right side and five on the left in front of the Holy of Holies; with the flowers the lamps and the tongs of gold;
1 Kings,7,50,The cups snuffers basins spoons firepans--of pure gold; and the hinges of gold for the doors of the innermost room the Holy of Holies and for the doors of the Holy Place.
1 Kings,7,51,So all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the Lord was completed. Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated--the silver the gold and the vessels--and put them in the treasuries of the Lord's house.
1 Kings,8,1,THEN SOLOMON assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes the chiefs of the fathers' houses of the Israelites before the king in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Zion the City of David.
1 Kings,8,2,All the men of Israel assembled themselves before King Solomon at the feast in the seventh month Ethanim.
1 Kings,8,3,All the elders of Israel came and the priests took up the ark.
1 Kings,8,4,And they brought up the ark of the Lord the Tent of Meeting and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them up.
1 Kings,8,5,King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel who had assembled before him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen so many that they could not be reported or counted.
1 Kings,8,6,And the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the Lord to its place in the Holy of Holies of the house under the wings of the cherubim.
1 Kings,8,7,For the cherubim spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles.
1 Kings,8,8,The poles were so long that the ends of them were seen from the Holy Place before the Holy of Holies but they were not seen outside; they are there to this day.
1 Kings,8,9,There was nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites when they came out of the land of Egypt.
1 Kings,8,10,When the priests had come out of the Holy Place the cloud filled the Lord's house
1 Kings,8,11,So the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's house.
1 Kings,8,12,Then Solomon said The Lord said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.
1 Kings,8,13,I have surely built You a house of habitation a settled place for You to dwell in forever.
1 Kings,8,14,And the king turned his face about and blessed all the assembly of Israel and all the assembly of Israel stood.
1 Kings,8,15,He said Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel Who spoke with His mouth to David my father and has with His hand fulfilled it saying
1 Kings,8,16,Since the day that I brought forth My people Israel out of Egypt I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house that My Name [and My Presence] might be in it but I chose David to be over My people Israel.
1 Kings,8,17,Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the Name [the Presence] of the Lord the God of Israel.
1 Kings,8,18,And the Lord said to David my father Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for My Name you did well that it was in your heart.
1 Kings,8,19,Yet you shall not build the house but your son who shall be born to you shall build it to My Name [and My actively present Person].
1 Kings,8,20,And the Lord has fulfilled His promise which He made: I have risen up in the place of David my father and sit on the throne of Israel as the Lord promised and have built a house for the Name (renown) of the Lord the God of Israel.
1 Kings,8,21,And I have made there a place for the ark [the token of His presence] in which is the covenant [the Ten Commandments] of the Lord which He made with our fathers when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.
1 Kings,8,22,Then Solomon stood [in the court] before the Lord's burnt offering altar in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven
1 Kings,8,23,And he said O Lord the God of Israel there is no God like You in heaven above or on earth beneath keeping covenant and showing mercy and loving-kindness to Your servants who walk before You with all their heart.
1 Kings,8,24,You have kept what You promised Your servant David my father. You also spoke with Your mouth and have fulfilled it with Your hand as it is this day.
1 Kings,8,25,Therefore now O Lord the God of Israel keep with Your servant David my father what You promised him when You said There shall not fail you a man before Me to sit on the throne of Israel if only your children take heed to their way that they walk before Me as you have done.
1 Kings,8,26,Now O God of Israel let Your word which You spoke to Your servant David my father be confirmed [by experience].
1 Kings,8,27,But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? Behold the heavens and heaven of heavens [in its most extended compass] cannot contain You; how much less this house that I have built?
1 Kings,8,28,Yet graciously consider the prayer and supplication of Your servant O Lord my God to hearken to the [loud] cry and prayer which he prays before You today
1 Kings,8,29,That Your eyes may be open toward this house night and day toward the place of which You have said My Name [and the token of My presence] shall be there that You may hearken to the prayer which Your servant shall make in [or facing toward] this place.
1 Kings,8,30,Hearken to the prayer of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray in or toward this place. Hear in heaven Your dwelling place and when You hear forgive.
1 Kings,8,31,Whenever a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath and comes and swears the oath before Your altar in this house
1 Kings,8,32,Then hear in heaven and do and judge Your servants condemning the wicked by bringing his guilt upon his own head and justifying the [uncompromisingly] righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness (his uprightness right standing with God).
1 Kings,8,33,When Your people Israel are struck down before the enemy because they have sinned against You and they turn again to You confess Your name (Your revelation of Yourself) and pray beseeching You in this house
1 Kings,8,34,Then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel and return them to the land You gave to their fathers.
1 Kings,8,35,When heaven is shut up and no rain falls because they have sinned against You if they pray in [or toward] this place and confess Your name (Your revelation of Yourself) and turn from their sin when You afflict them
1 Kings,8,36,Then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants Your people Israel when You teach them the good way in which they should walk. And give rain upon Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.
1 Kings,8,37,If there is famine in the land or pestilence blight mildew locust or caterpillar if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities whatever plague whatever sickness there is
1 Kings,8,38,Whatever prayer or supplication is made by any or all of Your people Israel--each man knowing the affliction of his own heart and spreading forth his hands toward this house [and its pledge of Your presence]--
1 Kings,8,39,Then hear in heaven Your dwelling place and forgive and act and give to every man according to his ways whose heart You know for You and You only know the hearts of all the children of men
1 Kings,8,40,That they may fear and revere You all the days that they live in the land which You gave to our fathers.
1 Kings,8,41,Moreover concerning a stranger who is not of Your people Israel but comes from a far country for the sake of Your name [and Your active Presence]--
1 Kings,8,42,For they will hear of Your great name (Your revelation of Yourself) Your strong hand and outstretched arm--when he shall pray in [or toward] this house
1 Kings,8,43,Hear in heaven Your dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger asks of You so that all peoples of the earth may know Your name [and Your revelation of Your presence] and fear and revere You as do Your people Israel and may know and comprehend that this house which I have built is called by Your Name [and contains the token of Your presence].
1 Kings,8,44,If Your people go out to battle against their enemy wherever You shall send them and shall pray to the Lord toward the city which You have chosen and the house that I have built for Your Name [and Your revelation of Yourself]
1 Kings,8,45,Then hear in heaven their prayer and supplication and defend their cause and maintain their right.
1 Kings,8,46,If they sin against You--for there is no man who does not sin--and You are angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they are carried away captive to the enemy's land far or near;
1 Kings,8,47,Yet if they think and consider in the land where they were carried captive and repent and make supplication to You there saying We have sinned and have done perversely and wickedly;
1 Kings,8,48,If they repent and turn to You with all their mind and with all their heart in the land of their enemies who took them captive and pray to You toward their land which You gave to their fathers the city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your Name;
1 Kings,8,49,Then hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven Your dwelling place and defend their cause and maintain their right.
1 Kings,8,50,And forgive Your people who have sinned against You and all their transgressions against You and grant them compassion before those who took them captive that they may have pity and be merciful to them;
1 Kings,8,51,For they are Your people and Your heritage which You brought out of Egypt from the midst of the iron furnace.
1 Kings,8,52,Let Your eyes be open to the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel to hearken to them in all for which they call to You.
1 Kings,8,53,For You separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be Your heritage as You declared through Moses Your servant when You brought our fathers out of Egypt O Lord God.
1 Kings,8,54,When Solomon finished offering all this prayer and supplication to the Lord he arose from before the Lord's altar where he had knelt with hands stretched toward heaven.
1 Kings,8,55,And he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice saying
1 Kings,8,56,Blessed be the Lord Who has given rest to His people Israel according to all that He promised. Not one word has failed of all His good promise which He promised through Moses His servant.
1 Kings,8,57,May the Lord our God be with us as He was with our fathers; may He not leave us or forsake us
1 Kings,8,58,That He may incline our hearts to Him to walk in all His ways and to keep His commandments His statutes and His precepts which He commanded our fathers.
1 Kings,8,59,Let these my words with which I have made supplication before the Lord be near to the Lord our God day and night that He may maintain the cause and right of His servant and of His people Israel as each day requires
1 Kings,8,60,That all the earth's people may know that the Lord is God and that there is no other.
1 Kings,8,61,Let your hearts therefore be blameless and wholly true to the Lord our God to walk in His statutes and to keep His commandments as today.
1 Kings,8,62,And the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifice before the Lord.
1 Kings,8,63,Solomon offered as peace offerings to the Lord: 22000 oxen and 120000 sheep. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the house of the Lord.
1 Kings,8,64,On that same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was before the Lord's house; there he offered burnt offerings cereal offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the bronze altar that was before the Lord was too small to receive [all] the offerings.
1 Kings,8,65,So at that time Solomon held the feast and all Israel with him a great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt before the Lord our God for seven days [for the dedication] and seven days [for the Feast of Tabernacles] fourteen days in all.
1 Kings,8,66,On the eighth day he sent the people away; they blessed the king and went to their tents with greatest joy and gratitude for all the goodness the Lord had shown to David His servant and Israel His people.
1 Kings,9,1,WHEN SOLOMON finished the building of the Lord's house and the king's house and all he desired and was pleased to do
1 Kings,9,2,The Lord appeared to Solomon the second time as He had appeared to him at Gibeon.
1 Kings,9,3,The Lord told him I have heard your prayer and supplication which you have made before Me; I have hallowed this house which you have built and I have put My Name [and My Presence] there forever. My eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually.
1 Kings,9,4,And if you will walk before Me as David your father walked in integrity of heart and uprightness doing according to all that I have commanded you keeping My statutes and My precepts
1 Kings,9,5,Then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever as I promised David your father saying There shall not fail you [to have] a man upon the throne of Israel.
1 Kings,9,6,But if you turn away from following Me you or your children and will not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them
1 Kings,9,7,Then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them and this house I have hallowed for My Name (renown) I will cast from My sight. And Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all the peoples.
1 Kings,9,8,This house shall become a heap of ruins; every passerby shall be astonished and shall hiss [with surprise] and say Why has the Lord done thus to this land and to this house?
1 Kings,9,9,Then they will answer Because they forsook the Lord their God Who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt and have laid hold of other gods and have worshiped and served them; therefore the Lord has brought on them all this evil.
1 Kings,9,10,At the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the two houses the Lord's house and the king's house
1 Kings,9,11,For which Hiram king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with as much cedar and cypress timber and gold as he desired King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
1 Kings,9,12,And Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him and they did not please him.
1 Kings,9,13,He said What are these cities worth which you have given me my brother? So they are called the Cabul [unproductive] Land to this day.
1 Kings,9,14,And Hiram sent to the king 120 talents of gold.
1 Kings,9,15,This is the account of the levy [of forced labor] which King Solomon raised to build the house of the Lord his own house the Millo the wall of Jerusalem Hazor Megiddo and Gezer.
1 Kings,9,16,For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer burned it with fire slew the Canaanites who dwelt in the city and had given it as dowry to his daughter Solomon's wife.
1 Kings,9,17,So Solomon rebuilt Gezer and Lower Beth-horon
1 Kings,9,18,Baalath and Tamar (Tadmor) in the wilderness in the land of Judah
1 Kings,9,19,And all the store cities which Solomon had and cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen and whatever Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem in Lebanon and in all the land of his dominion.
1 Kings,9,20,As for all the people who were left of the Amorites Hittites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites who were not Israelites
1 Kings,9,21,Their children who were left after them in the land whom the Israelites were not able utterly to destroy of them Solomon made a forced levy of slaves to this day.
1 Kings,9,22,But Solomon made no slaves of the Israelites; they were the soldiers his officials attendants commanders captains chariot officers and horsemen.
1 Kings,9,23,These were the chief officers over Solomon's work 550 who had charge of the people who did the work.
1 Kings,9,24,But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the City of David to her house which Solomon had built for her; then he built the Millo.
1 Kings,9,25,Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar he built to the Lord and he burned incense with them before the Lord. So he finished the house.
1 Kings,9,26,And King Solomon made a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber which is beside Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea in Edom.
1 Kings,9,27,And Hiram sent with the fleet his servants shipmen who had knowledge of the sea with the servants of Solomon.
1 Kings,9,28,They came to Ophir and got 420 talents of gold and brought it to King Solomon.
1 Kings,10,1,WHEN THE queen of Sheba heard of [the constant connection of] the fame of Solomon with the name of the Lord she came to prove him with hard questions (problems and riddles).
1 Kings,10,2,She came to Jerusalem with a very great train with camels bearing spices very much gold and precious stones. When she had come to Solomon she communed with him about all that was in her mind.
1 Kings,10,3,Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from the king which he failed to explain to her.
1 Kings,10,4,When the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom and skill the house he had built
1 Kings,10,5,The food of his table the seating of his officials the standing at attention of his servants their apparel his cupbearers his ascent by which he went up to the house of the Lord [or the burnt offerings he sacrificed] she was breathless and overcome.
1 Kings,10,6,She said to the king It was a true report I heard in my own land of your acts and sayings and wisdom.
1 Kings,10,7,I did not believe it until I came and my eyes had seen. Behold the half was not told me. You have added wisdom and goodness exceeding the fame I heard.
1 Kings,10,8,Happy are your men! Happy are these your servants who stand continually before you hearing your wisdom!
1 Kings,10,9,Blessed be the Lord your God Who delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel! Because the Lord loved Israel forever He made you king to execute justice and righteousness.
1 Kings,10,10,And she gave the king 120 talents of gold and of spices a very great store and precious stones. Never again came such abundance of spices as these the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.
1 Kings,10,11,The navy also of Hiram brought from Ophir gold and a great plenty of almug (algum) wood and precious stones.
1 Kings,10,12,Of the almug wood the king made pillars for the house of the Lord and for the king's house and lyres also and harps for the singers. No such almug wood came again or has been seen to this day.
1 Kings,10,13,King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all she wanted whatever she asked besides his gifts to her from his royal bounty. So she returned to her own country she and her servants.
1 Kings,10,14,Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one [particular] year was 666 talents of gold
1 Kings,10,15,Besides what the traders brought and the traffic of the merchants and from all the [tributary] kings and governors of the land of Arabia.
1 Kings,10,16,King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold; 600 shekels of gold went into each shield.
1 Kings,10,17,And he made 300 shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
1 Kings,10,18,Also the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the finest gold.
1 Kings,10,19,The throne had six steps and attached at the rear of the top of the throne was a round covering or canopy. On either side of the seat were armrests and two lions stood beside the armrests.
1 Kings,10,20,Twelve lions stood there one on either end of each of the six steps; there was nothing like it ever made in any kingdom.
1 Kings,10,21,All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold and all vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver; it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.
1 Kings,10,22,For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish came bringing gold silver ivory apes and peacocks.
1 Kings,10,23,So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom (skill).
1 Kings,10,24,And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom which God had put in his mind.
1 Kings,10,25,Every man brought tribute: vessels of silver and gold garments equipment spices horses and mules so much year by year.
1 Kings,10,26,Solomon collected chariots and horsemen; he had 1400 chariots and 12000 horsemen which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
1 Kings,10,27,The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones and cedars as plentiful as the sycamore trees in the lowlands.
1 Kings,10,28,Solomon's horses were brought out of Egypt and the king's merchants received them in droves each at a price.
1 Kings,10,29,A chariot could be brought out of Egypt for 600 shekels of silver and a horse for 150. And so to all the kings of the Hittites and of Syria they were exported by the king's merchants.
1 Kings,11,1,BUT KING Solomon [defiantly] loved many foreign women--the daughter of Pharaoh women of the Moabites Ammonites Edomites Sidonians and Hittites.
1 Kings,11,2,They were of the very nations of whom the Lord said to the Israelites You shall not mingle with them neither shall they mingle with you for surely they will turn away your hearts after their gods. Yet Solomon clung to these in love.
1 Kings,11,3,He had 700 wives princesses and 300 concubines and his wives turned away his heart from God.
1 Kings,11,4,For when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect (complete and whole) with the Lord his God as was the heart of David his father.
1 Kings,11,5,For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and after Milcom the abominable idol of the Ammonites!
1 Kings,11,6,Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord and went not fully after the Lord as David his father did.
1 Kings,11,7,Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abominable idol of Moab on the hill opposite Jerusalem and for Molech the abominable idol of the Ammonites.
1 Kings,11,8,And he did so for all of his foreign wives who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.
1 Kings,11,9,And the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned from the Lord the God of Israel Who had appeared to him twice
1 Kings,11,10,And had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he did not do what the Lord commanded.
1 Kings,11,11,Therefore the Lord said to Solomon Because you are doing this and have not kept My covenant and My statutes which I have commanded you I will surely rend the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant!
1 Kings,11,12,However in your days I will not do it for David your father's sake. But I will rend it out of the hand of your son!
1 Kings,11,13,However I will not tear away all the kingdom but will give one tribe to your son for David My servant's sake and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.
1 Kings,11,14,The Lord stirred up an adversary against Solomon Hadad the Edomite; he was of royal descent in Edom.
1 Kings,11,15,For when David was in Edom and Joab the commander of Israel's army went up to bury the slain he slew every male in Edom.
1 Kings,11,16,For Joab and all Israel remained there for six months until he had cut off every male in Edom.
1 Kings,11,17,But Hadad fled he and certain Edomites of his father's servants to Egypt Hadad being yet a little child.
1 Kings,11,18,They set out from Midian and came to Paran and took men with them out of Paran and came to Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt who gave [young] Hadad a house and land and ordered provisions for him.
1 Kings,11,19,Hadad found great favor with Pharaoh so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife Tahpenes the queen.
1 Kings,11,20,The sister of Tahpenes bore Hadad Genubath his son whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.
1 Kings,11,21,But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the commander of Israel's army was dead Hadad said to Pharaoh Let me depart that I may go to my own country.
1 Kings,11,22,Then Pharaoh said to him But what have you lacked with me that now you want to go to your own country? He replied Nothing. However let me go anyhow.
1 Kings,11,23,God raised up for [Hadad] another adversary Rezon son of Eliada who had fled from his master Hadadezer king of Zobah.
1 Kings,11,24,Rezon gathered men about him and became leader of a marauding band after the slaughter by David. They went to Damascus and dwelt and made [Rezon] king in Damascus.
1 Kings,11,25,And Rezon was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon besides the mischief that Hadad did. Rezon abhorred Israel and reigned over Syria.
1 Kings,11,26,Jeroboam son of Nebat an Ephrathite of Zereda Solomon's servant whose mother's name was Zeruah a widow woman rebelled against the king--
1 Kings,11,27,And for this reason: Solomon built the Millo and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.
1 Kings,11,28,The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of courage. Solomon seeing that the young man was industrious put him in charge over all the [forced] labor of the house of Joseph.
1 Kings,11,29,At that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the way. Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they were alone in the field.
1 Kings,11,30,Ahijah caught the new garment he wore and tore it into twelve pieces.
1 Kings,11,31,He said to Jeroboam You take ten pieces for thus says the Lord the God of Israel Behold I will tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon and will give you ten tribes.
1 Kings,11,32,But he shall have one tribe for My servant David's sake and for Jerusalem's sake the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel
1 Kings,11,33,Because they have forsaken Me and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians Chemosh the god of the Moabites and Milcom the god of the Ammonites and have not walked in My ways to do what is right in My sight keeping My statutes and My ordinances as did David his father.
1 Kings,11,34,However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him ruler all the days of his life for David My servant's sake whom I chose because he kept My commandments and My statutes.
1 Kings,11,35,But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand and give it to you ten tribes.
1 Kings,11,36,Yet to his son I will give one tribe that David My servant may always have a light before Me in Jerusalem the city where I have chosen to put My Name.
1 Kings,11,37,And I will take you and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires; and you shall be king over Israel.
1 Kings,11,38,And if you will hearken to all I command you and will walk in My ways and do right in My sight keeping My statutes and My commandments as David My servant did I will be with you and build you a sure house as I built for David and will give Israel to you.
1 Kings,11,39,And I will for this afflict the descendants of David but not forever.
1 Kings,11,40,Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt to Shishak king of Egypt and was in Egypt until Solomon died.
1 Kings,11,41,The rest of the acts of Solomon--and all that he did and his wisdom (skill)--are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
1 Kings,11,42,The time Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
1 Kings,11,43,And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father. Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings,12,1,REHOBOAM WENT to Shechem for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
1 Kings,12,2,And when Jeroboam son of Nebat heard of it--for he still dwelt in Egypt where he had fled from King Solomon--[he] returned from Egypt.
1 Kings,12,3,And they sent and called him and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and said to Rehoboam
1 Kings,12,4,Your father made our yoke heavy; now therefore lighten the hard service and the heavy yoke your father put upon us and we will serve you.
1 Kings,12,5,He replied Go away for three days and then return to me. So the people departed.
1 Kings,12,6,And King Rehoboam consulted with the old men who stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived and said How do you advise me to answer this people?
1 Kings,12,7,And they said to him If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them and answer them with good words they will be your servants forever.
1 Kings,12,8,But he forsook the counsel the old men gave him and consulted the young men who grew up with him and stood before him.
1 Kings,12,9,He said to them What do you advise that we answer this people who have said Make the yoke your father put on us lighter?
1 Kings,12,10,The young men who grew up with him answered To the people who told you Your father made our yoke heavy but you make it lighter for us--say this My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
1 Kings,12,11,And now whereas my father loaded you with a heavy yoke I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1 Kings,12,12,So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had appointed.
1 Kings,12,13,And the king answered the people roughly and forsook the counsel the old men had given him
1 Kings,12,14,And spoke to them after the counsel of the young men saying My father made your yoke heavy but I will add to your yoke; he chastised you with whips but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1 Kings,12,15,So the king did not hearken to the people for the situation was from the Lord that He might fulfill His word which He spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
1 Kings,12,16,So when all Israel saw that the king did not heed them they answered the king What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents O Israel! Look now to your own house David! So Israel went to their tents.
1 Kings,12,17,But Rehoboam reigned over the Israelites who dwelt in the cities of Judah.
1 Kings,12,18,Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram who was over the tribute [taskmaster over the forced labor] and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. So King Rehoboam hastened to get into his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
1 Kings,12,19,So Israel has rebelled against the house of David to this day.
1 Kings,12,20,When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. None followed the house of David except the tribe of Judah only.
1 Kings,12,21,And when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem he assembled all the house of Judah with the tribe of Benjamin 180000 chosen warriors to fight against the house of Israel to bring the kingdom back to Rehoboam son of Solomon.
1 Kings,12,22,But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God saying
1 Kings,12,23,Tell Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and all the house of Judah and Benjamin and the remnant of the people
1 Kings,12,24,Thus says the Lord You shall not go up or fight against your brethren the Israelites. Return every man to his house for this thing is from Me. So they hearkened to the Lord's word and returned home according to the Lord's word.
1 Kings,12,25,Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. He went out from there and built Penuel.
1 Kings,12,26,Jeroboam said in his heart Now the kingdom will return to the house of David.
1 Kings,12,27,If this people goes up to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem to sacrifice then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord to Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me and go back to Rehoboam king of Judah.
1 Kings,12,28,So the king took counsel and made two calves of gold. And he said to the people It is too much for you to go [all the way] up to Jerusalem. Behold your gods O Israel who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
1 Kings,12,29,And he set the one golden calf in Bethel and the other he put in Dan.
1 Kings,12,30,And this thing became a sin; for the people went to worship each of them even as far as Dan.
1 Kings,12,31,Jeroboam also made houses on high places and made priests of people who were not Levites.
1 Kings,12,32,And Jeroboam appointed a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month like the feast kept in Judah and he offered sacrifices upon the altar. So he did in Bethel sacrificing to the calves he had made. And he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places he had made.
1 Kings,12,33,So he offered upon the altar he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month a date which he chose individually; and he appointed a feast for the Israelites and he went up to the altar to burn incense [in defiance of God's law.]
1 Kings,13,1,AND BEHOLD there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the Lord to Bethel. Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
1 Kings,13,2,The man cried against the altar by the word of the Lord O altar altar thus says the Lord: Behold a son shall be born to the house of David Josiah by name; and on you shall he offer the priests of the high places who burn incense on you and men's bones shall be burned on you.
1 Kings,13,3,And he gave a sign the same day saying This is the sign which the Lord has spoken: Behold the altar shall be split and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out. [Fulfilled in II Kings 23:15 16.]
1 Kings,13,4,When King Jeroboam heard the words the man of God cried against the altar in Bethel he thrust out his hand saying Lay hold on him! And his hand which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not draw it to him again.
1 Kings,13,5,The altar also was split and the ashes poured out from the altar according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord.
1 Kings,13,6,And the king said to the man of God Entreat now the favor of the Lord your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored to me. And the man of God entreated the Lord and the king's hand was restored and became as it was before.
1 Kings,13,7,And the king said to the man of God Come home with me and refresh yourself and I will give you a reward.
1 Kings,13,8,And the man of God said to the king If you give me half your house I will not go in with you and I will not eat bread or drink water in this place.
1 Kings,13,9,For I was commanded by the word of the Lord You shall eat no bread or drink water or return by the way you came.
1 Kings,13,10,So he went another way and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel.
1 Kings,13,11,Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; the words which he had spoken to the king they told also to their father.
1 Kings,13,12,Their father asked them Which way did he go? For his sons had seen which way the man of God who came from Judah had gone.
1 Kings,13,13,He said to his sons Saddle the donkey for me. So they saddled the donkey and he rode on it
1 Kings,13,14,And went after the man of God. And he found him sitting under an oak and he said to him Are you the man of God who came from Judah? And he said I am.
1 Kings,13,15,Then he said to him Come home with me and eat bread.
1 Kings,13,16,He said I may not return with you or go in with you neither will I eat bread or drink water with you in this place.
1 Kings,13,17,For I was told by the word of the Lord You shall not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way that you came.
1 Kings,13,18,He answered I am a prophet also as you are. And an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord saying Bring him back with you to your house that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied to him.
1 Kings,13,19,So the man from Judah went back with him and ate and drank water in his house.
1 Kings,13,20,And as they sat at the table the word of the Lord came to the prophet who brought him back.
1 Kings,13,21,And he cried to the man of God who came from Judah Thus says the Lord: Because you have disobeyed the word of the Lord and have not kept the command which the Lord your God commanded you
1 Kings,13,22,But have come back and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which the Lord said to you Eat no bread and drink no water--your corpse shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.
1 Kings,13,23,And after the prophet of the house had eaten bread and drunk he saddled the donkey for the man he had brought back.
1 Kings,13,24,And when he had gone a lion met him by the road and slew him and his corpse was cast in the way and the donkey stood by it; the lion also stood by the corpse.
1 Kings,13,25,And behold men passed by and saw the corpse thrown in the road and the lion standing by the corpse and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
1 Kings,13,26,When the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it he said It is the man of God who was disobedient to the word of the Lord; therefore the Lord has given him to the lion which has torn him and slain him according to the word of the Lord which He spoke to him.
1 Kings,13,27,And he said to his sons Saddle the donkey for me. And they saddled it.
1 Kings,13,28,And he went and found the corpse thrown in the road and the donkey and the lion stood by the body; the lion had not eaten the corpse or torn the donkey.
1 Kings,13,29,The prophet took up the corpse of the man of God and laid it upon the donkey and brought it back and the old prophet came into the city to mourn and to bury him.
1 Kings,13,30,And he laid the body in his own grave and they mourned over him saying Alas my brother!
1 Kings,13,31,After he had buried him he said to his sons When I am dead bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
1 Kings,13,32,For the saying which he cried by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria shall surely come to pass.
1 Kings,13,33,After this thing Jeroboam turned not from his evil way but made priests for the high places again from among all the people. Whoever would he consecrated that there might be priests for the high places.
1 Kings,13,34,And this thing became the sin of the dynasty of Jeroboam that caused it to be abolished and destroyed from the face of the earth.
1 Kings,14,1,THEN ABIJAH [the little] son of Jeroboam became sick.
1 Kings,14,2,And Jeroboam said to his wife Arise I pray you and disguise yourself that you may not be recognized as Jeroboam's wife and go to Shiloh. Behold Ahijah the prophet is there who told me that I should be king over this people.
1 Kings,14,3,Take ten loaves some cakes and a bottle of honey and go to him. He will tell you what shall happen to the child.
1 Kings,14,4,Jeroboam's wife did so. She arose and went [twenty miles] to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah. Ahijah could not see for his eyes were dim because of his age.
1 Kings,14,5,And the Lord said to Ahijah Behold the wife of Jeroboam is coming to ask you concerning her son for he is sick. Thus and thus shall you say to her. When she came she pretended to be another woman.
1 Kings,14,6,But when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door he said Come in wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another? For I am charged with heavy news for you.
1 Kings,14,7,Go tell Jeroboam Thus says the Lord the God of Israel: Because I exalted you from among the people and made you leader over My people Israel
1 Kings,14,8,And rent the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you--and yet you have not been as My servant David who kept My commandments and followed Me with all his heart to do only what was right in My eyes
1 Kings,14,9,But have done evil above all who were before you; for you have made yourself other gods molten images to provoke Me to anger and have cast Me behind your back--
1 Kings,14,10,Therefore behold I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam and will cut off from [him] every male both bond and free in Israel and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam as a man sweeps away dung till it is all gone.
1 Kings,14,11,Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs shall eat and any who dies in the field the birds of the heavens shall eat. For the Lord has spoken it.
1 Kings,14,12,Arise therefore [Ano Jeroboam's wife] get to your own house. When your feet enter the city the child shall die.
1 Kings,14,13,And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam's family shall come to the grave because in him there is found something good and pleasing to the Lord the God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
1 Kings,14,14,Moreover the Lord will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam this day. From now on
1 Kings,14,15,The Lord will smite Israel as a reed is shaken in the water; and He will root up Israel out of this good land which He gave to their fathers and will scatter them beyond the [Euphrates] River because they have made their Asherim [idolatrous symbols of the goddess Asherah] provoking the Lord to anger.
1 Kings,14,16,He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam which he has sinned and made Israel to sin.
1 Kings,14,17,So Jeroboam's wife departed and came to Tirzah. When she came to the threshold of the house the child died.
1 Kings,14,18,And all Israel buried him and mourned for him according to the word of the Lord spoken by His servant Ahijah the prophet.
1 Kings,14,19,The rest of the acts of Jeroboam how he warred and how he reigned behold they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
1 Kings,14,20,Jeroboam reigned for twenty-two years and he slept with his fathers; and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings,14,21,And Rehoboam son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem the city the Lord chose out of all the tribes of Israel to put His Name [and the pledge of His presence] there. His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
1 Kings,14,22,And Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord Whom they provoked to jealousy with the sins they committed above all that their fathers had done.
1 Kings,14,23,For they also built themselves [idolatrous] high places pillars and Asherim [idolatrous symbols of the goddess Asherah] on every high hill and under every green tree.
1 Kings,14,24,There were also sodomites (male cult prostitutes) in the land. They did all the abominations of the nations whom the Lord cast out before the Israelites.
1 Kings,14,25,In the fifth year of King Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt [Jeroboam's brother-in-law] came up against Jerusalem.
1 Kings,14,26,He took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and of the king's house; he took away all including all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
1 Kings,14,27,King Rehoboam made in their stead bronze shields and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard who kept the door of the king's house.
1 Kings,14,28,And as often as the king went into the house of the Lord the guards bore them and brought them back into the guardroom.
1 Kings,14,29,The rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
1 Kings,14,30,There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
1 Kings,14,31,Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. Abijam (Abijah) his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings,15,1,IN THE eighteenth year of King Jeroboam son of Nebat Abijam began to reign over Judah.
1 Kings,15,2,He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Maacah (Micaiah) daughter [granddaughter] of Abishalom (Absalom).
1 Kings,15,3,He walked in all the sins of his father [Rehoboam] before him; and his heart was not blameless with the Lord his God as the heart of David his father [forefather].
1 Kings,15,4,Nevertheless for David's sake the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem setting up his son after him and establishing Jerusalem
1 Kings,15,5,Because David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and turned not aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
1 Kings,15,6,There was war between [Abijam's father] Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of [Rehoboam's] life.
1 Kings,15,7,The rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
1 Kings,15,8,Abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the City of David. Asa his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings,15,9,In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel Asa began to reign over Judah.
1 Kings,15,10,Forty-one years he reigned in Jerusalem. His mother was [also named] Maacah (Micaiah) daughter of Abishalom (Absalom).
1 Kings,15,11,And Asa did right in the eyes of the Lord as did David his father [forefather].
1 Kings,15,12,He put away the sodomites (male cult prostitutes) out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers [Solomon Rehoboam and Abijam] had made or promoted.
1 Kings,15,13,Also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen mother because she had an image made for [the goddess] Asherah. Asa destroyed her image burning it by the brook Kidron.
1 Kings,15,14,But the high places were not removed. Yet Asa's heart was blameless with the Lord all his days.
1 Kings,15,15,He brought the things which his father had dedicated and the things which he himself had dedicated into the house of the Lord--silver gold and vessels.
1 Kings,15,16,There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1 Kings,15,17,Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built up Ramah that he might allow no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
1 Kings,15,18,Then Asa took all the silver and gold left in the treasuries of the house of the Lord and of the king's house and delivered them into the hands of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad son of Tabrimmon the son of Hezion king of Syria who dwelt at Damascus saying
1 Kings,15,19,Let there be a league between me and you as was between my father and your father. Behold I am sending you a present of silver and gold; go break your league with Baasha king of Israel that he may withdraw from me.
1 Kings,15,20,So Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel and smote Ijon Dan Abel-beth-maacah and all Chinneroth with all the land of Naphtali.
1 Kings,15,21,When Baasha heard of it he quit building up Ramah and dwelt in Tirzah.
1 Kings,15,22,Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah--none was exempted. They carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had been building. And King Asa built up with them Geba of Benjamin and also Mizpah.
1 Kings,15,23,The rest of all the acts of Asa all his might all that he did and the cities which he built are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
1 Kings,15,24,Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of David his father. Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings,15,25,Nadab son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah and reigned two years.
1 Kings,15,26,He did evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the way of his father and in his sin with which he made Israel sin.
1 Kings,15,27,Baasha son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against Nadab and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon which belonged to the Philistines for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.
1 Kings,15,28,In the third year of Asa king of Judah Baasha slew Nadab and reigned in his stead.
1 Kings,15,29,As soon as he was king Baasha killed all the household of Jeroboam. He left to [it] not one who breathed until he had destroyed it according to the word of the Lord which He spoke by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite--
1 Kings,15,30,Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned and by which he made Israel to sin and because of his provocation of the Lord the God of Israel to anger.
1 Kings,15,31,The rest of Nadab's acts and all that he did are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1 Kings,15,32,There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1 Kings,15,33,In the third year of Asa king of Judah Baasha son of Ahijah began his reign of twenty-four years over all Israel in Tirzah.
1 Kings,15,34,He did evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin with which he made Israel sin.
1 Kings,16,1,AND THE word of the Lord came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha saying
1 Kings,16,2,Because I exalted you [Baasha] out of the dust and made you leader over My people Israel and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have made My people Israel sin to provoke Me to anger with their sins
1 Kings,16,3,Behold I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house and will make your house like [that] of Jeroboam son of Nebat.
1 Kings,16,4,Any of Baasha's family who dies in the city the dogs shall eat and any who dies in the field the birds of the heavens shall eat.
1 Kings,16,5,Now the rest of the acts of Baasha what he did and his might are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1 Kings,16,6,Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah. Elah his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings,16,7,Also the word of the Lord against Baasha and his house came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani for all the evil that Baasha did in the sight of the Lord in provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands [idols] in being like the house of Jeroboam and also because he destroyed it [the family of Jeroboam of his own accord].
1 Kings,16,8,In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah Elah son of Baasha began his reign of two years over Israel in Tirzah.
1 Kings,16,9,Elah's servant Zimri captain of half his chariots conspired against Elah. He was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza who was over the household in Tirzah.
1 Kings,16,10,Zimri came in and smote and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah and reigned in his stead.
1 Kings,16,11,When he began to reign as soon as he sat on his throne he killed all the household of Baasha; he left not one male of his kinsmen or his friends.
1 Kings,16,12,Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha according to the word of the Lord which He spoke against Baasha through Jehu the prophet
1 Kings,16,13,For all the sins of Baasha and of Elah his son by which they sinned and made Israel sin in provoking the Lord the God of Israel to anger with their idols.
1 Kings,16,14,The rest of the acts of Elah and all he did are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1 Kings,16,15,In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah Zimri reigned for seven days in Tirzah. The troops were encamped against Gibbethon which belonged to the Philistines
1 Kings,16,16,And they heard the rumor Zimri has conspired and slain the king! So all Israel made Omri the commander of the army king over Israel that day in the camp.
1 Kings,16,17,So Omri went up from Gibbethon and all Israel with him and they besieged Tirzah.
1 Kings,16,18,And when Zimri saw that the city was taken he went into the stronghold of the king's house and burned the king's house over him with fire and died
1 Kings,16,19,Because of his sins committed in doing evil in the sight of the Lord in walking in the way of Jeroboam and his sin in causing Israel to sin.
1 Kings,16,20,The rest of the acts of Zimri and his deeds of treason are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1 Kings,16,21,Then the people of Israel were divided into two factions. Half of the people followed Tibni son of Ginath to make him king and half followed Omri.
1 Kings,16,22,But the people who followed Omri prevailed against those who followed Tibni son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri reigned.
1 Kings,16,23,In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah Omri began his reign of twelve years over Israel. He reigned six years in Tirzah.
1 Kings,16,24,Omri bought the hill Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver. He built a city on the hill and fortified it and called it Samaria (Shomeron) after the owner of the hill Shemer.
1 Kings,16,25,But Omri did evil in the eyes of the Lord even worse than all who were before him.
1 Kings,16,26,He walked in all the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat and in his sin by which he made Israel sin to provoke the Lord the God of Israel to anger with their idols.
1 Kings,16,27,The rest of the acts of Omri and his might that he showed are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1 Kings,16,28,So Omri slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings,16,29,In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah Ahab son of Omri began his reign of twenty-two years over Israel in Samaria.
1 Kings,16,30,And Ahab son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all before him.
1 Kings,16,31,As if it had been a light thing for Ahab to walk in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat he took for a wife Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians and served Baal and worshiped him.
1 Kings,16,32,He erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal which he built in Samaria.
1 Kings,16,33,And Ahab made an Asherah [idolatrous symbol of the goddess Asherah]. Ahab did more to provoke the Lord the God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel before him.
1 Kings,16,34,In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho. He laid its foundations at the cost of the life of Abiram his firstborn and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub according to the word of the Lord which He spoke through Joshua son of Nun.
1 Kings,17,1,ELIJAH THE Tishbite of the temporary residents of Gilead said to Ahab As the Lord the God of Israel lives before Whom I stand there shall not be dew or rain these years but according to My word.
1 Kings,17,2,And the word of the Lord came to him saying
1 Kings,17,3,Go from here and turn east and hide yourself by the brook Cherith east of the Jordan.
1 Kings,17,4,You shall drink of the brook and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.
1 Kings,17,5,So he did according to the word of the Lord; he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith east of the Jordan.
1 Kings,17,6,And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook.
1 Kings,17,7,After a while the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land.
1 Kings,17,8,And the word of the Lord came to him:
1 Kings,17,9,Arise go to Zarephath which belongs to Sidon and dwell there. Behold I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.
1 Kings,17,10,So he arose and went to Zarephath. When he came to the gate of the city behold a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her Bring me a little water in a vessel that I may drink.
1 Kings,17,11,As she was going to get it he called to her and said Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.
1 Kings,17,12,And she said As the Lord your God lives I have not a loaf baked but only a handful of meal in the jar and a little oil in the bottle. See I am gathering two sticks that I may go in and bake it for me and my son that we may eat it--and die.
1 Kings,17,13,Elijah said to her Fear not; go and do as you have said. But make me a little cake of [it] first and bring it to me and afterward prepare some for yourself and your son.
1 Kings,17,14,For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of meal shall not waste away or the bottle of oil fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth.
1 Kings,17,15,She did as Elijah said. And she and he and her household ate for many days.
1 Kings,17,16,The jar of meal was not spent nor did the bottle of oil fail according to the word which the Lord spoke through Elijah.
1 Kings,17,17,After these things the son of the woman the mistress of the house became sick; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.
1 Kings,17,18,And she said to Elijah What have you against me O man of God? Have you come to me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son?
1 Kings,17,19,He said to her Give me your son. And he took him from her bosom and carried him up into the chamber where he stayed and laid him upon his own bed.
1 Kings,17,20,And Elijah cried to the Lord and said O Lord my God have You brought further calamity upon the widow with whom I sojourn by slaying her son?
1 Kings,17,21,And he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried to the Lord and said O Lord my God I pray You let this child's soul come back into him.
1 Kings,17,22,And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived.
1 Kings,17,23,And Elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the [lower part of the] house and gave him to his mother; and Elijah said See your son is alive!
1 Kings,17,24,And the woman said to Elijah By this I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.
1 Kings,18,1,AFTER MANY days the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year saying Go show yourself to Ahab and I will send rain upon the earth.
1 Kings,18,2,So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria.
1 Kings,18,3,And Ahab called Obadiah who was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly;
1 Kings,18,4,For when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water.)
1 Kings,18,5,And Ahab said to Obadiah Go into the land to all the fountains of water and to all the brooks; perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive that we lose none of the beasts.
1 Kings,18,6,So they divided the land between them to pass through it. Ahab went one way and Obadiah went another way each by himself.
1 Kings,18,7,As Obadiah was on the way behold Elijah met him. He recognized him and fell on his face and said Are you my lord Elijah?
1 Kings,18,8,He answered him It is I. Go tell your lord Behold Elijah is here.
1 Kings,18,9,And he said What sin have I committed that you would deliver your servant into the hands of Ahab to be slain?
1 Kings,18,10,As the Lord your God lives there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you. And when they said He is not here he took an oath from the kingdom or nation that they had not found you.
1 Kings,18,11,And now you say Go tell your lord Behold Elijah is here.
1 Kings,18,12,And as soon as I have gone out from you the Spirit of the Lord will carry you I know not where; so when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you he will kill me. But I your servant have feared and revered the Lord from my youth.
1 Kings,18,13,Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord how I hid a hundred men of the Lord's prophets by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water?
1 Kings,18,14,And now you say Go tell your lord Behold Elijah is here; and he will kill me.
1 Kings,18,15,Elijah said As the Lord of hosts lives before Whom I stand I will surely show myself to Ahab today.
1 Kings,18,16,So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
1 Kings,18,17,When Ahab saw Elijah Ahab said to him Are you he who troubles Israel?
1 Kings,18,18,Elijah replied I have not troubled Israel but you have and your father's house by forsaking the commandments of the Lord and by following the Baals.
1 Kings,18,19,Therefore send and gather to me all Israel at Mount Carmel and the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of [the goddess] Asherah who eat at [Queen] Jezebel's table.
1 Kings,18,20,So Ahab sent to all the Israelites and assembled the prophets at Mount Carmel.
1 Kings,18,21,Elijah came near to all the people and said How long will you halt and limp between two opinions? If the Lord is God follow Him! But if Baal then follow him. And the people did not answer him a word.
1 Kings,18,22,Then Elijah said to the people I I only remain a prophet of the Lord but Baal's prophets are 450 men.
1 Kings,18,23,Let two bulls be given us; let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood but put no fire to it. I will dress the other bull lay it on the wood and put no fire to it.
1 Kings,18,24,Then you call on the name of your god and I will call on the name of the Lord; and the One Who answers by fire let Him be God. And all the people answered It is well spoken.
1 Kings,18,25,Elijah said to the prophets of Baal Choose one bull for yourselves and dress it first for you are many; and call on the name of your god but put no fire under it.
1 Kings,18,26,So they took the bull given them dressed it and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon saying O Baal hear and answer us! But there was no voice; no one answered. And they leaped upon or limped about the altar they had made.
1 Kings,18,27,At noon Elijah mocked them saying Cry aloud for he is a god; either he is musing or he has gone aside or he is on a journey or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.
1 Kings,18,28,And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their custom with knives and lances until the blood gushed out upon them.
1 Kings,18,29,Midday passed and they played the part of prophets until the time for offering the evening sacrifice but there was no voice no answer no one who paid attention.
1 Kings,18,30,Then Elijah said to all the people Come near to me. And all the people came near him. And he repaired the [old] altar of the Lord that had been broken down [by Jezebel].
1 Kings,18,31,Then Elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob to whom the word of the Lord came saying Israel shall be your name.
1 Kings,18,32,And with the stones Elijah built an altar in the name [and self-revelation] of the Lord. He made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed.
1 Kings,18,33,He put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood and said Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and the wood.
1 Kings,18,34,And he said Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.
1 Kings,18,35,The water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water.
1 Kings,18,36,At the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice Elijah the prophet came near and said O Lord the God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and that I am Your servant and that I have done all these things at Your word.
1 Kings,18,37,Hear me O Lord hear me that this people may know that You the Lord are God and have turned their hearts back [to You].
1 Kings,18,38,Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and also licked up the water that was in the trench.
1 Kings,18,39,When all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said The Lord He is God! The Lord He is God!
1 Kings,18,40,And Elijah said Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one escape. They seized them and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon and [as God's law required] slew them there.
1 Kings,18,41,And Elijah said to Ahab Go up eat and drink for there is the sound of abundance of rain.
1 Kings,18,42,So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees
1 Kings,18,43,And said to his servant Go up now look toward the sea. And he went up and looked and said There is nothing. Elijah said Go again seven times.
1 Kings,18,44,And at the seventh time the servant said A cloud as small as a man's hand is arising out of the sea. And Elijah said Go up say to Ahab Hitch your chariot and go down lest the rain stop you.
1 Kings,18,45,In a little while the heavens were black with wind-swept clouds and there was a great rain. And Ahab went to Jezreel.
1 Kings,18,46,The hand of the Lord was on Elijah. He girded up his loins and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel [nearly twenty miles].
1 Kings,19,1,AHAB TOLD Jezebel all that Elijah had done and how he had slain all the prophets [of Baal] with the sword.
1 Kings,19,2,Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah saying So let the gods do to me and more also if I make not your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.
1 Kings,19,3,Then he was afraid and arose and went for his life and came to Beersheba of Judah [over eighty miles and out of Jezebel's realm] and left his servant there.
1 Kings,19,4,But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a lone broom or juniper tree and asked that he might die. He said It is enough; now O Lord take away my life; for I am no better than my fathers.
1 Kings,19,5,As he lay asleep under the broom or juniper tree behold an angel touched him and said to him Arise and eat.
1 Kings,19,6,He looked and behold there was a cake baked on the coals and a bottle of water at his head. And he ate and drank and lay down again.
1 Kings,19,7,The angel of the Lord came the second time and touched him and said Arise and eat for the journey is too great for you.
1 Kings,19,8,So he arose and ate and drank and went in the strength of that food forty days and nights to Horeb the mount of God.
1 Kings,19,9,There he came to a cave and lodged in it; and behold the word of the Lord came to him and He said to him What are you doing here Elijah?
1 Kings,19,10,He replied I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts; for the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant thrown down Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I I only am left; and they seek my life to take it away.
1 Kings,19,11,And He said Go out and stand on the mount before the Lord. And behold the Lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake;
1 Kings,19,12,And after the earthquake a fire but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire [a sound of gentle stillness and] a still small voice.
1 Kings,19,13,When Elijah heard the voice he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold there came a voice to him and said What are you doing here Elijah?
1 Kings,19,14,He said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts because the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant thrown down Your altars and slain Your prophets with the sword. And I I only am left and they seek my life to destroy it.
1 Kings,19,15,And the Lord said to him Go return on your way to the Wilderness of Damascus; and when you arrive anoint Hazael to be king over Syria.
1 Kings,19,16,And anoint Jehu son of Nimshi to be king over Israel and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah to be prophet in your place.
1 Kings,19,17,And him who escapes from the sword of Hazael Jehu shall slay and him who escapes the sword of Jehu Elisha shall slay.
1 Kings,19,18,Yet I will leave Myself 7000 in Israel all the knees that have not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him.
1 Kings,19,19,So Elijah left there and found Elisha son of Shaphat whose plowing was being done with twelve yoke of oxen and he drove the twelfth. Elijah crossed over to him and cast his mantle upon him.
1 Kings,19,20,He left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said Let me kiss my father and mother and then I will follow you. And he [testing Elisha] said Go on back. What have I done to you? [Settle it for yourself.]
1 Kings,19,21,So Elisha went back from him. Then he took a yoke of oxen slew them boiled their flesh with the oxen's yoke [as fuel] and gave to the people and they ate. Then he arose followed Elijah and served him.
1 Kings,20,1,BEN-HADAD KING of Syria gathered all his army together; thirty-two kings were with him and horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Samaria warring against it.
1 Kings,20,2,He sent messengers into Samaria to Ahab king of Israel and said to him Thus says Ben-hadad:
1 Kings,20,3,Your silver and your gold are mine; your wives and your children even the fairest also are mine.
1 Kings,20,4,And the king of Israel answered and said My lord O king according to what you say I am yours and all that I have.
1 Kings,20,5,The messengers came again and said Thus says Ben-hadad: Although I have sent to you saying You shall deliver to me your silver your gold your wives and your children--
1 Kings,20,6,Yet I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants; and all the desire of your eyes they shall lay hands upon and take it away.
1 Kings,20,7,Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said Notice now and see how this man is seeking our destruction. He sent to me for my wives my children my silver and my gold and I did not refuse him.
1 Kings,20,8,And all the elders and all the people said to him Do not heed him or consent.
1 Kings,20,9,So he said to Ben-hadad's messengers Tell my lord the king All you first sent for to your servant I will do but this thing I cannot do. And the messengers left; then they brought him word again.
1 Kings,20,10,Ben-hadad sent to him and said May the gods do so to me and more also if the rubbish of Samaria shall be enough for each one of all the people who are at my feet and follow me to get a handful.
1 Kings,20,11,The king of Israel answered Tell him: Let not him who girds on his harness boast as he who puts it off.
1 Kings,20,12,When Ben-hadad heard this message as he and the kings were drinking in the booths he said to his servants Set the army in array. And they set themselves in array against [Samaria].
1 Kings,20,13,Then a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel and said Thus says the Lord: Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold I will deliver it into your hand today and you shall know and realize that I am the Lord.
1 Kings,20,14,Ahab said By whom? And he said Thus says the Lord: By the young men [the attendants or bodyguards] of the governors of the districts. Then Ahab said Who shall order the battle? And he answered You.
1 Kings,20,15,Ahab numbered the attendants of the governors of the districts and they were 232. After them he numbered all the people of [the army of ] Israel 7000.
1 Kings,20,16,And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths he and the thirty-two kings who helped him.
1 Kings,20,17,The servants of the governors of the districts went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out and they told him saying There are men come out of Samaria.
1 Kings,20,18,And he said Whether they have come out for peace or for war take them alive.
1 Kings,20,19,So these [strong young guards] of the governors of the districts went out of [Samaria] and the army followed them.
1 Kings,20,20,And each one killed his man; the Syrians fled and Israel pursued them. Ben-hadad king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen.
1 Kings,20,21,The king of Israel went out and smote [the riders of] the horses and chariots and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
1 Kings,20,22,The prophet came to the king of Israel and said to him Go fortify yourself and become strong and give attention to what you must do for at the first of next year the king of Syria will return against you.
1 Kings,20,23,And the servants of the king of Syria said to him Israel's gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we. But let us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they.
1 Kings,20,24,And do this thing: Remove the kings each from his place and put governors in their stead.
1 Kings,20,25,And muster yourself an army like the army you have lost horse for horse and chariot for chariot. And we will fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he heeded their speech and did so.
1 Kings,20,26,And at the return of the year Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
1 Kings,20,27,The Israelites were counted and all present went against them. The Israelites encamped before the enemy like two little flocks of lost kids [absolutely everything against them but Almighty God] but the Syrians filled the country.
1 Kings,20,28,A man of God came and said to the king of Israel Thus says the Lord: Because the Syrians have said The Lord is God of the hills but He is not God of the valleys therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into your hands and you shall know and recognize by experience that I am the Lord.
1 Kings,20,29,They encamped opposite each other seven days. Then the battle was joined; and the Israelites slew of the Syrians 100000 foot soldiers in one day.
1 Kings,20,30,But the rest fled to the city of Aphek and the wall fell upon 27000 men who were left. Ben-hadad fled into the city and from chamber to chamber.
1 Kings,20,31,His servants said to him We have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Let us put sackcloth on our loins and ropes about our necks and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will spare your life.
1 Kings,20,32,So they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their necks and came to the king of Israel and said Your servant Ben-hadad says I pray you let me live. And King [Ahab] said Is he yet alive? He is my brother.
1 Kings,20,33,Now the men took it as an omen and they hastily took it up and said Yes your brother Ben-hadad. Then the king said Go bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him and the victorious king caused him to come up into the chariot.
1 Kings,20,34,Ben-hadad [tempting him] said The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you may maintain bazaars of your own in Damascus as my father did in Samaria. Then said Ahab I will send you away on these terms. So he made a covenant with him and sent him away.
1 Kings,20,35,And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor At the command of the Lord strike me I pray you. And the man refused to strike him.
1 Kings,20,36,Then said he to him Because you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord behold as soon as you have left me a lion will slay you. And as soon as he departed from him a lion found him and killed him.
1 Kings,20,37,Then [the prophet] found another man and said Strike me I pray you. And the man struck him so that in striking he wounded him.
1 Kings,20,38,So the prophet departed and waited for King Ahab by the way and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.
1 Kings,20,39,And as the king passed by the [prophet] cried out to him Your servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a man turned aside and brought a man to me and said Keep this man. If for any reason he is missing then your life shall be required for his life or else you shall pay a talent of silver.
1 Kings,20,40,But while your servant was busy here and there he was gone. And the king of Israel said to him Such is your own verdict; you yourself have decided it.
1 Kings,20,41,The man hastily removed the ashes from his face and Ahab king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.
1 Kings,20,42,And he said to the king Thus says the Lord: Because you have let go out of your hand the man I had devoted to destruction therefore your life shall go for his life and your people for his people.
1 Kings,20,43,And King [Ahab] of Israel went to his house resentful and sullen and came to Samaria.
1 Kings,21,1,NOW NABOTH the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel close beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria; and after these things
1 Kings,21,2,Ahab said to Naboth Give me your vineyard that I may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near my house. I will give you a better vineyard for it or if you prefer I will give you its worth in money.
1 Kings,21,3,Naboth said to Ahab The Lord forbid that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you.
1 Kings,21,4,And Ahab [already depressed by the Lord's message to him] came into his house [more] resentful and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him; for he had said I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. And he lay down on his bed turned away his face and would eat no food.
1 Kings,21,5,But Jezebel his wife came and said to him Why is your spirit so troubled that you eat no food?
1 Kings,21,6,And he said to her Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him Give me your vineyard for money; or if you prefer I will give you another vineyard for it. And he answered I will not give you my vineyard.
1 Kings,21,7,Jezebel his wife said to him Do you not govern Israel? Arise eat food and let your heart be happy. I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
1 Kings,21,8,So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal and sent them to the elders and nobles who dwelt with Naboth in his city.
1 Kings,21,9,And in the letters she said Proclaim a fast and set Naboth up high among the people.
1 Kings,21,10,And set two men base fellows before him and let them bear witness against him saying You cursed and renounced God and the king. Then carry him out and stone him to death.
1 Kings,21,11,And the men of his city the elders and the nobles who dwelt there did as Jezebel had directed in the letters sent them.
1 Kings,21,12,They proclaimed a fast and set Naboth on high among the people.
1 Kings,21,13,Two base fellows came in and sat opposite him and they charged Naboth before the people saying Naboth cursed and renounced God and the king. Then he was carried out of the city and stoned to death.
1 Kings,21,14,Then they sent to Jezebel saying Naboth has been stoned and is dead.
1 Kings,21,15,Then Jezebel said to Ahab Arise take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite which he refused to sell you for Naboth is not alive but dead.
1 Kings,21,16,When Ahab heard that he arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it.
1 Kings,21,17,Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite saying
1 Kings,21,18,Arise go down to meet Ahab king of Israel in Samaria. He is in the vineyard of Naboth where he has gone to possess it.
1 Kings,21,19,Say to him Thus says the Lord: Have you killed and also taken possession? Thus says the Lord: In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood even yours.
1 Kings,21,20,And Ahab said to Elijah Have you found me O my enemy? And he answered I have found you because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord.
1 Kings,21,21,See [says the Lord] I will bring evil on you and utterly sweep away and cut off from Ahab every male bond and free
1 Kings,21,22,And will make your household like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the household of Baasha son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked Me to anger and made Israel to sin.
1 Kings,21,23,Also the Lord said of Jezebel: The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
1 Kings,21,24,Any belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat and any who dies in the field the birds of the air shall eat.
1 Kings,21,25,For there was no one who sold himself to do evil in the sight of the Lord as did Ahab incited by his wife Jezebel.
1 Kings,21,26,He did very abominably in going after idols as had the Amorites whom the Lord cast out before the Israelites.
1 Kings,21,27,When Ahab heard those words of Elijah he tore his clothes put sackcloth on his flesh fasted lay in sackcloth and went quietly.
1 Kings,21,28,And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite saying
1 Kings,21,29,Do you see how Ahab humbles himself before Me? Because he humbles himself before Me I will not bring the evil in his lifetime but in his son's day I will bring the evil upon his house.
1 Kings,22,1,SYRIA AND Israel continued without war for three years.
1 Kings,22,2,In the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
1 Kings,22,3,And [Ahab] king of Israel said to his servants Do you know that Ramoth in Gilead is ours and we keep silence and do not take it from the king of Syria?
1 Kings,22,4,And [Ahab] said to Jehoshaphat Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead to battle? Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel I am as you are my people as your people my horses as your horses.
1 Kings,22,5,But Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel Inquire first I pray you for the word of the Lord today.
1 Kings,22,6,Then [Ahab] king of Israel gathered the prophets together about 400 men and said to them Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle or shall I hold back? And they said Go up for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.
1 Kings,22,7,Jehoshaphat said Is there not another prophet of the Lord here whom we may ask?
1 Kings,22,8,[Ahab] king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat There is yet one man Micaiah son of Imlah by whom we may inquire of the Lord but I hate him for he never prophesies good for me but evil. Jehoshaphat said Let not the king say that.
1 Kings,22,9,Then [Ahab] king of Israel told an officer Bring quickly Micaiah son of Imlah.
1 Kings,22,10,Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting in [royal] robes [or armor] each on his throne in an open place [on a threshing floor] at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
1 Kings,22,11,And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron and said Thus says the Lord: With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.
1 Kings,22,12,And all the prophets agreed saying Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper for the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand.
1 Kings,22,13,The messenger who went to call Micaiah said to him Behold now the prophets unanimously declare good to the king. Let your answer I pray you be like theirs and say what is good.
1 Kings,22,14,But Micaiah said As the Lord lives I will speak what the Lord says to me.
1 Kings,22,15,So he came to the king. King [Ahab] said Micaiah shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle or shall we hold back? And he answered Go and prosper for the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand.
1 Kings,22,16,And the king said to him How many times must I charge you to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?
1 Kings,22,17,And he said I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills as sheep that have no shepherd and the Lord said These have no master. Let them return every man to his house in peace.
1 Kings,22,18,Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat Did I not tell you that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil?
1 Kings,22,19,And Micaiah said Hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on His throne and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on His left.
1 Kings,22,20,And the Lord said Who will entice Ahab to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? One said this way another said that way.
1 Kings,22,21,Then there came forth a spirit [of whom I am about to tell] and stood before the Lord and said I will entice him.
1 Kings,22,22,The Lord said to him By what means? And he said I will go forth and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets. [The Lord] said You shall entice him and succeed also. Go forth and do it.
1 Kings,22,23,So the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets; and the Lord has spoken evil concerning you.
1 Kings,22,24,But Zedekiah son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak to you?
1 Kings,22,25,Micaiah said Behold you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.
1 Kings,22,26,[Ahab] king of Israel said Take Micaiah carry him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king's son
1 Kings,22,27,And say The king says Put this fellow in prison and feed him with bread and water of affliction until I come in peace.
1 Kings,22,28,Micaiah said If you return at all in peace the Lord has not spoken by me. He [added] Hear O people every one of you!
1 Kings,22,29,So [Ahab] king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
1 Kings,22,30,And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat I will disguise myself and enter the battle but you put on your [royal] clothing. And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.
1 Kings,22,31,But the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots Fight neither with small nor great but only with [Ahab] king of Israel.
1 Kings,22,32,And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat they said Surely it is the king of Israel. They turned to fight against him but Jehoshaphat cried out.
1 Kings,22,33,And when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel they turned back from pursuing him.
1 Kings,22,34,But a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote [Ahab] the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot Turn around and carry me out of the army for I am wounded.
1 Kings,22,35,The battle increased that day and [Ahab] the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians and at nightfall he died. And the blood of his wound flowed onto the floor of the chariot.
1 Kings,22,36,And there went a cry throughout the army about sundown saying Every man to his city and his own country
1 Kings,22,37,For the king is dead! And [Ahab] was brought to Samaria where they buried him.
1 Kings,22,38,And they washed [his] chariot by the pool of Samaria where the harlots bathed and the dogs licked up his blood as the Lord had predicted.
1 Kings,22,39,The rest of Ahab's acts all he did the ivory palace and all the cities he built are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1 Kings,22,40,So Ahab slept with his fathers. Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings,22,41,Jehoshaphat son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
1 Kings,22,42,Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
1 Kings,22,43,He walked in all the ways or customs of Asa his father never swerving from it doing right in the sight of the Lord. However the [idolatrous] high places were not taken away; for the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.
1 Kings,22,44,And Jehoshaphat made peace with Israel's king.
1 Kings,22,45,The rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat his might that he showed and how he warred are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
1 Kings,22,46,And the remnant of the sodomites (the male cult prostitutes) who remained in the days of his father Asa [Jehoshaphat] expelled from the country.
1 Kings,22,47,There was no king in Edom; a deputy was acting king.
1 Kings,22,48,Jehoshaphat ordered ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold but they did not go for the ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber.
1 Kings,22,49,When Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat Let my servants go with your servants in the ships Jehoshaphat refused.
1 Kings,22,50,Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of David his father [forefather]. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings,22,51,Ahaziah son of Ahab began his two-year reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.
1 Kings,22,52,He did evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the ways of his father [Ahab] and of his mother [Jezebel] and of Jeroboam son of Nebat who made Israel sin.
1 Kings,22,53,He served Baal and worshiped him and provoked the Lord the God of Israel to anger in all the ways his father had done.
2 Kings,1,1,MOAB REBELLED against Israel after the death of Ahab.
2 Kings,1,2,[King] Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria and lay sick. He sent messengers saying Go ask Baal-zebub the god of [Philistine] Ekron if I shall recover from this illness.
2 Kings,1,3,But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite Arise go up to meet the messengers of the king in Samaria and say to them Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?
2 Kings,1,4,Therefore the Lord says: You [Ahaziah] shall not leave the bed on which you lie but shall surely die. And Elijah departed.
2 Kings,1,5,When the messengers returned to Ahaziah he said Why have you turned back?
2 Kings,1,6,They replied A man came up to meet us who said Go back to the king who sent you and tell him Thus says the Lord: Is there no God in Israel that you send to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not leave the bed on which you lie but shall surely die.
2 Kings,1,7,The king asked What was the man like who came to meet you saying these things?
2 Kings,1,8,They answered He was a hairy man with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said It is Elijah the Tishbite.
2 Kings,1,9,Then the king sent to Elijah a captain of fifty men with his fifty [to seize him]. He found Elijah sitting on a hilltop and said Man of God the king says Come down.
2 Kings,1,10,Elijah said to the captain of fifty If I am a man of God then let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty. And fire fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
2 Kings,1,11,Again King [Ahaziah] sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he said to Elijah Man of God the king has said Come down quickly!
2 Kings,1,12,And Elijah answered If I am a man of God let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
2 Kings,1,13,Ahaziah sent again a captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up and fell on his knees before Elijah and besought him and said to him O man of God I pray you let my life and the lives of these fifty your servants be precious in your sight.
2 Kings,1,14,Behold fire came down from heaven and burned up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties. Therefore let my life now be precious in your sight.
2 Kings,1,15,The angel of the Lord said to Elijah Go down with him; do not be afraid of him. So he arose and went with him to the king.
2 Kings,1,16,Elijah said to [King] Ahaziah Thus says the Lord: Since you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub god of Ekron is it because there is no God in Israel of Whom to inquire His word? Therefore you shall not leave the bed on which you lie but shall surely die.
2 Kings,1,17,So Ahaziah died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken. Joram [also a son of Ahab] reigned in Israel in his stead in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah because Ahaziah had no son [but his brother].
2 Kings,1,18,Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings,2,1,WHEN THE Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind Elijah and Elisha were going from Gilgal.
2 Kings,2,2,And Elijah said to Elisha Tarry here I pray you for the Lord has sent me to Bethel. But Elisha replied As the Lord lives and as your soul lives I will not leave you. So they went down to Bethel.
2 Kings,2,3,The prophets' sons who were at Bethel came to Elisha and said Do you know that the Lord will take your master away from you today? He said Yes I know it; hold your peace.
2 Kings,2,4,Elijah said to him Elisha tarry here I pray you for the Lord has sent me to Jericho. But he said As the Lord lives and as your soul lives I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho.
2 Kings,2,5,The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said Do you know that the Lord will take your master away from you today? And he answered Yes I know it; hold your peace.
2 Kings,2,6,Elijah said to him Tarry here I pray you for the Lord has sent me to the Jordan. But he said As the Lord lives and as your soul lives I will not leave you. And the two of them went on.
2 Kings,2,7,Fifty men of the sons of the prophets also went and stood [to watch] afar off; and the two of them stood by the Jordan.
2 Kings,2,8,And Elijah took his mantle and rolled it up and struck the waters and they divided this way and that so that the two of them went over on dry ground.
2 Kings,2,9,And when they had gone over Elijah said to Elisha Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken from you. And Elisha said I pray you let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.
2 Kings,2,10,He said You have asked a hard thing. However if you see me when I am taken from you it shall be so for you--but if not it shall not be so.
2 Kings,2,11,As they still went on and talked behold a chariot of fire and horses of fire parted the two of them and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
2 Kings,2,12,And Elisha saw it and he cried My father my father! The chariot of Israel and its horsemen! And he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.
2 Kings,2,13,He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
2 Kings,2,14,And he took the mantle that fell from Elijah and struck the waters and said Where is the Lord the God of Elijah? And when he had struck the waters they parted this way and that and Elisha went over.
2 Kings,2,15,When the sons of the prophets who were [watching] at Jericho saw him they said The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha. And they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
2 Kings,2,16,And they said to him Behold now there are among your servants fifty strong men; let them go we pray you and seek your master. It may be that the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up and cast him on some mountain or into some valley. And he said You shall not send.
2 Kings,2,17,But when they urged him till he was embarrassed he said Send. So they sent fifty men who sought for three days but did not find him.
2 Kings,2,18,When they returned to Elisha who had waited at Jericho he said to them Did I not tell you Do not go?
2 Kings,2,19,And the men of the city said to Elisha Behold inhabiting of this city is pleasant as my lord sees but the water is bad and the locality causes miscarriage and barrenness [in all animals].
2 Kings,2,20,He said Bring me a new bowl and put salt [the symbol of God's purifying power] in it. And they brought it to him.
2 Kings,2,21,Then Elisha went to the spring of the waters and cast the salt in it and said Thus says the Lord: I [not the salt] have healed these waters; there shall not be any more death miscarriage or barrenness [and bereavement] because of it.
2 Kings,2,22,So the waters were healed to this day as Elisha had said.
2 Kings,2,23,He went up from Jericho to Bethel. On the way young [maturing and accountable] boys came out of the city and mocked him and said to him Go up [in a whirlwind] you baldhead! Go up you baldhead!
2 Kings,2,24,And he turned around and looked at them and called a curse down on them in the name of the Lord. And two she-bears came out of the woods and ripped up forty-two of the boys.
2 Kings,2,25,Elisha went from there to Mount Carmel and from there he returned to Samaria.
2 Kings,3,1,JORAM SON of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah and reigned twelve years.
2 Kings,3,2,He did evil in the sight of the Lord but not like his father and mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.
2 Kings,3,3,Yet he clung to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat which made Israel to sin; he departed not from them.
2 Kings,3,4,Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster and paid in tribute to the king of Israel [annually] 100000 lambs and 100000 rams with the wool.
2 Kings,3,5,But when Ahab died the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
2 Kings,3,6,So King Joram went out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel.
2 Kings,3,7,And he sent to Jehoshaphat king of Judah saying The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to war against Moab? And he said I will go; I am as you are my people as your people my horses as your horses.
2 Kings,3,8,Joram said Which way shall we go up? Jehoshaphat answered The way through the Wilderness of Edom.
2 Kings,3,9,So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. They made a circuit of seven days' journey but there was no water for the army or for the animals following them.
2 Kings,3,10,Then the king of Israel said Alas! The Lord has called [us] three kings together to be delivered into Moab's hand!
2 Kings,3,11,But Jehoshaphat said Is there no prophet of the Lord here by whom we may inquire of the Lord? One of the king of Israel's servants answered Elisha son of Shaphat who served Elijah is here.
2 Kings,3,12,Jehoshaphat said The word of the Lord is with him. So Joram king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to Elisha.
2 Kings,3,13,And Elisha said to the king of Israel What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your [wicked] father Ahab and your [wicked] mother Jezebel. But the king of Israel said to him No for the Lord has called [us] three kings together to be delivered into the hand of Moab.
2 Kings,3,14,And Elisha said As the Lord of hosts lives before Whom I stand surely were it not that I respect the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah I would neither look at you nor see you [King Joram].
2 Kings,3,15,But now bring me a minstrel. And while the minstrel played the hand and power of the Lord came upon [Elisha].
2 Kings,3,16,And he said Thus says the Lord: Make this [dry] brook bed full of trenches.
2 Kings,3,17,For thus says the Lord: You shall not see wind or rain yet that ravine shall be filled with water so you your cattle and your beasts [of burden] may drink.
2 Kings,3,18,This is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord. He will deliver the Moabites also into your hands.
2 Kings,3,19,You shall smite every fenced city and every choice city and shall fell every good tree and stop all wells of water and mar every good piece of land with stones.
2 Kings,3,20,In the morning when the sacrifice was offered behold there came water by the way of Edom and the country was filled with water.
2 Kings,3,21,When all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them all who were able to put on armor young and old gathered and drew up at the border.
2 Kings,3,22,When they rose up early next morning and the sun shone upon the water the Moabites saw the water across from them as red as blood.
2 Kings,3,23,And they said This is blood; the kings have surely been fighting and have slain one another. Now then Moab to the spoil!
2 Kings,3,24,But when they came to the camp of Israel the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites so that they fled before them. And they went forward slaying the Moabites as they went.
2 Kings,3,25,They beat down the cities [walls] and on every good piece of land every man cast a stone covering it [with stones]. And they stopped all the springs of water and felled all the good trees until only the stones [of the walls of Moab's capital city] of Kir-hareseth were left standing and the slingers surrounded and took it.
2 Kings,3,26,And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was against him he took with him 700 swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom but they could not.
2 Kings,3,27,Then he [Moab's king] took his eldest son who was to reign in his stead and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall [in full view of the horrified enemy kings]. And there was great indignation wrath and bitterness against Israel; and they [his allies Judah and Edom] withdrew from [Joram] and returned to their own land.
2 Kings,4,1,NOW THE wife of a son of the prophets cried to Elisha Your servant my husband is dead and you know that your servant feared the Lord. But the creditor has come to take my two sons to be his slaves.
2 Kings,4,2,Elisha said to her What shall I do for you? Tell me what have you [of sale value] in the house? She said Your handmaid has nothing in the house except a jar of oil.
2 Kings,4,3,Then he said Go around and borrow vessels from all your neighbors empty vessels--and not a few.
2 Kings,4,4,And when you come in shut the door upon you and your sons. Then pour out [the oil you have] into all those vessels setting aside each one when it is full.
2 Kings,4,5,So she went from him and shut the door upon herself and her sons who brought to her the vessels as she poured the oil.
2 Kings,4,6,When the vessels were all full she said to her son Bring me another vessel. And he said to her There is not a one left. Then the oil stopped multiplying.
2 Kings,4,7,Then she came and told the man of God. He said Go sell the oil and pay your debt and you and your sons live on the rest.
2 Kings,4,8,One day Elisha went on to Shunem where a rich and influential woman lived who insisted on his eating a meal. Afterward whenever he passed by he stopped there for a meal.
2 Kings,4,9,And she said to her husband Behold now I perceive that this is a holy man of God who passes by continually.
2 Kings,4,10,Let us make a small chamber on the [housetop] and put there for him a bed a table a chair and a lamp. Then whenever he comes to us he can go [up the outside stairs and rest] here.
2 Kings,4,11,One day he came and turned into the chamber and lay there.
2 Kings,4,12,And he said to Gehazi his servant Call this Shunammite. When he had called her she stood before him.
2 Kings,4,13,And he said to Gehazi Say now to her You have been most painstakingly and reverently concerned for us; what is to be done for you? Would you like to be spoken for to the king or to the commander of the army? She answered I dwell among my own people [they are sufficient].
2 Kings,4,14,Later Elisha said What then is to be done for her? Gehazi answered She has no child and her husband is old.
2 Kings,4,15,He said Call her. [Gehazi] called her and she stood in the doorway.
2 Kings,4,16,Elisha said At this season when the time comes round you shall embrace a son. She said No my lord you man of God do not lie to your handmaid.
2 Kings,4,17,But the woman conceived and bore a son at that season the following year as Elisha had said to her.
2 Kings,4,18,When the child had grown he went out one day to his father with the reapers.
2 Kings,4,19,But he said to his father My head my head! The man said to his servant Carry him to his mother.
2 Kings,4,20,And when he was brought to his mother he sat on her knees till noon and then died.
2 Kings,4,21,And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God and shut the door upon him and went out.
2 Kings,4,22,And she called to her husband and said Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys that I may go quickly to the man of God and come back again.
2 Kings,4,23,And he said Why go to him today? It is neither the New Moon nor the Sabbath. And she said It will be all right.
2 Kings,4,24,Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant Ride fast; do not slacken your pace for me unless I tell you.
2 Kings,4,25,So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her afar off he said to Gehazi his servant Behold yonder is that Shunammite.
2 Kings,4,26,Run to meet her and say Is it well with you? Well with your husband? Well with the child? And she answered It is well.
2 Kings,4,27,When she came to the mountain to the man of God she clung to his feet. Gehazi came to thrust her away but the man of God said Let her alone for her soul is bitter and vexed within her and the Lord has hid it from me and has not told me.
2 Kings,4,28,Then she said Did I desire a son of my lord? Did I not say Do not deceive me?
2 Kings,4,29,Then he said to Gehazi Gird up your loins and take my staff in your hand and go lay my staff on the face of the child. If you meet any man do not salute him. If he salutes you do not answer him.
2 Kings,4,30,The mother of the child said As the Lord lives and as my soul lives I will not leave you. And he arose and followed her.
2 Kings,4,31,Gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff on the child's face but the boy neither spoke nor heard. So he went back to meet Elisha and said to him The child has not awakened.
2 Kings,4,32,When Elisha arrived in the house the child was dead and laid upon his bed.
2 Kings,4,33,So he went in shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the Lord.
2 Kings,4,34,He went up and lay on the child put his mouth on his mouth his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands. And as he stretched himself on him and embraced him the child's flesh became warm.
2 Kings,4,35,Then he returned and walked in the house to and fro and went up again and stretched himself upon him. And the child sneezed seven times and then opened his eyes.
2 Kings,4,36,Then [Elisha] called Gehazi and said Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she came he said Take up your son.
2 Kings,4,37,She came and fell at his feet bowing herself to the ground. Then she took up her son and went out.
2 Kings,4,38,Elisha came back to Gilgal during a famine in the land. The sons of the prophets were sitting before him and he said to his servant Set on the big pot and cook pottage for the sons of the prophets.
2 Kings,4,39,Then one went into the field to gather herbs and gathered from a wild vine his lap full of wild gourds and returned and cut them up into the pot of pottage for they were unknown to them.
2 Kings,4,40,So they poured it out for the men to eat. But as they ate of the pottage they cried out O man of God there is death in the pot! And they could not eat it.
2 Kings,4,41,But he said Bring meal [as a symbol of God's healing power]. And he cast it into the pot and said Pour it out for the people that they may eat. Then there was no harm in the pot.
2 Kings,4,42,[At another time] a man from Baal-shalisha came and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain [in the husk] in his sack. And Elisha said Give to the men that they may eat.
2 Kings,4,43,His servant said How am I to set [only] this before a hundred [hungry] men? He said Give to the men that they may eat. For thus says the Lord: They shall be fed and have some left.
2 Kings,4,44,So he set it before them and they ate and left some as the Lord had said.
2 Kings,5,1,NAAMAN COMMANDER of the army of the king of Syria was a great man with his master accepted [and acceptable] because by him the Lord had given victory to Syria. He was also a mighty man of valor but he was a leper.
2 Kings,5,2,The Syrians had gone out in bands and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid and she waited on Naaman's wife.
2 Kings,5,3,She said to her mistress Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! For he would heal him of his leprosy.
2 Kings,5,4,[Naaman] went in and told his king Thus and thus said the maid from Israel.
2 Kings,5,5,And the king of Syria said Go now and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed and took with him ten talents of silver 6000 shekels of gold and ten changes of raiment.
2 Kings,5,6,And he brought the letter to the king of Israel. It said When this letter comes to you I will with it have sent to you my servant Naaman that you may cure him of leprosy.
2 Kings,5,7,When the king of Israel read the letter he rent his clothes and said Am I God to kill and to make alive that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? Just consider and see how he is seeking a quarrel with me.
2 Kings,5,8,When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes he sent to the king asking Why have you rent your clothes? Let Naaman come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
2 Kings,5,9,So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stopped at Elisha's door.
2 Kings,5,10,Elisha sent a messenger to him saying Go and wash in the Jordan seven times and your flesh shall be restored and you shall be clean.
2 Kings,5,11,But Naaman was angry and went away and said Behold I thought he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and wave his hand over the place and heal the leper.
2 Kings,5,12,Are not Abana and Pharpar the rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.
2 Kings,5,13,And his servants came near and said to him My father if the prophet had bid you to do some great thing would you not have done it? How much rather then when he says to you Wash and be clean?
2 Kings,5,14,Then he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan as the man of God had said and his flesh was restored like that of a little child and he was clean.
2 Kings,5,15,Then Naaman returned to the man of God he and all his company and stood before him. He said Behold now I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel. So now accept a gift from your servant.
2 Kings,5,16,Elisha said As the Lord lives before Whom I stand I will accept none. He urged him to take it but Elisha refused.
2 Kings,5,17,Naaman said Then I pray you let there be given to me your servant two mules' burden of earth. For your servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods but only to the Lord.
2 Kings,5,18,In this thing may the Lord pardon your servant: when my master [the king] goes into the house of [his god] Rimmon to worship there and he leans on my hand and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon may the Lord pardon your servant in this thing.
2 Kings,5,19,Elisha said to him Go in peace. So Naaman departed from him a little way.
2 Kings,5,20,But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God said Behold my master spared this Naaman the Syrian in not receiving from his hands what he brought. But as the Lord lives I will run after him and get something from him.
2 Kings,5,21,So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him he lighted down from the chariot to meet him and said Is all well?
2 Kings,5,22,And he said All is well. My master has sent me to say There have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets. I pray you give them a talent of silver and two changes of garments.
2 Kings,5,23,And Naaman said Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of garments and laid them upon two of his servants and they bore them before Gehazi.
2 Kings,5,24,When he came to the hill he took them from their hands and put them in the house; and he sent the men away and they left.
2 Kings,5,25,He went in and stood before his master. Elisha said Where have you been Gehazi? He said Your servant went nowhere.
2 Kings,5,26,Elisha said to him Did not my spirit go with you when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Was it a time to accept money garments olive orchards vineyards sheep oxen menservants and maidservants?
2 Kings,5,27,Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cleave to you and to your offspring forever. And Gehazi went from his presence a leper as white as snow.
2 Kings,6,1,THE SONS of the prophets said to Elisha Look now the place where we live before you is too small for us.
2 Kings,6,2,Let us go to the Jordan and each man get there a [house] beam; and let us make us a place there where we may dwell. And he answered Go.
2 Kings,6,3,One said Be pleased to go with your servants. He answered I will go.
2 Kings,6,4,So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan they cut down trees.
2 Kings,6,5,But as one was felling his beam the axhead fell into the water; and he cried Alas my master for it was borrowed!
2 Kings,6,6,The man of God said Where did it fall? When shown the place Elisha cut off a stick and threw it in there and the iron floated.
2 Kings,6,7,He said Pick it up. And he put out his hand and took it.
2 Kings,6,8,When the king of Syria was warring against Israel after counseling with his servants he said In such and such a place shall be my camp.
2 Kings,6,9,Then the man of God sent to the king of Israel saying Beware that you pass not such a place for the Syrians are coming down there.
2 Kings,6,10,Then the king of Israel sent to the place of which [Elisha] told and warned him; and thus he protected and saved himself there repeatedly.
2 Kings,6,11,Therefore the mind of the king of Syria was greatly troubled by this thing. He called his servants and said Will you show me who of us is for the king of Israel?
2 Kings,6,12,One of his servants said None my lord O king; but Elisha the prophet who is in Israel tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.
2 Kings,6,13,He said Go and see where he is that I may send and seize him. And it was told him He is in Dothan.
2 Kings,6,14,So [the Syrian king] sent there horses chariots and a great army. They came by night and surrounded the city.
2 Kings,6,15,When the servant of the man of God rose early and went out behold an army with horses and chariots was around the city. Elisha's servant said to him Alas my master! What shall we do?
2 Kings,6,16,[Elisha] answered Fear not; for those with us are more than those with them.
2 Kings,6,17,Then Elisha prayed Lord I pray You open his eyes that he may see. And the Lord opened the young man's eyes and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
2 Kings,6,18,And when the Syrians came down to him Elisha prayed to the Lord Smite this people with blindness I pray You. And God smote them with blindness as Elisha asked.
2 Kings,6,19,Elisha said to the Syrians This is not the way or the city. Follow me and I will bring you to the man whom you seek. And he led them to Samaria.
2 Kings,6,20,And when they had come into Samaria Elisha said Lord open the eyes of these men that they may see. And the Lord opened their eyes and they saw. Behold they were in the midst of Samaria!
2 Kings,6,21,When the king of Israel saw them he said to Elisha My father shall I slay them? Shall I slay them?
2 Kings,6,22,[Elisha] answered You shall not slay them. Would you slay those you have taken captive with your sword and bow? Set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink and return to their master.
2 Kings,6,23,So [the king] prepared great provision for them and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away and they went to their master. And the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
2 Kings,6,24,Afterward Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered his whole army and went up and besieged Samaria
2 Kings,6,25,And a great famine came to Samaria. They besieged it until a donkey's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver and a fourth of a kab of dove's dung [a wild vegetable] for five shekels of silver.
2 Kings,6,26,As the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall a woman cried to him Help my lord O king!
2 Kings,6,27,He said [For] if he does not help you [No let the Lord help you!] from where can I get you help? Out of the threshing floor or out of the winepress?
2 Kings,6,28,And the king said to her What ails you? She answered This woman said to me Give me your son so we may eat him today and we will eat my son tomorrow.
2 Kings,6,29,So we boiled my son and ate him. The next day I said to her Give your son so we may eat him but she had hidden her son.
2 Kings,6,30,When the king heard the woman's words he rent his clothes. As he went on upon the wall the people looked and behold he wore sackcloth inside on his flesh.
2 Kings,6,31,Then he said May God do so to me and more also if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day!
2 Kings,6,32,Now Elisha sat in his house and the elders sat with him. And the king sent a man from before him [to behead Elisha]. But before the messenger arrived Elisha said to the elders See how this son of [Jezebel] a murderer is sending to remove my head? Look when the messenger comes shut the door and hold it fast against him. Is not the sound of his master's feet [just] behind him?
2 Kings,6,33,And while Elisha was talking with them behold [the messenger] came to him [and then the king came also]. And [the relenting king] said This evil is from the Lord! Why should I any longer wait [expecting Him to withdraw His punishment? What Elisha can be done now]?
2 Kings,7,1,THEN ELISHA said Hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord: Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour will sell for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria!
2 Kings,7,2,Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said If the Lord should make windows in heaven could this thing be? But Elisha said You shall see it with your own eyes but you shall not eat of it.
2 Kings,7,3,Now four men who were lepers were at the entrance of the city's gate; and they said to one another Why do we sit here until we die?
2 Kings,7,4,If we say We will enter the city--then the famine is in the city and we shall die there; and if we sit still here we die also. So now come let us go over to the army of the Syrians. If they spare us alive we shall live; and if they kill us we shall but die.
2 Kings,7,5,So they arose in the twilight and went to the Syrian camp. But when they came to the edge of the camp no man was there.
2 Kings,7,6,For the Lord had made the Syrian army hear a noise of chariots and horses the noise of a great army. They had said to one another The king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to come upon us.
2 Kings,7,7,So the Syrians arose and fled in the twilight and left their tents horses donkeys even the camp as it was and fled for their lives.
2 Kings,7,8,And when these lepers came to the edge of the camp they went into one tent and ate and drank and carried away silver gold and clothing and went and hid them [in the darkness]. Then they entered another tent and carried from there also and went and hid it.
2 Kings,7,9,Then they said one to another We are not doing right. This is a day of [glad] good news and we are silent and do not speak up! If we wait until daylight some punishment will come upon us [for not reporting at once]. So now come let us go and tell the king's household.
2 Kings,7,10,So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city. They told them We came to the camp of the Syrians and behold there was neither sight nor sound of man there--only the horses and donkeys tied and the tents as they were.
2 Kings,7,11,Then the gatekeepers called out and it was told to the king's household within.
2 Kings,7,12,And the king rose in the night and said to his servants I will tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the open country thinking When they come out of the city we shall take them alive and get into the city.
2 Kings,7,13,One of his servants said Let some men take five of the remaining horses; [if they are caught and killed] they will be no worse off than all the multitude of Israel left in the city to be consumed. Let us send and see.
2 Kings,7,14,So they took two chariot horses and the king sent them after the Syrian army saying Go and see.
2 Kings,7,15,They went after them to the Jordan. All the way was strewn with clothing and equipment which the Syrians had cast away in their flight. And the messengers returned and told the king.
2 Kings,7,16,Then the people went out and plundered the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel as the Lord had spoken [through Elisha].
2 Kings,7,17,The king had appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate and the [starving] people trampled him in the gate [as they struggled to get through for food] and he died as the man of God had foretold when the king came down to him.
2 Kings,7,18,When the man of God had told the king Two measures of barley shall sell for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria
2 Kings,7,19,The captain had told the man of God If the Lord should make windows in heaven could such a thing be? And he said You shall see it with your own eyes but you shall not eat of it.
2 Kings,7,20,And so it was fulfilled to him for the people trampled on him in the gate and he died.
2 Kings,8,1,NOW ELISHA had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life Arise and go with your household and sojourn wherever you can for the Lord has called for a famine and moreover it will come upon the land for seven years.
2 Kings,8,2,So the woman arose and did as the man of God had said. She went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
2 Kings,8,3,At the end of the seven years the woman returned from the land of the Philistines and she went to appeal to the king for her house and land.
2 Kings,8,4,The king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God saying Tell me all the great things Elisha has done.
2 Kings,8,5,And as Gehazi was telling the king how [Elisha] had restored the dead to life behold the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and land. And Gehazi said My lord O king this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha brought back to life.
2 Kings,8,6,When the king asked the woman she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer saying Restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now.
2 Kings,8,7,Elisha came to Damascus and Ben-hadad king of Syria was sick; and he was told The man of God has come here.
2 Kings,8,8,And the king said to Hazael Take a present in your hand and go meet the man of God and inquire of the Lord by him saying Shall I recover from this disease?
2 Kings,8,9,So Hazael went to meet Elisha and took a present with him of every good thing of Damascus forty camel loads and came and stood before him and said Your son Ben-hadad king of Syria has sent me to you asking Shall I recover from this disease?
2 Kings,8,10,And Elisha said Go say to him You shall certainly recover; but the Lord has shown me that he shall certainly die.
2 Kings,8,11,Elisha stared steadily at him until Hazael was embarrassed. And the man of God wept.
2 Kings,8,12,And Hazael said Why do you weep my lord? He answered Because I know the evil that you will do to the Israelites. You will burn their strongholds slay their young men with the sword dash their infants in pieces and rip up their pregnant women.
2 Kings,8,13,And Hazael said What is your servant only a dog that he should do this monstrous thing? And Elisha answered The Lord has shown me that you will be king over Syria.
2 Kings,8,14,Then [Hazael] departed from Elisha and came to his master who said to him What did Elisha say to you? And he answered He told me you would surely recover.
2 Kings,8,15,But the next day Hazael took the bedspread and dipped it in water and spread it on [the Syrian king's] face so that he died. And Hazael reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,8,16,In the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.
2 Kings,8,17,He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
2 Kings,8,18,He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel as did the house of Ahab for [Athaliah] the daughter of Ahab was his wife. He did evil in the sight of the Lord.
2 Kings,8,19,Yet for David His servant's sake the Lord would not destroy Judah for He promised to give him and his sons a lamp forever.
2 Kings,8,20,In his days Edom revolted from the rule of Judah and set up a king over themselves.
2 Kings,8,21,So Jehoram [of Judah] went over to Zair with all his chariots. He and his chariot commanders rose up by night and slew the Edomites who had surrounded them; and [escaping] his army fled home.
2 Kings,8,22,So Edom revolted from the rule of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
2 Kings,8,23,The rest of the acts of Jehoram and all that he did are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings,8,24,Jehoram slept with his fathers and was buried with [them] in the City of David. Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,8,25,In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
2 Kings,8,26,Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.
2 Kings,8,27,He walked in the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the Lord as did the house of Ahab for his father was son-in-law of Ahab.
2 Kings,8,28,Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
2 Kings,8,29,King Joram returned to Jezreel to be healed of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was sick.
2 Kings,9,1,AND ELISHA the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him Gird up your loins take this flask of oil in your hand and go to Ramoth-gilead.
2 Kings,9,2,When you arrive look there for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi; and go in and have him arise from among his brethren and lead him to an inner chamber.
2 Kings,9,3,Then take the cruse of oil and pour it on his head and say Thus says the Lord: I have anointed you king over Israel. Then open the door and flee; do not tarry.
2 Kings,9,4,So the young man the young prophet went to Ramoth-gilead.
2 Kings,9,5,And when he came the captains of the army were sitting outside; and he said I have a message for you O captain. Jehu said To which of us? And he said To you O captain.
2 Kings,9,6,And Jehu arose and they went into the house. And the prophet poured the oil on Jehu's head and said to him Thus says the Lord the God of Israel: I have anointed you king over the people of the Lord even over Israel.
2 Kings,9,7,You shall strike down the house of Ahab your master that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets and of all the servants of the Lord [who have died] at the hands of Jezebel.
2 Kings,9,8,For the whole house of Ahab shall perish and I will cut off from Ahab every male bond or free in Israel.
2 Kings,9,9,I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah.
2 Kings,9,10,And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel and none shall bury her. And he opened the door and fled. [Fulfilled in II Kings 9:33-37.]
2 Kings,9,11,When Jehu came out to the servants of his master one said to him Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you? And he said to them You know that class of man and what he would say.
2 Kings,9,12,And they said That is false; tell us now. And he said Thus and thus he spoke to me saying Thus says the Lord: I have anointed you king over Israel.
2 Kings,9,13,Then they hastily took every man his garment and put it [for a cushion] under Jehu on the top of the [outside] stairs and blew with trumpets saying Jehu is king!
2 Kings,9,14,So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram [to dethrone and slay him]. Now Joram was holding Ramoth-gilead he and all Israel against Hazael king of Syria
2 Kings,9,15,But King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Jehu said If this is your mind let no one make his escape from the city [Ramoth-gilead] to go and tell it in Jezreel [the capital].
2 Kings,9,16,So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.
2 Kings,9,17,A watchman on the tower in Jezreel spied the company of Jehu as he came and said I see a company. And Joram said Send a horseman to meet them and have him ask Do you come in peace?
2 Kings,9,18,So one on horseback went to meet him and said Thus says the king: Is it peace? And Jehu said What have you to do with peace? Rein in behind me. And the watchman reported The messenger came to them but he does not return.
2 Kings,9,19,Then Joram sent out a second man on horseback who came to them and said Thus says the king: Is it peace? Jehu replied What have you to do with peace? Ride behind me.
2 Kings,9,20,And the watchman reported He came to them but does not return; also the driving is like the driving of Jehu son of Nimshi for he drives furiously.
2 Kings,9,21,Joram said Make ready. When his chariot was made ready Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out each in his chariot. Thus they went out to meet Jehu and met him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite.
2 Kings,9,22,When Joram saw Jehu he said Is it peace Jehu? And he answered How can peace exist as long as the fornications of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?
2 Kings,9,23,Then Joram reined about and fled and he said to Ahaziah Treachery Ahaziah!
2 Kings,9,24,But Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his shoulders; and the arrow went out through his heart and he sank down in his chariot.
2 Kings,9,25,Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain Take [Joram] up and cast him in the plot of Naboth the Jezreelite's field; for remember how when I and you rode together after Ahab his father the Lord uttered this prophecy against him:
2 Kings,9,26,As surely as I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons says the Lord I will repay you on this plot of ground says the Lord. Now therefore take and cast Joram into the plot of ground [of Naboth] as the word of the Lord said.
2 Kings,9,27,When Ahaziah king of Judah saw this he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed him and said Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the ascent to Gur which is by Ibleam. And [Ahaziah] fled to Megiddo and died there.
2 Kings,9,28,His servants took him in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his sepulcher with his fathers in the City of David.
2 Kings,9,29,In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab Ahaziah's reign over Judah began.
2 Kings,9,30,Now when Jehu came to Jezreel Jezebel heard of it and she painted her eyes and beautified her head and looked out of [an upper] window.
2 Kings,9,31,And as Jehu entered in at the gate she said [Have you come in] peace you Zimri who slew his master?
2 Kings,9,32,Jehu lifted up his face to the window and said Who is on my side? Who? And two or three eunuchs looked out at him.
2 Kings,9,33,And he said Throw her down! So they threw her down and some of her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses and he drove over her.
2 Kings,9,34,When he came in he ate and drank and said See now to this cursed woman and bury her for she is a king's daughter.
2 Kings,9,35,They went to bury her but they found nothing left of her except the skull feet and palms of her hands.
2 Kings,9,36,They came again and told Jehu. He said This is the word of the Lord which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel.
2 Kings,9,37,The corpse of Jezebel shall be like dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel so that they shall not say This is Jezebel.
2 Kings,10,1,AHAB HAD seventy [grandsons] in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them from Jezreel to the rulers of Samaria to the elders and to those who brought up Ahab's [grandsons] saying
2 Kings,10,2,Now as soon as this letter comes to you seeing your master [Joram's] sons are with you and also chariots and horses a fortified city and weapons
2 Kings,10,3,Select the best and most fit of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne; and fight for your master's house.
2 Kings,10,4,But they were exceedingly afraid and reasoned The two kings could not stand before [Jehu]; how then can we stand?
2 Kings,10,5,And he who was over the household he who was over the city the elders also and the guardians and tutors sent to Jehu saying We are your servants and will do all that you bid us; [but] we will not make any man king; do what is good in your eyes.
2 Kings,10,6,Then [Jehu] wrote a second letter to them saying If you are with me and will obey me take the heads of your master [Joram's] sons and come to me at Jezreel by tomorrow this time. Now the [dead] king's sons seventy persons were with the great men of the city who were bringing them up.
2 Kings,10,7,When the letter came to these men they took the king's sons and slew them seventy persons and put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel.
2 Kings,10,8,When a messenger came and told him They have brought the heads of the king's sons he said Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the city gate until morning.
2 Kings,10,9,The next morning he went out and stood and said to all the people You are just and innocent. Behold I conspired against my master and slew him but who smote all these?
2 Kings,10,10,Know now that nothing which the Lord spoke concerning the house of Ahab shall be unfulfilled or ineffective; for the Lord has done what He said through His servant Elijah.
2 Kings,10,11,So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel and all his great men his familiar friends and his priests until he left him none remaining.
2 Kings,10,12,And he arose and went to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house of the shepherds on the way
2 Kings,10,13,Jehu met the kinsmen of Ahaziah king of Judah and said Who are you? They answered We are the kinsmen of Ahaziah and we came down to visit the royal princes and the sons of [Jezebel] the queen mother.
2 Kings,10,14,He said Take them alive. And they did so and slew them at the cistern of the shearing house forty-two men; he left none of them.
2 Kings,10,15,When Jehu left there he met Jehonadab son of Rechab coming to meet him. He saluted him and said to him Is your heart right as my heart is with yours? Jehonadab answered It is. [Jehu said] If it is give me your hand. He gave him his hand and Jehu took him up into the chariot.
2 Kings,10,16,And he said Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord. So they made [the Rechabite] ride in Jehu's chariot.
2 Kings,10,17,When Jehu came to Samaria he slew all who remained of Ahab's family in Samaria till he had destroyed them all according to what the Lord said to Elijah.
2 Kings,10,18,Jehu assembled all the people and said to them Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much.
2 Kings,10,19,So call to me all the prophets of Baal all his worshipers and all his priests. Let none be missing for I have a great sacrifice to make to Baal; whoever is missing shall not live. But Jehu did it with trickery intending to destroy the Baal worshipers.
2 Kings,10,20,Jehu said Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.
2 Kings,10,21,Jehu sent through all Israel and all the worshipers of Baal came; not a man failed to come. They went to the house or temple of Baal filling it from one end to the other.
2 Kings,10,22,And he said to the man over the vestry Bring vestments for all the worshipers of Baal. And he brought them vestments.
2 Kings,10,23,Then Jehu with Jehonadab son of Rechab went into the house of Baal and said to the worshipers of Baal Search and see that there are here with you none of the servants of the Lord--but Baal worshipers only.
2 Kings,10,24,And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings Jehu appointed eighty men outside and said If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape he who lets him go shall forfeit his own life for his life.
2 Kings,10,25,As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering Jehu said to the guards and to the officers Go in and slay them; let none escape. And they smote them with the sword; and the guards or runners [before the king] and the officers threw their bodies out and went into the inner dwelling of the house of Baal.
2 Kings,10,26,They brought out the pillars or obelisks of the house of Baal and burned them.
2 Kings,10,27,They broke down the pillars of Baal and the house of Baal and made it [forever unclean] a privy to this day.
2 Kings,10,28,Thus Jehu rooted Baal out of Israel.
2 Kings,10,29,But Jehu did not give up the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat by which he made Israel to sin that is the golden calves at Bethel and Dan.
2 Kings,10,30,And the Lord said to Jehu Because you have executed well what is right in My eyes and have done to the house of Ahab as I willed your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on Israel's throne. [Fulfilled in II Kings 15:12.]
2 Kings,10,31,But Jehu paid no attention to walking in the law of the Lord the God of Israel with all his heart. He did not quit the sins with which Jeroboam made Israel to sin.
2 Kings,10,32,[So] in those days the Lord began to cut off parts of Israel. Hazael [of Syria] defeated them in all the [across the Jordan] territory of Israel
2 Kings,10,33,From the Jordan east all the land of Gilead the Gadites Reubenites and Manassites from Aroer which is by the Valley of the Arnon even Gilead and Bashan.
2 Kings,10,34,The rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did and all his might are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings,10,35,Jehu slept with his fathers. They buried him in Samaria. Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,10,36,The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
2 Kings,11,1,WHEN ATHALIAH the mother of [King] Ahaziah [of Judah] saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the royal descendants.
2 Kings,11,2,But Jehosheba the daughter of King Jehoram [half] sister of Ahaziah stole Joash son of Ahaziah from among the king's sons who were to be slain even him and his nurse and hid them from Athaliah in an inner storeroom for beds; so he was not slain.
2 Kings,11,3,Joash was with his nurse hidden in the house of the Lord for six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.
2 Kings,11,4,In the seventh year Jehoiada [the priest Jehosheba's husband] sent for the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guards or runners and brought them to him to the house of the Lord and made a covenant with them and took an oath from them in the house of the Lord and showed them the king's [hidden] son.
2 Kings,11,5,And he commanded them saying This is the thing you shall do: a third of you who come in on the Sabbath shall keep watch of the king's house
2 Kings,11,6,A third shall be at the gate Sur and a third at the gate behind the guard. So you shall keep watch of the palace [from three places] and be a barrier.
2 Kings,11,7,And two divisions of all you who should go off duty on the Sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord to [protect] the king.
2 Kings,11,8,You shall surround the [little] king every man with his weapons in his hand. And let anyone who breaks through the ranks be put to death. You be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in.
2 Kings,11,9,The captains over the hundreds did all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men who were to come on duty on the Sabbath with those who should go off duty on the Sabbath and came to Jehoiada the priest.
2 Kings,11,10,To the captains over hundreds the priest gave the spears and shields that had been King David's which were in the house of the Lord.
2 Kings,11,11,And the guards stood every man with his weapons in his hand from the right corner to the left corner of the temple area along by the altar [in the court] and the temple proper.
2 Kings,11,12,And Jehoiada brought out the king's son and put the crown on him and gave him the Testimony [the Mosaic Law]; and they proclaimed him king and anointed him and they clapped their hands and said Long live the king!
2 Kings,11,13,When Athaliah heard the noise of the guards and the people she went into the house of the Lord to the people.
2 Kings,11,14,When she looked there stood the king [on the platform] by the pillar as was customary [on such occasions] and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king with all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets. And Athaliah rent her clothes and cried Treason! Treason!
2 Kings,11,15,Then Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds set over the army and said to them Take her forth outside the ranks and him who follows her kill with the sword. For the priest had said Let her not be slain in the house of the Lord.
2 Kings,11,16,They seized her and she went through the horses' entrance to the king's house and there she was slain.
2 Kings,11,17,And Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord the king and the people that they would be the Lord's people--and also between the king and the people.
2 Kings,11,18,Then all the people of the land went to the house of Baal and destroyed it. His altar and his images they broke completely in pieces and Mattan the priest of Baal they slew before the altars. And [Jehoiada] the priest appointed watchmen to guard the house of the Lord.
2 Kings,11,19,Then he took the rulers over hundreds the captains the guard and all the people of the land and they brought the king down from the house of the Lord and came by way of the guards' gate to the king's house. And [little] Joash was seated on the throne of the kings.
2 Kings,11,20,So all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been slain with the sword beside the king's house.
2 Kings,11,21,Joash was seven years old when he began to reign.
2 Kings,12,1,IN THE seventh year of Jehu Joash began to reign and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah of Beersheba.
2 Kings,12,2,Joash did right in the sight of the Lord all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
2 Kings,12,3,Yet the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.
2 Kings,12,4,And Joash said to the priests All the current money brought into the house of the Lord to provide the dedicated things also the money [which the priests by command have] assessed on all those bound by vows also all the money that it comes into any man's heart voluntarily to bring into the house of the Lord
2 Kings,12,5,Let the priests solicit and receive such contributions every man from his acquaintance and let them repair the Lord's house wherever any such need may be found.
2 Kings,12,6,But in the twenty-third year of King Joash's reign the priests had not made the needed repairs on the Lord's house.
2 Kings,12,7,Then King Joash called for Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said to them Why are you not repairing the [Lord's] house? Do not take any more money from your acquaintances but turn it all over for the repair of the house. [You are no longer responsible for this work. I will take it into my own hands.]
2 Kings,12,8,And the priests consented to receive no more money from the people nor to repair the breaches of the house.
2 Kings,12,9,Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one entered the house of the Lord; and the priests who guarded the door put in the chest all the money that was brought into the house of the Lord.
2 Kings,12,10,And whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest the king's scribe and the high priest came up and counted the money that was found in the house of the Lord and tied it up in bags.
2 Kings,12,11,Then they gave the money when it was weighed into the hands of those who were doing the work who had the oversight of the house of the Lord; and they paid it out to the carpenters and builders who worked on the house of the Lord
2 Kings,12,12,And to the masons and stonecutters and to buy timber and hewn stone for making the repairs on the house of the Lord and for all that was outlay for repairing the house.
2 Kings,12,13,However there were not made for the house of the Lord basins of silver snuffers bowls trumpets any vessels of gold or of silver from the money that was brought into the house of the Lord.
2 Kings,12,14,But they gave that to the workmen and repaired with it the house of the Lord.
2 Kings,12,15,Moreover they did not require an accounting from the men into whose hands they delivered the money to be paid to the workmen for they dealt faithfully.
2 Kings,12,16,The money from the guilt offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the house of the Lord; it was the priests'.
2 Kings,12,17,Then Hazael king of Syria went up fought against Gath [in Philistia] and took it. And Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
2 Kings,12,18,And Joash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat Jehoram and Ahaziah his [forefathers] kings of Judah had dedicated and his own hallowed things and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the house of the Lord and in the king's house and sent them to Hazael king of Syria; and Hazael went away from Jerusalem.
2 Kings,12,19,The rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings,12,20,His servants arose and made a conspiracy and slew Joash [in revenge] in the house of Millo on the way that goes down to Silla.
2 Kings,12,21,It was Jozachar son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer his servants who smote him so that he died. They buried [Joash] with his fathers in the City of David. Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,13,1,IN THE twenty-third year of Joash son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria and reigned seventeen years.
2 Kings,13,2,He did evil in the sight of the Lord and followed the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat which made Israel to sin and did not depart from them.
2 Kings,13,3,The anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and He delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria and of Ben-hadad son of Hazael continually.
2 Kings,13,4,But Jehoahaz besought the Lord and the Lord hearkened to him for He saw the oppression of Israel how the king of Syria burdened them.
2 Kings,13,5,Then the Lord gave Israel a savior [one to rescue and give them peace] so that they escaped from under the hand of the Syrians; and the Israelites dwelt in their tents or homes as before.
2 Kings,13,6,Yet they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam who made Israel sin; but the nation walked in them. And the Asherah [symbol of the goddess Asherah] remained in Samaria.
2 Kings,13,7,[Ben-hadad] of Syria did not leave to Jehoahaz of [Israel] an army of more than fifty horsemen ten chariots and 10000 footmen for the Syrian king had destroyed them and made them like dust to be trampled.

2 Kings,13,12,The rest of the acts of Jehoash all that he did and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings,13,13,Jehoash slept with his fathers and Jeroboam [II] sat on his throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,13,14,Now Elisha [previously] had become ill of the illness of which he died. And Jehoash king of Israel came down to him and wept over him and said O my father my father the chariot of Israel and the horsemen of it!
2 Kings,13,15,And Elisha said to him Take bow and arrows. And he took bow and arrows.
2 Kings,13,16,And he said to the king of Israel Put your hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands.
2 Kings,13,17,And he said Open the window to the east. And he opened it. Then Elisha said Shoot. And he shot. And he said The Lord's arrow of victory the arrow of victory over Syria. For you shall smite the Syrians in Aphek till you have destroyed them.
2 Kings,13,18,Then he said Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said to the king of Israel Strike on the ground. And he struck three times and stopped.
2 Kings,13,19,And the man of God was angry with him and said You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck down Syria until you had destroyed it. But now you shall strike Syria down only three times.
2 Kings,13,20,Elisha died and they buried him. Bands of the Moabites invaded the land in the spring of the next year.
2 Kings,13,21,As a man was being buried [on an open bier] such a band was seen coming; and the man was cast into Elisha's grave. And when the man being let down touched the bones of Elisha he revived and stood on his feet.
2 Kings,13,22,Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
2 Kings,13,23,But the Lord was gracious to them and had compassion on them and turned toward them because of His covenant with Abraham Isaac and Jacob and would not destroy them or cast them from His presence yet.
2 Kings,13,24,Hazael king of Syria died; Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,13,25,Jehoash son of Jehoahaz recovered from Ben-hadad son of Hazael the cities which he had taken from Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times Jehoash defeated him and recovered the cities of Israel.
2 Kings,14,1,IN THE second year of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah reigned.
2 Kings,14,2,He was twenty-five years old when he began his twenty-nine-year reign in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.
2 Kings,14,3,He did right in the sight of the Lord yet not like David his [forefather]. He did all things as Joash his father did.

2 Kings,14,5,As soon as the kingdom was established in Amaziah's hand he slew his servants who had slain the king his father.
2 Kings,14,6,But he did not slay the children of the murderers in compliance with what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses in which the Lord commanded The fathers shall not be put to death for the children nor the children for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin only.
2 Kings,14,7,Amaziah slew of Edom in the Valley of Salt 10000 and took Sela (Greek petra [rock]) by war and called it Joktheel which is the name of it to this day.
2 Kings,14,8,Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu king of Israel saying Come let us look one another in the face and test each other.
2 Kings,14,9,Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah The thistle in Lebanon sent to the cedar in Lebanon saying Give your daughter to my son as wife. And a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle [leaving the cedar unharmed].
2 Kings,14,10,You have indeed smitten Edom and your heart has lifted you up. Glory in that and stay at home; for why should you meddle to your hurt and provoke calamity causing you to fall you and Judah with you?
2 Kings,14,11,But Amaziah would not hear. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah measured swords at Beth-shemesh which belongs to Judah.
2 Kings,14,12,But Judah was defeated by Israel and every man fled home.
2 Kings,14,13,And Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah son of Joash the son of Ahaziah at Beth-shemesh and came to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate 400 cubits.

2 Kings,15,26,The rest of the acts of Pekahiah all he did see they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
2 Kings,15,27,In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah son of Remaliah began his twenty-year reign over Israel in Samaria.
2 Kings,15,28,He did evil in the Lord's sight; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam [I] son of Nebat which he made Israel sin.
2 Kings,15,29,In the days of Pekah king of Israel Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came and took Ijon Abel-beth-maacah Janoah Kedesh Hazor Gilead and Galilee all the land of Naphtali and carried the people captive to Assyria.
2 Kings,15,30,Hoshea son of Elah conspired against Pekah son of Remaliah [of Israel]; he smote and killed him and reigned in his stead in the twentieth year of Jotham son of Uzziah king of Judah.
2 Kings,15,31,The rest of Pekah's acts all that he did behold they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of Israel's Kings.
2 Kings,15,32,In the second year of Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel Jotham son of Uzziah king of Judah became king.
2 Kings,15,33,When he was twenty-five years old he began his reign of sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jerusha daughter of Zadok.
2 Kings,15,34,He did right in the Lord's sight according to all his father Uzziah had done.
2 Kings,15,35,Yet the high places were not removed; the people sacrificed and burned incense still on the high places. He built the Upper Gate of the house of the Lord.
2 Kings,15,36,The rest of the acts of Jotham all he did are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of Judah's Kings?
2 Kings,15,37,In those days the Lord began sending Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah against Judah.
2 Kings,15,38,Jotham slept with his fathers and was buried [with them] in the city of David his [forefather]. Ahaz his son succeeded him.
2 Kings,16,1,IN THE seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah Ahaz son of Jotham king of Judah became king.
2 Kings,16,2,Ahaz was twenty years old when he began his sixteen-year reign in Jerusalem. He did not do right in the sight of the Lord his God like David his [forefather].
2 Kings,16,3,But he walked in the ways of Israel's kings yes and made his son pass through the fire [and offered him as a sacrifice] in accord with the abominable [idolatrous] practices of the [heathen] nations whom the Lord drove out before the Israelites.
2 Kings,16,4,He sacrificed and burned incense in the high places on the hills and under every green tree.
2 Kings,16,5,Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war; they besieged Ahaz but could not conquer him.
2 Kings,16,6,At that time Rezin king of Syria got back Elath [in Edom] for Syria and drove the Jews from [it]. The Syrians came to Elath and dwell there to this day.
2 Kings,16,7,So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria saying I am your servant and son. Come up and save me out of the hands of the kings of Syria and of Israel who are attacking me.
2 Kings,16,8,And Ahaz took the silver and gold in the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the king's house and sent a present to the king of Assyria.
2 Kings,16,9,Assyria's king hearkened to him; he went up against Damascus took it carried its people captive to Kir and slew Rezin.
2 Kings,16,10,King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria and saw there their [heathen] altar. King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest a model of the altar and an exact pattern for its construction.
2 Kings,16,11,So Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus finishing it before King Ahaz returned.
2 Kings,16,12,When the king came from Damascus he looked at the altar and offered on it.
2 Kings,16,13,King Ahaz burned his burnt offering and his cereal offering poured his drink offering and dashed the blood of his peace offerings upon that altar.
2 Kings,16,14,The bronze altar which was before the Lord he removed from the front of the house from between his [new] altar and the house of the Lord and put it on the north side of his altar.
2 Kings,16,15,And King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest: Upon the principal (the new) altar burn the morning burnt offering the evening cereal offering the king's burnt sacrifice and his cereal offering with the burnt offering and cereal offering and drink offering of all the people of the land; and dash upon the [new] altar all the blood of the burnt offerings and the sacrifices. But the [old] bronze altar shall be kept for me to use to inquire by [of the Lord].
2 Kings,16,16,Urijah the priest did all this as King Ahaz commanded.
2 Kings,16,17,[To keep Assyria's king from getting them] King Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases [of the ten lavers] and removed the laver from each of them; and he took down the Sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it and put it upon stone supports.
2 Kings,16,18,And the covered way for the Sabbath that they had built in the temple court and the king's outer entrance he removed from the house of the Lord because of the king of Assyria [who if he heard of them might seize them].
2 Kings,16,19,The rest of the acts of Ahaz are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings,16,20,Ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried [with them] in the City of David. Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,17,1,IN THE twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah Hoshea son of Elah began his nine-year reign in Samaria over Israel.
2 Kings,17,2,He did evil in the sight of the Lord but not as Israel's kings before him did.
2 Kings,17,3,Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria and Hoshea became his servant and brought him tribute.
2 Kings,17,4,But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria as he had done year by year; therefore the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison.
2 Kings,17,5,Then the king of Assyria invaded all the land and went up to Samaria and besieged it for three years.
2 Kings,17,6,In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried the Israelites away into Assyria and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan and in the cities of the Medes.
2 Kings,17,7,This was so because the Israelites had sinned against the Lord their God Who had brought them out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and they had feared other gods
2 Kings,17,8,And walked in the customs of the [heathen] nations whom the Lord drove out before the Israelites customs the kings of Israel had introduced.
2 Kings,17,9,The Israelites did secretly against the Lord their God things not right. They built for themselves high places in all their towns from [lonely] watchtower to [populous] fortified city.
2 Kings,17,10,They set up for themselves pillars and Asherim [symbols of the goddess Asherah] on every high hill and under every green tree.
2 Kings,17,11,There they burned incense on all the high places as did the nations whom the Lord carried away before them; and they did wicked things provoking the Lord to anger.
2 Kings,17,12,And they served idols of which the Lord had said to them You shall not do this thing.
2 Kings,17,13,Yet the Lord warned Israel and Judah through all the prophets and all the seers saying Turn from your evil ways and keep My commandments and My statutes according to all the Law which I commanded your fathers and which I sent to you by My servants the prophets.
2 Kings,17,14,Yet they would not hear but hardened their necks as did their fathers who did not believe (trust in rely on and remain steadfast to) the Lord their God.
2 Kings,17,15,They despised and rejected His statutes and His covenant which He made with their fathers and His warnings to them and they followed vanity (false gods--falsehood emptiness and futility) and [they themselves and their prayers] became false (empty and futile). They went after the heathen round about them of whom the Lord had charged them that they should not do as they did.
2 Kings,17,16,And they forsook all the commandments of the Lord their God and made for themselves molten images even two calves and made an Asherah and worshiped all the [starry] hosts of the heavens and served Baal.
2 Kings,17,17,They caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire and used divination and enchantments and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord provoking Him to anger.
2 Kings,17,18,Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them out of His sight. None was left but the tribe of Judah.
2 Kings,17,19,Judah also did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God but walked in the customs which Israel introduced.
2 Kings,17,20,The Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel and afflicted them and delivered them into the hands of spoilers until He had cast them out of His sight.
2 Kings,17,21,For He tore Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam son of Nebat king. And Jeroboam drew and drove Israel away from following the Lord and made them sin a great sin.
2 Kings,17,22,For the Israelites walked in all the sins Jeroboam committed; they departed not from them
2 Kings,17,23,Until the Lord removed Israel from His sight as He had foretold by all His servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away from their own land to Assyria to this day.
2 Kings,17,24,The king of Assyria brought men from Babylon Cuthah Avva Hamath and Sepharvaim and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the Israelites. They possessed Samaria and dwelt in its cities.
2 Kings,17,25,At the beginning of their dwelling there they did not fear and revere the Lord. Therefore the Lord sent lions among them which killed some of them.
2 Kings,17,26,So the king of Assyria was told: The nations you removed and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the manner in which the God of the land requires their worship. Therefore He has sent lions among them and behold they are killing them because they do not know the manner of [worship demanded by] the God of the land.
2 Kings,17,27,Then the king of Assyria commanded Take to Samaria one of the priests you brought from there and let him [and his helpers] go and live there and let him teach the people the law of the God of the land.
2 Kings,17,28,So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel and taught them how they should fear and revere the Lord.
2 Kings,17,29,But every nationality still made gods of their own and put them in the shrines of the high places which the Samaritans had made every nationality in the city in which they dwelt.
2 Kings,17,30,The men of Babylon made [and worshiped their deity] Succoth-benoth the men of Cuth made Nergal the men of Hamath made Ashima
2 Kings,17,31,The Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim.
2 Kings,17,32,So they feared the Lord yet appointed from among themselves whether high or low priests of the high places who sacrificed for them in the shrines of the high places.
2 Kings,17,33,They feared the Lord yet served their own gods as did the nations from among whom they had been carried away.
2 Kings,17,34,Unto this day they do after their former custom: they do not fear the Lord [as God sees it] neither do they obey the statutes or the ordinances or the law and commandment which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob whom He named Israel
2 Kings,17,35,With whom the Lord had made a covenant and commanded them You shall not fear other gods or bow yourselves to them or serve them or sacrifice to them.
2 Kings,17,36,But you shall [reverently] fear bow yourselves to and sacrifice to the Lord Who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm.
2 Kings,17,37,And the statutes ordinances law and commandment which He wrote for you you shall observe and do forevermore; you shall not fear other gods.
2 Kings,17,38,And the covenant that I have made with you you shall not forget; you shall not fear other gods.
2 Kings,17,39,But the Lord your God you shall [reverently] fear; then He will deliver you out of the hands of all your enemies.
2 Kings,17,40,However they did not listen but they did as they had done formerly.
2 Kings,17,41,So these nations [vainly] feared the Lord and also served their graven images as did their children and their children's children. As their fathers did so do they to this day.
2 Kings,18,1,IN THE third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel Hezekiah son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
2 Kings,18,2,He was twenty-five years old when he began his twenty-nine-year reign in Jerusalem. His mother was Abi daughter of Zechariah.
2 Kings,18,3,Hezekiah did right in the sight of the Lord according to all that David his [forefather] had done.
2 Kings,18,4,He removed the high places broke the images cut down the Asherim and broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made for until then the Israelites had burned incense to it; but he called it Nehushtan [a bronze trifle].
2 Kings,18,5,Hezekiah trusted in leaned on and was confident in the Lord the God of Israel; so that neither after him nor before him was any one of all the kings of Judah like him.
2 Kings,18,6,For he clung and held fast to the Lord and ceased not to follow Him but kept His commandments as the Lord commanded Moses.
2 Kings,18,7,And the Lord was with Hezekiah; he prospered wherever he went. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to serve him.
2 Kings,18,8,He smote the Philistines even to Gaza [the most distant city] and its borders from the [isolated] watchtower to the [populous] fortified city.
2 Kings,18,9,In the fourth year of King Hezekiah which was the seventh of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it.
2 Kings,18,10,After three years it was taken; in the sixth year of Hezekiah which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel Samaria was taken.
2 Kings,18,11,The king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria and put them in Halah and on the Habor the river of Gozan and in the cities of the Medes
2 Kings,18,12,Because they did not obey the voice of the Lord their God but transgressed His covenant even all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded and would not hear it or do it.
2 Kings,18,13,In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.
2 Kings,18,14,Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish saying I have done wrong. Depart from me; what you put on me I will bear. And the king of Assyria exacted of Hezekiah king of Judah 300 talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
2 Kings,18,15,And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the king's house.
2 Kings,18,16,Then Hezekiah stripped off the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord and from the doorposts which he as king of Judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of Assyria.
2 Kings,18,17,And the king of Assyria sent the Tartan the Rabsaris and the Rabshakeh [the high officials] from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem with a great army. They went up to Jerusalem and when they arrived they came and stood by the canal of the Upper Pool which is on the highway to the Fuller's Field.
2 Kings,18,18,When they called for the king there came out to them Eliakim son of Hilkiah who was over the king's household and Shebna the scribe and Joah son of Asaph the recorder.
2 Kings,18,19,The Rabshakeh told them Say to Hezekiah Thus says the great king of Assyria: What justifies this confidence of yours?
2 Kings,18,20,You say--but they are empty words--There is counsel and strength for war. Now on whom do you rely that you rebel against me?
2 Kings,18,21,Behold you are relying on Egypt that broken reed of a staff; if a man leans on it it will pierce his hand. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust and rely on him.
2 Kings,18,22,But if you tell me We trust in and rely on the Lord our God is it not He Whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed saying to Judah and Jerusalem You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
2 Kings,18,23,So now make a wager and give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria: I will deliver you 2000 horses--if you can on your part put riders on them.
2 Kings,18,24,How then can you beat back one captain among the least of my master's servants when your trust is put in Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
2 Kings,18,25,Have I come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it? The Lord said to me Go up against this land and destroy it.
2 Kings,18,26,Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah and Shebna and Joah said to the Rabshakeh We pray you speak to your servants in the Aramaic (Syrian) language for we understand it; and do not speak to us in the Jews' language in the hearing of the people on the wall.
2 Kings,18,27,But the Rabshakeh said to them Has my master sent me to your master and you only to say these things? Has he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall [whom Hezekiah has doomed to be forced] to eat their own dung and drink their own urine along with you?
2 Kings,18,28,Then the Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language Hear the word of the great king of Assyria!
2 Kings,18,29,Thus says the king: Let not Hezekiah deceive you. For he will not be able to deliver you out of my hand.
2 Kings,18,30,Nor let Hezekiah make you trust in and rely on the Lord saying The Lord will surely deliver us and this city will not be given into the hand of Assyria's king.
2 Kings,18,31,Hearken not to Hezekiah for thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me and come out to me and eat every man from his own vine and fig tree and drink every man the waters of his own cistern
2 Kings,18,32,Until I come and take you away to a land like your own a land of grain and vintage fruit of bread and vineyards of olive trees and honey that you may live and not die. Do not listen to Hezekiah when he urges you saying The Lord will deliver us.
2 Kings,18,33,Has any one of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
2 Kings,18,34,Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad [in Syria]? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim Hena and Ivvah [in the Euphrates Valley]? Have they delivered Samaria [Israel's capital] out of my hand?
2 Kings,18,35,Who of all the gods of the countries has delivered his country out of my hand that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
2 Kings,18,36,But the people were silent and answered him not a word for Hezekiah had commanded Do not answer him.
2 Kings,18,37,Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah who was over the royal household and Shebna the scribe and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him what the Rabshakeh had said.
2 Kings,19,1,WHEN KING Hezekiah heard it he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the Lord.
2 Kings,19,2,And he sent Eliakim who was over his household Shebna the scribe and the older priests covered with sackcloth to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
2 Kings,19,3,They said to him Hezekiah says: This is a day of [extreme danger and] distress of rebuke and chastisement and blasphemous and insolent insult; for children have come to the birth and there is no strength to bring them forth.
2 Kings,19,4,It may be that the Lord your God will hear all the words of the Rabshakeh whom the king of Assyria has sent to mock reproach insult and defy the living God and will rebuke the words which the Lord your God has heard. So raise your prayer for the remnant [of His people] that is left.
2 Kings,19,5,So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
2 Kings,19,6,Isaiah said to them Say to your master Thus says the Lord: Do not be afraid because of the words you have heard with which the servants of the king of Assyria have reviled and blasphemed Me.
2 Kings,19,7,Behold I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own country.
2 Kings,19,8,So the Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah [a fortified city of Judah]; for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.
2 Kings,19,9,And Sennacherib king of Assyria heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia He has come to make war against you. And when he heard it he sent messengers again to Hezekiah saying
2 Kings,19,10,Say this to Hezekiah king of Judah: Let not your God on Whom you rely deceive you by saying Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
2 Kings,19,11,Behold you have heard what the Assyrian kings have done to all lands destroying them utterly. And shall you be delivered?
2 Kings,19,12,Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my ancestors have destroyed as Gozan Haran [of Mesopotamia] Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?
2 Kings,19,13,Where are the kings of Hamath of Arpad [of northern Syria] of the city of Sepharvaim of Hena and Ivvah?
2 Kings,19,14,Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. And he went up into the house of the Lord and spread it before the Lord.
2 Kings,19,15,And Hezekiah prayed: O Lord the God of Israel Who [in symbol] is enthroned above the cherubim [of the ark in the temple] You are the God You alone of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made the heavens and the earth.
2 Kings,19,16,Lord bow down Your ear and hear; Lord open Your eyes and see; hear the words of Sennacherib which he has sent to mock reproach insult and defy the living God.
2 Kings,19,17,It is true Lord that the Assyrian kings have laid waste the nations and their lands
2 Kings,19,18,And have cast the gods of those peoples into the fire for they were not gods but the work of men's hands wood and stone. So they [could destroy and] have destroyed them.
2 Kings,19,19,Now therefore O Lord our God I beseech You save us out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know and understand that You O Lord are God alone.
2 Kings,19,20,Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying Thus says the Lord the God of Israel: Your prayer to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.
2 Kings,19,21,This is the word that the Lord has spoken concerning him: The Virgin Daughter of Zion has despised you and laughed you to scorn; the Daughter of Jerusalem has wagged her head behind you.
2 Kings,19,22,Whom have you mocked and reviled and insulted and blasphemed? Against Whom have you raised your voice and haughtily lifted your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!
2 Kings,19,23,By your messengers you have mocked reproached insulted and defied the Lord and have said With my many chariots I have gone up to the heights of the mountains to the far recesses of Lebanon. I cut down its tall cedar trees and its choicest cypress trees. I entered its most distant retreat its densest forest.
2 Kings,19,24,I dug wells and drank foreign waters and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all [the defense and] the streams of Egypt.
2 Kings,19,25,[But says the God of Israel] Have you not heard how I ordained long ago what now I have brought to pass? I planned it in olden times that you [king of Assyria] should [be My instrument to] lay waste fortified cities making them ruinous heaps.
2 Kings,19,26,That is why their inhabitants had little power they were dismayed and confounded; they were like plants of the field the green herb the grass on the housetops blasted before it is grown up.
2 Kings,19,27,But [O Sennacherib] I [the Lord] know your sitting down your going out your coming in and your raging against Me.
2 Kings,19,28,Because your raging against Me and your arrogance and careless ease have come to My ears therefore I will put My hook in your nose and My bridle in your lips and I will turn you back by the way you came O king of Assyria.
2 Kings,19,29,And [Hezekiah says the Lord] this shall be the sign [of these things] to you: you shall eat this year what grows of itself also in the second year what springs up voluntarily. But in the third year sow and reap plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
2 Kings,19,30,And the remnant that has survived of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
2 Kings,19,31,For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and a band of survivors out of Mount Zion. The zeal of the Lord of hosts shall perform this.
2 Kings,19,32,Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow here or come before it with shield or cast up a siege mound against it.
2 Kings,19,33,By the way that he came by that way shall he return and he shall not come into this city says the Lord.
2 Kings,19,34,For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David's sake.
2 Kings,19,35,And it all came to pass for that night the Angel of the Lord went forth and slew 185000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when [the living] arose early in the morning behold all these were dead bodies.
2 Kings,19,36,So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned and dwelt at Nineveh.
2 Kings,19,37,And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons killed him with the sword and they escaped to the land of Armenia or Ararat. Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,20,1,IN THOSE days Hezekiah became deadly ill. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came and said to him Thus says the Lord: Set your house in order for you shall die; you shall not recover.
2 Kings,20,2,Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord saying
2 Kings,20,3,I beseech You O Lord [earnestly] remember now how I have walked before You in faithfulness and truth and with a whole heart [entirely devoted to You] and have done what is good in Your sight. And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
2 Kings,20,4,Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court the word of the Lord came to him:
2 Kings,20,5,Turn back and tell Hezekiah the leader of My people Thus says the Lord the God of David your [forefather]: I have heard your prayer I have seen your tears; behold I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord.
2 Kings,20,6,I will add to your life fifteen years and deliver you and this city [Jerusalem] out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for My own sake and for My servant David's sake.
2 Kings,20,7,And Isaiah said Bring a cake of figs. Let them lay it on the burning inflammation that he may recover.
2 Kings,20,8,Hezekiah said to Isaiah What shall be the sign that the Lord will heal me and that I shall go up into the house of the Lord on the third day?
2 Kings,20,9,And Isaiah said This is the sign to you from the Lord that He will do the thing He has promised: shall the shadow [denoting the time of day] go forward ten steps or go back ten steps?
2 Kings,20,10,Hezekiah answered It is an easy matter for the shadow to go forward ten steps; so let the shadow go back ten steps.
2 Kings,20,11,So Isaiah the prophet cried to the Lord and He brought the shadow the ten steps backward by which it had gone down on the sundial of Ahaz.
2 Kings,20,12,At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a present to Hezekiah for he had heard of Hezekiah's illness.
2 Kings,20,13,And Hezekiah rejoiced and welcomed the embassy and showed them all his treasure-house--the silver gold spices precious ointment his armory and all that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
2 Kings,20,14,Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said What did these men say? From where did they come to you? Hezekiah said They are from a far country from Babylon.
2 Kings,20,15,Isaiah said What have they seen in your house? Hezekiah answered They have seen all that is in my house. There is no treasure of mine that I have not shown them.
2 Kings,20,16,Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah Hear the word of the Lord!
2 Kings,20,17,Behold the time is coming when all that is in your house and that which your forefathers have stored up till this day shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left says the Lord.
2 Kings,20,18,And some of your sons who shall be born to you shall be taken away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of Babylon's king.
2 Kings,20,19,Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah The word of the Lord you have spoken is good. For he thought Is it not good if [all this evil is meant for the future and] peace and security shall be in my days?
2 Kings,20,20,The rest of the acts of Hezekiah and all his might and how he made the pool and the canal and brought water into the city are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings,20,21,Hezekiah slept with his fathers. Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,21,1,MANASSEH WAS twelve years old when he began his fifty-five-year [wicked] reign in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hephzibah.
2 Kings,21,2,He [Hezekiah's son] did evil in the sight of the Lord after the [idolatrous] practices of the [heathen] nations whom the Lord cast out before the Israelites.
2 Kings,21,3,For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal and made an Asherah as did Ahab king of Israel and worshiped all the [starry] hosts of the heavens and served them!
2 Kings,21,4,And he built [heathen] altars in the house of the Lord of which the Lord said In Jerusalem will I put My Name [and the pledge of My presence].
2 Kings,21,5,And he [good Hezekiah's son] built altars for all the hosts of the heavens in the two courts of the house of the Lord!
2 Kings,21,6,And he made his son pass through the fire and burned him as an offering [to Molech]; he practiced soothsaying and augury and dealt with mediums and wizards! He did much wickedness in the sight of the Lord provoking Him to anger.
2 Kings,21,7,He made a graven image of [the goddess] Asherah and set it in the house of which the Lord said to David and to Solomon his son In this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel will I put My Name [and the pledge of My presence] forever;
2 Kings,21,8,And I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them.
2 Kings,21,9,But they would not listen; and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than the nations did whom the Lord destroyed before the Israelites!
2 Kings,21,10,And the Lord said through His servants the prophets:
2 Kings,21,11,Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these abominations and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did who were before him and has made Judah also to sin with his idols
2 Kings,21,12,Therefore thus says the Lord the God of Israel: Behold I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah that whoever hears of it both his ears shall tingle!
2 Kings,21,13,And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish wiping it and turning it upside down.
2 Kings,21,14,And I will cast off the rest of My inheritance and deliver them into the hands of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies
2 Kings,21,15,For they have done evil in My sight and have provoked Me to anger since their fathers came out of Egypt to this day.
2 Kings,21,16,Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood filling Jerusalem from one end to another--besides his sin in making Judah sin by doing evil in the sight of the Lord!
2 Kings,21,17,The rest of the acts of Manasseh all that he did and his sin that he committed are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings,21,18,Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house in the garden of Uzza. Amon his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,21,19,Amon was twenty-two years old when he began his two-year reign in Jerusalem. His mother was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
2 Kings,21,20,[But] he also did evil in the sight of the Lord as his father Manasseh had done.
2 Kings,21,21,He walked in all the ways of his father; and he served the idols that his father served and worshiped them;
2 Kings,21,22,He forsook the Lord the God of his [forefathers] and did not walk in the way of the Lord.
2 Kings,21,23,The servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his own house.
2 Kings,21,24,But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon and made Josiah his son king in his stead.
2 Kings,21,25,The rest of the acts of Amon are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings,21,26,He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza. Josiah his son succeeded him.
2 Kings,22,1,JOSIAH WAS eight years old when he began his thirty-one-year reign in Jerusalem. His mother was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.
2 Kings,22,2,He did right in the sight of the Lord and walked in all the ways of David his [forefather] and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
2 Kings,22,3,In the eighteenth year of King Josiah he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam the scribe to the Lord's house saying
2 Kings,22,4,Go up to Hilkiah the high priest that he may count the money brought into the house of the Lord which the keepers of the door have gathered from the people.
2 Kings,22,5,And let them deliver it into the hands of the workmen who have oversight of the Lord's house to give to the laborers engaged in the repairing of the Lord's house--
2 Kings,22,6,That is to the carpenters builders and masons--and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
2 Kings,22,7,However there was no accounting required of them for the money delivered into their hands because they dealt faithfully.
2 Kings,22,8,Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord! Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan and he read it.
2 Kings,22,9,And Shaphan the scribe came to the king and reported to him: Your servants have gathered the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hands of the workmen who have oversight of the house of the Lord.
2 Kings,22,10,Then Shaphan the scribe told the king Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
2 Kings,22,11,And when the king heard the words of the Book of the Law he rent his clothes.
2 Kings,22,12,And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest Ahikam son of Shaphan Achbor son of Micaiah Shaphan the scribe and Asaiah servant of the king
2 Kings,22,13,Go inquire of the Lord for me and for the people and for all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found. For great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us because our fathers have not listened and obeyed the words of this book to do according to all that is written concerning us.
2 Kings,22,14,So Hilkiah the priest Ahikam Achbor Shaphan and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah the son of Harhas keeper of the wardrobe--now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter--and they talked with her.
2 Kings,22,15,She said to them Thus says the Lord the God of Israel: Tell the man who sent you to me
2 Kings,22,16,Thus says the Lord: Behold I will bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants according to all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read.
2 Kings,22,17,Because they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods provoking Me to anger with all the work of their hands therefore My wrath will be kindled against this place and will not be quenched.
2 Kings,22,18,But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the Lord say this Thus says the Lord the God of Israel regarding the words you have heard:
2 Kings,22,19,Because your heart was [tender and] penitent and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard what I said against this place and against its inhabitants that they should become a desolation [an astonishment and] a curse and you have rent your clothes and wept before Me I also have heard you says the Lord.
2 Kings,22,20,Behold therefore [King Josiah] I will gather you to your fathers taken to your grave in peace and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring on this place. And they brought the king word.
2 Kings,23,1,KING JOSIAH sent and gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
2 Kings,23,2,The king went up to the house of the Lord and with him all the men of Judah all the inhabitants of Jerusalem the priests the prophets and all the people both small and great. And he read in their ears all the words of the Book of the Covenant which was found in the Lord's house.
2 Kings,23,3,The king stood [on the platform] by the pillar and made a covenant before the Lord--to walk after the Lord and to keep His commandments His testimonies and His statutes with all his heart and soul to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to join in the covenant.
2 Kings,23,4,And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second rank and the keepers of the threshold to bring out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels made for Baal for [the goddess] Asherah and for all the hosts of the heavens; and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron and carried their ashes to Bethel [where Israel's idolatry began].
2 Kings,23,5,He put away the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in Judah's cities and round about Jerusalem--also those who burned incense to Baal to the sun to the moon to the constellations [or twelve signs of the zodiac] and to all the hosts of the heavens.
2 Kings,23,6,And Josiah brought the Asherah from the house of the Lord to outside Jerusalem to the brook Kidron and burned it there and beat it to dust and cast its dust upon the graves of the common people [who had sacrificed to it].
2 Kings,23,7,And he broke down the houses of the male cult prostitutes which were by the house of the Lord where the women wove [tent] hangings for the Asherah [shrines].
2 Kings,23,8,And [Josiah] brought all the [idolatrous] priests out of the city of Judah and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense from Geba to Beersheba [north to south] and broke down the high places both at the entrance of the Gate of Joshua the governor of the city and that which was on one's left at the city's gate.
2 Kings,23,9,However the priests of the high places were not allowed to sacrifice upon the Lord's altar in Jerusalem but they ate unleavened bread among their brethren.
2 Kings,23,10,And Josiah defiled Topheth which is in the Valley of Ben-hinnom [son of Hinnom] that no man might ever burn there his son or his daughter as an offering to Molech.
2 Kings,23,11,And he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had devoted to the sun from the entrance of the house of the Lord by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain which was in the area and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
2 Kings,23,12,And the altars on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz which the kings of Judah had made and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord [Josiah] pulled down and beat them in pieces and he [ran and] cast their dust into the brook Kidron.
2 Kings,23,13,And the king defiled the high places east of Jerusalem south of the Mount of Corruption which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abominable [goddess] of the Sidonians for Chemosh the abominable god of the Moabites and for Milcom the abominable [god] of the Ammonites.
2 Kings,23,14,He broke in pieces the pillars (images) and cut down the Asherim and replaced them with the bones of men [to defile the places forever].
2 Kings,23,15,Moreover the altar at Bethel the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat who made Israel to sin that altar with the high place Josiah tore down and broke in pieces its stones beating them to dust and burned the Asherah.
2 Kings,23,16,And as Josiah turned he saw the tombs across on the mount and he sent and brought the bones out of the tombs and burned them upon the altar and defiled it in fulfillment of the word of the Lord which the man of God prophesied who predicted these things [about this altar naming Josiah before he was born].
2 Kings,23,17,Josiah said What is that monument I see? The men of the city told him It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and foretold these things that you have just done against the altar of Bethel.
2 Kings,23,18,He said Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.
2 Kings,23,19,Also Josiah took away all the houses of the high places in the cities of Samaria which the kings of Israel had made provoking the Lord to anger and he did to them all that he had done in Bethel.
2 Kings,23,20,He slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars and burned men's bones upon them [to defile the places forever]. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
2 Kings,23,21,The king commanded all the people Keep the Passover to the Lord your God as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.
2 Kings,23,22,Surely such a Passover was not held from the days of Israel's judges even in all the days of the kings of Israel or Judah.
2 Kings,23,23,But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this Passover was kept to the Lord in Jerusalem.
2 Kings,23,24,Moreover Josiah put away the mediums the wizards the teraphim (household gods) the idols and all the abominations that were seen in Judah and in Jerusalem that he might establish the words of the law written in the book found by Hilkiah the priest in the house of the Lord.
2 Kings,23,25,There was no king like him before or after [Josiah] who turned to the Lord with all his heart and all his soul and all his might according to all the Law of Moses.
2 Kings,23,26,Still the Lord did not turn from the fierceness of His great wrath kindled against Judah because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked Him.
2 Kings,23,27,And the Lord said I will remove Judah also out of My sight as I have removed Israel and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen and the house of which I said My Name [and the pledge of My presence] shall be there.
2 Kings,23,28,The rest of the acts of Josiah all that he did are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of Judah's Kings?
2 Kings,23,29,In his days Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates. King Josiah went out against him but he slew Josiah at Megiddo when he saw him.
2 Kings,23,30,Josiah's servants carried him dead in a chariot from Megiddo brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. The people of the land anointed Jehoahaz son of Josiah king in his stead.
2 Kings,23,31,Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began his three-month reign in Jerusalem. His mother was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2 Kings,23,32,He did evil in the sight of the Lord according to all [the evil] his forefathers had done.
2 Kings,23,33,And Pharaoh Necho put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath that he might not reign in Jerusalem and laid a tribute of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold upon the land.
2 Kings,23,34,Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of Josiah and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz away to Egypt where he died.
2 Kings,23,35,Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh but he taxed the land to give the money as Pharaoh commanded. He exacted the silver and gold of the people of the land from everyone according to his assessment to give it to Pharaoh Necho.
2 Kings,23,36,Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began his eleven-year reign in Jerusalem. His mother was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
2 Kings,23,37,He did evil in the sight of the Lord like all his [forefathers] had done.
2 Kings,24,1,IN HIS days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him.
2 Kings,24,2,The Lord sent against Jehoiakim bands of Chaldeans of Syrians of Moabites and of Ammonites. And He sent them against Judah to destroy it according to the word of the Lord which He spoke by His servants the prophets.
2 Kings,24,3,Surely this came upon Judah at the command of the Lord to remove them out of His sight because of the sins of Manasseh according to all he had done
2 Kings,24,4,And also for the innocent blood that he shed. For he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood and the Lord would not pardon.
2 Kings,24,5,The rest of the acts of Jehoiakim all that he did are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of Judah's Kings?
2 Kings,24,6,So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers. Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,24,7,The king of Egypt came no more out of his land for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to Egypt's king from the River of Egypt to the river Euphrates.
2 Kings,24,8,Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began his three-month reign in Jerusalem. His mother was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
2 Kings,24,9,And he did evil in the sight of the Lord in keeping with all his father had done.
2 Kings,24,10,At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem and the city was besieged.
2 Kings,24,11,Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city while his servants were besieging it.
2 Kings,24,12,Jehoiachin king of Judah surrendered to the king of Babylon he his mother his servants princes and palace officials. The king of Babylon took him prisoner in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign.
2 Kings,24,13,He carried off all the treasures of the Lord's house and the king's house and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold in the temple of the Lord which Solomon king of Israel had made as the Lord had said.
2 Kings,24,14,He carried away all Jerusalem all the princes all the mighty men of valor 10000 captives and all the craftsmen and smiths. None remained except the poorest of the land.
2 Kings,24,15,Nebuchadnezzar took captive to Babylon King Jehoiachin; his mother his wives his officials and the chief and mighty men of the land [the prophet Ezekiel included] he took from Jerusalem to Babylon into exile.
2 Kings,24,16,And the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon all the men of valor 7000 and craftsmen and smiths 1000 all strong and fit for war.
2 Kings,24,17,And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah Jehoiachin's uncle king in his stead and changed his name to Zedekiah.
2 Kings,24,18,Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began his eleven-year reign in Jerusalem. His mother was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2 Kings,24,19,He did evil in the sight of the Lord in keeping with all Jehoiakim had done.
2 Kings,24,20,For because of the anger of the Lord it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that He cast them out of His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
2 Kings,25,1,IN THE ninth year of Zedekiah's reign on the tenth day of the tenth month Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem and laid siege to it and they built siege works against it round about.
2 Kings,25,2,The city was besieged [nearly two years] until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
2 Kings,25,3,On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was complete in the city; there was no food for the people of the land.
2 Kings,25,4,Then the city was broken through; the king and all the warriors fled by night by way of the gate between the two walls by the king's garden though the Chaldeans were round about the city. [The king] went by the way toward the Arabah (the plain).
2 Kings,25,5,The Chaldean army pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his army was scattered from him.
2 Kings,25,6,So they captured Zedekiah and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah and sentence was passed on him.
2 Kings,25,7,And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in double fetters [hands and feet] and carried him to Babylon. [Foretold in Jer. 34:3; Ezek. 12:13.]
2 Kings,25,8,On the seventh day of the fifth month of the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon Nebuzaradan captain of the Babylonian king's guard came to Jerusalem.
2 Kings,25,9,He burned the house of the Lord the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down.
2 Kings,25,10,All the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the [Babylonian] guard broke down the walls around Jerusalem.
2 Kings,25,11,Now the rest of the people left in the city and the deserters who fell away to the king of Babylon along with the rest of the multitude Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile.
2 Kings,25,12,But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and soil tillers.
2 Kings,25,13,The bronze pillars in the Lord's house and [its] bases and the bronze Sea the Chaldeans smashed and carried the bronze to Babylon.
2 Kings,25,14,And they took away the pots shovels snuffers dishes for incense all the bronze vessels used in the temple service
2 Kings,25,15,The firepans and bowls. Such things as were of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold and what was of silver [he took away] as silver.
2 Kings,25,16,The two pillars the one Sea and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the Lord the bronze of all these articles was incalculable.
2 Kings,25,17,The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits and upon it was a capital of bronze. The height of the capital was three cubits; a network and pomegranates round about the capital were all of bronze. And the second pillar had the same as these with a network.
2 Kings,25,18,The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest Zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the threshold.
2 Kings,25,19,And out of the city he took an officer who was in command of the men of war and five men of the king's personal advisors who were found in the city and the scribe of the captain of the army who mustered the people of the land and sixty men of the people who were found in the city.
2 Kings,25,20,Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
2 Kings,25,21,The king of Babylon smote and killed them at Riblah in the land of Hamath [north of Damascus]. So Judah was taken into exile.
2 Kings,25,22,Over the people whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left in the land of Judah he appointed as governor Gedaliah son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan.
2 Kings,25,23,And when all the captains of the forces and their men heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor they came with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah namely Ishmael son of Nethaniah Johanan son of Kareah Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite and Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite.
2 Kings,25,24,And Gedaliah swore to them and their men saying Do not be afraid of the Chaldean officials. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon and it shall be well with you.
2 Kings,25,25,But in the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama of the royal family [so having a claim to be governor] came with ten men and smote and killed Gedaliah and the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.
2 Kings,25,26,Then all the people both small and great and the captains of the forces arose and went to Egypt for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
2 Kings,25,27,And in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign showed favor to Jehoiachin king of Judah and released him from prison;
2 Kings,25,28,He spoke kindly to him and ranked him above the kings with him in Babylon.
2 Kings,25,29,Jehoiachin put off his prison garments and he dined regularly at the king's table the remainder of his life.
2 Kings,25,30,And his allowance a continual one was given him by the king every day a portion for the rest of his life.

1 Chronicles,13,3,And let us bring again the ark of our God to us for we did not seek it during the days of Saul.

1 Chronicles,14,11,So [Israel] came up to Baal-perazim and David smote [the Philistines] there. Then David said God has broken my enemies by my hand like the bursting forth of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim [Lord of breaking through].

1 Chronicles,15,12,And said to them You are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites; sanctify yourselves both you and your brethren that you may bring up the ark of the Lord the God of Israel to the place that I have prepared for it.
1 Chronicles,15,13,For because you bore it not [as God directed] at the first the Lord our God broke forth upon us--because we did not seek Him in the way He ordained.
1 Chronicles,15,14,So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the Lord the God of Israel.

1 Chronicles,15,29,As the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the City of David Michal [David's wife] daughter of Saul looking from a window saw King David leaping as in sport and she despised him in her heart.
1 Chronicles,16,1,SO THEY brought the ark of God and set it in the midst of the tent which David had pitched for it and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.

1 Chronicles,16,6,Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

1 Chronicles,16,8,O give thanks to the Lord call on His name; make known His doings among the peoples!
1 Chronicles,16,9,Sing to Him sing praises to Him; meditate on and talk of all His wondrous works and devoutly praise them!

1 Chronicles,16,17,He confirmed it as a statute to Jacob and to Israel for an everlasting covenant
1 Chronicles,16,18,Saying To you I will give the land of Canaan the measured portion of your possession and inheritance.
1 Chronicles,16,19,When they were but few even a very few and only temporary residents and strangers in it
1 Chronicles,16,20,When they went from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another people
1 Chronicles,16,21,He allowed no man to do them wrong; yes He reproved kings for their sakes
1 Chronicles,16,22,Saying Touch not My anointed and do My prophets no harm.
1 Chronicles,16,23,Sing to the Lord all the earth; show forth from day to day His salvation.
1 Chronicles,16,24,Declare His glory among the nations His marvelous works among all peoples.
1 Chronicles,16,25,For great is the Lord and greatly to be praised; He also is to be [reverently] feared above all so-called gods.
1 Chronicles,16,26,For all the gods of the people are [lifeless] idols but the Lord made the heavens.
1 Chronicles,16,27,Honor and majesty are [found] in His presence; strength and joy are [found] in His sanctuary.
1 Chronicles,16,28,Ascribe to the Lord you families of the peoples ascribe to the Lord glory and strength
1 Chronicles,16,29,Ascribe to the Lord the glory due His name. Bring an offering and come before Him; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness and in holy array.

1 Chronicles,16,35,And say Save us O God of our salvation; gather us together and deliver us from the nations that we may give thanks to Your holy name and glory in Your praise.
1 Chronicles,16,36,Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel forever and ever! And all the people said Amen! and praised the Lord.
1 Chronicles,16,37,So David left Asaph and his brethren before the ark of the covenant of the Lord to minister before the ark continually as each day's work required
1 Chronicles,16,38,And Obed-edom with [his] sixty-eight kinsmen. Also Obed-edom son of Jeduthun and Hosah were to be gatekeepers.

1 Chronicles,16,42,With them were Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those who should sound aloud and instruments for accompanying the songs of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were to be at the gate.
1 Chronicles,16,43,Then all the people departed each man to his house and David returned home to bless his household.
1 Chronicles,17,1,AS DAVID sat in his house he said to Nathan the prophet Behold I dwell in a house of cedars but the ark of the covenant of the Lord remains under tent curtains.
1 Chronicles,17,2,Then Nathan said to David Do all that is in your heart for God is with you.
1 Chronicles,17,3,And that same night the word of God came to Nathan saying
1 Chronicles,17,4,Go and tell David My servant Thus says the Lord: You shall not build Me a house to dwell in
1 Chronicles,17,5,For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel from Egypt until this day; but I have gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to another.
1 Chronicles,17,6,Wherever I have walked with all Israel did I say a word to any of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to feed My people saying Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?
1 Chronicles,17,7,Now therefore thus shall you say to My servant David Thus says the Lord of hosts: I took you from the sheepfold from following the sheep that you should be prince over My people Israel.
1 Chronicles,17,8,And I have been with you wherever you have gone and I have cut off all your enemies from before you and I will make your name like the name of the great ones of the earth.
1 Chronicles,17,9,Also I will appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them that they may dwell in their own place and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more as at the first
1 Chronicles,17,10,Since the time that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all your enemies. Furthermore I foretell to you that the Lord will build you a house (a blessed posterity).
1 Chronicles,17,11,And it shall come to pass that when your days are fulfilled to go to be with your fathers I will raise up your offspring after you one of your own sons and I will establish his kingdom.
1 Chronicles,17,12,He shall build Me a house and I will establish his throne forever.
1 Chronicles,17,13,I will be his father and he shall be My son; and I will not take My mercy and steadfast love away from him as I took it from him [King Saul] who was before you.
1 Chronicles,17,14,But I will settle him (Him) in My house and in My kingdom forever; and his (His) throne shall be established forevermore.
1 Chronicles,17,15,According to all these words and according to all this vision so Nathan spoke to David.
1 Chronicles,17,16,And David the king went in and sat before the Lord and said Who am I O Lord God and what is my house and family that You have brought me up to this?
1 Chronicles,17,17,And yet this was a small thing in Your eyes O God; for You have spoken of Your servant's house for a great while to come and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree O Lord God!
1 Chronicles,17,18,What more can David say to You for thus honoring Your servant? For You know Your servant.
1 Chronicles,17,19,O Lord for Your servant's sake and in accord with Your own heart You have wrought all this greatness to make known all these great things.
1 Chronicles,17,20,O Lord there is none like You nor is there any God beside You according to all that our ears have heard.
1 Chronicles,17,21,And what nation on the earth is like Your people Israel whom God went to redeem to Himself as a people making Yourself a name by great and terrible things by driving out nations from before Your people whom You redeemed out of Egypt?
1 Chronicles,17,22,You made Your people Israel Your own forever and You Lord became their God.
1 Chronicles,17,23,Therefore now Lord let the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house be established forever and do as You have said.
1 Chronicles,17,24,Let it be established and let Your name [and the character that name denotes] be magnified forever saying The Lord of hosts the God of Israel is Israel's God; and the house of David Your servant will be established before You.
1 Chronicles,17,25,For You O my God have told Your servant that You will build for him a house (a blessed posterity); therefore Your servant has found courage and confidence to pray before You.
1 Chronicles,17,26,And now Lord You are God and have promised this good thing to Your servant.
1 Chronicles,17,27,Therefore may it please You to bless the house (posterity) of Your servant that it may continue before You forever; for what You bless O Lord is blessed forever.
1 Chronicles,18,1,AFTER THIS David smote and subdued the Philistines and took Gath and its villages out of the hand of the Philistines.
1 Chronicles,18,2,He smote Moab and the Moabites became David's servants and brought tribute.

1 Chronicles,18,6,Then David put garrisons in Syria [whose capital was] Damascus; the Syrians became David's servants and brought tribute. Thus the Lord preserved and gave victory to David wherever he went.
1 Chronicles,18,7,David took the shields of gold that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles,18,8,Likewise from Tibhath and from Cun cities of Hadadezer David brought very much bronze with which Solomon later made the bronze laver the pillars and the vessels of bronze.
1 Chronicles,18,9,When Tou king of Hamath heard how David had defeated all the hosts of Hadadezer king of Zobah
1 Chronicles,18,10,He sent Hadoram his son to King David to salute him and to congratulate him because he had fought and defeated Hadadezer for Hadadezer had had wars with Tou. And Hadoram brought with him all manner of vessels of gold silver and bronze.
1 Chronicles,18,11,King David dedicated them also to the Lord with the silver and the gold he brought from all these nations: Edom Moab the Ammonites the Philistines and the Amalekites.
1 Chronicles,18,12,Also Abishai son of Zeruiah slew 18000 of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
1 Chronicles,18,13,He put garrisons in Edom and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the Lord preserved and gave victory to David wherever he went.
1 Chronicles,18,14,So David reigned over all Israel and executed judgment and justice among all his people.
1 Chronicles,18,15,Joab son of Zeruiah [David's half sister] was over the army; and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder;
1 Chronicles,18,16,Zadok son of Ahitub and Abimelech son of Abiathar were the priests; and Shavsha was secretary [of state];
1 Chronicles,18,17,Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over [David's bodyguards] the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chiefs next to the king.
1 Chronicles,19,1,AFTER THIS Nahash king of the Ammonites died and his son reigned in his stead.
1 Chronicles,19,2,David said I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father's death. So the servants of David came into the land of the Ammonites to comfort Hanun.
1 Chronicles,19,3,But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun Do you think that David has sent comforters to you because he honors your father? Have his servants not come to you to search to overthrow and to spy out the land?
1 Chronicles,19,4,Therefore Hanun took David's servants shaved them cut off their garments in the middle near their buttocks and sent them away.
1 Chronicles,19,5,When David was told how the men were served he sent to meet them for [they] were greatly shamed and embarrassed. The king said Stay in Jericho until your beards are grown and then return.
1 Chronicles,19,6,When the Ammonites saw that they had made themselves hateful to David Hanun and [his people] sent 1000 talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia and Aram-maacah and Zobah.
1 Chronicles,19,7,So they hired 32000 chariots and the king of Maacah and his troops who came and pitched before Medeba. And the Ammonites gathered from their cities and came to battle.
1 Chronicles,19,8,When David heard of it he sent Joab and all the army of mighty men.
1 Chronicles,19,9,And the Ammonites came out and lined up in battle array before the entrance of the city [Medeba] and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.
1 Chronicles,19,10,When Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind he chose from all the choice men of Israel and put them in array against the Syrians.
1 Chronicles,19,11,The rest of the soldiers he delivered to Abishai his brother and they were arrayed against the Ammonites.
1 Chronicles,19,12,And he said If the Syrians are too strong for me then you help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you I will help you.
1 Chronicles,19,13,Be of good courage and let us behave ourselves courageously for our people and for the cities of our God; and may the Lord do what is good in His sight.
1 Chronicles,19,14,So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians for battle and they fled before him.
1 Chronicles,19,15,And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled they likewise fled before Abishai Joab's brother and entered into the city [Medeba]. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles,19,16,When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel they sent messengers and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates River with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head.
1 Chronicles,19,17,It was told to David and he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan and drew up his army against them. So when David set the battle in array against the Syrians they fought with him.
1 Chronicles,19,18,But the Syrians fled before Israel and David slew of the Syrians 7000 men in chariots and 40000 foot soldiers and killed Shophach the commander of the army.
1 Chronicles,19,19,When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel they made peace with David and became subject to him; nor would the Syrians any longer help the Ammonites.
1 Chronicles,20,1,AFTER THE end of the year when kings go out to battle Joab led forth the army and devastated the land of the Ammonites and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. Joab smote Rabbah and overthrew it.
1 Chronicles,20,2,David took their king's crown from off his head and found that it weighed a talent of gold and that precious stones were in it. It was set upon David's head. He brought also very much spoil out of the city of Rabbah.
1 Chronicles,20,3,He brought out the people who were in it and set them at cutting with saws iron wedges and axes. So David dealt with all the Ammonite cities. And David and all the army returned to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles,20,4,After this there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Sippai of the sons of the giant and they were subdued.
1 Chronicles,20,5,There was war again with the Philistines and Elhanan son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
1 Chronicles,20,6,And again there was war at Gath where was a man of great stature who had twenty-four fingers and toes six on each hand and each foot. He also was born to the giant.
1 Chronicles,20,7,And when he reproached and defied Israel Jonathan son of Shimea David's brother slew him.
1 Chronicles,20,8,These were born to the giant [clan] in Gath and they fell by the hands of David and his servants.
1 Chronicles,21,1,SATAN [an adversary] stood up against Israel and stirred up David to number Israel.
1 Chronicles,21,2,David said to Joab and the rulers of the people Go number Israel from Beersheba to Dan and bring me the total that I may know it.
1 Chronicles,21,3,And Joab answered May the Lord multiply His people a hundred times! But my lord the king are they not all my lord's servants? Why then does my lord require this? Why will he bring guilt upon Israel?
1 Chronicles,21,4,But the king's word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles,21,5,Joab gave the total number of the people to David. And all of Israel were 1100000 who drew the sword and of Judah 470000 who drew the sword.
1 Chronicles,21,6,But Levi and Benjamin he did not include among them for the king's order was detestable to Joab.
1 Chronicles,21,7,And God was displeased with this [reliance on human resources] and He smote Israel.
1 Chronicles,21,8,And David said to God I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing. But now I beseech You take away the hateful wickedness of Your servant; for I have done very foolishly.
1 Chronicles,21,9,And the Lord said to Gad David's seer
1 Chronicles,21,10,Go and tell David Thus says the Lord: I offer you three things; choose one of them that I may do it to you.
1 Chronicles,21,11,So Gad came to David and said to him Thus says the Lord: Take which one you will:
1 Chronicles,21,12,Either three years of famine or three months of devastation before your foes while the sword of your enemies overtakes you or else three days of the sword of the Lord and pestilence in the land and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to Him Who sent me.
1 Chronicles,21,13,And David said to Gad I am in great and distressing perplexity; let me fall I pray you into the hands of the Lord for very great and many are His mercies; but let me not fall into the hands of man.
1 Chronicles,21,14,So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel and there fell of Israel 70000 men.
