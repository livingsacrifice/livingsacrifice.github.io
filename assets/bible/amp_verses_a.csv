Genesis,1,1,IN THE beginning God (prepared formed fashioned and) created the heavens and the earth.
Genesis,1,2,The earth was without form and an empty waste and darkness was upon the face of the very great deep. The Spirit of God was moving (hovering brooding) over the face of the waters.
Genesis,1,3,And God said Let there be light; and there was light.
Genesis,1,4,And God saw that the light was good (suitable pleasant) and He approved it; and God separated the light from the darkness.
Genesis,1,5,And God called the light Day and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning one day.
Genesis,1,6,And God said Let there be a firmament [the expanse of the sky] in the midst of the waters and let it separate the waters [below] from the waters [above].
Genesis,1,7,And God made the firmament [the expanse] and separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse. And it was so.
Genesis,1,8,And God called the firmament Heavens. And there was evening and there was morning a second day.
Genesis,1,9,And God said Let the waters under the heavens be collected into one place [of standing] and let the dry land appear. And it was so.
Genesis,1,10,God called the dry land Earth and the accumulated waters He called Seas. And God saw that this was good (fitting admirable) and He approved it.
Genesis,1,11,And God said Let the earth put forth [tender] vegetation: plants yielding seed and fruit trees yielding fruit whose seed is in itself each according to its kind upon the earth. And it was so.
Genesis,1,12,The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed according to their own kinds and trees bearing fruit in which was their seed each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good (suitable admirable) and He approved it.
Genesis,1,13,And there was evening and there was morning a third day.
Genesis,1,14,And God said Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night and let them be signs and tokens [of God's provident care] and [to mark] seasons days and years
Genesis,1,15,And let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light upon the earth. And it was so.
Genesis,1,16,And God made the two great lights--the greater light (the sun) to rule the day and the lesser light (the moon) to rule the night. He also made the stars.
Genesis,1,17,And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth
Genesis,1,18,To rule over the day and over the night and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good (fitting pleasant) and He approved it.
Genesis,1,19,And there was evening and there was morning a fourth day.
Genesis,1,20,And God said Let the waters bring forth abundantly and swarm with living creatures and let birds fly over the earth in the open expanse of the heavens.
Genesis,1,21,God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves which the waters brought forth abundantly according to their kinds and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good (suitable admirable) and He approved it.
Genesis,1,22,And God blessed them saying Be fruitful multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let the fowl multiply in the earth.
Genesis,1,23,And there was evening and there was morning a fifth day.
Genesis,1,24,And God said Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: livestock creeping things and [wild] beasts of the earth according to their kinds. And it was so.
Genesis,1,25,And God made the [wild] beasts of the earth according to their kinds and domestic animals according to their kinds and everything that creeps upon the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good (fitting pleasant) and He approved it.
Genesis,1,26,God said Let Us [Father Son and Holy Spirit] make mankind in Our image after Our likeness and let them have complete authority over the fish of the sea the birds of the air the [tame] beasts and over all of the earth and over everything that creeps upon the earth.
Genesis,1,27,So God created man in His own image in the image and likeness of God He created him; male and female He created them.
Genesis,1,28,And God blessed them and said to them Be fruitful multiply and fill the earth and subdue it [using all its vast resources in the service of God and man]; and have dominion over the fish of the sea the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves upon the earth.
Genesis,1,29,And God said See I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the land and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food.
Genesis,1,30,And to all the animals on the earth and to every bird of the air and to everything that creeps on the ground--to everything in which there is the breath of life--I have given every green plant for food. And it was so.
Genesis,1,31,And God saw everything that He had made and behold it was very good (suitable pleasant) and He approved it completely. And there was evening and there was morning a sixth day.
Genesis,2,1,THUS THE heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them.
Genesis,2,2,And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.
Genesis,2,3,And God blessed (spoke good of) the seventh day set it apart as His own and hallowed it because on it God rested from all His work which He had created and done.
Genesis,2,4,This is the history of the heavens and of the earth when they were created. In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens--
Genesis,2,5,When no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up for the Lord God had not [yet] caused it to rain upon the earth and there was no man to till the ground
Genesis,2,6,But there went up a mist (fog vapor) from the land and watered the whole surface of the ground--
Genesis,2,7,Then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath or spirit of life and man became a living being.
Genesis,2,8,And the Lord God planted a garden toward the east in Eden [delight]; and there He put the man whom He had formed (framed constituted).
Genesis,2,9,And out of the ground the Lord God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight or to be desired--good (suitable pleasant) for food; the tree of life also in the center of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of [the difference between] good and evil and blessing and calamity.
Genesis,2,10,Now a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it divided and became four [river] heads.
Genesis,2,11,The first is named Pishon; it is the one flowing around the whole land of Havilah where there is gold.
Genesis,2,12,The gold of that land is of high quality; bdellium (pearl?) and onyx stone are there.
Genesis,2,13,The second river is named Gihon; it is the one flowing around the whole land of Cush.
Genesis,2,14,The third river is named Hiddekel [the Tigris]; it is the one flowing east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
Genesis,2,15,And the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to tend and guard and keep it.
Genesis,2,16,And the Lord God commanded the man saying You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;
Genesis,2,17,But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and blessing and calamity you shall not eat for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.
Genesis,2,18,Now the Lord God said It is not good (sufficient satisfactory) that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper meet (suitable adapted complementary) for him.
Genesis,2,19,And out of the ground the Lord God formed every [wild] beast and living creature of the field and every bird of the air and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them; and whatever Adam called every living creature that was its name.
Genesis,2,20,And Adam gave names to all the livestock and to the birds of the air and to every [wild] beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a helper meet (suitable adapted complementary) for him.
Genesis,2,21,And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam; and while he slept He took one of his ribs or a part of his side and closed up the [place with] flesh.
Genesis,2,22,And the rib or part of his side which the Lord God had taken from the man He built up and made into a woman and He brought her to the man.
Genesis,2,23,Then Adam said This [creature] is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman because she was taken out of a man.
Genesis,2,24,Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall become united and cleave to his wife and they shall become one flesh.
Genesis,2,25,And the man and his wife were both naked and were not embarrassed or ashamed in each other's presence.
Genesis,3,1,NOW THE serpent was more subtle and crafty than any living creature of the field which the Lord God had made. And he [Satan] said to the woman Can it really be that God has said You shall not eat from every tree of the garden?
Genesis,3,2,And the woman said to the serpent We may eat the fruit from the trees of the garden
Genesis,3,3,Except the fruit from the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die.
Genesis,3,4,But the serpent said to the woman You shall not surely die
Genesis,3,5,For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God knowing the difference between good and evil and blessing and calamity.
Genesis,3,6,And when the woman saw that the tree was good (suitable pleasant) for food and that it was delightful to look at and a tree to be desired in order to make one wise she took of its fruit and ate; and she gave some also to her husband and he ate.
Genesis,3,7,Then the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves apronlike girdles.
Genesis,3,8,And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.
Genesis,3,9,But the Lord God called to Adam and said to him Where are you?
Genesis,3,10,He said I heard the sound of You [walking] in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.
Genesis,3,11,And He said Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat?
Genesis,3,12,And the man said The woman whom You gave to be with me--she gave me [fruit] from the tree and I ate.
Genesis,3,13,And the Lord God said to the woman What is this you have done? And the woman said The serpent beguiled (cheated outwitted and deceived) me and I ate.
Genesis,3,14,And the Lord God said to the serpent Because you have done this you are cursed above all [domestic] animals and above every [wild] living thing of the field; upon your belly you shall go and you shall eat dust [and what it contains] all the days of your life.
Genesis,3,15,And I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her Offspring; He will bruise and tread your head underfoot and you will lie in wait and bruise His heel.
Genesis,3,16,To the woman He said I will greatly multiply your grief and your suffering in pregnancy and the pangs of childbearing; with spasms of distress you will bring forth children. Yet your desire and craving will be for your husband and he will rule over you.
Genesis,3,17,And to Adam He said Because you have listened and given heed to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you saying You shall not eat of it the ground is under a curse because of you; in sorrow and toil shall you eat [of the fruits] of it all the days of your life.
Genesis,3,18,Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth for you and you shall eat the plants of the field.
Genesis,3,19,In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread until you return to the ground for out of it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you shall return.
Genesis,3,20,The man called his wife's name Eve [life spring] because she was the mother of all the living.
Genesis,3,21,For Adam also and for his wife the Lord God made long coats (tunics) of skins and clothed them.
Genesis,3,22,And the Lord God said Behold the man has become like one of Us [the Father Son and Holy Spirit] to know [how to distinguish between] good and evil and blessing and calamity; and now lest he put forth his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat and live forever--
Genesis,3,23,Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken.
Genesis,3,24,So [God] drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden the cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep and guard the way to the tree of life.
Genesis,4,1,AND ADAM knew Eve as his wife and she became pregnant and bore Cain; and she said I have gotten and gained a man with the help of the Lord.
Genesis,4,2,And [next] she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
Genesis,4,3,And in the course of time Cain brought to the Lord an offering of the fruit of the ground.
Genesis,4,4,And Abel brought of the firstborn of his flock and of the fat portions. And the Lord had respect and regard for Abel and for his offering
Genesis,4,5,But for Cain and his offering He had no respect or regard. So Cain was exceedingly angry and indignant and he looked sad and depressed.
Genesis,4,6,And the Lord said to Cain Why are you angry? And why do you look sad and depressed and dejected?
Genesis,4,7,If you do well will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well sin crouches at your door; its desire is for you but you must master it.
Genesis,4,8,And Cain said to his brother Let us go out to the field. And when they were in the field Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.
Genesis,4,9,And the Lord said to Cain Where is Abel your brother? And he said I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?
Genesis,4,10,And [the Lord] said What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to Me from the ground.
Genesis,4,11,And now you are cursed by reason of the earth which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's [shed] blood from your hand.
Genesis,4,12,When you till the ground it shall no longer yield to you its strength; you shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth [in perpetual exile a degraded outcast].
Genesis,4,13,Then Cain said to the Lord My punishment is greater than I can bear.
Genesis,4,14,Behold You have driven me out this day from the face of the land and from Your face I will be hidden; and I will be a fugitive and a vagabond and a wanderer on the earth and whoever finds me will kill me.
Genesis,4,15,And the Lord said to him Therefore if anyone kills Cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark or sign upon Cain lest anyone finding him should kill him.
Genesis,4,16,So Cain went away from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod [wandering] east of Eden.
Genesis,4,17,And Cain's wife [one of Adam's offspring] became pregnant and bore Enoch; and Cain built a city and named it after his son Enoch.
Genesis,4,18,To Enoch was born Irad and Irad was the father of Mehujael and Mehujael the father of Methusael and Methusael the father of Lamech.
Genesis,4,19,And Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah and of the other was Zillah.
Genesis,4,20,Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle and purchase possessions.
Genesis,4,21,His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
Genesis,4,22,Zillah bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all [cutting] instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
Genesis,4,23,Lamech said to his wives Adah and Zillah Hear my voice; you wives of Lamech listen to what I say; for I have slain a man [merely] for wounding me and a young man [only] for striking and bruising me.
Genesis,4,24,If Cain is avenged sevenfold truly Lamech [will be avenged] seventy-sevenfold.
Genesis,4,25,And Adam's wife again became pregnant and she bore a son and called his name Seth. For God she said has appointed for me another child instead of Abel for Cain slew him.
Genesis,4,26,And to Seth also a son was born whom he named Enosh. At that time men began to call [upon God] by the name of the Lord.
Genesis,5,1,THIS IS the book (the written record the history) of the generations of the offspring of Adam. When God created man He made him in the likeness of God.
Genesis,5,2,He created them male and female and blessed them and named them [both] Adam [Man] at the time they were created.
Genesis,5,3,When Adam had lived 130 years he had a son in his own likeness after his image; and he named him Seth.
Genesis,5,4,After he had Seth Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,5,5,So altogether Adam lived 930 years and he died.
Genesis,5,6,When Seth was 105 years old Enosh was born.
Genesis,5,7,Seth lived after the birth of Enosh 807 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,5,8,So Seth lived 912 years and he died.
Genesis,5,9,When Enosh was 90 years old Kenan was born to him.
Genesis,5,10,Enosh lived after the birth of Kenan 815 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,5,11,So Enosh lived 905 years and he died.
Genesis,5,12,When Kenan was 70 years old Mahalalel was born.
Genesis,5,13,Kenan lived after the birth of Mahalalel 840 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,5,14,So Kenan lived 910 years and he died.
Genesis,5,15,When Mahalalel was 65 years old Jared was born.
Genesis,5,16,Mahalalel lived after the birth of Jared 830 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,5,17,So Mahalalel lived 895 years and he died.
Genesis,5,18,When Jared was 162 years old Enoch was born.
Genesis,5,19,Jared lived after the birth of Enoch 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,5,20,So Jared lived 962 years and he died.
Genesis,5,21,When Enoch was 65 years old Methuselah was born.
Genesis,5,22,Enoch walked [in habitual fellowship] with God after the birth of Methuselah 300 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,5,23,So all the days of Enoch were 365 years.
Genesis,5,24,And Enoch walked [in habitual fellowship] with God; and he was not for God took him [home with Him].
Genesis,5,25,When Methuselah was 187 years old Lamech was born to him.
Genesis,5,26,Methuselah lived after the birth of Lamech 782 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,5,27,So Methuselah lived 969 years and he died.
Genesis,5,28,When Lamech was 182 years old a son was born.
Genesis,5,29,He named him Noah saying This one shall bring us relief and comfort from our work and the [grievous] toil of our hands due to the ground being cursed by the Lord.
Genesis,5,30,Lamech lived after the birth of Noah 595 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,5,31,So all the days of Lamech were 777 years and he died.
Genesis,5,32,After Noah was 500 years old he became the father of Shem Ham and Japheth.
Genesis,6,1,WHEN MEN began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them
Genesis,6,2,The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair and they took wives of all they desired and chose.
Genesis,6,3,Then the Lord said My Spirit shall not forever dwell and strive with man for he also is flesh; but his days shall yet be 120 years.
Genesis,6,4,There were giants on the earth in those days--and also afterward--when the sons of God lived with the daughters of men and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old men of renown.
Genesis,6,5,The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination and intention of all human thinking was only evil continually.
Genesis,6,6,And the Lord regretted that He had made man on the earth and He was grieved at heart.
Genesis,6,7,So the Lord said I will destroy blot out and wipe away mankind whom I have created from the face of the ground--not only man [but] the beasts and the creeping things and the birds of the air--for it grieves Me and makes Me regretful that I have made them.
Genesis,6,8,But Noah found grace (favor) in the eyes of the Lord.
Genesis,6,9,This is the history of the generations of Noah. Noah was a just and righteous man blameless in his [evil] generation; Noah walked [in habitual fellowship] with God.
Genesis,6,10,And Noah became the father of three sons: Shem Ham and Japheth.
Genesis,6,11,The earth was depraved and putrid in God's sight and the land was filled with violence (desecration infringement outrage assault and lust for power).
Genesis,6,12,And God looked upon the world and saw how degenerate debased and vicious it was for all humanity had corrupted their way upon the earth and lost their true direction.
Genesis,6,13,God said to Noah I intend to make an end of all flesh for through men the land is filled with violence; and behold I will destroy them and the land.
Genesis,6,14,Make yourself an ark of gopher or cypress wood; make in it rooms (stalls pens coops nests cages and compartments) and cover it inside and out with pitch (bitumen).
Genesis,6,15,And this is the way you are to make it: the length of the ark shall be 300 cubits its breadth 50 cubits and its height 30 cubits [that is 450 ft. x 75 ft. x 45 ft.].
Genesis,6,16,You shall make a roof or window [a place for light] for the ark and finish it to a cubit [at least 18 inches] above--and the door of the ark you shall put in the side of it; and you shall make it with lower second and third stories.
Genesis,6,17,For behold I even I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy and make putrid all flesh under the heavens in which are the breath and spirit of life; everything that is on the land shall die.
Genesis,6,18,But I will establish My covenant (promise pledge) with you and you shall come into the ark--you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you.
Genesis,6,19,And of every living thing of all flesh [found on land] you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.
Genesis,6,20,Of fowls and birds according to their kinds of beasts according to their kinds of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind--two of every sort shall come in with you that they may be kept alive.
Genesis,6,21,Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten and you shall collect and store it up and it shall serve as food for you and for them.
Genesis,6,22,Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.
Genesis,7,1,AND THE Lord said to Noah Come with all your household into the ark for I have seen you to be righteous (upright and in right standing) before Me in this generation.
Genesis,7,2,Of every clean beast you shall receive and take with you seven pairs the male and his mate and of beasts that are not clean a pair of each kind the male and his mate
Genesis,7,3,Also of the birds of the air seven pairs the male and the female to keep seed [their kind] alive over all the earth or land.
Genesis,7,4,For in seven days I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights and every living substance and thing that I have made I will destroy blot out and wipe away from the face of the earth.
Genesis,7,5,And Noah did all that the Lord commanded him.
Genesis,7,6,Noah was 600 years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth or land.
Genesis,7,7,And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him went into the ark because of the waters of the flood.
Genesis,7,8,Of clean animals and of animals that are not clean and of birds and fowls and of everything that creeps on the ground
Genesis,7,9,There went in two and two with Noah into the ark the male and the female as God had commanded Noah.
Genesis,7,10,And after the seven days the floodwaters came upon the earth or land.
Genesis,7,11,In the year 600 of Noah's life in the seventeenth day of the second month that same day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up and burst forth and the windows and floodgates of the heavens were opened.
Genesis,7,12,And it rained upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
Genesis,7,13,On the very same day Noah and Shem Ham and Japheth the sons of Noah and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them went into the ark
Genesis,7,14,They and every [wild] beast according to its kind all the livestock according to their kinds every moving thing that creeps on the land according to its kind and every fowl according to its kind every winged thing of every sort.
Genesis,7,15,And they went into the ark with Noah two and two of all flesh in which there were the breath and spirit of life.
Genesis,7,16,And they that entered male and female of all flesh went in as God had commanded [Noah]; and the Lord shut him in and closed [the door] round about him.
Genesis,7,17,The flood [that is the downpour of rain] was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased and bore up the ark and it was lifted [high] above the land.
Genesis,7,18,And the waters became mighty and increased greatly upon the land and the ark went [gently floating] upon the surface of the waters.
Genesis,7,19,And the waters prevailed so exceedingly and were so mighty upon the earth that all the high hills under the whole sky were covered.
Genesis,7,20,[In fact] the waters became fifteen cubits higher as the high hills were covered.
Genesis,7,21,And all flesh ceased to breathe that moved upon the earth--fowls and birds [tame] animals [wild] beasts all swarming and creeping things that swarm and creep upon the land and all mankind.
Genesis,7,22,Everything on the dry land in whose nostrils were the breath and spirit of life died.
Genesis,7,23,God destroyed (blotted out) every living thing that was upon the face of the earth; man and animals and the creeping things and the birds of the heavens were destroyed (blotted out) from the land. Only Noah remained alive and those who were with him in the ark.
Genesis,7,24,And the waters prevailed [mightily] upon the earth or land 150 days (five months).
Genesis,8,1,AND GOD [earnestly] remembered Noah and every living thing and all the animals that were with him in the ark; and God made a wind blow over the land and the waters sank down and abated.
Genesis,8,2,Also the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed the gushing rain from the sky was checked
Genesis,8,3,And the waters receded from the land continually. At the end of 150 days the waters had diminished.
Genesis,8,4,On the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat [in Armenia].
Genesis,8,5,And the waters continued to diminish until the tenth month; on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the high hills were seen.
Genesis,8,6,At the end of [another] forty days Noah opened a window of the ark which he had made
Genesis,8,7,And sent forth a raven which kept going to and fro until the waters were dried up from the land.
Genesis,8,8,Then he sent forth a dove to see if the waters had decreased from the surface of the ground.
Genesis,8,9,But the dove found no resting-place on which to roost and she returned to him to the ark for the waters were [yet] on the face of the whole land. So he put forth his hand and drew her to him into the ark.
Genesis,8,10,He waited another seven days and again sent forth the dove out of the ark.
Genesis,8,11,And the dove came back to him in the evening and behold in her mouth was a newly sprouted and freshly plucked olive leaf! So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the land.
Genesis,8,12,Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove but she did not return to him any more.
Genesis,8,13,In the year 601 [of Noah's life] on the first day of the first month the waters were drying up from the land. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the surface of the ground was drying.
Genesis,8,14,And on the twenty-seventh day of the second month the land was entirely dry.
Genesis,8,15,And God spoke to Noah saying
Genesis,8,16,Go forth from the ark you and your wife and your sons and their wives with you.
Genesis,8,17,Bring forth every living thing that is with you of all flesh--birds and beasts and every creeping thing that creeps on the ground--that they may breed abundantly on the land and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.
Genesis,8,18,And Noah went forth and his wife and his sons and their wives with him [after being in the ark one year and ten days].
Genesis,8,19,Every beast every creeping thing every bird--and whatever moves on the land--went forth by families out of the ark.
Genesis,8,20,And Noah built an altar to the Lord and took of every clean [four-footed] animal and of every clean fowl or bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
Genesis,8,21,When the Lord smelled the pleasing odor [a scent of satisfaction to His heart] the Lord said to Himself I will never again curse the ground because of man for the imagination (the strong desire) of man's heart is evil and wicked from his youth; neither will I ever again smite and destroy every living thing as I have done.
Genesis,8,22,While the earth remains seedtime and harvest cold and heat summer and winter and day and night shall not cease.
Genesis,9,1,AND GOD pronounced a blessing upon Noah and his sons and said to them Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
Genesis,9,2,And the fear of you and the dread and terror of you shall be upon every beast of the land every bird of the air all that creeps upon the ground and upon all the fish of the sea; they are delivered into your hand.
Genesis,9,3,Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and as I gave you the green vegetables and plants I give you everything.
Genesis,9,4,But you shall not eat flesh with the life of it which is its blood.
Genesis,9,5,And surely for your lifeblood I will require an accounting; from every beast I will require it; and from man from every man [who spills another's lifeblood] I will require a reckoning.
Genesis,9,6,Whoever sheds man's blood by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God He made man.
Genesis,9,7,And you be fruitful and multiply; bring forth abundantly on the earth and multiply on it.
Genesis,9,8,Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him saying
Genesis,9,9,Behold I establish My covenant or pledge with you and with your descendants after you
Genesis,9,10,And with every living creature that is with you--whether the birds the livestock or the wild beasts of the earth along with you as many as came out of the ark--every animal of the earth.
Genesis,9,11,I will establish My covenant or pledge with you: Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood; neither shall there ever again be a flood to destroy the earth and make it corrupt.
Genesis,9,12,And God said This is the token of the covenant (solemn pledge) which I am making between Me and you and every living creature that is with you for all future generations:
Genesis,9,13,I set My bow [rainbow] in the cloud and it shall be a token or sign of a covenant or solemn pledge between Me and the earth.
Genesis,9,14,And it shall be that when I bring clouds over the earth and the bow [rainbow] is seen in the clouds
Genesis,9,15,I will [earnestly] remember My covenant or solemn pledge which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy and make all flesh corrupt.
Genesis,9,16,When the bow [rainbow] is in the clouds and I look upon it I will [earnestly] remember the everlasting covenant or pledge between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
Genesis,9,17,And God said to Noah This [rainbow] is the token or sign of the covenant or solemn pledge which I have established between Me and all flesh upon the earth.
Genesis,9,18,The sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem Ham and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan [born later].
Genesis,9,19,These are the three sons of Noah and from them the whole earth was overspread and stocked with inhabitants.
Genesis,9,20,And Noah began to cultivate the ground and he planted a vineyard.
Genesis,9,21,And he drank of the wine and became drunk and he was uncovered and lay naked in his tent.
Genesis,9,22,And Ham the father of Canaan glanced at and saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside.
Genesis,9,23,So Shem and Japheth took a garment laid it upon the shoulders of both and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward and they did not see their father's nakedness.
Genesis,9,24,When Noah awoke from his wine and knew the thing which his youngest son had done to him
Genesis,9,25,He exclaimed Cursed be Canaan! He shall be the servant of servants to his brethren!
Genesis,9,26,He also said Blessed be the Lord the God of Shem! And blessed by the Lord my God be Shem! And let Canaan be his servant.
Genesis,9,27,May God enlarge Japheth; and let him dwell in the tents of Shem and let Canaan be his servant.
Genesis,9,28,And Noah lived after the flood 350 years.
Genesis,9,29,All the days of Noah were 950 years and he died.
Genesis,10,1,THIS IS the history of the generations (descendants) of the sons of Noah Shem Ham and Japheth. The sons born to them after the flood were:
Genesis,10,2,The sons of Japheth: Gomer Magog Madai Javan Tubal Meshech and Tiras.
Genesis,10,3,The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz Riphath and Togarmah.
Genesis,10,4,The sons of Javan: Elishah Tarshish Kittim and Dodanim.
Genesis,10,5,From these the coastland peoples spread. [These are the sons of Japheth] in their lands each with his own language by their families within their nations.
Genesis,10,6,The sons of Ham: Cush Egypt [Mizraim] Put and Canaan.
Genesis,10,7,The sons of Cush: Seba Havilah Sabtah Raamah and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
Genesis,10,8,Cush became the father of Nimrod; he was the first to be a mighty man on the earth.
Genesis,10,9,He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; therefore it is said Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the Lord.
Genesis,10,10,The beginning of his kingdom was Babel Erech Accad and Calneh in the land of Shinar [in Babylonia].
Genesis,10,11,Out of the land he [Nimrod] went forth into Assyria and built Nineveh Rehoboth-Ir Calah
Genesis,10,12,And Resen which is between Nineveh and Calah; all these [suburbs combined to form] the great city.
Genesis,10,13,And Egypt [Mizraim] became the father of Ludim Anamim Lehabim Naphtuhim
Genesis,10,14,Pathrusim Casluhim (from whom came the Philistines) and Caphtorim.
Genesis,10,15,Canaan became the father of Sidon his firstborn Heth [the Hittites]
Genesis,10,16,The Jebusites the Amorites the Girgashites
Genesis,10,17,The Hivites the Arkites the Sinites
Genesis,10,18,The Arvadites the Zemarites and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites spread abroad
Genesis,10,19,And the territory of the Canaanites extended from Sidon as one goes to Gerar as far as Gaza and as one goes to Sodom Gomorrah Admah and Zeboiim as far as Lasha.
Genesis,10,20,These are the sons of Ham by their families their languages their lands and their nations.
Genesis,10,21,To Shem also the younger brother of Japheth and the ancestor of all the children of Eber [including the Hebrews] children were born.
Genesis,10,22,The sons of Shem: Elam Asshur Arpachshad Lud and Aram.
Genesis,10,23,The sons of Aram: Uz Hul Gether and Mash.
Genesis,10,24,Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber.
Genesis,10,25,To Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg [division] because [the inhabitants of] the earth were divided up in his days; and his brother's name was Joktan.
Genesis,10,26,Joktan became the father of Almodad Sheleph Hazarmaveth Jerah
Genesis,10,27,Hadoram Uzal Diklah
Genesis,10,28,Obal Abimael Sheba
Genesis,10,29,Ophir Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
Genesis,10,30,The territory in which they lived extended from Mesha as one goes toward Sephar to the hill country of the east.
Genesis,10,31,These are Shem's descendants by their families their languages their lands and their nations.
Genesis,10,32,These are the families of the sons of Noah according to their generations within their nations; and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood.
Genesis,11,1,AND THE whole earth was of one language and of one accent and mode of expression.
Genesis,11,2,And as they journeyed eastward they found a plain (valley) in the land of Shinar and they settled and dwelt there.
Genesis,11,3,And they said one to another Come let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly. So they had brick for stone and slime (bitumen) for mortar.
Genesis,11,4,And they said Come let us build us a city and a tower whose top reaches into the sky and let us make a name for ourselves lest we be scattered over the whole earth.
Genesis,11,5,And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built.
Genesis,11,6,And the Lord said Behold they are one people and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do and now nothing they have imagined they can do will be impossible for them.
Genesis,11,7,Come let Us go down and there confound (mix up confuse) their language that they may not understand one another's speech.
Genesis,11,8,So the Lord scattered them abroad from that place upon the face of the whole earth and they gave up building the city.
Genesis,11,9,Therefore the name of it was called Babel--because there the Lord confounded the language of all the earth; and from that place the Lord scattered them abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
Genesis,11,10,This is the history of the generations of Shem. Shem was 100 years old when he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood.
Genesis,11,11,And Shem lived after Arpachshad was born 500 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,11,12,When Arpachshad had lived 35 years he became the father of Shelah.
Genesis,11,13,Arpachshad lived after Shelah was born 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,11,14,When Shelah had lived 30 years he became the father of Eber.
Genesis,11,15,Shelah lived after Eber was born 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,11,16,When Eber had lived 34 years he became the father of Peleg.
Genesis,11,17,And Eber lived after Peleg was born 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,11,18,When Peleg had lived 30 years he became the father of Reu.
Genesis,11,19,And Peleg lived after Reu was born 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,11,20,When Reu had lived 32 years he became the father of Serug.
Genesis,11,21,And Reu lived after Serug was born 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,11,22,When Serug had lived 30 years he became the father of Nahor.
Genesis,11,23,And Serug lived after Nahor was born 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,11,24,When Nahor had lived 29 years he became the father of Terah.
Genesis,11,25,And Nahor lived after Terah was born 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis,11,26,After Terah had lived 70 years he became the father of [at different times] Abram and Nahor and Haran [his firstborn].
Genesis,11,27,Now this is the history of the descendants of Terah. Terah was the father of Abram Nahor and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot.
Genesis,11,28,Haran died before his father Terah [died] in the land of his birth in Ur of the Chaldees.
Genesis,11,29,And Abram and Nahor took wives. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah.
Genesis,11,30,But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
Genesis,11,31,And Terah took Abram his son Lot the son of Haran his grandson and Sarai his daughter-in-law his son Abram's wife and they went forth together to go from Ur of the Chaldees into the land of Canaan; but when they came to Haran they settled there.
Genesis,11,32,And Terah lived 205 years; and Terah died in Haran.
Genesis,12,1,NOW [in Haran] the Lord said to Abram Go for yourself [for your own advantage] away from your country from your relatives and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
Genesis,12,2,And I will make of you a great nation and I will bless you [with abundant increase of favors] and make your name famous and distinguished and you will be a blessing [dispensing good to others].
Genesis,12,3,And I will bless those who bless you [who confer prosperity or happiness upon you] and curse him who curses or uses insolent language toward you; in you will all the families and kindred of the earth be blessed [and by you they will bless themselves].
Genesis,12,4,So Abram departed as the Lord had directed him; and Lot [his nephew] went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran.
Genesis,12,5,Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother's son and all their possessions that they had gathered and the persons [servants] that they had acquired in Haran and they went forth to go to the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan
Genesis,12,6,Abram passed through the land to the locality of Shechem to the oak or terebinth tree of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
Genesis,12,7,Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said I will give this land to your posterity. So Abram built an altar there to the Lord Who had appeared to him.
Genesis,12,8,From there he pulled up [his tent pegs] and departed to the mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord.
Genesis,12,9,Abram journeyed on still going toward the South (the Negeb).
Genesis,12,10,Now there was a famine in the land and Abram went down into Egypt to live temporarily for the famine in the land was oppressive (intense and grievous).
Genesis,12,11,And when he was about to enter into Egypt he said to Sarai his wife I know that you are beautiful to behold.
Genesis,12,12,So when the Egyptians see you they will say This is his wife; and they will kill me but they will let you live.
Genesis,12,13,Say I beg of you that you are my sister so that it may go well with me for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.
Genesis,12,14,And when Abram came into Egypt the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
Genesis,12,15,The princes of Pharaoh also saw her and commended her to Pharaoh and she was taken into Pharaoh's house [harem].
Genesis,12,16,And he treated Abram well for her sake; he acquired sheep oxen he-donkeys menservants maidservants she-donkeys and camels.
Genesis,12,17,But the Lord scourged Pharaoh and his household with serious plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.
Genesis,12,18,And Pharaoh called Abram and said What is this that you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
Genesis,12,19,Why did you say She is my sister so that I took her to be my wife? Now then here is your wife; take her and get away [from here]!
Genesis,12,20,And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they brought him on his way with his wife and all that he had.
Genesis,13,1,SO ABRAM went up out of Egypt he and his wife and all that he had and Lot with him into the South [country of Judah the Negeb].
Genesis,13,2,Now Abram was extremely rich in livestock and in silver and in gold.
Genesis,13,3,And he journeyed on from the South [country of Judah the Negeb] as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning between Bethel and Ai
Genesis,13,4,Where he had built an altar at first; and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.
Genesis,13,5,But Lot who went with Abram also had flocks and herds and tents.
Genesis,13,6,Now the land was not able to nourish and support them so they could dwell together for their possessions were too great for them to live together.
Genesis,13,7,And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite were dwelling then in the land [making fodder more difficult to obtain].
Genesis,13,8,So Abram said to Lot Let there be no strife I beg of you between you and me or between your herdsmen and my herdsmen for we are relatives.
Genesis,13,9,Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself I beg of you from me. If you take the left hand then I will go to the right; or if you choose the right hand then I will go to the left.
Genesis,13,10,And Lot looked and saw that everywhere the Jordan Valley was well watered. Before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah [it was all] like the garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt as you go to Zoar.
Genesis,13,11,Then Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley and [he] traveled east. So they separated.
Genesis,13,12,Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan and Lot dwelt in the cities of the [Jordan] Valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom and dwelt there.
Genesis,13,13,But the men of Sodom were wicked and exceedingly great sinners against the Lord.
Genesis,13,14,The Lord said to Abram after Lot had left him Lift up now your eyes and look from the place where you are northward and southward and eastward and westward;
Genesis,13,15,For all the land which you see I will give to you and to your posterity forever.
Genesis,13,16,And I will make your descendants like the dust of the earth so that if a man could count the dust of the earth then could your descendants also be counted.
Genesis,13,17,Arise walk through the land the length of it and the breadth of it for I will give it to you.
Genesis,13,18,Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt among the oaks or terebinths of Mamre which are at Hebron and built there an altar to the Lord.
Genesis,14,1,IN THE days of the kings Amraphel of Shinar Arioch of Ellasar Chedorlaomer of Elam and Tidal of Goiim
Genesis,14,2,They made war on the kings Bera of Sodom Birsha of Gomorrah Shinab of Admah Shemeber of Zeboiim and the king of Bela that is Zoar.
Genesis,14,3,The latter kings joined together [as allies] in the Valley of Siddim which is [now] the [Dead] Sea of Salt.
Genesis,14,4,Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
Genesis,14,5,And in the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him attacked and subdued the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim the Zuzim in Ham and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim
Genesis,14,6,And the Horites in their Mount Seir as far as El-paran which is on the border of the wilderness.
Genesis,14,7,Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat which [now] is Kadesh and subdued all the country of the Amalekites and also the Amorites who dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.
Genesis,14,8,Then the kings of Sodom Gomorrah Admah Zeboiim and Bela that is Zoar went out and [together] they joined battle [with those kings] in the Valley of Siddim
Genesis,14,9,With the kings Chedorlaomer of Elam Tidal of Goiim Amraphel of Shinar and Arioch of Ellasar--four kings against five.
Genesis,14,10,Now the Valley of Siddim was full of slime or bitumen pits and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled they fell (were overthrown) there and the remainder [of the kings] fled to the mountain.
Genesis,14,11,[The victors] took all the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah and all the supply of provisions and departed.
Genesis,14,12,And they also took Lot Abram's brother's son who dwelt in Sodom and his goods away with them.
Genesis,14,13,Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew [one from the other side] who was living by the oaks or terebinths of Mamre the Amorite a brother of Eshcol and of Aner--these were allies of Abram.
Genesis,14,14,When Abram heard that [his nephew] had been captured he armed (led forth) the 318 trained servants born in his own house and pursued the enemy as far as Dan.
Genesis,14,15,He divided his forces against them by night he and his servants and attacked and routed them and pursued them as far as Hobah which is north of Damascus.
Genesis,14,16,And he brought back all the goods and also brought back his kinsman Lot and his possessions the women also and the people.
Genesis,14,17,After his [Abram's] return from the defeat and slaying of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh that is the King's Valley.
Genesis,14,18,Melchizedek king of Salem [later called Jerusalem] brought out bread and wine [for their nourishment]; he was the priest of God Most High
Genesis,14,19,And he blessed him and said Blessed (favored with blessings made blissful joyful) be Abram by God Most High Possessor and Maker of heaven and earth
Genesis,14,20,And blessed praised and glorified be God Most High Who has given your foes into your hand! And [Abram] gave him a tenth of all [he had taken].
Genesis,14,21,And the king of Sodom said to Abram Give me the persons and keep the goods for yourself.
Genesis,14,22,But Abram said to the king of Sodom I have lifted up my hand and sworn to the Lord God Most High the Possessor and Maker of heaven and earth
Genesis,14,23,That I would not take a thread or a shoelace or anything that is yours lest you should say I have made Abram rich.
Genesis,14,24,[Take all] except only what my young men have eaten and the share of the men [allies] who went with me--Aner Eshcol and Mamre; let them take their portion.
Genesis,15,1,AFTER THESE things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision saying Fear not Abram I am your Shield your abundant compensation and your reward shall be exceedingly great.
Genesis,15,2,And Abram said Lord God what can You give me since I am going on [from this world] childless and he who shall be the owner and heir of my house is this [steward] Eliezer of Damascus?
Genesis,15,3,And Abram continued Look You have given me no child; and [a servant] born in my house is my heir.
Genesis,15,4,And behold the word of the Lord came to him saying This man shall not be your heir but he who shall come from your own body shall be your heir.
Genesis,15,5,And He brought him outside [his tent into the starlight] and said Look now toward the heavens and count the stars--if you are able to number them. Then He said to him So shall your descendants be.
Genesis,15,6,And he [Abram] believed in (trusted in relied on remained steadfast to) the Lord and He counted it to him as righteousness (right standing with God).
Genesis,15,7,And He said to him I am the [same] Lord Who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees to give you this land as an inheritance.
Genesis,15,8,But he [Abram] said Lord God by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?
Genesis,15,9,And He said to him Bring to Me a heifer three years old a she-goat three years old a ram three years old a turtledove and a young pigeon.
Genesis,15,10,And he brought Him all these and cut them down the middle [into halves] and laid each half opposite the other; but the birds he did not divide.
Genesis,15,11,And when the birds of prey swooped down upon the carcasses Abram drove them away.
Genesis,15,12,When the sun was setting a deep sleep overcame Abram and a horror (a terror a shuddering fear) of great darkness assailed and oppressed him.
Genesis,15,13,And [God] said to Abram Know positively that your descendants will be strangers dwelling as temporary residents in a land that is not theirs [Egypt] and they will be slaves there and will be afflicted and oppressed for 400 years. [Fulfilled in Exod. 12:40.]
Genesis,15,14,But I will bring judgment on that nation whom they will serve and afterward they will come out with great possessions.
Genesis,15,15,And you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried at a good old (hoary) age.
Genesis,15,16,And in the fourth generation they [your descendants] shall come back here [to Canaan] again for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full and complete.
Genesis,15,17,When the sun had gone down and a [thick] darkness had come on behold a smoking oven and a flaming torch passed between those pieces.
Genesis,15,18,On the same day the Lord made a covenant (promise pledge) with Abram saying To your descendants I have given this land from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates--the land of
Genesis,15,19,The Kenites the Kenizzites the Kadmonites
Genesis,15,20,The Hittites the Perizzites the Rephaim
Genesis,15,21,The Amorites the Canaanites the Girgashites and the Jebusites.
Genesis,16,1,NOW SARAI Abram's wife had borne him no children. She had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar.
Genesis,16,2,And Sarai said to Abram See here the Lord has restrained me from bearing [children]. I am asking you to have intercourse with my maid; it may be that I can obtain children by her. And Abram listened to and heeded what Sarai said.
Genesis,16,3,So Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her Egyptian maid after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan and gave her to her husband Abram to be his [secondary] wife.
Genesis,16,4,And he had intercourse with Hagar and she became pregnant; and when she saw that she was with child she looked with contempt upon her mistress and despised her.
Genesis,16,5,Then Sarai said to Abram May [the responsibility for] my wrong and deprivation of rights be upon you! I gave my maid into your bosom and when she saw that she was with child I was contemptible and despised in her eyes. May the Lord be the judge between you and me.
Genesis,16,6,But Abram said to Sarai See here your maid is in your hands and power; do as you please with her. And when Sarai dealt severely with her humbling and afflicting her she [Hagar] fled from her.
Genesis,16,7,But the Angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness on the road to Shur.
Genesis,16,8,And He said Hagar Sarai's maid where did you come from and where are you intending to go? And she said I am running away from my mistress Sarai.
Genesis,16,9,The Angel of the Lord said to her Go back to your mistress and [humbly] submit to her control.
Genesis,16,10,Also the Angel of the Lord said to her I will multiply your descendants exceedingly so that they shall not be numbered for multitude.
Genesis,16,11,And the Angel of the Lord continued See now you are with child and shall bear a son and shall call his name Ishmael [God hears] because the Lord has heard and paid attention to your affliction.
Genesis,16,12,And he [Ishmael] will be as a wild ass among men; his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he will live to the east and on the borders of all his kinsmen.
Genesis,16,13,So she called the name of the Lord Who spoke to her You are a God of seeing for she said Have I [not] even here [in the wilderness] looked upon Him Who sees me [and lived]? Or have I here also seen [the future purposes or designs of] Him Who sees me?
Genesis,16,14,Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi [A well to the Living One Who sees me]; it is between Kadesh and Bered.
Genesis,16,15,And Hagar bore Abram a son and Abram called the name of his son whom Hagar bore Ishmael.
Genesis,16,16,Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael.
Genesis,17,1,WHEN ABRAM was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to him and said I am the Almighty God; walk and live habitually before Me and be perfect (blameless wholehearted complete).
Genesis,17,2,And I will make My covenant (solemn pledge) between Me and you and will multiply you exceedingly.
Genesis,17,3,Then Abram fell on his face and God said to him
Genesis,17,4,As for Me behold My covenant (solemn pledge) is with you and you shall be the father of many nations.
Genesis,17,5,Nor shall your name any longer be Abram [high exalted father]; but your name shall be Abraham [father of a multitude] for I have made you the father of many nations.
Genesis,17,6,And I will make you exceedingly fruitful and I will make nations of you and kings will come from you.
Genesis,17,7,And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting solemn pledge to be a God to you and to your posterity after you.
Genesis,17,8,And I will give to you and to your posterity after you the land in which you are a stranger [going from place to place] all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
Genesis,17,9,And God said to Abraham As for you you shall therefore keep My covenant you and your descendants after you throughout their generations.
Genesis,17,10,This is My covenant which you shall keep between Me and you and your posterity after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
Genesis,17,11,And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token or sign of the covenant (the promise or pledge) between Me and you.
Genesis,17,12,He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised every male throughout your generations whether born in [your] house or bought with [your] money from any foreigner not of your offspring.
Genesis,17,13,He that is born in your house and he that is bought with your money must be circumcised; and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
Genesis,17,14,And the male who is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.
Genesis,17,15,And God said to Abraham As for Sarai your wife you shall not call her name Sarai; but Sarah [Princess] her name shall be.
Genesis,17,16,And I will bless her and give you a son also by her. Yes I will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall come from her.
Genesis,17,17,Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? And shall Sarah who is ninety years old bear a son?
Genesis,17,18,And [he] said to God Oh that Ishmael might live before You!
Genesis,17,19,But God said Sarah your wife shall bear you a son indeed and you shall call his name Isaac [laughter]; and I will establish My covenant or solemn pledge with him for an everlasting covenant and with his posterity after him.
Genesis,17,20,And as for Ishmael I have heard and heeded you: behold I will bless him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly; He will be the father of twelve princes and I will make him a great nation. [Fulfilled in Gen. 25:12-18.]
Genesis,17,21,But My covenant My promise and pledge I will establish with Isaac whom Sarah will bear to you at this season next year.
Genesis,17,22,And God stopped talking with him and went up from Abraham.
Genesis,17,23,And Abraham took Ishmael his son and all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money every male among [those] of Abraham's house and circumcised [them] the very same day as God had said to him.
Genesis,17,24,And Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised.
Genesis,17,25,And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised.
Genesis,17,26,On the very same day Abraham was circumcised and Ishmael his son as well.
Genesis,17,27,And all the men of his house both those born in the house and those bought with money from a foreigner were circumcised along with him.
Genesis,18,1,NOW THE Lord appeared to Abraham by the oaks or terebinths of Mamre; as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day
Genesis,18,2,He lifted up his eyes and looked and behold three men stood at a little distance from him. He ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the ground
Genesis,18,3,And said My lord if now I have found favor in your sight do not pass by your servant I beg of you.
Genesis,18,4,Let a little water be brought and you may wash your feet and recline and rest yourselves under the tree.
Genesis,18,5,And I will bring a morsel (mouthful) of bread to refresh and sustain your hearts before you go on further--for that is why you have come to your servant. And they replied Do as you have said.
Genesis,18,6,So Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah and said Quickly get ready three measures of fine meal knead it and bake cakes.
Genesis,18,7,And Abraham ran to the herd and brought a calf tender and good and gave it to the young man [to butcher]; then he [Abraham] hastened to prepare it.
Genesis,18,8,And he took curds and milk and the calf which he had made ready and set it before [the men]; and he stood by them under the tree while they ate.
Genesis,18,9,And they said to him Where is Sarah your wife? And he said [She is here] in the tent.
Genesis,18,10,[The Lord] said I will surely return to you when the season comes round and behold Sarah your wife will have a son. And Sarah was listening and heard it at the tent door which was behind Him.
Genesis,18,11,Now Abraham and Sarah were old well advanced in years; it had ceased to be with Sarah as with [young] women. [She was past the age of childbearing].
Genesis,18,12,Therefore Sarah laughed to herself saying After I have become aged shall I have pleasure and delight my lord (husband) being old also?
Genesis,18,13,And the Lord asked Abraham Why did Sarah laugh saying Shall I really bear a child when I am so old?
Genesis,18,14,Is anything too hard or too wonderful for the Lord? At the appointed time when the season [for her delivery] comes around I will return to you and Sarah shall have borne a son.
Genesis,18,15,Then Sarah denied it saying I did not laugh; for she was afraid. And He said No but you did laugh.
Genesis,18,16,The men rose up from there and faced toward Sodom and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
Genesis,18,17,And the Lord said Shall I hide from Abraham [My friend and servant] what I am going to do
Genesis,18,18,Since Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed through him and shall bless themselves by him?
Genesis,18,19,For I have known (chosen acknowledged) him [as My own] so that he may teach and command his children and the sons of his house after him to keep the way of the Lord and to do what is just and righteous so that the Lord may bring Abraham what He has promised him.
Genesis,18,20,And the Lord said Because the shriek [of the sins] of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is exceedingly grievous
Genesis,18,21,I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether [as vilely and wickedly] as is the cry of it which has come to Me; and if not I will know.
Genesis,18,22,Now the [two] men turned from there and went toward Sodom but Abraham still stood before the Lord.
Genesis,18,23,And Abraham came close and said Will You destroy the righteous (those upright and in right standing with God) together with the wicked?
Genesis,18,24,Suppose there are in the city fifty righteous; will You destroy the place and not spare it for [the sake of ] the fifty righteous in it?
Genesis,18,25,Far be it from You to do such a thing--to slay the righteous with the wicked so that the righteous fare as do the wicked! Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth execute judgment and do righteously?
Genesis,18,26,And the Lord said If I find in the city of Sodom fifty righteous (upright and in right standing with God) I will spare the whole place for their sake.
Genesis,18,27,Abraham answered Behold now I who am but dust and ashes have taken upon myself to speak to the Lord.
Genesis,18,28,If five of the fifty righteous should be lacking--will You destroy the whole city for lack of five? He said If I find forty-five I will not destroy it.
Genesis,18,29,And [Abraham] spoke to Him yet again and said Suppose [only] forty shall be found there. And He said I will not do it for forty's sake.
Genesis,18,30,Then [Abraham] said to Him Oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak [again]. Suppose [only] thirty shall be found there. And He answered I will not do it if I find thirty there.
Genesis,18,31,And [Abraham] said Behold now I have taken upon myself to speak [again] to the Lord. Suppose [only] twenty shall be found there. And [the Lord] replied I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.
Genesis,18,32,And he said Oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak again only this once. Suppose ten [righteous people] shall be found there. And [the Lord] said I will not destroy it for ten's sake.
Genesis,18,33,And the Lord went His way when He had finished speaking with Abraham and Abraham returned to his place.
Genesis,19,1,IT WAS evening when the two angels came to Sodom. Lot was sitting at Sodom's [city] gate. Seeing them Lot rose up to meet them and bowed to the ground.
Genesis,19,2,And he said My lords turn aside I beg of you into your servant's house and spend the night and bathe your feet. Then you can arise early and go on your way. But they said No we will spend the night in the square.
Genesis,19,3,[Lot] entreated and urged them greatly until they yielded and [with him] entered his house. And he made them a dinner [with drinking] and had unleavened bread which he baked and they ate.
Genesis,19,4,But before they lay down the men of the city of Sodom both young and old all the men from every quarter surrounded the house.
Genesis,19,5,And they called to Lot and said Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may know (be intimate with) them.
Genesis,19,6,And Lot went out of the door to the men and shut the door after him
Genesis,19,7,And said I beg of you my brothers do not behave so wickedly.
Genesis,19,8,Look now I have two daughters who are virgins; let me I beg of you bring them out to you and you can do as you please with them. But only do nothing to these men for they have come under the protection of my roof.
Genesis,19,9,But they said Stand back! And they said This fellow came in to live here temporarily and now he presumes to be [our] judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them. So they rushed at and pressed violently against Lot and came close to breaking down the door.
Genesis,19,10,But the men [the angels] reached out and pulled Lot into the house to them and shut the door after him.
Genesis,19,11,And they struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness [which dazzled them] from the youths to the old men so that they wearied themselves [groping] to find the door.
Genesis,19,12,And the [two] men asked Lot Have you any others here--sons-in-law or your sons or your daughters? Whomever you have in the city bring them out of this place
Genesis,19,13,For we will spoil and destroy [Sodom]; for the outcry and shriek against its people has grown great before the Lord and He has sent us to destroy it.
Genesis,19,14,And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law who were to marry his daughters and said Up get out of this place for the Lord will spoil and destroy this city! But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be [only] joking.
Genesis,19,15,When morning came the angels urged Lot to hurry saying Arise take your wife and two daughters who are here [and be off] lest you [too] be consumed and swept away in the iniquity and punishment of the city.
Genesis,19,16,But while he lingered the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand for the Lord was merciful to him; and they brought him forth and set him outside the city and left him there.
Genesis,19,17,And when they had brought them forth they said Escape for your life! Do not look behind you or stop anywhere in the whole valley; escape to the mountains [of Moab] lest you be consumed.
Genesis,19,18,And Lot said to them Oh not that my lords!
Genesis,19,19,Behold now your servant has found favor in your sight and you have magnified your kindness and mercy to me in saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains lest the evil overtake me and I die.
Genesis,19,20,See now yonder city; it is near enough to flee to and it is a little one. Oh let me escape to it! Is it not a little one? And my life will be saved!
Genesis,19,21,And [the angel] said to him See I have yielded to your entreaty concerning this thing also; I will not destroy this city of which you have spoken.
Genesis,19,22,Make haste and take refuge there for I cannot do anything until you arrive there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar [little].
Genesis,19,23,The sun had risen over the earth when Lot entered Zoar.
Genesis,19,24,Then the Lord rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of the heavens.
Genesis,19,25,He overthrew destroyed and ended those cities and all the valley and all the inhabitants of the cities and what grew on the ground.
Genesis,19,26,But [Lot's] wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt.
Genesis,19,27,Abraham went up early the next morning to the place where he [only the day before] had stood before the Lord.
Genesis,19,28,And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley and saw and behold the smoke of the country went up like the smoke of a furnace.
Genesis,19,29,When God ravaged and destroyed the cities of the plain [of Siddim] He [earnestly] remembered Abraham [imprinted and fixed him indelibly on His mind] and He sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when He overthrew the cities where Lot lived.
Genesis,19,30,And Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in Zoar; and he lived in a cave he and his two daughters.
Genesis,19,31,The elder said to the younger Our father is aging and there is not a man on earth to live with us in the customary way.
Genesis,19,32,Come let us make our father drunk with wine and we will lie with him so that we may preserve offspring (our race) through our father.
Genesis,19,33,And they made their father drunk with wine that night and the older went in and lay with her father; and he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she arose.
Genesis,19,34,Then the next day the firstborn said to the younger See here I lay last night with my father; let us make him drunk with wine tonight also and then you go in and lie with him so that we may preserve offspring (our race) through our father.
Genesis,19,35,And they made their father drunk with wine again that night and the younger arose and lay with him; and he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she arose.
Genesis,19,36,Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.
Genesis,19,37,The older bore a son and named him Moab [of a father]; he is the father of the Moabites to this day.
Genesis,19,38,The younger also bore a son and named him Ben-ammi [son of my people]; he is the father of the Ammonites to this day.
Genesis,20,1,NOW ABRAHAM journeyed from there toward the South country (the Negeb) and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and he lived temporarily in Gerar.
Genesis,20,2,And Abraham said of Sarah his wife She is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah [into his harem].
Genesis,20,3,But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said Behold you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken [as your own] for she is a man's wife.
Genesis,20,4,But Abimelech had not come near her so he said Lord will you slay a people who are just and innocent?
Genesis,20,5,Did not the man tell me She is my sister? And she herself said He is my brother. In integrity of heart and innocency of hands I have done this.
Genesis,20,6,Then God said to him in the dream Yes I know you did this in the integrity of your heart for it was I Who kept you back and spared you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not give you occasion to touch her.
Genesis,20,7,So now restore to the man his wife for he is a prophet and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore her [to him] know that you shall surely die you and all who are yours.
Genesis,20,8,So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things; and the men were exceedingly filled with reverence and fear.
Genesis,20,9,Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him What have you done to us? And how have I offended you that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me what ought not to be done [to anyone].
Genesis,20,10,And Abimelech said to Abraham What did you see [in us] that [justified] you in doing such a thing as this?
Genesis,20,11,And Abraham said Because I thought Surely there is no reverence or fear of God at all in this place and they will slay me because of my wife.
Genesis,20,12,But truly she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father but not of my mother; and she became my wife.
Genesis,20,13,When God caused me to wander from my father's house I said to her This kindness you can show me: at every place we stop say of me He is my brother.
Genesis,20,14,Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham and restored to him Sarah his wife.
Genesis,20,15,And Abimelech said Behold my land is before you; dwell wherever it pleases you.
Genesis,20,16,And to Sarah he said Behold I have given this brother of yours a thousand pieces of silver; see it is to compensate you [for all that has occurred] and to vindicate your honor before all who are with you; before all men you are cleared and compensated.
Genesis,20,17,So Abraham prayed to God and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his female slaves and they bore children
Genesis,20,18,For the Lord had closed fast the wombs of all in Abimelech's household because of Sarah Abraham's wife.
Genesis,21,1,THE LORD visited Sarah as He had said and the Lord did for her as He had promised.
Genesis,21,2,For Sarah became pregnant and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the set time God had told him.
Genesis,21,3,Abraham named his son whom Sarah bore to him Isaac [laughter].
Genesis,21,4,And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old as God had commanded him.
Genesis,21,5,Abraham was a hundred years old when Isaac was born.
Genesis,21,6,And Sarah said God has made me to laugh; all who hear will laugh with me.
Genesis,21,7,And she said Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children at the breast? For I have borne him a son in his old age!
Genesis,21,8,And the child grew and was weaned and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.
Genesis,21,9,Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian whom she had borne to Abraham mocking [Isaac].
Genesis,21,10,Therefore she said to Abraham Cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be an heir with my son Isaac.
Genesis,21,11,And the thing was very grievous (serious evil) in Abraham's sight on account of his son [Ishmael].
Genesis,21,12,God said to Abraham Do not let it seem grievous and evil to you because of the youth and your bondwoman; in all that Sarah has said to you do what she asks for in Isaac shall your posterity be called.
Genesis,21,13,And I will make a nation of the son of the bondwoman also because he is your offspring.
Genesis,21,14,So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave them to Hagar putting them on her shoulders and he sent her and the youth away. And she wandered on [aimlessly] and lost her way in the wilderness of Beersheba.
Genesis,21,15,When the water in the bottle was all gone Hagar caused the youth to lie down under one of the shrubs.
Genesis,21,16,Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off about a bowshot for she said Let me not see the death of the lad. And as she sat down opposite him he lifted up his voice and wept and she raised her voice and wept.
Genesis,21,17,And God heard the voice of the youth and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven and said to her What troubles you Hagar? Fear not for God has heard the voice of the youth where he is.
Genesis,21,18,Arise raise up the youth and support him with your hand for I intend to make him a great nation.
Genesis,21,19,Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the [empty] bottle with water and caused the youth to drink.
Genesis,21,20,And God was with the youth and he developed; and he dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer.
Genesis,21,21,He dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.
Genesis,21,22,At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham God is with you in everything you do.
Genesis,21,23,So now swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my son or with my posterity; but as I have dealt with you kindly you will do the same with me and with the land in which you have sojourned.
Genesis,21,24,And Abraham said I will swear.
Genesis,21,25,When Abraham complained to and reasoned with Abimelech about a well of water [Abimelech's] servants had violently seized
Genesis,21,26,Abimelech said I know not who did this thing; you did not tell me and I did not hear of it until today.
Genesis,21,27,So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech and the two men made a league or covenant.
Genesis,21,28,Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock
Genesis,21,29,And Abimelech said to Abraham What do these seven ewe lambs which you have set apart mean?
Genesis,21,30,He said You are to accept these seven ewe lambs from me as a witness for me that I dug this well.
Genesis,21,31,Therefore that place was called Beersheba [well of the oath] because there both parties swore an oath.
Genesis,21,32,Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba; then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army returned to the land of the Philistines.
Genesis,21,33,Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the Lord the Eternal God.
Genesis,21,34,And Abraham sojourned in Philistia many days.
Genesis,22,1,AFTER THESE events God tested and proved Abraham and said to him Abraham! And he said Here I am.
Genesis,22,2,[God] said Take now your son your only son Isaac whom you love and go to the region of Moriah; and offer him there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains of which I will tell you.
Genesis,22,3,So Abraham rose early in the morning saddled his donkey and took two of his young men with him and his son Isaac; and he split the wood for the burnt offering and then began the trip to the place of which God had told him.
Genesis,22,4,On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
Genesis,22,5,And Abraham said to his servants Settle down and stay here with the donkey and I and the young man will go yonder and worship and come again to you.
Genesis,22,6,Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on [the shoulders of ] Isaac his son and he took the fire (the firepot) in his own hand and a knife; and the two of them went on together.
Genesis,22,7,And Isaac said to Abraham My father! And he said Here I am my son. [Isaac] said See here are the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for the burnt sacrifice?
Genesis,22,8,Abraham said My son God Himself will provide a lamb for the burnt offering. So the two went on together.
Genesis,22,9,When they came to the place of which God had told him Abraham built an altar there; then he laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar on the wood.
Genesis,22,10,And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took hold of the knife to slay his son.
Genesis,22,11,But the Angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said Abraham Abraham! He answered Here I am.
Genesis,22,12,And He said Do not lay your hand on the lad or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear and revere God since you have not held back from Me or begrudged giving Me your son your only son.
Genesis,22,13,Then Abraham looked up and glanced around and behold behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up for a burnt offering and an ascending sacrifice instead of his son!
Genesis,22,14,So Abraham called the name of that place The Lord Will Provide. And it is said to this day On the mount of the Lord it will be provided.
Genesis,22,15,The Angel of the Lord called to Abraham from heaven a second time
Genesis,22,16,And said I have sworn by Myself says the Lord that since you have done this and have not withheld [from Me] or begrudged [giving Me] your son your only son
Genesis,22,17,In blessing I will bless you and in multiplying I will multiply your descendants like the stars of the heavens and like the sand on the seashore. And your Seed (Heir) will possess the gate of His enemies
Genesis,22,18,And in your Seed [ Christ] shall all the nations of the earth be blessed and [by Him] bless themselves because you have heard and obeyed My voice.
Genesis,22,19,So Abraham returned to his servants and they rose up and went with him to Beersheba; there Abraham lived.
Genesis,22,20,Now after these things it was told Abraham Milcah has also borne children to your brother Nahor:
Genesis,22,21,Uz the firstborn Buz his brother Kemuel the father of Aram
Genesis,22,22,Chesed Hazo Pildash Jidlaph and Bethuel.
Genesis,22,23,Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor Abraham's brother.
Genesis,22,24,And his concubine whose name was Reumah bore Tebah Gaham Tahash and Maacah.
Genesis,23,1,SARAH LIVED 127 years; this was the length of the life of Sarah.
Genesis,23,2,And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba that is Hebron in the land of Canaan. And Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
Genesis,23,3,And Abraham stood up from before his dead and said to the sons of Heth
Genesis,23,4,I am a stranger and a sojourner with you; give me property for a burial place among you that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
Genesis,23,5,And the Hittites replied to Abraham
Genesis,23,6,Listen to us my lord; you are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in any tomb or grave of ours that you choose; none of us will withhold from you his tomb or hinder you from burying your dead.
Genesis,23,7,And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land the Hittites.
Genesis,23,8,And he said to them If you are willing to grant my dead a burial out of my sight listen to me and ask Ephron son of Zohar for me
Genesis,23,9,That he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he owns--it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me here in your presence as a burial place to which I may hold fast among you.
Genesis,23,10,Now Ephron was present there among the sons of Heth; so in the hearing of all who went in at the gate of his city Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham saying
Genesis,23,11,No my lord hear me; I give you the field and the cave that is in it I give you. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.
Genesis,23,12,Then Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
Genesis,23,13,And he said to Ephron in the presence of the people of the land But if you will give it I beg of you hear me. I will give you the price of the field; accept it from me and I will bury my dead there.
Genesis,23,14,Ephron replied to Abraham saying
Genesis,23,15,My lord listen to me. The land is worth 400 shekels of silver; what is that between you and me? So bury your dead.
Genesis,23,16,So Abraham listened to what Ephron said and acted upon it. He weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: 400 shekels of silver according to the weights current among the merchants.
Genesis,23,17,So the field of Ephron in Machpelah which was to the east of Mamre [Hebron]--the field and the cave which was in it and all the trees that were in the field and in all its borders round about--was made over
Genesis,23,18,As a possession to Abraham in the presence of the Hittites before all who went in at his city gate.
Genesis,23,19,After this Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah to the east of Mamre that is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
Genesis,23,20,The field and the cave in it were conveyed to Abraham for a permanent burial place by the sons of Heth.
Genesis,24,1,NOW ABRAHAM was old well advanced in years and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.
Genesis,24,2,And Abraham said to the eldest servant of his house [Eliezer of Damascus] who ruled over all that he had I beg of you put your hand under my thigh;
Genesis,24,3,And you shall swear by the Lord the God of heaven and earth that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I have settled
Genesis,24,4,But you shall go to my country and to my relatives and take a wife for my son Isaac.
Genesis,24,5,The servant said to him But perhaps the woman will not be willing to come along after me to this country. Must I take your son to the country from which you came?
Genesis,24,6,Abraham said to him See to it that you do not take my son back there.
Genesis,24,7,The Lord the God of heaven Who took me from my father's house from the land of my family and my birth Who spoke to me and swore to me saying To your offspring I will give this land--He will send His Angel before you and you will take a wife from there for my son.
Genesis,24,8,And if the woman should not be willing to go along after you then you will be clear from this oath; only you must not take my son back there.
Genesis,24,9,So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.
Genesis,24,10,And the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed taking some of all his master's treasures with him; thus he journeyed to Mesopotamia [between the Tigris and the Euphrates] to the city of Nahor [Abraham's brother].
Genesis,24,11,And he made his camels to kneel down outside the city by a well of water at the time of the evening when women go out to draw water.
Genesis,24,12,And he said O Lord God of my master Abraham I pray You cause me to meet with good success today and show kindness to my master Abraham.
Genesis,24,13,See I stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city are coming to draw water.
Genesis,24,14,And let it so be that the girl to whom I say I pray you let down your jar that I may drink and she replies Drink and I will give your camels drink also--let her be the one whom You have selected and appointed and indicated for Your servant Isaac [to be a wife to him]; and by it I shall know that You have shown kindness and faithfulness to my master.
Genesis,24,15,Before he had finished speaking behold out came Rebekah who was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah who was the wife of Nahor the brother of Abraham with her water jar on her shoulder.
Genesis,24,16,And the girl was very beautiful and attractive chaste and modest and unmarried. And she went down to the well filled her water jar and came up.
Genesis,24,17,And the servant ran to meet her and said I pray you let me drink a little water from your water jar.
Genesis,24,18,And she said Drink my lord; and she quickly let down her jar onto her hand and gave him a drink.
Genesis,24,19,When she had given him a drink she said I will draw water for your camels also until they finish drinking.
Genesis,24,20,So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well and drew water for all his camels.
Genesis,24,21,The man stood gazing at her in silence waiting to know if the Lord had made his trip prosperous.
Genesis,24,22,And when the camels had finished drinking the man took a gold earring or nose ring of half a shekel in weight and for her hands two bracelets of ten shekels in weight in gold
Genesis,24,23,And said Whose daughter are you? I pray you tell me: Is there room in your father's house for us to lodge there?
Genesis,24,24,And she said to him I am the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah and [her husband] Nahor.
Genesis,24,25,She said also to him We have both straw and provender (fodder) enough and also room in which to lodge.
Genesis,24,26,The man bowed down his head and worshiped the Lord
Genesis,24,27,And said Blessed be the Lord the God of my master Abraham Who has not left my master bereft and destitute of His loving-kindness and steadfastness. As for me going on the way [of obedience and faith] the Lord led me to the house of my master's kinsmen.
Genesis,24,28,The girl related to her mother's household what had happened.
Genesis,24,29,Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban and Laban ran out to the man at the well.
Genesis,24,30,For when he saw the earring or nose ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms and when he heard Rebekah his sister saying The man said this to me he went to the man and found him standing by the camels at the well.
Genesis,24,31,He cried Come in you blessed of the Lord! Why do you stand outside? For I have made the house ready and have prepared a place for the camels.
Genesis,24,32,So the man came into the house; and [Laban] ungirded his camels and gave straw and provender for the camels and water to bathe his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
Genesis,24,33,A meal was set before him but he said I will not eat until I have told of my errand. And [Laban] said Speak on.
Genesis,24,34,And he said I am Abraham's servant.
Genesis,24,35,And the Lord has blessed my master mightily and he has become great; and He has given him flocks herds silver gold menservants maidservants camels and asses.
Genesis,24,36,And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old and to him he has given all that he has.
Genesis,24,37,And my master made me swear saying You must not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I dwell
Genesis,24,38,But you shall go to my father's house and to my family and take a wife for my son.
Genesis,24,39,And I said to my master But suppose the woman will not follow me.
Genesis,24,40,And he said to me The Lord in Whose presence I walk [habitually] will send His Angel with you and prosper your way and you will take a wife for my son from my kindred and from my father's house.
Genesis,24,41,Then you shall be clear from my oath when you come to my kindred; and if they do not give her to you you shall be free and innocent of my oath.
Genesis,24,42,I came today to the well and said O Lord God of my master Abraham if You are now causing me to go on my way prosperously--
Genesis,24,43,See I am standing by the well of water; now let it be that when the maiden comes out to draw water and I say to her I pray you give me a little water from your [water] jar to drink
Genesis,24,44,And if she says to me You drink and I will draw water for your camels also let that same woman be the one whom the Lord has selected and indicated for my master's son.
Genesis,24,45,And before I had finished praying in my heart behold Rebekah came out with her [water] jar on her shoulder and she went down to the well and drew water. And I said to her I pray you let me have a drink.
Genesis,24,46,And she quickly let down her [water] jar from her shoulder and said Drink and I will water your camels also. So I drank and she gave the camels drink also.
Genesis,24,47,I asked her Whose daughter are you? She said The daughter of Bethuel Nahor's son whom Milcah bore to him. And I put the earring or nose ring on her face and the bracelets on her arms.
Genesis,24,48,And I bowed down my head and worshiped the Lord and blessed the Lord the God of my master Abraham Who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter to his son.
Genesis,24,49,And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master [showing faithfulness to him] tell me; and if not tell me that I may turn to the right or to the left.
Genesis,24,50,Then Laban and Bethuel answered The thing comes forth from the Lord; we cannot speak bad or good to you.
Genesis,24,51,Rebekah is before you; take her and go and let her be the wife of your master's son as the Lord has said.
Genesis,24,52,And when Abraham's servant heard their words he bowed himself to the ground before the Lord.
Genesis,24,53,And the servant brought out jewels of silver jewels of gold and garments and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave precious things to her brother and her mother.
Genesis,24,54,Then they ate and drank he and the men who were with him and stayed there all night. And in the morning they arose and he said. Send me away to my master.
Genesis,24,55,But [Rebekah's] brother and mother said Let the girl stay with us a few days--at least ten; then she may go.
Genesis,24,56,But [the servant] said to them Do not hinder and delay me seeing that the Lord has caused me to go prosperously on my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.
Genesis,24,57,And they said We will call the girl and ask her [what is] her desire.
Genesis,24,58,So they called Rebekah and said to her Will you go with this man? And she said I will go.
Genesis,24,59,So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse [Deborah] and Abraham's servant and his men.
Genesis,24,60,And they blessed Rebekah and said to her You are our sister; may you become the mother of thousands of ten thousands and let your posterity possess the gate of their enemies.
Genesis,24,61,And Rebekah and her maids arose and followed the man upon their camels. Thus the servant took Rebekah and went on his way.
Genesis,24,62,Now Isaac had returned from going to the well Beer-lahai-roi [A well to the Living One Who sees me] for he [now] dwelt in the South country (the Negeb).
Genesis,24,63,And Isaac went out to meditate and bow down [in prayer] in the open country in the evening; and he looked up and saw that behold the camels were coming.
Genesis,24,64,And Rebekah looked up and when she saw Isaac she dismounted from the camel.
Genesis,24,65,For she [had] said to the servant Who is that man walking across the field to meet us? And the servant [had] said He is my master. So she took a veil and concealed herself with it.
Genesis,24,66,And the servant told Isaac everything that he had done.
Genesis,24,67,And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent and he took Rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her; thus Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
Genesis,25,1,ABRAHAM TOOK another wife and her name was Keturah.
Genesis,25,2,And she bore him Zimran Jokshan Medan Midian Ishbak and Shuah.
Genesis,25,3,Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim Letushim and Leummim.
Genesis,25,4,The sons of Midian were Ephah Epher Hanoch Abida and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
Genesis,25,5,And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.
Genesis,25,6,But to the sons of his concubines [Hagar and Keturah] Abraham gave gifts and while he was still living he sent them to the east country away from Isaac his son [of promise].
Genesis,25,7,The days of Abraham's life were 175 years.
Genesis,25,8,Then Abraham's spirit was released and he died at a good (ample full) old age an old man satisfied and satiated and was gathered to his people.
Genesis,25,9,And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite which is east of Mamre
Genesis,25,10,The field which Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife.
Genesis,25,11,After the death of Abraham God blessed his son Isaac and Isaac dwelt at Beer-lahai-roi [A well to the Living One Who sees me].
Genesis,25,12,Now this is the history of the descendants of Ishmael Abraham's son whom Hagar the Egyptian Sarah's handmaid bore to Abraham.
Genesis,25,13,These are the names of the sons of Ishmael named in the order of their births: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael and Kedar Adbeel Mibsam
Genesis,25,14,Mishma Dumah Massa
Genesis,25,15,Hadad Tema Jetur Naphish and Kedemah.
Genesis,25,16,These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names by their villages and by their encampments (sheepfolds)--twelve princes according to their tribes. [Foretold in Gen. 17:20.]
Genesis,25,17,And Ishmael lived 137 years; then his spirit left him and he died and was gathered to his kindred.
Genesis,25,18,And [Ishmael's sons] dwelt from Havilah to Shur which is before Egypt in the direction of Assyria. [Ishmael] dwelt close [to the lands] of all his brethren.
Genesis,25,19,And this is the history of the descendants of Isaac Abraham's son: Abraham was the father of Isaac.
Genesis,25,20,Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Padan-aram the sister of Laban the Aramean.
Genesis,25,21,And Isaac prayed much to the Lord for his wife because she was unable to bear children; and the Lord granted his prayer and Rebekah his wife became pregnant.
Genesis,25,22,[Two] children struggled together within her; and she said If it is so [that the Lord has heard our prayer] why am I like this? And she went to inquire of the Lord.
Genesis,25,23,The Lord said to her [The founders of] two nations are in your womb and the separation of two peoples has begun in your body; the one people shall be stronger than the other and the elder shall serve the younger.
Genesis,25,24,When her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb.
Genesis,25,25,The first came out red all over like a hairy garment and they named him Esau [hairy].
Genesis,25,26,Afterward his brother came forth and his hand grasped Esau's heel; so he was named Jacob [supplanter]. Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them.
Genesis,25,27,When the boys grew up Esau was a cunning and skilled hunter a man of the outdoors; but Jacob was a plain and quiet man dwelling in tents.
Genesis,25,28,And Isaac loved [and was partial to] Esau because he ate of Esau's game; but Rebekah loved Jacob.
Genesis,25,29,Jacob was boiling pottage (lentil stew) one day when Esau came from the field and was faint [with hunger].
Genesis,25,30,And Esau said to Jacob I beg of you let me have some of that red lentil stew to eat for I am faint and famished! That is why his name was called Edom [red].
Genesis,25,31,Jacob answered Then sell me today your birthright (the rights of a firstborn).
Genesis,25,32,Esau said See here I am at the point of death; what good can this birthright do me?
Genesis,25,33,Jacob said Swear to me today [that you are selling it to me]; and he swore to [Jacob] and sold him his birthright.
Genesis,25,34,Then Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils and he ate and drank and rose up and went his way. Thus Esau scorned his birthright as beneath his notice.
Genesis,26,1,AND THERE was a famine in the land other than the former famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Gerar to Abimelech king of the Philistines.
Genesis,26,2,And the Lord appeared to him and said Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land of which I will tell you.
Genesis,26,3,Dwell temporarily in this land and I will be with you and will favor you with blessings; for to you and to your descendants I will give all these lands and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.
Genesis,26,4,And I will make your descendants to multiply as the stars of the heavens and will give to your posterity all these lands (kingdoms); and by your Offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed or by Him bless themselves
Genesis,26,5,For Abraham listened to and obeyed My voice and kept My charge My commands My statutes and My laws.
Genesis,26,6,So Isaac stayed in Gerar.
Genesis,26,7,And the men of the place asked him about his wife and he said She is my sister; for he was afraid to say She is my wife--[thinking] Lest the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah because she is attractive and is beautiful to look upon.
Genesis,26,8,When he had been there a long time Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac caressing Rebekah his wife.
Genesis,26,9,And Abimelech called Isaac and said See here she is certainly your wife! How did you [dare] say to me She is my sister? And Isaac said to him Because I thought Lest I die on account of her.
Genesis,26,10,And Abimelech said What is this you have done to us? One of the men might easily have lain with your wife and you would have brought guilt and sin upon us.
Genesis,26,11,Then Abimelech charged all his people He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
Genesis,26,12,Then Isaac sowed seed in that land and received in the same year a hundred times as much as he had planted and the Lord favored him with blessings.
Genesis,26,13,And the man became great and gained more and more until he became very wealthy and distinguished;
Genesis,26,14,He owned flocks herds and a great supply of servants and the Philistines envied him.
Genesis,26,15,Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father the Philistines had closed and filled with earth.
Genesis,26,16,And Abimelech said to Isaac Go away from us for you are much mightier than we are.
Genesis,26,17,So Isaac went away from there and pitched his tent in the Valley of Gerar and dwelt there.
Genesis,26,18,And Isaac dug again the wells of water which had been dug in the days of Abraham his father for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham; and he gave them the names by which his father had called them.
Genesis,26,19,Now Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of living [spring] water.
Genesis,26,20,And the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen saying The water is ours. And he named the well Esek [contention] because they quarreled with him.
Genesis,26,21,Then [his servants] dug another well and they quarreled over that also; so he named it Sitnah [enmity].
Genesis,26,22,And he moved away from there and dug another well and for that one they did not quarrel. He named it Rehoboth [room] saying For now the Lord has made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land.
Genesis,26,23,Now he went up from there to Beersheba.
Genesis,26,24,And the Lord appeared to him the same night and said I am the God of Abraham your father. Fear not for I am with you and will favor you with blessings and multiply your descendants for the sake of My servant Abraham.
Genesis,26,25,And [Isaac] built an altar there and called on the name of the Lord and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac's servants were digging a well.
Genesis,26,26,Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzah one of his friends and Phicol his army's commander.
Genesis,26,27,And Isaac said to them Why have you come to me seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?
Genesis,26,28,They said We saw that the Lord was certainly with you; so we said Let there be now an oath between us [carrying a curse with it to befall the one who breaks it] even between you and us and let us make a covenant with you
Genesis,26,29,That you will do us no harm inasmuch as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed or favored of the Lord!
Genesis,26,30,And he made them a [formal] dinner and they ate and drank.
Genesis,26,31,And they rose up early in the morning and took oaths [with a curse] with one another; and Isaac sent them on their way and they departed from him in peace.
Genesis,26,32,That same day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well they had dug saying We have found water!
Genesis,26,33,And he named [the well] Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba [well of the oath] to this day.
Genesis,26,34,Now Esau was 40 years old when he took as wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
Genesis,26,35,And they made life bitter and a grief of mind and spirit for Isaac and Rebekah [their parents-in-law].
Genesis,27,1,WHEN ISAAC was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called Esau his elder son and said to him My son! And he answered him Here I am.
Genesis,27,2,He said See here now; I am old I do not know when I may die.
Genesis,27,3,So now I pray you take your weapons your [arrows in a] quiver and your bow and go out into the open country and hunt game for me
Genesis,27,4,And prepare me appetizing meat such as I love and bring it to me that I may eat of it [preparatory] to giving you my blessing [as my firstborn] before I die.
Genesis,27,5,But Rebekah heard what Isaac said to Esau his son; and when Esau had gone to the open country to hunt for game that he might bring it
Genesis,27,6,Rebekah said to Jacob her younger son See here I heard your father say to Esau your brother
Genesis,27,7,Bring me game and make me appetizing meat so that I may eat and declare my blessing upon you before the Lord before my death.
Genesis,27,8,So now my son do exactly as I command you.
Genesis,27,9,Go now to the flock and from it bring me two good and suitable kids; and I will make them into appetizing meat for your father such as he loves.
Genesis,27,10,And you shall bring it to your father that he may eat and declare his blessing upon you before his death.
Genesis,27,11,But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother Listen Esau my brother is a hairy man and I am a smooth man.
Genesis,27,12,Suppose my father feels me; I will seem to him to be a cheat and an imposter and I will bring [his] curse on me and not [his] blessing.
Genesis,27,13,But his mother said to him On me be your curse my son; only obey my word and go fetch them to me.
Genesis,27,14,So [Jacob] went got [the kids] and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared appetizing meat with a delightful odor such as his father loved.
Genesis,27,15,Then Rebekah took her elder son Esau's best clothes which were with her in the house and put them on Jacob her younger son.
Genesis,27,16,And she put the skins of the kids on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
Genesis,27,17,And she gave the savory meat and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob.
Genesis,27,18,So he went to his father and said My father. And he said Here am I; who are you my son?
Genesis,27,19,And Jacob said to his father I am Esau your firstborn; I have done what you told me to do. Now sit up and eat of my game so that you may proceed to bless me.
Genesis,27,20,And Isaac said to his son How is it that you have found the game so quickly my son? And he said Because the Lord your God caused it to come to me.
Genesis,27,21,But Isaac said to Jacob Come close to me I beg of you that I may feel you my son and know whether you really are my son Esau or not.
Genesis,27,22,So Jacob went near to Isaac and his father felt him and said The voice is Jacob's voice but the hands are the hands of Esau.
Genesis,27,23,He could not identify him because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands; so he blessed him.
Genesis,27,24,But he said Are you really my son Esau? He answered I am.
Genesis,27,25,Then [Isaac] said Bring it to me and I will eat of my son's game that I may bless you. He brought it to him and he ate; and he brought him wine and he drank.
Genesis,27,26,Then his father Isaac said Come near and kiss me my son.
Genesis,27,27,So he came near and kissed him; and [Isaac] smelled his clothing and blessed him and said The scent of my son is as the odor of a field which the Lord has blessed.
Genesis,27,28,And may God give you of the dew of the heavens and of the fatness of the earth and abundance of grain and [new] wine;
Genesis,27,29,Let peoples serve you and nations bow down to you; be master over your brothers and let your mother's sons bow down to you. Let everyone be cursed who curses you and favored with blessings who blesses you.
Genesis,27,30,As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob and Jacob was scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
Genesis,27,31,Esau had also prepared savory food and brought it to his father and said to him Let my father arise and eat of his son's game that you may bless me.
Genesis,27,32,And Isaac his father said to him Who are you? And he replied I am your son your firstborn Esau.
Genesis,27,33,Then Isaac trembled and shook violently and he said Who? Where is he who has hunted game and brought it to me and I ate of it all before you came and I have blessed him? Yes and he shall be blessed.
Genesis,27,34,When Esau heard the words of his father he cried out with a great and bitter cry and said to his father Bless me even me also O my father!
Genesis,27,35,[Isaac] said Your brother came with crafty cunning and treacherous deceit and has taken your blessing.
Genesis,27,36,[Esau] replied Is he not rightly named Jacob [the supplanter]? For he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright and now he has taken away my blessing! Have you not still a blessing reserved for me?
Genesis,27,37,And Isaac answered Esau Behold I have made [Jacob] your lord and master; I have given all his brethren to him for servants and with corn and [new] wine have I sustained him. What then can I do for you my son?
Genesis,27,38,Esau said to his father Have you only one blessing my father? Bless me even me also O my father! And Esau lifted up [could not control] his voice and wept aloud.
Genesis,27,39,Then Isaac his father answered Your [blessing and] dwelling shall all come from the fruitfulness of the earth and from the dew of the heavens above;
Genesis,27,40,By your sword you shall live and serve your brother. But [the time shall come] when you will grow restive and break loose and you shall tear his yoke from off your neck.
Genesis,27,41,And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him; and Esau said in his heart The days of mourning for my father are very near. When [he is gone] I will kill my brother Jacob.
Genesis,27,42,These words of Esau her elder son were repeated to Rebekah. She sent for Jacob her younger son and said to him See here your brother Esau comforts himself concerning you [by intending] to kill you.
Genesis,27,43,So now my son do what I tell you; arise flee to my brother Laban in Haran;
Genesis,27,44,Linger and dwell with him for a while until your brother's fury is spent.
Genesis,27,45,When your brother's anger is diverted from you he will forget [the wrong] that you have done him. Then I will send and bring you back from there. Why should I be deprived of both of you in one day?
Genesis,27,46,Then Rebekah said to Isaac I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth [these wives of Esau]! If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth such as these Hittite girls around here what good will my life be to me?
Genesis,28,1,SO ISAAC called Jacob and blessed him and commanded him You shall not marry one of the women of Canaan.
Genesis,28,2,Arise go to Padan-aram to the house of Bethuel your mother's father and take from there as a wife one of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother.
Genesis,28,3,May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you until you become a group of peoples.
Genesis,28,4,May He give the blessing [He gave to] Abraham to you and your descendants with you that you may inherit the land He gave to Abraham in which you are a sojourner.
Genesis,28,5,Thus Isaac sent Jacob away. He went to Padan-aram to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean the brother of Rebekah Jacob and Esau's mother.
Genesis,28,6,Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Padan-aram to take him a wife from there and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge saying You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;
Genesis,28,7,And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Padan-aram.
Genesis,28,8,Also Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan did not please Isaac his father.
Genesis,28,9,So Esau went to Ishmael and took to be his wife [in addition] to the wives he [already] had Mahalath daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son the sister of Nebaioth.
Genesis,28,10,And Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran.
Genesis,28,11,And he came to a certain place and stayed there overnight because the sun was set. Taking one of the stones of the place he put it under his head and lay down there to sleep.
Genesis,28,12,And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven; and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it!
Genesis,28,13,And behold the Lord stood over and beside him and said I am the Lord the God of Abraham your father [forefather] and the God of Isaac; I will give to you and to your descendants the land on which you are lying.
Genesis,28,14,And your offspring shall be as [countless as] the dust or sand of the ground and you shall spread abroad to the west and the east and the north and the south; and by you and your Offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed and bless themselves.
Genesis,28,15,And behold I am with you and will keep (watch over you with care take notice of) you wherever you may go and I will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done all of which I have told you.
Genesis,28,16,And Jacob awoke from his sleep and he said Surely the Lord is in this place and I did not know it.
Genesis,28,17,He was afraid and said How to be feared and reverenced is this place! This is none other than the house of God and this is the gateway to heaven!
Genesis,28,18,And Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone he had put under his head and he set it up for a pillar (a monument to the vision in his dream) and he poured oil on its top [in dedication].
Genesis,28,19,And he named that place Bethel [the house of God]; but the name of that city was Luz at first.
Genesis,28,20,Then Jacob made a vow saying If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me food to eat and clothing to wear
Genesis,28,21,So that I may come again to my father's house in peace then the Lord shall be my God;
Genesis,28,22,And this stone which I have set up as a pillar (monument) shall be God's house [a sacred place to me] and of all [the increase of possessions] that You give me I will give the tenth to You.
Genesis,29,1,THEN JACOB went [briskly and cheerfully] on his way [400 miles] and came to the land of the people of the East.
Genesis,29,2,As he looked he saw a well in the field; and behold there were three flocks of sheep lying by it for out of that well the flocks were watered. The stone on the well's mouth was a big one
Genesis,29,3,And when all the flocks were gathered there [the shepherds] would roll the stone from the well's mouth water the sheep and replace the stone on the well's mouth.
Genesis,29,4,And Jacob said to them My brothers where are you from? And they said We are from Haran.
Genesis,29,5,[Jacob] said to them Do you know Laban the grandson of Nahor? And they said We know him.
Genesis,29,6,He said to them Is it well with him? And they said He is doing well; and behold here comes his daughter Rachel with [his] sheep!
Genesis,29,7,He said The sun is still high; it is a long time yet before the flocks need be gathered [in their folds]. [Why not] water the sheep and return them to their pasture?
Genesis,29,8,But they said We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together; then [the shepherds] roll the stone from the well's mouth and we water the sheep.
Genesis,29,9,While he was still talking with them Rachel came with her father's sheep for she shepherded them.
Genesis,29,10,When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of Laban his mother's brother and the sheep of Laban his uncle Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of his uncle Laban.
Genesis,29,11,Then Jacob kissed Rachel and he wept aloud.
Genesis,29,12,Jacob told Rachel he was her father's relative Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father.
Genesis,29,13,When Laban heard of the arrival of Jacob his sister's son he ran to meet him and embraced and kissed him and brought him to his house. And [Jacob] told Laban all these things.
Genesis,29,14,Then Laban said to him Surely you are my bone and my flesh. And [Jacob] stayed with him a month.
Genesis,29,15,Then Laban said to Jacob Just because you are my relative should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what shall your wages be?
Genesis,29,16,Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the elder was Leah and the name of the younger was Rachel.
Genesis,29,17,Leah's eyes were weak and dull looking but Rachel was beautiful and attractive.
Genesis,29,18,And Jacob loved Rachel; so he said I will work for you for seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.
Genesis,29,19,And Laban said It is better that I give her to you than to another man. Stay and live with me.
Genesis,29,20,And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.
Genesis,29,21,Finally Jacob said to Laban Give me my wife for my time is completed so that I may take her to me.
Genesis,29,22,And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast [with drinking].
Genesis,29,23,But when night came he took Leah his daughter and brought her to [Jacob] who had intercourse with her.
Genesis,29,24,And Laban gave Zilpah his maid to his daughter Leah to be her maid.
Genesis,29,25,But in the morning [Jacob saw his wife and] behold it was Leah! And he said to Laban What is this you have done to me? Did I not work for you [all those seven years] for Rachel? Why then have you deceived and cheated and thrown me down [like this]?
Genesis,29,26,And Laban said It is not permitted in our country to give the younger [in marriage] before the elder.
Genesis,29,27,Finish the [wedding feast] week [for Leah]; then we will give you [Rachel] also and you shall work for me yet seven more years in return.
Genesis,29,28,So Jacob complied and fulfilled [Leah's] week; then [Laban] gave him Rachel his daughter as his wife.
Genesis,29,29,(And Laban gave Bilhah his maid to Rachel his daughter to be her maid.)
Genesis,29,30,And Jacob lived with Rachel also as his wife and he loved Rachel more than Leah and served [Laban] another seven years [for her].
Genesis,29,31,And when the Lord saw that Leah was despised He made her able to bear children but Rachel was barren.
Genesis,29,32,And Leah became pregnant and bore a son and named him Reuben [See a son!]; for she said Because the Lord has seen my humiliation and affliction; now my husband will love me.
Genesis,29,33,[Leah] became pregnant again and bore a son and said Because the Lord heard that I am despised He has given me this son also; and she named him Simeon [God hears].
Genesis,29,34,And she became pregnant again and bore a son and said Now this time will my husband be a companion to me for I have borne him three sons. Therefore he was named Levi [companion].
Genesis,29,35,Again she conceived and bore a son and she said Now will I praise the Lord! So she called his name Judah [praise]; then [for a time] she ceased bearing.
Genesis,30,1,WHEN RACHEL saw that she bore Jacob no children she envied her sister and said to Jacob Give me children or else I will die!
Genesis,30,2,And Jacob became very angry with Rachel and he said Am I in God's stead Who has denied you children?
Genesis,30,3,And she said See here take my maid Bilhah and have intercourse with her; and [when the baby comes] she shall deliver it upon my knees that I by her may also have children.
Genesis,30,4,And she gave him Bilhah her maid as a [secondary] wife and Jacob had intercourse with her.
Genesis,30,5,And Bilhah became pregnant and bore Jacob a son.
Genesis,30,6,And Rachel said God has judged and vindicated me and has heard my plea and has given me a son; so she named him Dan [judged].
Genesis,30,7,And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
Genesis,30,8,And Rachel said With mighty wrestlings [in prayer to God] I have struggled with my sister and have prevailed; so she named him [this second son Bilhah bore] Naphtali [struggled].
Genesis,30,9,When Leah saw that she had ceased to bear she gave Zilpah her maid to Jacob as a [secondary] wife.
Genesis,30,10,And Zilpah Leah's maid bore Jacob a son.
Genesis,30,11,Then Leah said Victory and good fortune have come; and she named him Gad [fortune].
Genesis,30,12,Zilpah Leah's maid bore Jacob [her] second son.
Genesis,30,13,And Leah said I am happy for women will call me blessed (happy fortunate to be envied); and she named him Asher [happy].
Genesis,30,14,Now Reuben went at the time of wheat harvest and found some mandrakes (love apples) in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah Give me I pray you some of your son's mandrakes.
Genesis,30,15,But [Leah] answered Is it not enough that you have taken my husband without your taking away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said Jacob shall sleep with you tonight [in exchange] for your son's mandrakes.
Genesis,30,16,And Jacob came out of the field in the evening and Leah went out to meet him and said You must sleep with me [tonight] for I have certainly paid your hire with my son's mandrakes. So he slept with her that night.
Genesis,30,17,And God heeded Leah's [prayer] and she conceived and bore Jacob [her] fifth son.
Genesis,30,18,Leah said God has given me my hire because I have given my maid to my husband; and she called his name Issachar [hired].
Genesis,30,19,And Leah became pregnant again and bore Jacob [her] sixth son.
Genesis,30,20,Then Leah said God has endowed me with a good marriage gift [for my husband]; now will he dwell with me [and regard me as his wife in reality] because I have borne him six sons; and she named him Zebulun [dwelling].
Genesis,30,21,Afterwards she bore a daughter and called her Dinah.
Genesis,30,22,Then God remembered Rachel and answered her pleading and made it possible for her to have children.
Genesis,30,23,And [now for the first time] she became pregnant and bore a son; and she said God has taken away my reproach disgrace and humiliation.
Genesis,30,24,And she called his name Joseph [may he add] and said May the Lord add to me another son.
Genesis,30,25,When Rachel had borne Joseph Jacob said to Laban Send me away that I may go to my own place and country.
Genesis,30,26,Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you and let me go; for you know the work which I have done for you.
Genesis,30,27,And Laban said to him If I have found favor in your sight I pray you [do not go]; for I have learned by experience and from the omens in divination that the Lord has favored me with blessings on your account.
Genesis,30,28,He said State your salary and I will give it.
Genesis,30,29,Jacob answered him You know how I have served you and how your possessions your cattle and sheep and goats have fared with me.
Genesis,30,30,For you had little before I came and it has increased and multiplied abundantly; and the Lord has favored you with blessings wherever I turned. But now when shall I provide for my own house also?
Genesis,30,31,[Laban] said What shall I give you? And Jacob said You shall not give me anything if you will do this one thing for me [of which I am about to tell you] and I will again feed and take care of your flock.
Genesis,30,32,Let me pass through all your flock today removing from it every speckled and spotted animal and every black one among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and such shall be my wages.
Genesis,30,33,So later when the matter of my wages is brought before you my fair dealing will be evident and answer for me. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the sheep if found with me shall be counted as stolen.
Genesis,30,34,And Laban said Good; let it be done as you say.
Genesis,30,35,But that same day [Laban] removed the he-goats that were streaked and spotted and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted every one that had white on it and every black lamb and put them in charge of his sons.
Genesis,30,36,And he set [a distance of] three days' journey between himself and Jacob; and Jacob was then left in care of the rest of Laban's flock.
Genesis,30,37,But Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane trees and peeled white streaks in them exposing the white in the rods.
Genesis,30,38,Then he set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink. And since they bred and conceived when they came to drink
Genesis,30,39,The flocks bred and conceived in sight of the rods and brought forth lambs and kids streaked speckled and spotted.
Genesis,30,40,Jacob separated the lambs and [as he had done with the peeled rods] he also set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the dark in the [new] flock of Laban; and he put his own droves by themselves and did not let them breed with Laban's flock.
Genesis,30,41,And whenever the stronger animals were breeding Jacob laid the rods in the watering troughs before the eyes of the flock that they might breed and conceive among the rods.
Genesis,30,42,But when the sheep and goats were feeble he omitted putting the rods there; so the feebler animals were Laban's and the stronger Jacob's.
Genesis,30,43,Thus the man increased and became exceedingly rich and had many sheep and goats and maidservants menservants camels and donkeys.
Genesis,31,1,JACOB HEARD Laban's sons complaining Jacob has taken away all that was our father's; he has acquired all this wealth and honor from what belonged to our father.
Genesis,31,2,And Jacob noticed that Laban looked at him less favorably than before.
Genesis,31,3,Then the Lord said to Jacob Return to the land of your fathers and to your people and I will be with you.
Genesis,31,4,So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock
Genesis,31,5,And he said to them I see how your father looks at me that he is not [friendly] toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.
Genesis,31,6,You know that I have served your father with all my might and power.
Genesis,31,7,But your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times but God did not allow him to hurt me.
Genesis,31,8,If he said The speckled shall be your wages then all the flock bore speckled; and if he said The streaked shall be your hire then all the flock bore streaked.
Genesis,31,9,Thus God has taken away the flocks of your father and given them to me.
Genesis,31,10,And I had a dream at the time the flock conceived. I looked up and saw that the rams which mated with the she-goats were streaked speckled and spotted.
Genesis,31,11,And the Angel of God said to me in the dream Jacob. And I said Here am I.
Genesis,31,12,And He said Look up and see all the rams which mate with the flock are streaked speckled and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban does to you.
Genesis,31,13,I am the God of Bethel where you anointed the pillar and where you vowed a vow to Me. Now arise get out from this land and return to your native land.
Genesis,31,14,And Rachel and Leah answered him Is there any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
Genesis,31,15,Are we not counted by him as strangers? For he sold us and has also quite devoured our money [the price you paid for us].
Genesis,31,16,For all the riches which God has taken from our father are ours and our children's. Now then whatever God has said to you do it.
Genesis,31,17,Then Jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;
Genesis,31,18,And he drove away all his livestock and all his gain which he had gotten the livestock he had obtained and accumulated in Padan-aram to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.
Genesis,31,19,Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep [possibly to the feast of sheepshearing] and Rachel stole her father's household gods.
Genesis,31,20,And Jacob outwitted Laban the Syrian [Aramean] in that he did not tell him that he [intended] to flee and slip away secretly.
Genesis,31,21,So he fled with all that he had and arose and crossed the river [Euphrates] and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.
Genesis,31,22,But on the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
Genesis,31,23,So he took his kinsmen with him and pursued after [Jacob] for seven days and they overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.
Genesis,31,24,But God came to Laban the Syrian [Aramean] in a dream by night and said to him Be careful that you do not speak from good to bad to Jacob [peaceably then violently].
Genesis,31,25,Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent on the hill and Laban coming with his kinsmen pitched [his tents] on the same hill of Gilead.
Genesis,31,26,And Laban said to Jacob What do you mean stealing away and leaving like this without my knowing it and carrying off my daughters as if captives of the sword?
Genesis,31,27,Why did you flee secretly and cheat me and did not tell me so that I might have sent you away with joy and gladness and with singing with tambourine and lyre?
Genesis,31,28,And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons [grandchildren] and my daughters good-bye? Now you have done foolishly [in behaving like this].
Genesis,31,29,It is in my power to do you harm; but the God of your father spoke to me last night saying Be careful that you do not speak from good to bad to Jacob [peaceably then violently].
Genesis,31,30,And now you felt you must go because you were homesick for your father's house but why did you steal my [household] gods?
Genesis,31,31,Jacob answered Laban Because I was afraid; for I thought Suppose you would take your daughters from me by force.
Genesis,31,32,The one with whom you find those gods of yours let him not live. Here before our kinsmen [search my possessions and] take whatever you find that belongs to you. For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen [the images].
Genesis,31,33,So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and the tent of the two maids but he did not find them. Then he went from Leah's tent into Rachel's tent.
Genesis,31,34,Now Rachel had taken the images (gods) and put them in the camel's saddle and sat on them. Laban searched and felt through all the tent but did not find them.
Genesis,31,35,And [Rachel] said to her father Do not be displeased my lord that I cannot rise up before you for the period of women is upon me and I am unwell. And he searched but did not find the gods.
Genesis,31,36,Then Jacob became angry and reproached and argued with Laban. And Jacob said to Laban What is my fault? What is my sin that you so hotly pursued me?
Genesis,31,37,Although you have searched and felt through all my household possessions what have you found of all your household goods? Put it here before my brethren and yours that they may judge and decide between us.
Genesis,31,38,These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your she-goats have not lost their young and the rams of your flock have not been eaten by me.
Genesis,31,39,I did not bring you [the carcasses of the animals] torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss of it; you required of me [to make good] all that was stolen whether it occurred by day or by night.
Genesis,31,40,This was [my lot]; by day the heat consumed me and by night the cold and I could not sleep.
Genesis,31,41,I have been twenty years in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks; and you have changed my wages ten times.
Genesis,31,42,And if the God of my father the God of Abraham and the Dread [lest he should fall] and Fear [lest he offend] of Isaac had not been with me surely you would have sent me away now empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and humiliation and the [wearying] labor of my hands and rebuked you last night.
Genesis,31,43,Laban answered Jacob These daughters are my daughters these children are my children these flocks are my flocks and all that you see is mine. But what can I do today to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?
Genesis,31,44,So come now let us make a covenant or league you and I and let it be for a witness between you and me.
Genesis,31,45,So Jacob set up a stone for a pillar or monument.
Genesis,31,46,And Jacob said to his brethren Gather stones; and they took stones and made a heap and they ate [together] there upon the heap.
Genesis,31,47,Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha [witness heap in Aramaic ] but Jacob called it Galeed [ witness heap in Hebrew. ]
Genesis,31,48,Laban said This heap is a witness today between you and me. Therefore it was named Galeed.
Genesis,31,49,And [the pillar or monument was called] Mizpah [watchpost] for he [Laban] said May the Lord watch between you and me when we are absent and hidden one from another.
Genesis,31,50,If you should afflict humiliate or lower [divorce] my daughters or if you should take other wives beside my daughters although no man is with us [to witness] see (remember) God is witness between you and me.
Genesis,31,51,And Laban said to Jacob See this heap and this pillar which I have set up between you and me.
Genesis,31,52,This heap is a witness and this pillar is a witness that I will not pass by this heap to you and that you will not pass by this heap and this pillar to me for harm.
Genesis,31,53,The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor and the god [the object of worship] of their father [Terah an idolator] judge between us. But Jacob swore [only] by [the one true God] the Dread and Fear of his father Isaac.
Genesis,31,54,Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called his brethren to eat food; and they ate food and lingered all night on the mountain.
Genesis,31,55,And early in the morning Laban rose up and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and pronounced a blessing [asking God's favor] on them. Then Laban departed and returned to his home.
Genesis,32,1,THEN JACOB went on his way and God's angels met him.
Genesis,32,2,When Jacob saw them he said This is God's army! So he named that place Mahanaim [two armies].
Genesis,32,3,And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir the country of Edom.
Genesis,32,4,And he commanded them Say this to my lord Esau: Your servant Jacob says this: I have been living temporarily with Laban and have stayed there till now.
Genesis,32,5,And I have oxen donkeys flocks menservants and women servants; and I have sent to tell my lord that I may find mercy and kindness in your sight.
Genesis,32,6,And the messengers returned to Jacob saying We came to your brother Esau; and now he is [on the way] to meet you and four hundred men are with him.
Genesis,32,7,Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him and the flocks and herds and camels into two groups
Genesis,32,8,Thinking If Esau comes to the one group and smites it then the other group which is left will escape.
Genesis,32,9,Jacob said O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac the Lord Who said to me Return to your country and to your people and I will do you good
Genesis,32,10,I am not worthy of the least of all the mercy and loving-kindness and all the faithfulness which You have shown to Your servant for with [only] my staff I passed over this Jordan [long ago] and now I have become two companies.
Genesis,32,11,Deliver me I pray You from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau; for I fear him lest he come and smite [us all] the mothers with the children.
Genesis,32,12,And You said I will surely do you good and make your descendants as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude.
Genesis,32,13,And Jacob lodged there that night and took from what he had with him as a present for his brother Esau:
Genesis,32,14,Two hundred she-goats 20 he-goats 200 ewes 20 rams
Genesis,32,15,Thirty milk camels with their colts 40 cows 10 bulls 20 she-donkeys and 10 [donkey] colts.
Genesis,32,16,And he put them into the charge of his servants every drove by itself and said to his servants Pass over before me and put a space between drove and drove.
Genesis,32,17,And he commanded the first When Esau my brother meets you and asks to whom you belong where you are going and whose are the animals before you
Genesis,32,18,Then you shall say They are your servant Jacob's; it is a present sent to my lord Esau; and moreover he is behind us.
Genesis,32,19,And so he commanded the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying This is what you are to say to Esau when you meet him.
Genesis,32,20,And say Moreover your servant Jacob is behind us. For he said I will appease him with the present that goes before me and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me.
Genesis,32,21,So the present went on before him and he himself lodged that night in the camp.
Genesis,32,22,But he rose up that [same] night and took his two wives his two women servants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford [of the] Jabbok.
Genesis,32,23,And he took them and sent them across the brook; also he sent over all that he had.
Genesis,32,24,And Jacob was left alone and a Man wrestled with him until daybreak.
Genesis,32,25,And when [the Man] saw that He did not prevail against [Jacob] He touched the hollow of his thigh; and Jacob's thigh was put out of joint as he wrestled with Him.
Genesis,32,26,Then He said Let Me go for day is breaking. But [Jacob] said I will not let You go unless You declare a blessing upon me.
Genesis,32,27,[The Man] asked him What is your name? And [in shock of realization whispering] he said Jacob [supplanter schemer trickster swindler]!
Genesis,32,28,And He said Your name shall be called no more Jacob [supplanter] but Israel [contender with God]; for you have contended and have power with God and with men and have prevailed.
Genesis,32,29,Then Jacob asked Him Tell me I pray You what [in contrast] is Your name? But He said Why is it that you ask My name? And [the Angel of God declared] a blessing on [Jacob] there.
Genesis,32,30,And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel [the face of God] saying For I have seen God face to face and my life is spared and not snatched away.
Genesis,32,31,And as he passed Penuel [Peniel] the sun rose upon him and he was limping because of his thigh.
Genesis,32,32,That is why to this day the Israelites do not eat the sinew of the hip which is on the hollow of the thigh because [the Angel of the Lord] touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh on the sinew of the hip.
Genesis,33,1,AND JACOB raised his eyes and looked and behold Esau was coming and with him 400 men. So he divided the children to Leah and to Rachel and to the two maids.
Genesis,33,2,And he put the maids and their children in front Leah and her children after them and Rachel and Joseph last of all.
Genesis,33,3,Then Jacob went over [the stream] before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother.
Genesis,33,4,But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept.
Genesis,33,5,[Esau] looked up and saw the women and the children and said Who are these with you? And [Jacob] replied They are the children whom God has graciously given your servant.
Genesis,33,6,Then the maids came near they and their children and they bowed themselves.
Genesis,33,7,And Leah also with her children came near and they bowed themselves. After them Joseph and Rachel came near and they bowed themselves.
Genesis,33,8,Esau said What do you mean by all this company which I met? And he said These are that I might find favor in the sight of my lord.
Genesis,33,9,And Esau said I have plenty my brother; keep what you have for yourself.
Genesis,33,10,But Jacob replied No I beg of you if now I have found favor in your sight receive my gift that I am presenting; for truly to see your face is to me as if I had seen the face of God and you have received me favorably.
Genesis,33,11,Accept I beg of you my blessing and gift that I have brought to you; for God has dealt graciously with me and I have everything. And he kept urging him and he accepted it.
Genesis,33,12,Then [Esau] said Let us get started on our journey and I will go before you.
Genesis,33,13,But Jacob replied You know my lord that the children are tender and delicate and need gentle care and the flocks and herds with young are of concern to me; for if the men should overdrive them for a single day the whole of the flocks would die.
Genesis,33,14,Let my lord I pray you pass over before his servant; and I will lead on slowly governed by [consideration for] the livestock that set the pace before me and the endurance of the children until I come to my lord in Seir.
Genesis,33,15,Then Esau said Let me now leave with you some of the people who are with me. But [Jacob] said What need is there for it? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.
Genesis,33,16,So Esau turned back that day on his way to Seir.
Genesis,33,17,But Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built himself a house and made booths or places of shelter for his livestock; so the name of the place is called Succoth [booths].
Genesis,33,18,When Jacob came from Padan-aram he arrived safely and in peace at the town of Shechem in the land of Canaan and pitched his tents before the [enclosed] town.
Genesis,33,19,Then he bought the piece of land on which he had encamped from the sons of Hamor Shechem's father for a hundred pieces of money.
Genesis,33,20,There he erected an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel [God the God of Israel].
Genesis,34,1,NOW DINAH daughter of Leah whom she bore to Jacob went out [unattended] to see the girls of the place.
Genesis,34,2,And when Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite prince of the country saw her he seized her lay with her and humbled defiled and disgraced her.
Genesis,34,3,But his soul longed for and clung to Dinah daughter of Jacob and he loved the girl and spoke comfortingly to her young heart's wishes.
Genesis,34,4,And Shechem said to his father Hamor Get me this girl to be my wife.
Genesis,34,5,Jacob heard that [Shechem] had defiled Dinah his daughter. Now his sons were with his livestock in the field. So Jacob held his peace until they came.
Genesis,34,6,But Hamor father of Shechem went out to Jacob to have a talk with him.
Genesis,34,7,When Jacob's sons heard it they came from the field; and they were distressed and grieved and very angry for [Shechem] had done a vile thing to Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter which ought not to be done.
Genesis,34,8,And Hamor conferred with them saying The soul of my son Shechem craves your daughter [and sister]. I beg of you give her to him to be his wife.
Genesis,34,9,And make marriages with us and give your daughters to us and take our daughters to you.
Genesis,34,10,You shall dwell with us; the country will be open to you; live and trade and get your possessions in it.
Genesis,34,11,And Shechem said to [Dinah's] father and to her brothers Let me find favor in your eyes and I will give you whatever you ask of me.
Genesis,34,12,Ask me ever so much dowry and [marriage] gift and I will give according to what you tell me; only give me the girl to be my wife.
Genesis,34,13,The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully [ justifying their intended action by saying in effect we are going to do this] because Shechem had defiled and disgraced their sister Dinah.
Genesis,34,14,They said to them We cannot do this thing and give our sister to one who is not circumcised for that would be a reproach and disgrace to us.
Genesis,34,15,But we do consent to do this: if you will become as we are and every male among you be circumcised
Genesis,34,16,Then we will give our daughters to you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and become one people.
Genesis,34,17,But if you will not listen to us and consent to be circumcised then we will take our daughter and go.
Genesis,34,18,Their words pleased Hamor and his son Shechem.
Genesis,34,19,And the young man did not delay to do the thing for he delighted in Jacob's daughter. He was honored above all his family [so ranking first he acted first].
Genesis,34,20,Then Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their [enclosed] town and discussed the matter with the citizens saying
Genesis,34,21,These men are peaceable with us; so let them dwell in the land and trade in it; for the land is large enough [for us and] for them; let us take their daughters for wives and let us give them our daughters.
Genesis,34,22,But the men will consent to our request that they live among us and be one people only on condition that every male among us be circumcised as they are.
Genesis,34,23,Shall not their cattle and their possessions and all their beasts be ours? Only let us consent to them and they will dwell here with us.
Genesis,34,24,And all the people who went out of the town gate listened and heeded what Hamor and Shechem said; and every male was circumcised who was a resident of that town.
Genesis,34,25,But on the third day [after the circumcision] when [all the men] were sore two of the sons of Jacob Simeon and Levi Dinah's [full] brothers took their swords boldly entered the city [without danger] and slew all the males.
Genesis,34,26,And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took Dinah out of Shechem's house [where she had been all this time] and departed.
Genesis,34,27,[Then the rest of] Jacob's [eleven] sons came upon the slain and plundered the town because there their sister had been defiled and disgraced.
Genesis,34,28,They took their flocks their herds their donkeys and whatever was in the town and in the field;
Genesis,34,29,All their wealth and all their little ones and their wives they took captive making spoil even of all [they found] in the houses.
Genesis,34,30,And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi You have ruined me making me infamous and embroiling me with the inhabitants of the land the Canaanites and the Perizzites! And we are few in number and they will gather together against me and attack me; and I shall be destroyed I and my household.
Genesis,34,31,And they said Should he [be permitted to] deal with our sister as with a harlot?
Genesis,35,1,AND GOD said to Jacob Arise go up to Bethel and dwell there. And make there an altar to God Who appeared to you [in a distinct manifestation] when you fled from the presence of Esau your brother.
Genesis,35,2,Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him Put away the [images of] strange gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change [into fresh] garments;
Genesis,35,3,Then let us arise and go up to Bethel and I will make there an altar to God Who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me wherever I went.
Genesis,35,4,So they [both young men and women] gave to Jacob all the strange gods they had and their earrings which were [worn as charms against evil] in their ears; and Jacob buried and hid them under the oak near Shechem.
Genesis,35,5,And they journeyed and a terror from God fell on the towns round about them and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.
Genesis,35,6,So Jacob came to Luz that is Bethel which is in the land of Canaan he and all the people with him.
Genesis,35,7,There he built an altar and called the place El-bethel [God of Bethel] for there God revealed Himself to him when he fled from the presence of his brother.
Genesis,35,8,But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died and was buried below Bethel under an oak; and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth [oak of weeping].
Genesis,35,9,And God [in a distinctly visible manifestation] appeared to Jacob again when he came out of Padan-aram and declared a blessing on him.
Genesis,35,10,Again God said to him Your name is Jacob [supplanter]; you shall not be called Jacob any longer but Israel shall be your name. So He called him Israel [contender with God].
Genesis,35,11,And God said to him I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall come from you and kings shall be born of your stock;
Genesis,35,12,The land which I gave Abraham and Isaac I will give to you and to your descendants after you I will give the land.
Genesis,35,13,Then God ascended from him in the place where He talked with him.
Genesis,35,14,And Jacob set up a pillar (monument) in the place where he talked with [God] a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink offering on it and he poured oil on it.
Genesis,35,15,And Jacob called the name of the place where God had talked with him Bethel [house of God].
Genesis,35,16,And they journeyed from Bethel and had but a little way to go to Ephrath [Bethlehem] when Rachel suffered the pangs of childbirth and had hard labor.
Genesis,35,17,When she was in hard labor the midwife said to her Do not be afraid; you shall have this son also.
Genesis,35,18,And as her soul was departing for she died she called his name Ben-oni [son of my sorrow]; but his father called him Benjamin [son of the right hand].
Genesis,35,19,So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath that is Bethlehem.
Genesis,35,20,And Jacob set a pillar (monument) on her grave; that is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.
Genesis,35,21,Then Israel journeyed on and spread his tent on the other side of the tower of Edar.
Genesis,35,22,When Israel dwelt there Reuben [his eldest son] went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heard about it. Now Jacob's sons were twelve.
Genesis,35,23,The sons of Leah: Reuben Jacob's firstborn Simeon Levi Judah Issachar and Zebulun.
Genesis,35,24,The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis,35,25,The sons of Bilhah Rachel's maid: Dan and Naphtali.
Genesis,35,26,And the sons of Zilpah Leah's maid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob born to him in Padan-aram.
Genesis,35,27,And Jacob came to Isaac his father at Mamre or Kiriath-arba that is Hebron where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.
Genesis,35,28,Now the days of Isaac were 180 years.
Genesis,35,29,And Isaac's spirit departed; he died and was gathered to his people being an old man satisfied and satiated with days; his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
Genesis,36,1,NOW THIS is the history of the descendants of Esau that is Edom.
Genesis,36,2,Esau took his wives from the women of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite and Oholibamah daughter of Anah the son of Zibeon the Hivite

Genesis,36,4,Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz; Basemath bore Reuel;
Genesis,36,5,And Oholibamah bore Jeush Jalam and Korah. These are the sons of Esau born to him in Canaan.
Genesis,36,6,Now Esau took his wives his sons his daughters and all the members of his household his cattle all his beasts and all his possessions which he had obtained in the land of Canaan and he went into a land away from his brother Jacob.
Genesis,36,7,For their great flocks and herds and possessions [which they had collected] made it impossible for them to dwell together; the land in which they were strangers could not support them because of their livestock.
Genesis,36,8,So Esau dwelt in the hill country of Seir; Esau is Edom.
Genesis,36,9,And this is the history of the descendants of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir.
Genesis,36,10,These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah Esau's wife and Reuel the son of Basemath Esau's wife.

Genesis,36,23,The sons of Shobal are these: Alvan Manahath Ebal Shepho and Onam.
Genesis,36,24,These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness as he pastured the donkeys of Zibeon his father.
Genesis,36,25,The children of Anah are these: Dishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah [Esau's wife].
Genesis,36,26,These are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan Eshban Ithran and Cheran.

Genesis,36,30,Dishon Ezer Dishan. These are the Horite chiefs according to their clans in the land of Seir.
Genesis,36,31,And these are the kings who reigned in Edom before any king reigned over the Israelites:
Genesis,36,32,Bela son of Beor reigned in Edom. And the name of his city was Dinhabah.
Genesis,36,33,Now Bela died and Jobab son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.
Genesis,36,34,Then Jobab died and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead.
Genesis,36,35,And Husham died and Hadad son of Bedad who defeated Midian in the country of Moab reigned in his stead. The name of his [enclosed] city was Avith.
Genesis,36,36,Hadad died and Samlah of Masrekah succeeded him.

Genesis,36,42,Kenaz Teman Mibzar
Genesis,36,43,Magdiel and Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom [that is of Esau the father of the Edomites] according to their dwelling places in their land.
Genesis,37,1,SO JACOB dwelt in the land in which his father had been a stranger and sojourner in the land of Canaan.
Genesis,37,2,This is the history of the descendants of Jacob and this is Jacob's line. Joseph when he was seventeen years old was shepherding the flock with his brothers; the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah his father's [secondary] wives; and Joseph brought to his father a bad report of them.
Genesis,37,3,Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a [distinctive] long tunic with sleeves.
Genesis,37,4,But when his brothers saw that their father loved [Joseph] more than all of his brothers they hated him and could not say Peace [in friendly greeting] to him or speak peaceably to him.
Genesis,37,5,Now Joseph had a dream and he told it to his brothers and they hated him still more.
Genesis,37,6,And he said to them Listen now and hear I pray you this dream that I have dreamed:
Genesis,37,7,We [brothers] were binding sheaves in the field and behold my sheaf arose and stood upright and behold your sheaves stood round about my sheaf and bowed down!
Genesis,37,8,His brothers said to him Shall you indeed reign over us? Or are you going to have us as your subjects and dominate us? And they hated him all the more for his dreams and for what he said.
Genesis,37,9,But Joseph dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brothers [also]. He said See here I have dreamed again and behold [this time not only] eleven stars [but also] the sun and the moon bowed down and did reverence to me!
Genesis,37,10,And he told it to his father [as well as] his brethren. But his father rebuked him and said to him What is the meaning of this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers actually come to bow down ourselves to the earth and do homage to you?
Genesis,37,11,Joseph's brothers envied him and were jealous of him but his father observed the saying and pondered over it.
Genesis,37,12,Joseph's brothers went to shepherd and feed their father's flock near Shechem.
Genesis,37,13,[One day] Israel said to Joseph Do not your brothers shepherd my flock at Shechem? Come and I will send you to them. And he said Here I am.
Genesis,37,14,And [Jacob] said to him Go I pray you see whether everything is all right with your brothers and with the flock; then come back and bring me word. So he sent him out of the Hebron Valley and he came to Shechem.
Genesis,37,15,And a certain man found him and behold he had lost his way and was wandering in the open country. The man asked him What are you trying to find?
Genesis,37,16,And he said I am looking for my brothers. Tell me I pray you where they are pasturing our flocks.
Genesis,37,17,But the man said [They were here but] they have gone. I heard them say Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
Genesis,37,18,And when they saw him far off even before he came near to them they conspired to kill him.
Genesis,37,19,And they said one to another See here comes this dreamer and master of dreams.
Genesis,37,20,So come on now let us kill him and throw his body into some pit; then we will say [to our father] Some wild and ferocious animal has devoured him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams!
Genesis,37,21,Now Reuben heard it and he delivered him out of their hands by saying Let us not kill him.
Genesis,37,22,And Reuben said to them Shed no blood but cast him into this pit or well that is out here in the wilderness and lay no hand on him. He was trying to get Joseph out of their hands in order to rescue him and deliver him again to his father.
Genesis,37,23,When Joseph had come to his brothers they stripped him of his [distinctive] long garment which he was wearing;
Genesis,37,24,Then they took him and cast him into the [well-like] pit which was empty; there was no water in it.
Genesis,37,25,Then they sat down to eat their lunch. When they looked up behold they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites [mixed Arabians] coming from Gilead with their camels bearing gum [of the styrax tree] balm (balsam) and myrrh or ladanum going on their way to carry them down to Egypt.
Genesis,37,26,And Judah said to his brothers What do we gain if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?
Genesis,37,27,Come let us sell him to the Ishmaelites [and Midianites these mixed Arabians who are approaching] and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brothers consented.
Genesis,37,28,Then as the Midianite [and Ishmaelite] merchants were passing by the brothers pulled Joseph up and lifted him out of the well. And they sold him for twenty pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites who took Joseph [captive] into Egypt.
Genesis,37,29,Then Reuben [who had not been there when the brothers plotted to sell the lad] returned to the pit; and behold Joseph was not in the pit and he rent his clothes.
Genesis,37,30,He rejoined his brothers and said The boy is not there! And I where shall I go [to hide from my father]?
Genesis,37,31,Then they took Joseph's [distinctive] long garment killed a young goat and dipped the garment in the blood;
Genesis,37,32,And they sent the garment to their father saying We have found this! Examine and decide whether it is your son's tunic or not.
Genesis,37,33,He said My son's long garment! An evil [wild] beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
Genesis,37,34,And Jacob tore his clothes put on sackcloth and mourned many days for his son.
Genesis,37,35,And all his sons and daughters attempted to console him but he refused to be comforted and said I will go down to Sheol (the place of the dead) to my son mourning. And his father wept for him.
Genesis,37,36,And the Midianites [and Ishmaelites] sold [Joseph] in Egypt to Potiphar an officer of Pharaoh and the captain and chief executioner of the [royal] guard.
Genesis,38,1,AT THAT time Judah withdrew from his brothers and went to [lodge with] a certain Adullamite named Hirah.
Genesis,38,2,There Judah saw and met a daughter of Shuah a Canaanite; he took her as wife and lived with her.
Genesis,38,3,And she became pregnant and bore a son and he called him Er.
Genesis,38,4,And she conceived again and bore a son and named him Onan.
Genesis,38,5,Again she conceived and bore a son and named him Shelah. [They were living] at Chezib when she bore him.
Genesis,38,6,Now Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn; her name was Tamar.
Genesis,38,7,And Er Judah's firstborn was wicked in the sight of the Lord and the Lord slew him.
Genesis,38,8,Then Judah told Onan Marry your brother's widow; live with her and raise offspring for your brother.
Genesis,38,9,But Onan knew that the family would not be his so when he cohabited with his brother's widow he prevented conception lest he should raise up a child for his brother.
Genesis,38,10,And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; therefore He slew him also.
Genesis,38,11,Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law Remain a widow at your father's house till Shelah my [youngest] son is grown; for he thought Lest perhaps [if Shelah should marry her] he would die also as his brothers did. So Tamar went and lived in her father's house.
Genesis,38,12,But later Judah's wife the daughter of Shuah died; and when Judah was comforted he went up to his sheepshearers at Timnath with his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
Genesis,38,13,Then it was told Tamar Listen your father-in-law is going up to Timnath to shear his sheep.
Genesis,38,14,So she put off her widow's garments and covered herself with a veil wrapped herself up [in disguise] and sat in the entrance of Enaim which is by the road to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown and she was not given to him as his wife.
Genesis,38,15,When Judah saw her he thought she was a harlot or devoted prostitute [under a vow to her goddess] for she had covered her face [as such women did].
Genesis,38,16,He turned to her by the road and said Come let me have intercourse with you; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said What will you give me that you may have intercourse with me?
Genesis,38,17,He answered I will send you a kid from the flock. And she said Will you give me a pledge (deposit) until you send it?
Genesis,38,18,And he said What pledge shall I give you? She said Your signet [seal] your [signet] cord and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave them to her and came in to her and she became pregnant by him.
Genesis,38,19,And she arose and went away and laid aside her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood.
Genesis,38,20,And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite to receive his pledge from the woman's hand; but he was unable to find her.
Genesis,38,21,He asked the men of that place Where is the harlot or cult prostitute who was openly by the roadside? They said There was no harlot or temple prostitute here.
Genesis,38,22,So he returned to Judah and said I cannot find her; and also the local men said There was no harlot or temple prostitute around here.
Genesis,38,23,And Judah said Let her keep [the pledge articles] for herself lest we be made ashamed. I sent this kid but you have not found her.
Genesis,38,24,But about three months later Judah was told Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot and also she is with child by her lewdness. And Judah said Bring her forth and let her be burned!
Genesis,38,25,When she was brought forth she [took the things he had given her in pledge and] sent [them] to her father-in-law saying I am with child by the man to whom these articles belong. Then she added Make out clearly I pray you to whom these belong the signet [seal] [signet] cord and staff.
Genesis,38,26,And Judah acknowledged them and said She has been more righteous and just than I because I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he did not cohabit with her again.
Genesis,38,27,Now when the time came for her to be delivered behold there were twins in her womb.
Genesis,38,28,And when she was in labor one baby put out his hand; and the midwife took his hand and bound upon it a scarlet thread saying This baby was born first.
Genesis,38,29,But he drew back his hand and behold his brother was born first. And she said What a breaking forth you have made for yourself! Therefore his name was called Perez [breaking forth].
Genesis,38,30,And afterward his brother who had the scarlet thread on his hand was born and was named Zerah [scarlet].
Genesis,39,1,AND JOSEPH was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar an officer of Pharaoh the captain and chief executioner of the [royal] guard an Egyptian bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.
Genesis,39,2,But the Lord was with Joseph and he [though a slave] was a successful and prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
Genesis,39,3,And his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to flourish and succeed in his hand.
Genesis,39,4,So Joseph pleased [Potiphar] and found favor in his sight and he served him. And [his master] made him supervisor over his house and he put all that he had in his charge.
Genesis,39,5,From the time that he made him supervisor in his house and over all that he had the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the Lord's blessing was on all that he had in the house and in the field.
Genesis,39,6,And [Potiphar] left all that he had in Joseph's charge and paid no attention to anything he had except the food he ate. Now Joseph was an attractive person and fine-looking.
Genesis,39,7,Then after a time his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and she said Lie with me.
Genesis,39,8,But he refused and said to his master's wife See here with me in the house my master has concern about nothing; he has put all that he has in my care.
Genesis,39,9,He is not greater in this house than I am; nor has he kept anything from me except you for you are his wife. How then can I do this great evil and sin against God?
Genesis,39,10,She spoke to Joseph day after day but he did not listen to her to lie with her or to be with her.
Genesis,39,11,Then it happened about this time that Joseph went into the house to attend to his duties and none of the men of the house were indoors.
Genesis,39,12,And she caught him by his garment saying Lie with me! But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out [of the house].
Genesis,39,13,And when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled away
Genesis,39,14,She called to the men of her household and said to them Behold he [your master] has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock and insult us; he came in where I was to lie with me and I screamed at the top of my voice.
Genesis,39,15,And when he heard me screaming and crying he left his garment with me and fled and got out of the house.
Genesis,39,16,And she laid up his garment by her until his master came home.
Genesis,39,17,Then she told him the same story saying The Hebrew servant whom you brought among us came to me to mock and insult me.
Genesis,39,18,And when I screamed and cried he left his garment with me and fled out [of the house].
Genesis,39,19,And when [Joseph's] master heard the words of his wife saying to him This is the way your servant treated me his wrath was kindled.
Genesis,39,20,And Joseph's master took him and put him in the prison a place where the state prisoners were confined; so he was there in the prison.
Genesis,39,21,But the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy and loving-kindness and gave him favor in the sight of the warden of the prison.
Genesis,39,22,And the warden of the prison committed to Joseph's care all the prisoners who were in the prison; and whatsoever was done there he was in charge of it.
Genesis,39,23,The prison warden paid no attention to anything that was in [Joseph's] charge for the Lord was with him and made whatever he did to prosper.
Genesis,40,1,NOW SOME time later the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their lord Egypt's king.
Genesis,40,2,And Pharaoh was angry with his officers the chief of the butlers and the chief of the bakers.
Genesis,40,3,He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard in the prison where Joseph was confined.
Genesis,40,4,And the captain of the guard put them in Joseph's charge and he served them; and they continued in custody for some time.
Genesis,40,5,And they both dreamed a dream in the same night each man according to [the personal significance of] the interpretation of his dream--the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt who were confined in the prison.
Genesis,40,6,When Joseph came to them in the morning and looked at them he saw that they were sad and depressed.
Genesis,40,7,So he asked Pharaoh's officers who were in custody with him in his master's house Why do you look so dejected and sad today?
Genesis,40,8,And they said to him We have dreamed dreams and there is no one to interpret them. And Joseph said to them Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me [your dreams] I pray you.
Genesis,40,9,And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph and said to him In my dream I saw a vine before me
Genesis,40,10,And on the vine were three branches. Then it was as though it budded; its blossoms burst forth and the clusters of them brought forth ripe grapes [almost all at once].
Genesis,40,11,And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup; then I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
Genesis,40,12,And Joseph said to him This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days.
Genesis,40,13,Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position and you will again put Pharaoh's cup into his hand as when you were his butler.
Genesis,40,14,But think of me when it shall be well with you and show kindness I beg of you to me and mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this house.
Genesis,40,15,For truly I was carried away from the land of the Hebrews by unlawful force and here too I have done nothing for which they should put me into the dungeon.
Genesis,40,16,When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said to Joseph I also dreamed and behold I had three cake baskets on my head.
Genesis,40,17,And in the uppermost basket were some of all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh but the birds [of prey] were eating out of the basket on my head.
Genesis,40,18,And Joseph answered This is the interpretation of it: The three baskets are three days.
Genesis,40,19,Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head but will have you beheaded and hung on a tree and [you will not so much as be given burial but] the birds will eat your flesh.
Genesis,40,20,And on the third day Pharaoh's birthday he made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the heads of the chief butler and the chief baker [by inviting them also] among his servants.
Genesis,40,21,And he restored the chief butler to his butlership and the butler gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand;
Genesis,40,22,But [Pharaoh] hanged the chief baker as Joseph had interpreted to them.
Genesis,40,23,But [even after all that] the chief butler gave no thought to Joseph but forgot [all about] him.
Genesis,41,1,AFTER TWO full years Pharaoh dreamed that he stood by the river [Nile].
Genesis,41,2,And behold there came up out of the river [Nile] seven well-favored cows sleek and handsome and fat; and they grazed in the reed grass [in a marshy pasture].
Genesis,41,3,And behold seven other cows came up after them out of the river [Nile] ill favored and gaunt and ugly and stood by the fat cows on the bank of the river [Nile].
Genesis,41,4,And the ill-favored gaunt and ugly cows ate up the seven well-favored and fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.
Genesis,41,5,But he slept and dreamed the second time; and behold seven ears of grain came out on one stalk plump and good.
Genesis,41,6,And behold after them seven ears [of grain] sprouted thin and blighted by the east wind.
Genesis,41,7,And the seven thin ears [of grain] devoured the seven plump and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream.
Genesis,41,8,So when morning came his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all the magicians and all the wise men of Egypt. And Pharaoh told them his dreams but not one could interpret them to [him].
Genesis,41,9,Then the chief butler said to Pharaoh I remember my faults today.
Genesis,41,10,When Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me in custody in the captain of the guard's house both me and the chief baker
Genesis,41,11,We dreamed a dream in the same night he and I; we dreamed each of us according to [the significance of] the interpretation of his dream.
Genesis,41,12,And there was there with us a young man a Hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and chief executioner; and we told him our dreams and he interpreted them to us to each man according to the significance of his dream.
Genesis,41,13,And as he interpreted to us so it came to pass; I was restored to my office [as chief butler] and the baker was hanged.
Genesis,41,14,Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. But Joseph [first] shaved himself changed his clothes and made himself presentable; then he came into Pharaoh's presence.
Genesis,41,15,And Pharaoh said to Joseph I have dreamed a dream and there is no one who can interpret it; and I have heard it said of you that you can understand a dream and interpret it.
Genesis,41,16,Joseph answered Pharaoh It is not in me; God [not I] will give Pharaoh a [favorable] answer of peace.
Genesis,41,17,And Pharaoh said to Joseph In my dream behold I stood on the bank of the river [Nile];
Genesis,41,18,And behold there came up out of the river [Nile] seven fat sleek and handsome cows and they grazed in the reed grass [of a marshy pasture].
Genesis,41,19,And behold seven other cows came up after them undernourished gaunt and ugly [just skin and bones; such emaciated animals] as I have never seen in all of Egypt.
Genesis,41,20,And the lean and ill favored cows ate up the seven fat cows that had come first.
Genesis,41,21,And when they had eaten them up it could not be detected and known that they had eaten them for they were still as thin and emaciated as at the beginning. Then I awoke. [But again I fell asleep and dreamed.]
Genesis,41,22,And I saw in my dream and behold seven ears [of grain] growing on one stalk plump and good.
Genesis,41,23,And behold seven [other] ears withered thin and blighted by the east wind sprouted after them.
Genesis,41,24,And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears. Now I told this to the magicians but there was no one who could tell me what it meant.
Genesis,41,25,Then Joseph said to Pharaoh The [two] dreams are one; God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.
Genesis,41,26,The seven good cows are seven years and the seven good ears [of grain] are seven years; the [two] dreams are one [in their meaning].
Genesis,41,27,And the seven thin and ill favored cows that came up after them are seven years and also the seven empty ears [of grain] blighted and shriveled by the east wind; they are seven years of hunger and famine.
Genesis,41,28,This is the message just as I have told Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.
Genesis,41,29,Take note! Seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt are coming.
Genesis,41,30,Then there will come seven years of hunger and famine and [there will be so much want that] all the great abundance of the previous years will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and hunger (destitution starvation) will exhaust (consume finish) the land.
Genesis,41,31,And the plenty will become quite unknown in the land because of that following famine for it will be very woefully severe.
Genesis,41,32,That the dream was sent twice to Pharaoh and in two forms indicates that this thing which God will very soon bring to pass is fully prepared and established by God.
Genesis,41,33,So now let Pharaoh seek out and provide a man discreet understanding proficient and wise and set him over the land of Egypt [as governor].
Genesis,41,34,Let Pharaoh do this; then let him select and appoint officers over the land and take one-fifth [of the produce] of the [whole] land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years [year by year].
Genesis,41,35,And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and lay up grain under the direction and authority of Pharaoh and let them retain food [in fortified granaries] in the cities.
Genesis,41,36,And that food shall be put in store for the country against the seven years of hunger and famine that are to come upon the land of Egypt so that the land may not be ruined and cut off by the famine.
Genesis,41,37,And the plan seemed good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.
Genesis,41,38,And Pharaoh said to his servants Can we find this man's equal a man in whom is the spirit of God?
Genesis,41,39,And Pharaoh said to Joseph Forasmuch as [your] God has shown you all this there is nobody as intelligent and discreet and understanding and wise as you are.
Genesis,41,40,You shall have charge over my house and all my people shall be governed according to your word [with reverence submission and obedience]. Only in matters of the throne will I be greater than you are.
Genesis,41,41,Then Pharaoh said to Joseph See I have set you over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis,41,42,And Pharaoh took off his [signet] ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand and arrayed him in [official] vestments of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck;
Genesis,41,43,He made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and [officials] cried before him Bow the knee! And he set him over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis,41,44,And Pharaoh said to Joseph I am Pharaoh and without you shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
Genesis,41,45,And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah and he gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera priest of On to be his wife. And Joseph made an [inspection] tour of all the land of Egypt.
Genesis,41,46,Joseph [who had been in Egypt thirteen years] was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went [about his duties] through all the land of Egypt.
Genesis,41,47,In the seven abundant years the earth brought forth by handfuls [for each seed planted].
Genesis,41,48,And he gathered up all the [surplus] food of the seven [good] years in the land of Egypt and stored up the food in the cities; he stored away in each city the food from the fields around it.
Genesis,41,49,And Joseph gathered grain as the sand of the sea very much until he stopped counting for it could not be measured.
Genesis,41,50,Now to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came whom Asenath daughter of Potiphera the priest of On bore to him.
Genesis,41,51,And Joseph called the firstborn Manasseh [making to forget] For God said he has made me forget all my toil and hardship and all my father's house.
Genesis,41,52,And the second he called Ephraim [to be fruitful] For [he said] God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
Genesis,41,53,When the seven years of plenty were ended in the land of Egypt
Genesis,41,54,The seven years of scarcity and famine began to come as Joseph had said they would; the famine was in all [the surrounding] lands but in all of Egypt there was food.
Genesis,41,55,But when all the land of Egypt was weakened with hunger the people [there] cried to Pharaoh for food; and Pharaoh said to [them] all Go to Joseph; what he says to you do.
Genesis,41,56,When the famine was over all the land Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians; for the famine grew extremely distressing in the land of Egypt.
Genesis,41,57,And all countries came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain because the famine was severe over all [the known] earth.
Genesis,42,1,NOW WHEN Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt he said to his sons Why do you look at one another?
Genesis,42,2,For he said I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; get down there and buy [grain] for us that we may live and not die.
Genesis,42,3,So ten of Joseph's brethren went to buy grain in Egypt.
Genesis,42,4,But Benjamin Joseph's [full] brother Jacob did not send with his brothers; for he said Lest perhaps some harm or injury should befall him.
Genesis,42,5,So the sons of Israel came to buy grain among those who came for there was hunger and general lack of food in the land of Canaan.
Genesis,42,6,Now Joseph was the governor over the land and he it was who sold to all the people of the land; and Joseph's [half] brothers came and bowed themselves down before him with their faces to the ground.
Genesis,42,7,Joseph saw his brethren and he recognized them but he treated them as if he were a stranger to them and spoke roughly to them. He said Where do you come from? And they replied From the land of Canaan to buy food.
Genesis,42,8,Joseph knew his brethren but they did not know him.
Genesis,42,9,And Joseph remembered the dreams he had dreamed about them and said to them You are spies and with unfriendly purpose you have come to observe [secretly] the nakedness of the land.
Genesis,42,10,But they said to him No my lord but your servants have come [only] to buy food.
Genesis,42,11,We are all one man's sons; we are true men; your servants are not spies.
Genesis,42,12,And he said to them No but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.
Genesis,42,13,But they said Your servants are twelve brothers the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; the youngest is today with our father and one is not.
Genesis,42,14,And Joseph said to them It is as I said to you You are spies.
Genesis,42,15,You shall be proved by this test: by the life of Pharaoh you shall not go away from here unless your youngest brother comes here.
Genesis,42,16,Send one of you and let him bring your brother and you will be kept in prison that your words may be proved whether there is any truth in you; or else by the life of Pharaoh you certainly are spies.
Genesis,42,17,Then he put them all in custody for three days.
Genesis,42,18,And Joseph said to them on the third day Do this and live! I reverence and fear God.
Genesis,42,19,If you are true men let one of your brothers be bound in your prison but [the rest of] you go and carry grain for those weakened with hunger in your households.
Genesis,42,20,But bring your youngest brother to me so your words will be verified and you shall live. And they did so.
Genesis,42,21,And they said one to another We are truly guilty about our brother for we saw the distress and anguish of his soul when he begged us [to let him go] and we would not hear. So this distress and difficulty has come upon us.
Genesis,42,22,Reuben answered them Did I not tell you Do not sin against the boy and you would not hear? Therefore behold his blood is required [of us].
Genesis,42,23,But they did not know that Joseph understood them for he spoke to them through an interpreter.
Genesis,42,24,And he turned away from them and wept; then he returned to them and talked with them and took from them Simeon and bound him before their eyes.
Genesis,42,25,Then [privately] Joseph commanded that their sacks be filled with grain every man's money be restored to his sack and provisions be given to them for the journey. And this was done for them.
Genesis,42,26,They loaded their donkeys with grain and left.
Genesis,42,27,And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place he caught sight of his money; for behold it was in his sack's mouth.
Genesis,42,28,And he said to his brothers My money is restored! Here it is in my sack! And their hearts failed them and they were afraid and turned trembling one to another saying What is this that God has done to us?
Genesis,42,29,When they came to Jacob their father in Canaan they told him all that had befallen them saying
Genesis,42,30,The man who is the lord of the land spoke roughly to us and took us for spies of the country.
Genesis,42,31,And we said to him We are true men not spies.
Genesis,42,32,We are twelve brothers with the same father; one is no more and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan.
Genesis,42,33,And the man the lord of the country said to us By this test I will know whether or not you are honest men: leave one of your brothers here with me and take grain for your famishing households and be gone.
Genesis,42,34,Bring your youngest brother to me; then I will know that you are not spies but that you are honest men. And I will deliver to you your brother [whom I have kept bound in prison] and you may do business in the land.
Genesis,42,35,When they emptied their sacks behold every man's parcel of money was in his sack! When both they and their father saw the bundles of money they were afraid.
Genesis,42,36,And Jacob their father said to them You have bereaved me! Joseph is not and Simeon is not and you would take Benjamin from me. All these things are against me!
Genesis,42,37,And Reuben said to his father Slay my two sons if I do not bring [Benjamin] back to you. Deliver him into my keeping and I will bring him back to you.
Genesis,42,38,But [Jacob] said My son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he alone is left [of his mother's children]; if harm or accident should befall him on the journey you are to take you would bring my hoary head down to Sheol (the place of the dead) with grief.
Genesis,43,1,BUT THE hunger and destitution and starvation were very severe and extremely distressing in the land [Canaan].
Genesis,43,2,And when [the families of Jacob's sons] had eaten up the grain which the men had brought from Egypt their father said to them Go again; buy us a little food.
Genesis,43,3,But Judah said to him The man solemnly and sternly warned us saying You shall not see my face again unless your brother is with you.
Genesis,43,4,If you will send our brother with us we will go down [to Egypt] and buy you food;
Genesis,43,5,But if you will not send him we will not go down; for the man said to us You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.
Genesis,43,6,And Israel said Why did you do me such a wrong and suffer this evil to come upon me by telling the man that you had another brother?
Genesis,43,7,And they said The man asked us straightforward questions about ourselves and our relatives. He said Is your father still alive? Have you another brother? And we answered him accordingly. How could we know that he would say Bring your brother down here?
Genesis,43,8,And Judah said to Israel his father Send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and you and also our little ones.
Genesis,43,9,I will be security for him; you shall require him of me [personally]; if I do not bring him back to you and put him before you then let me bear the blame forever.
Genesis,43,10,For if we had not lingered like this surely by now we would have returned the second time.
Genesis,43,11,And their father Israel said to them If it must be so now do this; take of the choicest products in the land in your sacks and carry down a present to the man a little balm (balsam) and a little honey aromatic spices and gum (of rock rose) or ladanum pistachio nuts and almonds.
Genesis,43,12,And take double the [grain] money with you; and the money that was put back in the mouth of your sacks carry it again with you; there is a possibility that [its being in your sacks] was an oversight.
Genesis,43,13,Take your brother and arise and return to the man;
Genesis,43,14,May God Almighty give you mercy and favor before the man that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved [of my sons] I am bereaved.
Genesis,43,15,Then the men took the present and they took double the [grain] money with them and Benjamin; and they arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
Genesis,43,16,And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them he said to the steward of his house Bring the men into the house and kill an animal and make ready for the men will dine with me at noon.
Genesis,43,17,And the man did as Joseph ordered and brought the men to Joseph's house.
Genesis,43,18,The men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said We are brought in because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time we came so that he may find occasion to accuse and assail us take us for slaves and seize our donkeys.
Genesis,43,19,So they came near to the steward of Joseph's house and talked with him at the door of the house
Genesis,43,20,And said O sir we came down truly the first time to buy food;
Genesis,43,21,And when we came to the inn we opened our sacks and there was each man's money full weight returned in the mouth of his sack. Now we have brought it back again.
Genesis,43,22,And we have brought down with us other money to buy food; we do not know who put our money in our sacks.
Genesis,43,23,But [the steward] said Peace be to you fear not; your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money. And he brought Simeon out to them.
Genesis,43,24,And the man brought the men into Joseph's house and gave them water and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys provender.
Genesis,43,25,And they made ready the present they had brought for Joseph before his coming at noon for they heard that they were to dine there.
Genesis,43,26,And when Joseph came home they brought into the house to him the present which they had with them and bowed themselves to him to the ground.
Genesis,43,27,He asked them of their welfare and said Is your old father well of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?
Genesis,43,28,And they answered Your servant our father is in good health; he is still alive. And they bowed down their heads and made obeisance.
Genesis,43,29,And he looked up and saw his [full] brother Benjamin his mother's [only other] son and said Is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me? And he said God be gracious to you my son!
Genesis,43,30,And Joseph hurried from the room for his heart yearned for his brother and he sought privacy to weep; so he entered his chamber and wept there.
Genesis,43,31,And he washed his face and went out and restraining himself said Let dinner be served.
Genesis,43,32,And [the servants] set out [the food] for [Joseph] by himself and for [his brothers] by themselves and for those Egyptians who ate with him by themselves according to the Egyptian custom not to eat food with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.
Genesis,43,33,And [Joseph's brothers] were given seats before him--the eldest according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked at one another amazed [that so much was known about them].
Genesis,43,34,[Joseph] took and sent helpings to them from before him but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank freely and were merry with him.
Genesis,44,1,AND HE commanded the steward of his house saying Fill the men's sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.
Genesis,44,2,And put my cup the silver cup in the sack's mouth of the youngest with his grain money. And [the steward] did according to what Joseph had said.
Genesis,44,3,As soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their donkeys.
Genesis,44,4,When they had left the city and were not yet far away Joseph said to his steward Up follow after the men; and when you overtake them say to them Why have you rewarded evil for good? [Why have you stolen the silver cup?]
Genesis,44,5,Is it not my master's drinking cup with which he divines [the future]? You have done wrong in doing this.
Genesis,44,6,And the steward overtook them and he said to them these same words.
Genesis,44,7,They said to him Why does my lord say these things? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!
Genesis,44,8,Note that the money which we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. Is it likely then that we would steal from your master's house silver or gold?
Genesis,44,9,With whomever of your servants [your master's cup] is found not only let that one die but the rest of us will be my lord's slaves.
Genesis,44,10,And the steward said Now let it be as you say: he with whom [the cup] is found shall be my slave but [the rest of] you shall be blameless.
Genesis,44,11,Then quickly every man lowered his sack to the ground and every man opened his sack.
Genesis,44,12,And [the steward] searched beginning with the eldest and stopping with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
Genesis,44,13,Then they rent their clothes; and after each man had loaded his donkey again they returned to the city.
Genesis,44,14,Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house for he was still there; and they fell prostrate before him.
Genesis,44,15,Joseph said to them What is this thing that you have done? Do you not realize that such a man as I can certainly detect and know by divination [everything you do without other knowledge of it]?
Genesis,44,16,And Judah said What shall we say to my lord? What shall we reply? Or how shall we clear ourselves since God has found out and exposed the iniquity of your servants? Behold we are my lord's slaves the rest of us as well as he with whom the cup is found.
Genesis,44,17,But [Joseph] said God forbid that I should do that; but the man in whose hand the cup is found he shall be my servant; and as for [the rest of] you arise and go in peace to your father.
Genesis,44,18,Then Judah came close to [Joseph] and said O my lord let your servant I pray you speak a word to you in private and let not your anger blaze against your servant for you are as Pharaoh [so I will speak as if directly to him].
Genesis,44,19,My lord asked his servants saying Have you a father or a brother?
Genesis,44,20,And we said to my lord We have a father--an old man--and a young [brother the] child of his old age; and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother's [offspring] and his father loves him.
Genesis,44,21,And you said to your servants Bring him down to me that I may set my eyes on him.
Genesis,44,22,And we said to my lord The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should do so his father would die.
Genesis,44,23,And you told your servants Unless your youngest brother comes with you you shall not see my face again.
Genesis,44,24,And when we went back to your servant my father we told him what my lord had said.
Genesis,44,25,And our father said Go again and buy us a little food.
Genesis,44,26,But we said We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us then we will go down; for we may not see the man's face except our youngest brother is with us.
Genesis,44,27,And your servant my father said to us You know that [Rachel] my wife bore me two sons:
Genesis,44,28,And the one went out from me and I said Surely he is torn to pieces and I have never seen him since.
Genesis,44,29,And if you take this son also from me and harm or accident should befall him you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow and evil to Sheol (the place of the dead).
Genesis,44,30,Now therefore when I come to your servant my father and the lad is not with us since his life is bound up in the lad's life and his soul knit with the lad's soul
Genesis,44,31,When he sees that the lad is not with us he will die; and your servants will be responsible for his death and will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.
Genesis,44,32,For your servant became security for the lad to my father saying If I do not bring him to you then I will bear the blame to my father forever.
Genesis,44,33,Now therefore I pray you let your servant remain instead of the youth [to be] a slave to my lord and let the young man go home with his [half] brothers.
Genesis,44,34,For how can I go up to my father if the lad is not with me?--lest I witness the woe and the evil that will come upon my father.
Genesis,45,1,THEN JOSEPH could not restrain himself [any longer] before all those who stood by him and he called out Cause every man to go out from me! So no one stood there with Joseph while he made himself known to his brothers.
Genesis,45,2,And he wept and sobbed aloud and the Egyptians [who had just left him] heard it and the household of Pharaoh heard about it.
Genesis,45,3,And Joseph said to his brothers I am Joseph! Is my father still alive? And his brothers could not reply for they were distressingly disturbed and dismayed at [the startling realization that they were in] his presence.
Genesis,45,4,And Joseph said to his brothers Come near to me I pray you. And they did so. And he said I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt!
Genesis,45,5,But now do not be distressed and disheartened or vexed and angry with yourselves because you sold me here for God sent me ahead of you to preserve life.
Genesis,45,6,For these two years the famine has been in the land and there are still five years more in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.
Genesis,45,7,God sent me before you to preserve for you a posterity and to continue a remnant on the earth to save your lives by a great escape and save for you many survivors.
Genesis,45,8,So now it was not you who sent me here but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis,45,9,Hurry and go up to my father and tell him Your son Joseph says this to you: God has put me in charge of all Egypt. Come down to me; do not delay.
Genesis,45,10,You will live in the land of Goshen and you will be close to me--you and your children and your grandchildren your flocks your herds and all you have.
Genesis,45,11,And there I will sustain and provide for you so that you and your household and all that are yours may not come to poverty and want for there are yet five [more] years of [the scarcity hunger and starvation of ] famine.
Genesis,45,12,Now notice! Your own eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin can see that I am talking to you personally [in your language and not through an interpreter].
Genesis,45,13,And you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt and of all that you have seen; and you shall hurry and bring my father down here.
Genesis,45,14,And he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck and wept and Benjamin wept on his neck.
Genesis,45,15,Moreover he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; and after that his brothers conversed with him.
Genesis,45,16,When the report was heard in Pharaoh's house that Joseph's brothers had come it pleased Pharaoh and his servants well.
Genesis,45,17,And Pharaoh said to Joseph Tell your brothers this: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan
Genesis,45,18,And get your father and your households and come to me. And I will give you the best in the land of Egypt and you will live on the fat of the land.
Genesis,45,19,You therefore command them saying You do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come.
Genesis,45,20,Also do not look with regret or concern upon your goods for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.
Genesis,45,21,And the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons as the order of Pharaoh permitted and gave them provisions for the journey.
Genesis,45,22,To each of them he gave changes of raiment but to Benjamin he gave 300 pieces of silver and five changes of raiment.
Genesis,45,23,And to his father he sent as follows: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt and ten she-donkeys laden with grain bread and nourishing food and provision for his father [to supply all who were with him] on the way.
Genesis,45,24,So he sent his brothers away and they departed and he said to them See that you do not disagree (get excited quarrel) along the road.
Genesis,45,25,So they went up out of Egypt and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father
Genesis,45,26,And they said to him Joseph is still alive! And he is governor over all the land of Egypt! And Jacob's heart began to stop beating and [he almost] fainted for he did not believe them.
Genesis,45,27,But when they told him all the words of Joseph which he had said to them and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of Jacob their father revived [and warmth and life returned].
Genesis,45,28,And Israel said It is enough! Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.
Genesis,46,1,SO ISRAEL made his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba [a place hallowed by sacred memories] and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
Genesis,46,2,And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said Jacob! Jacob! And he said Here am I.
Genesis,46,3,And He said I am God the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt for I will there make of you a great nation.
Genesis,46,4,I will go down with you to Egypt and I will also surely bring you [your people Israel] up again; and Joseph will put his hand upon your eyes [when they are about to close in death].
Genesis,46,5,So Jacob arose and set out from Beersheba and Israel's sons conveyed their father their little ones and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
Genesis,46,6,And they took their cattle and the gains which they had acquired in the land of Canaan and came into Egypt Jacob and all his offspring with him:
Genesis,46,7,His sons and his sons' sons with him his daughters and his sons' daughters--all his offspring he brought with him into Egypt.
Genesis,46,8,And these are the names of the descendants of Israel who came into Egypt Jacob and his sons: Reuben Jacob's firstborn.
Genesis,46,9,And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch Pallu Hezron and Carmi.
Genesis,46,10,The sons of Simeon: Jemuel Jamin Ohad Jachin Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.
Genesis,46,11,The sons of Levi: Gershon Kohath and Merari.
Genesis,46,12,The sons of Judah: Er Onan Shelah Perez and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
Genesis,46,13,The sons of Issachar: Tola Puvah Iob and Shimron.
Genesis,46,14,The sons of Zebulun: Sered Elon and Jahleel.
Genesis,46,15,These are the sons of Leah whom she bore to Jacob in Padan-aram together with his daughter Dinah. All of his sons and his daughters numbered thirty-three.
Genesis,46,16,The sons of Gad: Ziphion Haggi Shuni Ezbon Eri Arodi and Areli.
Genesis,46,17,The sons of Asher: Imnah Ishvah Ishvi Beriah and Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
Genesis,46,18,These are the sons of Zilpah [the maid] whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter. And these she bore to Jacob--sixteen persons all told.
Genesis,46,19,The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis,46,20,And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim whom Asenath daughter of Potiphera priest of On bore to him.
Genesis,46,21,And the sons of Benjamin: Bela Becher Ashbel Gera Naaman Ehi Rosh Muppim Huppim and Ard.
Genesis,46,22,These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob--fourteen persons in all.
Genesis,46,23,The son of Dan: Hushim.
Genesis,46,24,The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel Guni Jezer and Shillem.
Genesis,46,25,These are the sons of Bilhah [the maid] whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter. And she bore these to Jacob--seven persons in all.
Genesis,46,26,All the persons who came with Jacob into Egypt--who were his own offspring not counting the wives of Jacob's sons--were sixty-six persons all told.
Genesis,46,27,And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt were two persons. All the persons of the house of Jacob [including Joseph and Jacob himself] who came into Egypt were seventy.
Genesis,46,28,And he sent Judah before him to Joseph to direct him to Goshen and meet him there; and they came into the land of Goshen.
Genesis,46,29,Then Joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen; and he presented himself and gave distinct evidence of himself to him [that he was Joseph] and [each] fell on the [other's] neck and wept on his neck a good while.
Genesis,46,30,And Israel said to Joseph Now let me die since I have seen your face [and know] that you are still alive.
Genesis,46,31,Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household I will go up and tell Pharaoh and say to him My brothers and my father's household who were in the land of Canaan have come to me.
Genesis,46,32,And the men are shepherds for their occupation has been keeping livestock and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.
Genesis,46,33,When Pharaoh calls you and says What is your occupation?
Genesis,46,34,You shall say Your servants' occupation has been as keepers of livestock from our youth until now both we and our fathers before us--in order that you may live in the land of Goshen for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.
Genesis,47,1,THEN JOSEPH came and told Pharaoh My father and my brothers with their flocks and their herds and all that they own have come from the land of Canaan and they are in the land of Goshen.
Genesis,47,2,And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them to Pharaoh.
Genesis,47,3,And Pharaoh said to his brothers What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh Your servants are shepherds both we and our fathers before us.
Genesis,47,4,Moreover they said to Pharaoh We have come to sojourn in the land for your servants have no pasture for our flocks for the famine is very severe in Canaan. So now we pray you let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
Genesis,47,5,And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph saying Your father and your brothers have come to you.
Genesis,47,6,The land of Egypt is before you; make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land. Let them live in the land of Goshen. And if you know of any men of ability among them put them in charge of my cattle.
Genesis,47,7,Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father and presented him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
Genesis,47,8,And Pharaoh asked Jacob How old are you?
Genesis,47,9,Jacob said to Pharaoh The days of the years of my pilgrimage are 130 years; few and evil have the days of the years of my life been and they have not attained to those of the life of my fathers in their pilgrimage.
Genesis,47,10,And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from his presence.
Genesis,47,11,Joseph settled his father and brethren and gave them a possession in Egypt in the best of the land in the land of Rameses (Goshen) as Pharaoh commanded.
Genesis,47,12,And Joseph supplied his father and his brethren and all his father's household with food according to [the needs of] their families.
Genesis,47,13,[In the course of time] there was no food in all the land for the famine was distressingly severe so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan hung in doubt and wavered by reason of the hunger (destitution starvation) of the famine.
Genesis,47,14,And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan [in payment] for the grain which they bought and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
Genesis,47,15,And when the money was exhausted in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said Give us food! Why should we die before your very eyes? For we have no money left.
Genesis,47,16,Joseph said Give up your livestock and I will give you food in exchange for [them] if your money is gone.
Genesis,47,17,So they brought their livestock to Joseph and [he] gave them food in exchange for the horses flocks cattle of the herds and the donkeys; and he supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.
Genesis,47,18,When that year was ended they came to [Joseph] the second year and said to him We will not hide from my lord [the fact] that our money is spent; my lord also has our herds of livestock; there is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands.
Genesis,47,19,Why should we perish before your eyes both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed [to plant] that we may live and not die and that the land may not be desolate.
Genesis,47,20,And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field because of the overwhelming severity of the famine upon them. The land became Pharaoh's
Genesis,47,21,And as for the people he removed them to cities and practically made slaves of them [at their own request] from one end of the borders of Egypt to the other.
Genesis,47,22,Only the priests' land he did not buy for the priests had a fixed pension from Pharaoh and lived on the amount Pharaoh gave them. So they did not sell their land.
Genesis,47,23,Then Joseph said to the people Behold I have today bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Now here is seed for you and you shall sow the land.
Genesis,47,24,At [harvest time when you reap] the increase you shall give one-fifth of it to Pharaoh and four-fifths shall be your own to use for seed for the field and as food for you and those of your households and for your little ones.
Genesis,47,25,And they said You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord; and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
Genesis,47,26,And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt--to this day--that Pharaoh should have the fifth part [of the crops]; it was the priests' land only which did not become Pharaoh's.
Genesis,47,27,And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt in the country of Goshen; and they gained possessions there and grew and multiplied exceedingly.
Genesis,47,28,And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so Jacob reached the age of 147 years.
Genesis,47,29,When the time drew near that Israel must die he called his son Joseph and said to him If now I have found favor in your sight put your hand under my thigh and [promise to] deal loyally and faithfully with me. Do not bury me I beg of you in Egypt
Genesis,47,30,But let me lie with my fathers; you shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place. And [Joseph] said I will do as you have directed.
Genesis,47,31,Then Jacob said Swear to me [that you will do it]. And he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the head of the bed.
Genesis,48,1,SOME TIME after these things occurred someone told Joseph Behold your father is sick. And he took with him his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim [and went to Goshen].
Genesis,48,2,When Jacob was told Your son Joseph has come to you Israel collected his strength and sat up on the bed.
Genesis,48,3,And Jacob said to Joseph God Almighty appeared to me at Luz [Bethel] in the land of Canaan and blessed me
Genesis,48,4,And said to me Behold I will make you fruitful and multiply you and I will make you a multitude of people and will give this land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession.
Genesis,48,5,And now your two sons [Ephraim and Manasseh] who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt are mine. [I am adopting them and now] as Reuben and Simeon [they] shall be mine.
Genesis,48,6,But other sons who may be born after them shall be your own; and they shall be called after the names of these [two] brothers and reckoned as belonging to them [when they come] into their inheritance.
Genesis,48,7,And as for me when I came from Padan Rachel died at my side in the land of Canaan on the way when yet there was but a little way to come to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath that is Bethlehem.
Genesis,48,8,When Israel [almost blind] saw Joseph's sons he said Who are these?
Genesis,48,9,And Joseph said to his father They are my sons whom God has given me in this place. And he said Bring them to me I pray you that I may bless them.
Genesis,48,10,Now Israel's eyes were dim from age so that he could not see. And Joseph brought them near to him and he kissed and embraced them.
Genesis,48,11,Israel said to Joseph I had not thought that I would see your face but see God has shown me your offspring also.
Genesis,48,12,Then Joseph took [the boys] from [his father's embrace] and he bowed [before him] with his face to the earth.
Genesis,48,13,Then Joseph took both [boys] Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel's left and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel's right and brought them close to him.
Genesis,48,14,And Israel reached out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim who was the younger and his left hand on Manasseh's head crossing his hands intentionally for Manasseh was the firstborn.
Genesis,48,15,Then [Jacob] blessed Joseph and said God [Himself ] before Whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac lived and walked habitually God [Himself ] Who has [been my Shepherd and has led and] fed me from the time I came into being until this day
Genesis,48,16,The redeeming Angel [that is the Angel the Redeemer--not a created being but the Lord Himself] Who has redeemed me continually from every evil bless the lads! And let my name be perpetuated in them [may they be worthy of having their names coupled with mine] and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them become a multitude in the midst of the earth.
Genesis,48,17,When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on Ephraim's head it displeased him; and he held up his father's hand to move it to Manasseh's head.
Genesis,48,18,And Joseph said Not so my father for this is the firstborn; put your right hand upon his head.
Genesis,48,19,But his father refused and said I know my son I know. He also shall become a people and shall be great; but his younger brother shall be greater than he and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations.
Genesis,48,20,And he blessed them that day saying By you shall Israel bless [one another] saying May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh. And he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
Genesis,48,21,And Israel said to Joseph Behold I [am about to] die but God will be with you and bring you again to the land of your fathers.
Genesis,48,22,Moreover I have given to you [Joseph] one portion [Shechem one mountain slope] more than any of your brethren which I took [reclaiming it] out of the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow.
Genesis,49,1,AND JACOB called for his sons and said Gather yourselves together [around me] that I may tell you what shall befall you in the latter or last days.
Genesis,49,2,Gather yourselves together and hear you sons of Jacob; and hearken to Israel your father.
Genesis,49,3,Reuben you are my firstborn my might the beginning (the firstfruits) of my manly strength and vigor; [your birthright gave you] the preeminence in dignity and the preeminence in power.
Genesis,49,4,But unstable and boiling over like water you shall not excel and have the preeminence [of the firstborn] because you went to your father's bed; you defiled it--he went to my couch!
Genesis,49,5,Simeon and Levi are brothers [equally headstrong deceitful vindictive and cruel]; their swords are weapons of violence.
Genesis,49,6,O my soul come not into their secret council; unto their assembly let not my honor be united [for I knew nothing of their plot] because in their anger they slew men [an honored man Shechem and the Shechemites] and in their self-will they disabled oxen.
Genesis,49,7,Cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel. I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.
Genesis,49,8,Judah you are the one whom your brothers shall praise; your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; your father's sons shall bow down to you.
Genesis,49,9,Judah a lion's cub! With the prey my son you have gone high up [the mountain]. He stooped down he crouched like a lion and like a lioness--who dares provoke and rouse him?
Genesis,49,10,The scepter or leadership shall not depart from Judah nor the ruler's staff from between his feet until Shiloh [the Messiah the Peaceful One] comes to Whom it belongs and to Him shall be the obedience of the people.
Genesis,49,11,Binding His foal to the vine and His donkey's colt to the choice vine He washes His garments in wine and His clothes in the blood of grapes.

Genesis,49,14,Issachar is a strong-boned donkey crouching down between the sheepfolds.
Genesis,49,15,And he saw that rest was good and that the land was pleasant; and he bowed his shoulder to bear [his burdens] and became a servant to tribute [subjected to forced labor].
Genesis,49,16,Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.
Genesis,49,17,Dan shall be a serpent by the way a horned snake in the path that bites at the horse's heels so that his rider falls backward.
Genesis,49,18,I wait for Your salvation O Lord.
Genesis,49,19,Gad--a raiding troop shall raid him but he shall raid at their heels and assault them [victoriously].
Genesis,49,20,Asher's food [supply] shall be rich and fat and he shall yield and deliver royal delights.
Genesis,49,21,Naphtali is a hind let loose which yields lovely fawns.
Genesis,49,22,Joseph is a fruitful bough a fruitful bough by a well (spring or fountain) whose branches run over the wall.
Genesis,49,23,Skilled archers have bitterly attacked and sorely worried him; they have shot at him and persecuted him.
Genesis,49,24,But his bow remained strong and steady and rested in the Strength that does not fail him for the arms of his hands were made strong and active by the hands of the Mighty God of Jacob by the name of the Shepherd the Rock of Israel
Genesis,49,25,By the God of your father Who will help you and by the Almighty Who will bless you with blessings of the heavens above blessings lying in the deep beneath blessings of the breasts and of the womb.
Genesis,49,26,The blessings of your father [on you] are greater than the blessings of my forefathers [Abraham and Isaac on me] and are as lasting as the bounties of the eternal hills; they shall be on the head of Joseph and on the crown of the head of him who was the consecrated one and the one separated from his brethren and [the one who] is prince among them.
Genesis,49,27,Benjamin is a ravenous wolf in the morning devouring the prey and at night dividing the spoil.
Genesis,49,28,All these are the twelve tribes of Israel and this is what their father said to them as he blessed them blessing each one according to the blessing suited to him.
Genesis,49,29,He charged them and said to them I am to be gathered to my [departed] people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite
Genesis,49,30,In the cave in the field at Machpelah east of Mamre in the land of Canaan that Abraham bought along with the field of Ephron the Hittite to possess as a cemetery.
Genesis,49,31,There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife and there I buried Leah.
Genesis,49,32,The purchase of the field and the cave that is in it was from the sons of Heth.
Genesis,49,33,When Jacob had finished commanding his sons he drew his feet up into the bed and breathed his last and was gathered to his [departed] people.
Genesis,50,1,THEN JOSEPH fell upon his father's face and wept over him and kissed him.
Genesis,50,2,And Joseph ordered his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.
Genesis,50,3,Then forty days were devoted [to this purpose] for him for that is the customary number of days required for those who are embalmed. And the Egyptians wept and bemoaned him [as they would for royalty] for seventy days.
Genesis,50,4,And when the days of his weeping and deep grief were past Joseph said to [the nobles of] the house of Pharaoh If now I have found grace in your eyes speak I pray you to Pharaoh [for Joseph was dressed in mourning and could not do so himself] saying
Genesis,50,5,My father made me swear saying I am about to die; in my tomb which I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan there you shall bury me. So now let me go up I pray you and bury my father and I will come again.
Genesis,50,6,And Pharaoh said Go up and bury your father as he made you swear.
Genesis,50,7,And Joseph went up [to Canaan] to bury his father; and with him went all the officials of Pharaoh--the nobles of his court and the elders of his house and all the nobles and elders of the land of Egypt--
Genesis,50,8,And all the household of Joseph and his brethren and his father's household. Only their little ones and their flocks and herds they left in the land of Goshen.
Genesis,50,9,And there went with [Joseph] both chariots and horsemen; and it was a very great company.
Genesis,50,10,And they came to the threshing floor of Atad which is beyond [west of] the Jordan and there they mourned with a great lamentation and extreme demonstrations of sorrow [according to Egyptian custom]; and [Joseph] made a mourning for his father seven days.
Genesis,50,11,When the inhabitants of the land the Canaanites saw the mourning at the floor of Atad they said This is a grievous mourning for the Egyptians. Therefore the place was called Abel-mizraim [mourning of Egypt]; it is west of the Jordan.
Genesis,50,12,Thus [Jacob's] sons did for him as he had commanded them.
Genesis,50,13,For his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah east of Mamre which Abraham bought along with the field for a possession as a burying place from Ephron the Hittite.
Genesis,50,14,After he had buried his father Joseph returned to Egypt he and his brethren and all who had gone up with him.
Genesis,50,15,When Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead they said Perhaps now Joseph will hate us and will pay us back for all the evil we did to him.
Genesis,50,16,And they sent a messenger to Joseph saying Your father commanded before he died saying
Genesis,50,17,So shall you say to Joseph: Forgive (take up and away all resentment and all claim to requital concerning) I pray you now the trespass of your brothers and their sin for they did evil to you. Now we pray you forgive the trespass of the servants of your father's God. And Joseph wept when they spoke thus to him.
Genesis,50,18,Then his brothers went and fell down before him saying See we are your servants (your slaves)!
Genesis,50,19,And Joseph said to them Fear not; for am I in the place of God? [Vengeance is His not mine.]
Genesis,50,20,As for you you thought evil against me but God meant it for good to bring about that many people should be kept alive as they are this day.
Genesis,50,21,Now therefore do not be afraid. I will provide for and support you and your little ones. And he comforted them [imparting cheer hope strength] and spoke to their hearts [kindly].
Genesis,50,22,Joseph dwelt in Egypt he and his father's household. And Joseph lived 110 years.
Genesis,50,23,And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation; the children also of Machir son of Manasseh were brought up on Joseph's knees.
Genesis,50,24,And Joseph said to his brethren I am going to die. But God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land to the land He swore to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob [to give you].
Genesis,50,25,And Joseph took an oath from the sons of Israel saying God will surely visit you and you will carry up my bones from here.
Genesis,50,26,So Joseph died being 110 years old; and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
Exodus,1,1,THESE ARE the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt with Jacob each with his household:
Exodus,1,2,Reuben Simeon Levi and Judah
Exodus,1,3,Issachar Zebulun and Benjamin
Exodus,1,4,Dan and Naphtali Gad and Asher.
Exodus,1,5,All the offspring of Jacob were seventy persons; Joseph was already in Egypt.
Exodus,1,6,Then Joseph died and all his brothers and all that generation.
Exodus,1,7,But the descendants of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong and the land was full of them.
Exodus,1,8,Now a new king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph.
Exodus,1,9,He said to his people Behold the Israelites are too many and too mighty for us [and they outnumber us both in people and in strength].
Exodus,1,10,Come let us deal shrewdly with them lest they multiply more and should war befall us they join our enemies fight against us and escape out of the land.
Exodus,1,11,So they set over [the Israelites] taskmasters to afflict and oppress them with [increased] burdens. And [the Israelites] built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.
Exodus,1,12,But the more [the Egyptians] oppressed them the more they multiplied and expanded so that [the Egyptians] were vexed and alarmed because of the Israelites.
Exodus,1,13,And the Egyptians reduced the Israelites to severe slavery.
Exodus,1,14,They made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar brick and all kinds of work in the field. All their service was with harshness and severity.
Exodus,1,15,Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives of whom one was named Shiprah and the other Puah
Exodus,1,16,When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool if it is a son you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter she shall live.
Exodus,1,17,But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded but let the male babies live.
Exodus,1,18,So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them Why have you done this thing and allowed the male children to live?
Exodus,1,19,The midwives answered Pharaoh Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; they are vigorous and quickly delivered; their babies are born before the midwife comes to them.
Exodus,1,20,So God dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and became very strong.
Exodus,1,21,And because the midwives revered and feared God He made them households [of their own].
Exodus,1,22,Then Pharaoh charged all his people saying Every son born [to the Hebrews] you shall cast into the river [Nile] but every daughter you shall allow to live.
Exodus,2,1,NOW [Amram] a man of the house of Levi [the priestly tribe] went and took as his wife [Jochebed] a daughter of Levi.
Exodus,2,2,And the woman became pregnant and bore a son; and when she saw that he was [exceedingly] beautiful she hid him three months.
Exodus,2,3,And when she could no longer hide him she took for him an ark or basket made of bulrushes or papyrus [making it watertight by] daubing it with bitumen and pitch. Then she put the child in it and laid it among the rushes by the brink of the river [Nile].
Exodus,2,4,And his sister [Miriam] stood some distance away to learn what would be done to him.
Exodus,2,5,Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river and her maidens walked along the bank; she saw the ark among the rushes and sent her maid to fetch it.
Exodus,2,6,When she opened it she saw the child; and behold the baby cried. And she took pity on him and said This is one of the Hebrews' children!
Exodus,2,7,Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter Shall I go and call a nurse of the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?
Exodus,2,8,Pharaoh's daughter said to her Go. And the girl went and called the child's mother.
Exodus,2,9,Then Pharaoh's daughter said to her Take this child away and nurse it for me and I will give you your wages. So the woman took the child and nursed it.
Exodus,2,10,And the child grew and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. And she called him Moses for she said Because I drew him out of the water.
Exodus,2,11,One day after Moses was grown it happened that he went out to his brethren and looked at their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew one of [Moses'] brethren.
Exodus,2,12,He looked this way and that way and when he saw no one he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
Exodus,2,13,He went out the second day and saw two Hebrew men quarreling and fighting; and he said to the unjust aggressor Why are you striking your comrade?
Exodus,2,14,And the man said Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian? Then Moses was afraid and thought Surely this thing is known.
Exodus,2,15,When Pharaoh heard of it he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh's presence and took refuge in the land of Midian where he sat down by a well.
Exodus,2,16,Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
Exodus,2,17,The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock.
Exodus,2,18,And when they came to Reuel [Jethro] their father he said How is it that you have come so soon today?
Exodus,2,19,They said An Egyptian delivered us from the shepherds; also he drew water for us and watered the flock.
Exodus,2,20,He said to his daughters Where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him that he may eat bread.
Exodus,2,21,And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
Exodus,2,22,And she bore a son and he called his name Gershom [expulsion or a stranger there]; for he said I have been a stranger and a sojourner in a foreign land.
Exodus,2,23,However after a long time [nearly forty years] the king of Egypt died; and the Israelites were sighing and groaning because of the bondage. They kept crying and their cry because of slavery ascended to God.
Exodus,2,24,And God heard their sighing and groaning and [earnestly] remembered His covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob.
Exodus,2,25,God saw the Israelites and took knowledge of them and concerned Himself about them [knowing all understanding remembering all].
Exodus,3,1,NOW MOSES kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the back or west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb or Sinai the mountain of God.
Exodus,3,2,The Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire yet was not consumed.
Exodus,3,3,And Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burned.
Exodus,3,4,And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called to him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses! And he said Here am I.
Exodus,3,5,God said Do not come near; put your shoes off your feet for the place on which you stand is holy ground.
Exodus,3,6,Also He said I am the God of your father the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look at God.
Exodus,3,7,And the Lord said I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters and oppressors; for I know their sorrows and sufferings and trials.
Exodus,3,8,And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand and power of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a land good and large a land flowing with milk and honey [a land of plenty]--to the place of the Canaanite the Hittite the Amorite the Perizzite the Hivite and the Jebusite.
Exodus,3,9,Now behold the cry of the Israelites has come to Me and I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them.
Exodus,3,10,Come now therefore and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring forth My people the Israelites out of Egypt.
Exodus,3,11,And Moses said to God Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?
Exodus,3,12,God said I will surely be with you; and this shall be the sign to you that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt you shall serve God on this mountain [Horeb or Sinai].
Exodus,3,13,And Moses said to God Behold when I come to the Israelites and say to them The God of your fathers has sent me to you and they say to me What is His name? What shall I say to them?
Exodus,3,14,And God said to Moses I AM WHO I AM and WHAT I AM and I WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE; and He said You shall say this to the Israelites: I AM has sent me to you!
Exodus,3,15,God said also to Moses This shall you say to the Israelites: The Lord the God of your fathers of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob has sent me to you! This is My name forever and by this name I am to be remembered to all generations.
Exodus,3,16,Go gather the elders of Israel together [the mature teachers and tribal leaders] and say to them The Lord God of your fathers the God of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob appeared to me saying I have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in Egypt;
Exodus,3,17,And I have declared that I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite the Hittite the Amorite the Perizzite the Hivite and the Jebusite to a land flowing with milk and honey.
Exodus,3,18,And [the elders] shall believe and obey your voice; and you shall go you and the elders of Israel to the king of Egypt and you shall say to him The Lord the God of the Hebrews has met with us; and now let us go we beseech you three days' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.
Exodus,3,19,And I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go [unless forced to do so] no not by a mighty hand.
Exodus,3,20,So I will stretch out My hand and smite Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in it; and after that he will let you go.
Exodus,3,21,And I will give this people favor and respect in the sight of the Egyptians; and it shall be that when you go you shall not go empty-handed.
Exodus,3,22,But every woman shall [insistently] solicit of her neighbor and of her that may be residing at her house jewels and articles of silver and gold and garments which you shall put on your sons and daughters; and you shall strip the Egyptians [of belongings due to you].
Exodus,4,1,AND MOSES answered But behold they will not believe me or listen to and obey my voice; for they will say The Lord has not appeared to you.
Exodus,4,2,And the Lord said to him What is that in your hand? And he said A rod.
Exodus,4,3,And He said Cast it on the ground. And he did so and it became a serpent [the symbol of royal and divine power worn on the crown of the Pharaohs]; and Moses fled from before it.
Exodus,4,4,And the Lord said to Moses Put forth your hand and take it by the tail. And he stretched out his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand
Exodus,4,5,[This you shall do said the Lord] that the elders may believe that the Lord the God of their fathers of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob has indeed appeared to you.
Exodus,4,6,The Lord said also to him Put your hand into your bosom. He put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as white as snow.
Exodus,4,7,[God] said Put your hand into your bosom again. So he put his hand back into his bosom and when he took it out behold it was restored as the rest of his flesh.
Exodus,4,8,[Then God said] If they will not believe you or heed the voice or the testimony of the first sign they may believe the voice or the witness of the second sign.
Exodus,4,9,But if they will also not believe these two signs or heed your voice you shall take some water of the river [Nile] and pour it upon the dry land; and the water which you take out of the river [Nile] shall become blood on the dry land.
Exodus,4,10,And Moses said to the Lord O Lord I am not eloquent or a man of words neither before nor since You have spoken to Your servant; for I am slow of speech and have a heavy and awkward tongue.
Exodus,4,11,And the Lord said to him Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes the dumb or the deaf or the seeing or the blind? Is it not I the Lord?
Exodus,4,12,Now therefore go and I will be with your mouth and will teach you what you shall say.
Exodus,4,13,And he said Oh my Lord I pray You send by the hand of [some other] whom You will [send].
Exodus,4,14,Then the anger of the Lord blazed against Moses; He said Is there not Aaron your brother the Levite? I know he can speak well. Also he is coming out to meet you and when he sees you he will be overjoyed.
Exodus,4,15,You must speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what you shall do.
Exodus,4,16,He shall speak for you to the people acting as a mouthpiece for you and you shall be as God to him.
Exodus,4,17,And you shall take this rod in your hand with which you shall work the signs [that prove I sent you].
Exodus,4,18,And Moses went away and returning to Jethro his father-in-law said to him Let me go back I pray you to my relatives in Egypt to see whether they are still alive. And Jethro said to Moses Go in peace.
Exodus,4,19,The Lord said to Moses in Midian Go back to Egypt; for all the men who were seeking your life [for killing the Egyptian] are dead.
Exodus,4,20,And Moses took his wife and his sons and set them on donkeys and he returned to the land of Egypt; and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
Exodus,4,21,And the Lord said to Moses When you return into Egypt see that you do before Pharaoh all those miracles and wonders which I have put in your hand; but I will make him stubborn and harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.
Exodus,4,22,And you shall say to Pharaoh Thus says the Lord Israel is My son even My firstborn.
Exodus,4,23,And I say to you Let My son go that he may serve Me; and if you refuse to let him go behold I will slay your son your firstborn.
Exodus,4,24,Along the way at a [resting-] place the Lord met [Moses] and sought to kill him [made him acutely and almost fatally ill].
Exodus,4,25,[Now apparently he had failed to circumcise one of his sons his wife being opposed to it; but seeing his life in such danger] Zipporah took a flint knife and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it to touch [Moses'] feet and said Surely a husband of blood you are to me!
Exodus,4,26,When He let [Moses] alone [to recover] Zipporah said A husband of blood are you because of the circumcision.
Exodus,4,27,The Lord said to Aaron Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went and met him in the mountain of God [Horeb or Sinai] and kissed him.
Exodus,4,28,Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord with which He had sent him and all the signs with which He had charged him.
Exodus,4,29,Moses and Aaron went and gathered together [in Egypt] all the elders of the Israelites.
Exodus,4,30,Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people.
Exodus,4,31,And the people believed; and when they heard that the Lord had visited the Israelites and that He had looked [in compassion] upon their affliction they bowed their heads and worshiped.
Exodus,5,1,AFTERWARD MOSES and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh Thus says the Lord the God of Israel Let My people go that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.
Exodus,5,2,But Pharaoh said Who is the Lord that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I know not the Lord neither will I let Israel go.
Exodus,5,3,And they said The God of the Hebrews has met with us; let us go we pray you three days' journey into the desert and sacrifice to the Lord our God lest He fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.
Exodus,5,4,The king of Egypt said to Moses and Aaron Why do you take the people from their jobs? Get to your burdens!
Exodus,5,5,Pharaoh said Behold the people of the land now are many and you make them rest from their burdens!
Exodus,5,6,The very same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers
Exodus,5,7,You shall no more give the people straw to make brick; let them go and gather straw for themselves.
Exodus,5,8,But the number of the bricks which they made before you shall still require of them; you shall not diminish it in the least. For they are idle; that is why they cry Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
Exodus,5,9,Let heavier work be laid upon the men that they may labor at it and pay no attention to lying words.
Exodus,5,10,The taskmasters of the people went out and their officers and they said to the people Thus says Pharaoh I will not give you straw.
Exodus,5,11,Go get straw where you can find it; but your work shall not be diminished in the least.
Exodus,5,12,So the people were scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather the short stubble instead of straw.
Exodus,5,13,And the taskmasters were urgent saying Finish your work your daily quotas as when there was straw.
Exodus,5,14,And the Hebrew foremen whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them were beaten and were asked Why have you not fulfilled all your quota of making bricks yesterday and today as before?
Exodus,5,15,Then the Hebrew foremen came to Pharaoh and cried Why do you deal like this with your servants?
Exodus,5,16,No straw is given to your servants yet they say to us Make bricks! And behold your servants are beaten but the fault is in your own people.
Exodus,5,17,But [Pharaoh] said You are idle lazy and idle! That is why you say Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.
Exodus,5,18,Get out now and get to work; for no straw shall be given you yet you shall deliver the full quota of bricks.
Exodus,5,19,And the Hebrew foremen saw that they were in an evil situation when it was said You shall not diminish in the least your full daily quota of bricks.
Exodus,5,20,And the foremen met Moses and Aaron who were standing in the way as they came forth from Pharaoh.
Exodus,5,21,And the foremen said to them The Lord look upon you and judge because you have made us a rotten stench to be detested by Pharaoh and his servants and have put a sword in their hand to slay us.
Exodus,5,22,Then Moses turned again to the Lord and said O Lord why have You dealt evil to this people? Why did You ever send me?
Exodus,5,23,For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name he has done evil to this people neither have You delivered Your people at all.
Exodus,6,1,THEN THE Lord said to Moses Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for [compelled] by a strong hand he will [not only] let them go but he will drive them out of his land with a strong hand.
Exodus,6,2,And God said to Moses I am the Lord.
Exodus,6,3,I appeared to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty [El-Shaddai] but by My name the Lord [Yahweh--the redemptive name of God] I did not make Myself known to them [in acts and great miracles].
Exodus,6,4,I have also established My covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan the land of their temporary residence in which they were strangers.
Exodus,6,5,I have also heard the groaning of the Israelites whom the Egyptians have enslaved; and I have [earnestly] remembered My covenant [with Abraham Isaac and Jacob].
Exodus,6,6,Accordingly say to the Israelites I am the Lord and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and I will free you from their bondage and I will rescue you with an outstretched arm [with special and vigorous action] and by mighty acts of judgment.
Exodus,6,7,And I will take you to Me for a people and I will be to you a God; and you shall know that it is I the Lord your God Who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
Exodus,6,8,And I will bring you into the land concerning which I lifted up My hand and swore that I would give it to Abraham Isaac and Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage. I am the Lord [you have the pledge of My changeless omnipotence and faithfulness].
Exodus,6,9,Moses told this to the Israelites but they refused to listen to Moses because of their impatience and anguish of spirit and because of their cruel bondage.
Exodus,6,10,The Lord said to Moses
Exodus,6,11,Go in tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his land.
Exodus,6,12,But Moses said to the Lord Behold [my own people] the Israelites have not listened to me; how then shall Pharaoh give heed to me who am of deficient and impeded speech?
Exodus,6,13,But the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a command for the Israelites and for Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus,6,14,These are the heads of their clans. The sons of Reuben Israel's firstborn: Hanoch Pallu Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.
Exodus,6,15,The sons of Simeon: Jemuel Jamin Ohad Jachin Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon.
Exodus,6,16,These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their births: Gershon Kohath and Merari; and Levi lived 137 years.
Exodus,6,17,The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimi by their families.
Exodus,6,18,The sons of Kohath: Amram Izhar Hebron and Uzziel; and Kohath lived 133 years.
Exodus,6,19,The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of Levi according to their generations.
Exodus,6,20,Amram took Jochebed his father's sister as wife and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and Amram lived 137 years.
Exodus,6,21,The sons of Izhar: Korah Nepheg and Zichri.
Exodus,6,22,The sons of Uzziel: Mishael Elzaphan and Sithri.
Exodus,6,23,Aaron took Elisheba daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon as wife; she bore him Nadab Abihu Eleazar and Ithamar.
Exodus,6,24,The sons of Korah: Assir Elkanah and Abiasaph. These are the families of the Korahites.
Exodus,6,25,Eleazar Aaron's son took one of the daughters of Putiel as wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites by their families.
Exodus,6,26,These are the [same] Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said Bring out the Israelites from the land of Egypt by their hosts
Exodus,6,27,And who spoke to [the] Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt; these are that Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,6,28,On the day when the Lord spoke to Moses in Egypt
Exodus,6,29,The Lord said to Moses I am the Lord; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you.
Exodus,6,30,But Moses said to the Lord Behold I am of deficient and impeded speech; how then shall Pharaoh listen to me?
Exodus,7,1,THE LORD said to Moses Behold I make you as God to Pharaoh [to declare My will and purpose to him]; and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.
Exodus,7,2,You shall speak all that I command you and Aaron your brother shall tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his land.
Exodus,7,3,And I will make Pharaoh's heart stubborn and hard and multiply My signs My wonders and miracles in the land of Egypt.
Exodus,7,4,But Pharaoh will not listen to you and I will lay My hand upon Egypt and bring forth My hosts My people the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment.
Exodus,7,5,The Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I stretch forth My hand upon Egypt and bring out the Israelites from among them.
Exodus,7,6,And Moses and Aaron did so as the Lord commanded them.
Exodus,7,7,Now Moses was 80 years old and Aaron 83 years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.
Exodus,7,8,And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Exodus,7,9,When Pharaoh says to you Prove [your authority] by a miracle then tell Aaron Throw your rod down before Pharaoh that it may become a serpent.
Exodus,7,10,So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did as the Lord had commanded; Aaron threw down his rod before Pharaoh and his servants and it became a serpent.
Exodus,7,11,Then Pharaoh called for the wise men [skilled in magic and divination] and the sorcerers (wizards and jugglers). And they also these magicians of Egypt did similar things with their enchantments and secret arts.
Exodus,7,12,For they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents; but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
Exodus,7,13,But Pharaoh's heart was hardened and stubborn and he would not listen to them just as the Lord had said.
Exodus,7,14,Then the Lord said to Moses Pharaoh's heart is hard and stubborn; he refuses to let the people go.
Exodus,7,15,Go to Pharaoh in the morning; he will be going out to the water; wait for him by the river's brink; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand.
Exodus,7,16,And say to him The Lord the God of the Hebrews has sent me to you saying Let My people go that they may serve Me in the wilderness; and behold heretofore you have not listened.
Exodus,7,17,Thus says the Lord In this you shall know recognize and understand that I am the Lord: behold I will smite with the rod in my hand the waters in the [Nile] River and they shall be turned to blood.
Exodus,7,18,The fish in the river shall die the river shall become foul smelling and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink from it.
Exodus,7,19,And the Lord said to Moses Say to Aaron Take your rod and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt over their streams rivers pools and ponds of water that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt in containers both of wood and of stone.
Exodus,7,20,Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded; [Aaron] lifted up the rod and smote the waters in the river in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants and all the waters in the river were turned to blood.
Exodus,7,21,And the fish in the river died; and the river became foul smelling and the Egyptians could not drink its water and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
Exodus,7,22,But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their enchantments and secret arts; and Pharaoh's heart was made hard and obstinate and he did not listen to Moses and Aaron just as the Lord had said.
Exodus,7,23,And Pharaoh turned and went into his house; neither did he take even this to heart.
Exodus,7,24,And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink for they could not drink the water of the [Nile].
Exodus,7,25,Seven days passed after the Lord had smitten the river.
Exodus,8,1,THEN THE Lord said to Moses Go to Pharaoh and say to him Thus says the Lord Let My people go that they may serve Me.
Exodus,8,2,And if you refuse to let them go behold I will smite your entire land with frogs;
Exodus,8,3,And the river shall swarm with frogs which shall go up and come into your house into your bedchamber and on your bed and into the houses of your servants and upon your people and into your ovens your kneading bowls and your dough.
Exodus,8,4,And the frogs shall come up on you and on your people and all your servants.
Exodus,8,5,And the Lord said to Moses Say to Aaron Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers the streams and canals and over the pools and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.
Exodus,8,6,So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land.
Exodus,8,7,But the magicians did the same thing with their enchantments and secret arts and brought up [more] frogs upon the land of Egypt.
Exodus,8,8,Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said Entreat the Lord that He may take away the frogs from me and my people; and I will let the people go that they may sacrifice to the Lord.
Exodus,8,9,Moses said to Pharaoh Glory over me in this: dictate when I shall pray [to the Lord] for you your servants and your people that the frogs may be destroyed from you and your houses and remain only in the river.
Exodus,8,10,And [Pharaoh] said Tomorrow. [Moses] said Let it be as you say that you may know that there is no one like the Lord our God.
Exodus,8,11,And the frogs shall depart from you and your houses and from your servants and your people; they shall remain in the river only.
Exodus,8,12,So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh and Moses cried to the Lord [as he had agreed with Pharaoh] concerning the frogs which He had brought against him.
Exodus,8,13,And the Lord did according to the word of Moses and the frogs died out of the houses out of the courtyards and villages and out of the fields.
Exodus,8,14,[The people] gathered them together in heaps and the land was loathsome and stank.
Exodus,8,15,But when Pharaoh saw that there was temporary relief he made his heart stubborn and hard and would not listen or heed them just as the Lord had said.
Exodus,8,16,Then the Lord said to Moses Say to Aaron Stretch out your rod and strike the dust of the ground that it may become biting gnats or mosquitoes throughout all the land of Egypt.
Exodus,8,17,And they did so; Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth and there came biting gnats or mosquitoes on man and beast; all the dust of the land became biting gnats or mosquitoes throughout all the land of Egypt.
Exodus,8,18,The magicians tried by their enchantments and secret arts to bring forth gnats or mosquitoes but they could not; and there were gnats or mosquitoes on man and beast.
Exodus,8,19,Then the magicians said to Pharaoh This is the finger of God! But Pharaoh's heart was hardened and strong and he would not listen to them just as the Lord had said.
Exodus,8,20,Then the Lord said to Moses Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he comes forth to the water; and say to him Thus says the Lord Let My people go that they may serve Me.
Exodus,8,21,Else if you will not let My people go behold I will send swarms [of bloodsucking gadflies] upon you your servants and your people and into your houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms [of bloodsucking gadflies] and also the ground on which they stand.
Exodus,8,22,But on that day I will sever and set apart the land of Goshen in which My people dwell that no swarms [of gadflies] shall be there so that you may know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.
Exodus,8,23,And I will put a division and a sign of deliverance between My people and your people. By tomorrow shall this sign be in evidence.
Exodus,8,24,And the Lord did so; and there came heavy and oppressive swarms [of bloodsucking gadflies] into the house of Pharaoh and his servants' houses; and in all of Egypt the land was corrupted and ruined by reason of the great invasion [of gadflies].
Exodus,8,25,And Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said Go sacrifice to your God [here] in the land [of Egypt].
Exodus,8,26,And Moses said It is not suitable or right to do that; for the animals the Egyptians hold sacred and will not permit to be slain are those which we are accustomed to sacrifice to the Lord our God; if we did this before the eyes of the Egyptians would they not stone us?
Exodus,8,27,We will go a three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the Lord our God as He will command us.
Exodus,8,28,So Pharaoh said I will let you go that you may sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Entreat [your God] for me.
Exodus,8,29,Moses said I go out from you and I will entreat the Lord that the swarms [of bloodsucking gadflies] may depart from Pharaoh his servants and his people tomorrow; only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.
Exodus,8,30,So Moses went out from Pharaoh and entreated the Lord.
Exodus,8,31,And the Lord did as Moses had spoken: He removed the swarms [of attacking gadflies] from Pharaoh from his servants and his people; there remained not one.
Exodus,8,32,But Pharaoh hardened his heart and made it stubborn this time also nor would he let the people go.
Exodus,9,1,THEN THE Lord said to Moses Go to Pharaoh and tell him Thus says the Lord God of the Hebrews: Let My people go that they may serve Me.
Exodus,9,2,If you refuse to let them go and still hold them
Exodus,9,3,Behold the hand of the Lord [will fall] upon your livestock which are out in the field upon the horses the donkeys the camels the herds and the flocks; there shall be a very severe plague.
Exodus,9,4,But the Lord shall make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the Israelites.
Exodus,9,5,And the Lord set a time saying Tomorrow the Lord will do this thing in the land.
Exodus,9,6,And the Lord did that the next day and all [kinds of] the livestock of Egypt died; but of the livestock of the Israelites not one died.
Exodus,9,7,Pharaoh sent to find out and behold there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened [his mind was set] and he did not let the people go.
Exodus,9,8,The Lord said to Moses and Aaron Take handfuls of ashes or soot from the brickkiln and let Moses sprinkle them toward the heavens in the sight of Pharaoh.
Exodus,9,9,And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt and become boils breaking out in sores on man and beast in all the land [occupied by the Egyptians].
Exodus,9,10,So they took ashes or soot of the kiln and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses threw them toward the sky and it became boils erupting in sores on man and beast.
Exodus,9,11,And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of their boils; for the boils were on the magicians and all the Egyptians.
Exodus,9,12,But the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh making it strong and obstinate and he did not listen to them or heed them just as the Lord had told Moses.
Exodus,9,13,Then the Lord said to Moses Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh and say to him Thus says the Lord the God of the Hebrews Let My people go that they may serve Me.
Exodus,9,14,For this time I will send all My plagues upon your heart and upon your servants and your people that you may recognize and know that there is none like Me in all the earth.
Exodus,9,15,For by now I could have put forth My hand and have struck you and your people with pestilence and you would have been cut off from the earth.
Exodus,9,16,But for this very purpose have I let you live that I might show you My power and that My name may be declared throughout all the earth.
Exodus,9,17,Since you are still exalting yourself [in haughty defiance] against My people by not letting them go
Exodus,9,18,Behold tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very heavy and dreadful fall of hail such as has not been in Egypt from its founding until now.
Exodus,9,19,Send therefore now and gather your cattle in hastily and all that you have in the field; for every man and beast that is in the field and is not brought home shall be struck by the hail and shall die.
Exodus,9,20,Then he who feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his livestock flee into the houses and shelters.
Exodus,9,21,And he who ignored the word of the Lord left his servants and his livestock in the field.
Exodus,9,22,The Lord said to Moses Stretch forth your hand toward the heavens that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt upon man and beast and upon all the vegetation of the field throughout the land of Egypt.
Exodus,9,23,Then Moses stretched forth his rod toward the heavens and the Lord sent thunder and hail and fire (lightning) ran down to and along the ground and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
Exodus,9,24,So there was hail and fire flashing continually in the midst of the weighty hail such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
Exodus,9,25,The hail struck down throughout all the land of Egypt everything that was in the field both man and beast; and the hail beat down all the vegetation of the field and shattered every tree of the field.
Exodus,9,26,Only in the land of Goshen where the Israelites were was there no hail.
Exodus,9,27,And Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said to them I have sinned this time; the Lord is in the right and I and my people are in the wrong.
Exodus,9,28,Entreat the Lord for there has been enough of these mighty thunderings and hail [these voices of God]; I will let you go; you shall stay here no longer.
Exodus,9,29,Moses said to him As soon as I leave the city I will stretch out my hands to the Lord; the thunder shall cease neither shall there be any more hail that you may know that the earth is the Lord's.
Exodus,9,30,But as for you and your servants I know that you do not yet [reverently] fear the Lord God.
Exodus,9,31,The flax and the barley were smitten and ruined for the barley was in the ear and the flax in bloom.
Exodus,9,32,But the wheat and spelt [another wheat] were not smitten for they ripen late and were not grown up yet.
Exodus,9,33,So Moses left the city and Pharaoh and stretched forth his hands to the Lord; and the thunder and hail ceased and rain was no longer poured upon the earth.
Exodus,9,34,But when Pharaoh saw that the rain the hail and the thunder had ceased he sinned yet more and toughened and stiffened his hard heart he and his servants.
Exodus,9,35,So Pharaoh's heart was strong and obstinate; he would not let the Israelites go just as the Lord had said by Moses.
Exodus,10,1,THE LORD said to Moses Go to Pharaoh for I have made his heart hard and his servants' hearts that I might show these My signs [of divine power] before him
Exodus,10,2,And that you may recount in the ears of your son and of your grandson what I have done in derision of the Egyptians and what things I have [repeatedly] done there--My signs [of divine power] done among them--that you may recognize and know that I am the Lord.
Exodus,10,3,So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him Thus says the Lord the God of the Hebrews How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go that they may serve Me.
Exodus,10,4,For if you refuse to let My people go behold tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country.
Exodus,10,5,And they shall cover the land so that one cannot see the ground; and they shall eat the remainder of what escaped and is left to you from the hail and they shall eat every tree of yours that grows in the field;
Exodus,10,6,The locusts shall fill your houses and those of all your servants and of all the Egyptians as neither your fathers nor your fathers' fathers have seen from their birth until this day. Then Moses departed from Pharaoh.
Exodus,10,7,And Pharaoh's servants said to him How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go that they may serve the Lord their God; do you not yet understand and know that Egypt is destroyed?
Exodus,10,8,So Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh; and he said to them Go serve the Lord your God; but just who are to go?
Exodus,10,9,And Moses said We will go with our young and our old with our sons and our daughters with our flocks and our herds [all of us and all we have] for we must hold a feast to the Lord.
Exodus,10,10,Pharaoh said to them Let the Lord be with you if I ever let you go with your little ones! See you have some evil purpose in mind.
Exodus,10,11,Not so! You that are men [without your families] go and serve the Lord for that is what you want. And [Moses and Aaron] were driven from Pharaoh's presence.
Exodus,10,12,Then the Lord said to Moses Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts that they may come up on the land of Egypt and eat all the vegetation of the land all that the hail has left.
Exodus,10,13,And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night; when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts.
Exodus,10,14,And the locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled down on the whole country of Egypt a very dreadful mass of them; never before were there such locusts as these nor will there ever be again.
Exodus,10,15,For they covered the whole land so that the ground was darkened and they ate every bit of vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left; there remained not a green thing of the trees or the plants of the field in all the land of Egypt.
Exodus,10,16,Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron in haste. He said I have sinned against the Lord your God and you.
Exodus,10,17,Now therefore forgive my sin I pray you only this once and entreat the Lord your God only that He may remove from me this [plague of] death.
Exodus,10,18,Then Moses left Pharaoh and entreated the Lord.
Exodus,10,19,And the Lord turned a violent west wind which lifted the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea; not one locust remained in all the country of Egypt.
Exodus,10,20,But the Lord made Pharaoh's heart more strong and obstinate and he would not let the Israelites go.
Exodus,10,21,And the Lord said to Moses Stretch out your hand toward the heavens that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt a darkness which may be felt.
Exodus,10,22,So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky and for three days a thick darkness was all over the land of Egypt.
Exodus,10,23,The Egyptians could not see one another nor did anyone rise from his place for three days; but all the Israelites had natural light in their dwellings.
Exodus,10,24,And Pharaoh called to Moses and said Go serve the Lord; let your little ones also go with you; it is only your flocks and your herds that must not go.
Exodus,10,25,But Moses said You must give into our hand also sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.
Exodus,10,26,Our livestock also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind; for of them must we take to serve the Lord our God and we know not with what we must serve the Lord until we arrive there.
Exodus,10,27,But the Lord made Pharaoh's heart stronger and more stubborn and he would not let them go.
Exodus,10,28,And Pharaoh said to Moses Get away from me! See that you never enter my presence again for the day you see my face again you shall die!
Exodus,10,29,And Moses said You have spoken truly; I will never see your face again.
Exodus,11,1,THEN THE Lord said to Moses Yet will I bring one plague more on Pharaoh and on Egypt; afterwards he will let you go. When he lets you go from here he will thrust you out altogether.
Exodus,11,2,Speak now in the hearing of the people and let every man solicit and ask of his neighbor and every woman of her neighbor jewels of silver and jewels of gold.
Exodus,11,3,And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was exceedingly great in the land of Egypt in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and of the people.
Exodus,11,4,And Moses said Thus says the Lord About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt;
Exodus,11,5,And all the firstborn in the land [the pride hope and joy] of Egypt shall die from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne even to the firstborn of the maidservant who is behind the hand mill and all the firstborn of beasts.
Exodus,11,6,There shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt such as has never been nor ever shall be again.
Exodus,11,7,But against any of the Israelites shall not so much as a dog move his tongue against man or beast that you may know that the Lord makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.
Exodus,11,8,And all these your servants shall come down to me and bow down to me saying Get out and all the people who follow you! And after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in great anger.
Exodus,11,9,Then the Lord said to Moses Pharaoh will not listen to you that My wonders and miracles may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
Exodus,11,10,Moses and Aaron did all these wonders and miracles before Pharaoh; and the Lord hardened Pharaoh's stubborn heart and he did not let the Israelites go out of his land.
Exodus,12,1,THE LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
Exodus,12,2,This month shall be to you the beginning of months the first month of the year to you.
Exodus,12,3,Tell all the congregation of Israel On the tenth day of this month they shall take every man a lamb or kid according to [the size of] the family of which he is the father a lamb or kid for each house.
Exodus,12,4,And if the household is too small to consume the lamb let him and his next door neighbor take it according to the number of persons every man according to what each can eat shall make your count for the lamb.
Exodus,12,5,Your lamb or kid shall be without blemish a male of the first year; you shall take it from the sheep or the goats.
Exodus,12,6,And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall [each] kill [his] lamb in the evening.

Exodus,13,1,THE LORD said to Moses
Exodus,13,2,Sanctify (consecrate set apart) to Me all the firstborn [males]; whatever is first to open the womb among the Israelites both of man and of beast is Mine.
Exodus,13,3,And Moses said to the people [Earnestly] remember this day in which you came out from Egypt out of the house of bondage and bondmen for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place; no leavened bread shall be eaten.

Exodus,13,13,Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem by [substituting for it] a lamb or if you will not redeem it then you shall break its neck; and every firstborn among your sons shall you redeem.
Exodus,13,14,And when in time to come your son asks you What does this mean? You shall say to him By strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt from the house of bondage and bondmen.
Exodus,13,15,For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go the Lord slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both the firstborn of man and of livestock. Therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all the males that first open the womb; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.
Exodus,13,16,And it shall be as a reminder upon your hand or as frontlets between your eyes for by a strong hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt.

Exodus,13,22,The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people.
Exodus,14,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Exodus,14,2,Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth between Migdol and the [Red] Sea before Baal-zephon. You shall encamp opposite it by the sea.
Exodus,14,3,For Pharaoh will say of the Israelites They are entangled in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.
Exodus,14,4,I will harden (make stubborn strong) Pharaoh's heart that he will pursue them and I will gain honor and glory over Pharaoh and all his host and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord. And they did so.
Exodus,14,5,It was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed toward the people and they said What is this we have done? We have let Israel go from serving us!
Exodus,14,6,And he made ready his chariots and took his army
Exodus,14,7,And took 600 chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them.

Exodus,14,10,When Pharaoh drew near the Israelites looked up and behold the Egyptians were marching after them; and the Israelites were exceedingly frightened and cried out to the Lord.
Exodus,14,11,And they said to Moses Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way and brought us out of Egypt?
Exodus,14,12,Did we not tell you in Egypt Let us alone; let us serve the Egyptians? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.
Exodus,14,13,Moses told the people Fear not; stand still (firm confident undismayed) and see the salvation of the Lord which He will work for you today. For the Egyptians you have seen today you shall never see again.
Exodus,14,14,The Lord will fight for you and you shall hold your peace and remain at rest.
Exodus,14,15,The Lord said to Moses Why do you cry to Me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward!
Exodus,14,16,Lift up your rod and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it and the Israelites shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.
Exodus,14,17,And I behold I will harden (make stubborn and strong) the hearts of the Egyptians and they shall go [into the sea] after them; and I will gain honor over Pharaoh and all his host his chariots and horsemen.
Exodus,14,18,The Egyptians shall know and realize that I am the Lord when I have gained honor and glory over Pharaoh his chariots and his horsemen.
Exodus,14,19,And the Angel of God Who went before the host of Israel moved and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before them and stood behind them
Exodus,14,20,Coming between the host of Egypt and the host of Israel. It was a cloud and darkness to the Egyptians but it gave light by night to the Israelites; and the one host did not come near the other all night.
Exodus,14,21,Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land; and the waters were divided.
Exodus,14,22,And the Israelites went into the midst of the sea on dry ground the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
Exodus,14,23,The Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea even all Pharaoh's horses his chariots and his horsemen.
Exodus,14,24,And in the morning watch the Lord through the pillar of fire and cloud looked down on the host of the Egyptians and discomfited [them]
Exodus,14,25,And bound (clogged took off) their chariot wheels making them drive heavily; and the Egyptians said Let us flee from the face of Israel for the Lord fights for them against the Egyptians!
Exodus,14,26,Then the Lord said to Moses Stretch out your hand over the sea that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians upon their chariots and horsemen.
Exodus,14,27,So Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to its strength and normal flow when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled into it [being met by it]; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians and shook them off into the midst of the sea.
Exodus,14,28,The waters returned and covered the chariots the horsemen and all the host of Pharaoh that pursued them; not even one of them remained.
Exodus,14,29,But the Israelites walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
Exodus,14,30,Thus the Lord saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore.
Exodus,14,31,And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did against the Egyptians and the people [reverently] feared the Lord and trusted in (relied on remained steadfast to) the Lord and to His servant Moses.
Exodus,15,1,THEN MOSES and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord saying I will sing to the Lord for He has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider or its chariot has He thrown into the sea.
Exodus,15,2,The Lord is my Strength and my Song and He has become my Salvation; this is my God and I will praise Him my father's God and I will exalt Him.
Exodus,15,3,The Lord is a Man of War; the Lord is His name.
Exodus,15,4,Pharaoh's chariots and his host has He cast into the sea; his chosen captains also are sunk in the Red Sea.
Exodus,15,5,The floods cover them; they sank in the depths [clad in mail] like a stone.
Exodus,15,6,Your right hand O Lord is glorious in power; Your right hand O Lord shatters the enemy.
Exodus,15,7,In the greatness of Your majesty You overthrow those rising against You. You send forth Your fury; it consumes them like stubble.
Exodus,15,8,With the blast of Your nostrils the waters piled up the floods stood fixed in a heap the deeps congealed in the heart of the sea.
Exodus,15,9,The enemy said I will pursue I will overtake I will divide the spoil; my desire shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them.
Exodus,15,10,You [Lord] blew with Your wind the sea covered them; [clad in mail] they sank as lead in the mighty waters.
Exodus,15,11,Who is like You O Lord among the gods? Who is like You glorious in holiness awesome in splendor doing wonders?
Exodus,15,12,You stretched out Your right hand the earth's [sea] swallowed them.
Exodus,15,13,You in Your mercy and loving-kindness have led forth the people whom You have redeemed; You have guided them in Your strength to Your holy habitation.
Exodus,15,14,The peoples have heard of it; they tremble; pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.
Exodus,15,15,Now the chiefs of Edom are dismayed; the mighty men of Moab [renowned for strength] trembling takes hold of them; all the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away--little by little.
Exodus,15,16,Terror and dread fall upon them; because of the greatness of Your arm they are as still as a stone--till Your people pass by and over [into Canaan] O Lord till the people pass by whom You have purchased.
Exodus,15,17,You will bring them in [to the land] and plant them on Your own mountain the place O Lord You have made for Your dwelling the sanctuary O Lord which Your hands have established.
Exodus,15,18,The Lord will reign forever and ever.
Exodus,15,19,For the horses of Pharaoh went with his chariots and horsemen into the sea and the Lord brought back the waters of the sea upon them but the Israelites walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea.
Exodus,15,20,Then Miriam the prophetess the sister of Aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and dancing.
Exodus,15,21,And Miriam responded to them Sing to the Lord for He has triumphed gloriously and is highly exalted; the horse and his rider He has thrown into the sea.
Exodus,15,22,Then Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea and they went into the Wilderness of Shur; they went three days [thirty-three miles] in the wilderness and found no water.
Exodus,15,23,When they came to Marah they could not drink its waters for they were bitter; therefore it was named Marah [bitterness].
Exodus,15,24,The people murmured against Moses saying What shall we drink?
Exodus,15,25,And he cried to the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree which he cast into the waters and the waters were made sweet. There [the Lord] made for them a statute and an ordinance and there He proved them
Exodus,15,26,Saying If you will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord your God and will do what is right in His sight and will listen to and obey His commandments and keep all His statutes I will put none of the diseases upon you which I brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord Who heals you.
Exodus,15,27,And they came to Elim where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters.
Exodus,16,1,THEY SET out from Elim and all the congregation of Israel came to the Wilderness of Sin which is between Elim and Sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after they left the land of Egypt.
Exodus,16,2,And the whole congregation of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness
Exodus,16,3,And said to them Would that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt when we sat by the fleshpots and ate bread to the full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
Exodus,16,4,Then the Lord said to Moses Behold I will rain bread from the heavens for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day that I may prove them whether they will walk in My law or not.
Exodus,16,5,On the sixth day they shall prepare to bring in twice as much as they gather daily.
Exodus,16,6,So Moses and Aaron said to all Israel At evening you shall know that the Lord has brought you out from the land of Egypt
Exodus,16,7,And in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord for He hears your murmurings against the Lord. For what are we that you murmur against us?
Exodus,16,8,And Moses said [This will happen] when the Lord gives you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full because the Lord has heard your grumblings which you murmur against Him; what are we? Your murmurings are not against us but against the Lord.
Exodus,16,9,And Moses said to Aaron Say to all the congregation of Israel Come near before the Lord for He has heard your murmurings.
Exodus,16,10,And as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of Israel they looked toward the wilderness and behold the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud!
Exodus,16,11,The Lord said to Moses
Exodus,16,12,I have heard the murmurings of the Israelites; speak to them saying At twilight you shall eat meat and between the two evenings you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God.
Exodus,16,13,In the evening quails came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay round about the camp.
Exodus,16,14,And when the dew had gone behold upon the face of the wilderness there lay a fine round and flakelike thing as fine as hoarfrost on the ground.
Exodus,16,15,When the Israelites saw it they said one to another Manna [What is it?]. For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them This is the bread which the Lord has given you to eat.
Exodus,16,16,This is what the Lord has commanded: Let every man gather of it as much as he will need an omer for each person according to the number of your persons; take it every man for those in his tent.
Exodus,16,17,The [people] did so and gathered some more some less.
Exodus,16,18,When they measured it with an omer he who gathered much had nothing over and he who gathered little had no lack; each gathered according to his need.
Exodus,16,19,Moses said Let none of it be left until morning.
Exodus,16,20,But they did not listen to Moses; some of them left of it until morning and it bred worms became foul and stank; and Moses was angry with them.
Exodus,16,21,They gathered it every morning each as much as he needed for when the sun became hot it melted.
Exodus,16,22,And on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread two omers for each person; and all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses.
Exodus,16,23,He said to them The Lord has said Tomorrow is a solemn rest a holy Sabbath to the Lord; bake and boil what you will bake and boil today; and all that remains over put aside for you to keep until morning.
Exodus,16,24,They laid it aside till morning as Moses told them; and it did not become foul neither was it wormy.
Exodus,16,25,Moses said Eat that today for today is a Sabbath to the Lord. Today you shall find none in the field.
Exodus,16,26,Six days you shall gather it but on the seventh day the Sabbath there shall be none.
Exodus,16,27,On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather but they found none.
Exodus,16,28,The Lord said to Moses How long do you [people] refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?
Exodus,16,29,See the Lord has given you the Sabbath; therefore He gives you on the sixth day the bread for two days; let every man remain in his place; let no man leave his place on the seventh day.
Exodus,16,30,So the people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus,16,31,The house of Israel called the bread manna; it was like coriander seed white and it tasted like wafers made with honey.
Exodus,16,32,Moses said This is what the Lord commands Take an omer of it to be kept throughout your generations that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus,16,33,And Moses said to Aaron Take a pot and put an omer of manna in it and lay it up before the Lord to be kept throughout your generations.
Exodus,16,34,As the Lord commanded Moses Aaron laid it up before the Testimony to be kept [in the ark].
Exodus,16,35,And the Israelites ate manna forty years until they came to a habitable land; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.
Exodus,16,36,(Now an omer is the tenth of an ephah.)
Exodus,17,1,ALL THE congregation of the Israelites moved on from the Wilderness of Sin by stages according to the commandment of the Lord and encamped at Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink.
Exodus,17,2,Therefore the people contended with Moses and said Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them Why do you find fault with me? Why do you tempt the Lord and try His patience?
Exodus,17,3,But the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against Moses and said Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and livestock with thirst?
Exodus,17,4,So Moses cried to the Lord What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.
Exodus,17,5,And the Lord said to Moses Pass on before the people and take with you some of the elders of Israel; and take in your hand the rod with which you smote the river [Nile] and go.
Exodus,17,6,Behold I will stand before you there on the rock at [Mount] Horeb; and you shall strike the rock and water shall come out of it that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
Exodus,17,7,He called the place Massah [proof ] and Meribah [contention] because of the faultfinding of the Israelites and because they tempted and tried the patience of the Lord saying Is the Lord among us or not?
Exodus,17,8,Then came Amalek [descendants of Esau] and fought with Israel at Rephidim.
Exodus,17,9,And Moses said to Joshua Choose us out men and go out fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.
Exodus,17,10,So Joshua did as Moses said and fought with Amalek; and Moses Aaron and Hur went up to the hilltop.
Exodus,17,11,When Moses held up his hand Israel prevailed; and when he lowered his hand Amalek prevailed.
Exodus,17,12,But Moses' hands were heavy and grew weary. So [the other men] took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Then Aaron and Hur held up his hands one on one side and one on the other side; so his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
Exodus,17,13,And Joshua mowed down and disabled Amalek and his people with the sword.
Exodus,17,14,And the Lord said to Moses Write this for a memorial in the book and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens.
Exodus,17,15,And Moses built an altar and called the name of it The Lord is my Banner;
Exodus,17,16,And he said Because [theirs] is a hand against the throne of the Lord the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.
Exodus,18,1,NOW JETHRO [Reuel] the priest of Midian Moses' father-in-law heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt.
Exodus,18,2,Then Jethro Moses' father-in-law took Zipporah Moses' wife after Moses had sent her back [to her father]
Exodus,18,3,And her two sons of whom the name of the one was Gershom [ expulsion or a stranger there] for Moses said I have been an alien in a strange land;
Exodus,18,4,And the name of the other was Eliezer [God is help] for the God of my father said Moses was my help and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.
Exodus,18,5,And Jethro Moses' father-in-law came with Moses' sons and his wife to the wilderness where he was encamped at the mount of God [Horeb or Sinai].
Exodus,18,6,And he said [in a message] to Moses I your father-in-law Jethro am come to you and your wife and her two sons with her.
Exodus,18,7,And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed in homage and kissed him; and each asked the other of his welfare and they came into the tent.
Exodus,18,8,Moses told his father-in-law all the Lord had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake and all the hardships that had come upon them by the way and how the Lord delivered them.
Exodus,18,9,Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness the Lord had done to Israel in that He had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus,18,10,Jethro said Blessed be the Lord Who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh Who has delivered the people [Israel] from under the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus,18,11,Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods. Yes in the [very] thing in which they dealt proudly [He showed Himself infinitely superior to all their gods].
Exodus,18,12,And Jethro Moses' father-in-law took a burnt offering and sacrifices [to offer] to God and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.
Exodus,18,13,Next day Moses sat to judge the people and the people stood around Moses from morning till evening.
Exodus,18,14,When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people he said What is this that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone and all the people stand around you from morning till evening?
Exodus,18,15,Moses said to his father-in-law Because the people come to me to inquire of God.
Exodus,18,16,When they have a dispute they come to me and I judge between a man and his neighbor and I make them know the statutes of God and His laws.
Exodus,18,17,Moses' father-in-law said to him The thing that you are doing is not good.
Exodus,18,18,You will surely wear out both yourself and this people with you for the thing is too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it all by yourself.
Exodus,18,19,Listen now to [me]; I will counsel you and God will be with you. You shall represent the people before God bringing their cases and causes to Him
Exodus,18,20,Teaching them the decrees and laws showing them the way they must walk and the work they must do.
Exodus,18,21,Moreover you shall choose able men from all the people--God-fearing men of truth who hate unjust gain--and place them over thousands hundreds fifties and tens to be their rulers.
Exodus,18,22,And let them judge the people at all times; every great matter they shall bring to you but every small matter they shall judge. So it will be easier for you and they will bear the burden with you.
Exodus,18,23,If you will do this and God so commands you you will be able to endure [the strain] and all these people also will go to their [tents] in peace.
Exodus,18,24,So Moses listened to and heeded the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
Exodus,18,25,Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people rulers of thousands of hundreds of fifties and of tens.
Exodus,18,26,And they judged the people at all times; the hard cases they brought to Moses but every small matter they decided themselves.
Exodus,18,27,Then Moses let his father-in-law depart and he went his way into his own land.
Exodus,19,1,IN THE third month after the Israelites left the land of Egypt the same day they came into the Wilderness of Sinai.
Exodus,19,2,When they had departed from Rephidim and had come to the Wilderness of Sinai they encamped there before the mountain.
Exodus,19,3,And Moses went up to God and the Lord called to him out of the mountain Say this to the house of Jacob and tell the Israelites:
Exodus,19,4,You have seen what I did to the Egyptians and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to Myself.
Exodus,19,5,Now therefore if you will obey My voice in truth and keep My covenant then you shall be My own peculiar possession and treasure from among and above all peoples; for all the earth is Mine.
Exodus,19,6,And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests a holy nation [consecrated set apart to the worship of God]. These are the words you shall speak to the Israelites.
Exodus,19,7,So Moses called for the elders of the people and told them all these words which the Lord commanded him.
Exodus,19,8,And all the people answered together and said All that the Lord has spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord.
Exodus,19,9,And the Lord said to Moses Behold I come to you in a thick cloud that the people may hear when I speak with you and believe you and remain steadfast forever. Then Moses told the words of the people to the Lord.
Exodus,19,10,And the Lord said to Moses Go and sanctify the people [set them apart for God] today and tomorrow and let them wash their clothes
Exodus,19,11,And be ready by the third day for the third day the Lord will come down upon Mount Sinai [in the cloud] in the sight of all the people.
Exodus,19,12,And you shall set bounds for the people round about saying Take heed that you go not up into the mountain or touch the border of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.
Exodus,19,13,No hand shall touch it [or the offender] but he shall surely be stoned or shot [with arrows]; whether beast or man he shall not live. When the trumpet sounds a long blast they shall come up to the mountain.
Exodus,19,14,So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified them [set them apart for God] and they washed their clothes.
Exodus,19,15,And he said to the people Be ready by the day after tomorrow; do not go near a woman.
Exodus,19,16,The third morning there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast so that all the people in the camp trembled.
Exodus,19,17,Then Moses brought the people from the camp to meet God and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
Exodus,19,18,Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke for the Lord descended upon it in fire; its smoke ascended like that of a furnace and the whole mountain quaked greatly.
Exodus,19,19,As the trumpet blast grew louder and louder Moses spoke and God answered him with a voice.
Exodus,19,20,The Lord came down upon Mount Sinai to the top of the mountain and the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain and Moses went up.
Exodus,19,21,The Lord said to Moses Go down and warn the people lest they break through to the Lord to gaze and many of them perish.
Exodus,19,22,And also let the priests who come near to the Lord sanctify (set apart) themselves [for God] lest the Lord break forth against them.
Exodus,19,23,And Moses said to the Lord The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai for You Yourself charged us saying Set bounds about the mountain and sanctify it [set it apart for God].
Exodus,19,24,Then the Lord said to him Go get down and you shall come up you and Aaron with you; but let not the priests and the people break through to come up to the Lord lest He break forth against them.
Exodus,19,25,So Moses went down to the people and told them.
Exodus,20,1,THEN GOD spoke all these words:
Exodus,20,2,I am the Lord your God Who has brought you out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage.
Exodus,20,3,You shall have no other gods before or besides Me.
Exodus,20,4,You shall not make yourself any graven image [to worship it] or any likeness of anything that is in the heavens above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth;
Exodus,20,5,You shall not bow down yourself to them or serve them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me
Exodus,20,6,But showing mercy and steadfast love to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments.
Exodus,20,7,You shall not use or repeat the name of the Lord your God in vain [that is lightly or frivolously in false affirmations or profanely]; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.
Exodus,20,8,[Earnestly] remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy (withdrawn from common employment and dedicated to God).
Exodus,20,9,Six days you shall labor and do all your work
Exodus,20,10,But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work you or your son your daughter your manservant your maidservant your domestic animals or the sojourner within your gates.
Exodus,20,11,For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth the sea and all that is in them and rested the seventh day. That is why the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it [set it apart for His purposes].
Exodus,20,12,Regard (treat with honor due obedience and courtesy) your father and mother that your days may be long in the land the Lord your God gives you.
Exodus,20,13,You shall not commit murder.
Exodus,20,14,You shall not commit adultery.
Exodus,20,15,You shall not steal.
Exodus,20,16,You shall not witness falsely against your neighbor.
Exodus,20,17,You shall not covet your neighbor's house your neighbor's wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his ox or his donkey or anything that is your neighbor's.
Exodus,20,18,Now all the people perceived the thunderings and the lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the smoking mountain and as [they] looked they trembled with fear and fell back and stood afar off.
Exodus,20,19,And they said to Moses You speak to us and we will listen but let not God speak to us lest we die.
Exodus,20,20,And Moses said to the people Fear not; for God has come to prove you so that the [reverential] fear of Him may be before you that you may not sin.
Exodus,20,21,And the people stood afar off but Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.
Exodus,20,22,And the Lord said to Moses Thus shall you say to the Israelites You have seen for yourselves that I have talked with you from heaven.
Exodus,20,23,You shall not make [gods to share] with Me [My glory and your worship]; gods of silver or gods of gold you shall not make for yourselves.
Exodus,20,24,An altar of earth you shall make to Me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I record My name and cause it to be remembered I will come to you and bless you.
Exodus,20,25,And if you will make Me an altar of stone you shall not build it of hewn stone for if you lift up a tool upon it you have polluted it.
Exodus,20,26,Neither shall you go up by steps to My altar that your nakedness be not exposed upon it.
Exodus,21,1,NOW THESE are the ordinances you [Moses] shall set before [the Israelites].
Exodus,21,2,If you buy a Hebrew servant [as the result of debt or theft] he shall serve six years and in the seventh he shall go out free paying nothing.
Exodus,21,3,If he came [to you] by himself he shall go out by himself; if he came married then his wife shall go out with him.
Exodus,21,4,If his master has given him a wife and she has borne him sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her master's and he shall go out [of your service] alone.
Exodus,21,5,But if the servant shall plainly say I love my master my wife and my children; I will not go free
Exodus,21,6,Then his master shall bring him to God [the judges as His agents]; he shall bring him to the door or doorpost and shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him for life.
Exodus,21,7,If a man sells his daughter to be a maidservant or bondwoman she shall not go out [in six years] as menservants do.
Exodus,21,8,If she does not please her master who has not espoused her to himself he shall let her be redeemed. To sell her to a foreign people he shall have no power for he has dealt faithlessly with her.
Exodus,21,9,And if he espouses her to his son he shall deal with her as with a daughter.
Exodus,21,10,If he marries again her food clothing and privilege as a wife shall he not diminish.
Exodus,21,11,And if he does not do these three things for her then shall she go out free without payment of money.
Exodus,21,12,Whoever strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death.
Exodus,21,13,But if he did not lie in wait for him but God allowed him to fall into his hand then I will appoint you a place to which he may flee [for protection until duly tried].
Exodus,21,14,But if a man comes willfully upon another to slay him craftily you shall take him from My altar [to which he may have fled for protection] that he may die.
Exodus,21,15,Whoever strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
Exodus,21,16,Whoever kidnaps a man whether he sells him or is found with him in his possession shall surely be put to death.

Exodus,21,18,If men quarrel and one strikes another with a stone or with his fist and he does not die but keeps his bed
Exodus,21,19,If he rises again and walks about leaning upon his staff then he that struck him shall be clear except he must pay for the loss of his time and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.
Exodus,21,20,And if a man strikes his servant or his maid with a rod and he [or she] dies under his hand he shall surely be punished.
Exodus,21,21,But if the servant lives on for a day or two the offender shall not be punished for he [has injured] his own property.
Exodus,21,22,If men contend with each other and a pregnant woman [interfering] is hurt so that she has a miscarriage yet no further damage follows [the one who hurt her] shall surely be punished with a fine [paid] to the woman's husband as much as the judges determine.
Exodus,21,23,But if any damage follows then you shall give life for life
Exodus,21,24,Eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
Exodus,21,25,Burn for burn wound for wound and lash for lash.
Exodus,21,26,And if a man hits the eye of his servant or the eye of his maid so that it is destroyed he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.
Exodus,21,27,And if he knocks out his manservant's tooth or his maidservant's tooth he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.
Exodus,21,28,If an ox gores a man or a woman to death then the ox shall surely be stoned and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be clear.
Exodus,21,29,But if the ox has tried to gore before and its owner has been warned but has not kept it closed in and it kills a man or a woman the ox shall be stoned and its owner also put to death.
Exodus,21,30,If a ransom is put on [the man's] life then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is laid upon him.
Exodus,21,31,If the [man's ox] has gored another's son or daughter he shall be dealt with according to this same rule.
Exodus,21,32,If the ox gores a manservant or a maidservant the owner shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver and the ox shall be stoned.
Exodus,21,33,If a man leaves a pit open or digs a pit and does not cover it and an ox or a donkey falls into it
Exodus,21,34,The owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money to the animal's owner but the dead beast shall be his.
Exodus,21,35,If one man's ox hurts another's so that it dies they shall sell the live ox and divide the price of it; the dead ox also they shall divide between them.
Exodus,21,36,Or if it is known that the ox has gored in the past and its owner has not kept it closed in he shall surely pay ox for ox and the dead beast shall be his.
Exodus,22,1,IF A man steals an ox or sheep and kills or sells it he shall pay five oxen for an ox or four sheep for a sheep.
Exodus,22,2,If a thief is found breaking in and is struck so that he dies there shall be no blood shed for him.

Exodus,22,4,If the beast which he stole is found in his possession alive whether it is ox or ass or sheep he shall restore double.

Exodus,22,7,If a man delivers to his neighbor money or goods to keep and it is stolen out of the neighbor's house then if the thief is found he shall pay double.
Exodus,22,8,But if the thief is not found the house owner shall appear before God [the judges as His agents] to find whether he stole his neighbor's goods.
Exodus,22,9,For every unlawful deed whether it concerns ox donkey sheep clothing or any lost thing at all which another identifies as his the cause of both parties shall come before God [the judges]. Whomever [they] shall condemn shall pay his neighbor double.
Exodus,22,10,If a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey or an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep and it dies or is hurt or driven away no man seeing it
Exodus,22,11,Then an oath before the Lord shall be required between the two that the man has not taken his neighbor's property; and the owner of it shall accept his word and not require him to make good the loss.
Exodus,22,12,But if it is stolen when in his care he shall make restitution to its owner.
Exodus,22,13,If it be torn in pieces [by some wild beast or by accident] let him bring [the mangled carcass] for witness; he shall not make good what was torn.
Exodus,22,14,And if a man borrows anything of his neighbor and it gets hurt or dies without its owner being with it the borrower shall make full restitution.
Exodus,22,15,But if the owner is with it [when the damage is done] the borrower shall not make it good. If it is a hired thing the damage is included in its hire.
Exodus,22,16,If a man seduces a virgin not betrothed and lies with her he shall surely pay a dowry for her to become his wife.

Exodus,22,25,If you lend money to any of My people with you who is poor you shall not be to him as a creditor neither shall you require interest from him.
Exodus,22,26,If you ever take your neighbor's garment in pledge you shall give it back to him before the sun goes down;
Exodus,22,27,For that is his only covering his clothing for his body. In what shall he sleep? When he cries to Me I will hear for I am gracious and merciful.
Exodus,22,28,You shall not revile God [the judges as His agents] or esteem lightly or curse a ruler of your people.

Exodus,22,31,And you shall be holy men [consecrated] to Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by beasts in the field; you shall throw it to the dogs.

Exodus,23,10,Six years you shall sow your land and reap its yield.
Exodus,23,11,But the seventh year you shall release it and let it rest and lie fallow that the poor of your people may eat [what the land voluntarily yields] and what they leave the wild beasts shall eat. In like manner you shall deal with your vineyard and olive grove.
Exodus,23,12,Six days you shall do your work but the seventh day you shall rest and keep Sabbath that your ox and your donkey may rest and the son of your bondwoman and the alien may be refreshed.

Exodus,23,29,I will not drive them out from before you in one year lest the land become desolate [for lack of attention] and the wild beasts multiply against you.
Exodus,23,30,Little by little I will drive them out from before you until you have increased and are numerous enough to take possession of the land.
Exodus,23,31,I will set your borders from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines and from the wilderness to the river [Euphrates]; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand and you shall drive them out before you.
Exodus,23,32,You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods.
Exodus,23,33,They shall not dwell in your land lest they make you sin against Me; for if you serve their gods it will surely be a snare to you.
Exodus,24,1,GOD SAID to Moses Come up to the Lord you and Aaron Nadab and Abihu [Aaron's sons] and seventy of Israel's elders and worship at a distance.
Exodus,24,2,Moses alone shall come near the Lord; the others shall not come near and neither shall the people come up with him.
Exodus,24,3,Moses came and told the people all that the Lord had said and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice All that the Lord has spoken we will do.
Exodus,24,4,Moses wrote all the words of the Lord. He rose up early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain and set up twelve pillars representing Israel's twelve tribes.
Exodus,24,5,And he sent young Israelite men who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the Lord.
Exodus,24,6,And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins and half of the blood he dashed against the altar.
Exodus,24,7,Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read in the hearing of the people; and they said All that the Lord has said we will do and we will be obedient.
Exodus,24,8,And Moses took the [remaining half of the] blood and sprinkled it on the people and said Behold the blood of the covenant which the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words.
Exodus,24,9,Then Moses Aaron Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel went up [the mountainside].
Exodus,24,10,And they saw the God of Israel [that is a convincing manifestation of His presence] and under His feet it was like pavement of bright sapphire stone like the very heavens in clearness.
Exodus,24,11,And upon the nobles of the Israelites He laid not His hand [to conceal Himself from them to rebuke their daring or to harm them]; but they saw [the manifestation of the presence of] God and ate and drank.
Exodus,24,12,And the Lord said to Moses Come up to Me into the mountain and be there and I will give you tables of stone with the law and the commandments which I have written that you may teach them.
Exodus,24,13,So Moses rose up with Joshua his attendant; and Moses went up into the mountain of God.
Exodus,24,14,And he said to the elders Tarry here for us until we come back to you; remember Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a cause let him go to them.
Exodus,24,15,Then Moses went up into the mountain and the cloud covered the mountain.
Exodus,24,16,The glory of the Lord rested on Mount Sinai and the cloud covered it for six days. On the seventh day [God] called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud.
Exodus,24,17,And the glory of the Lord appeared to the Israelites like devouring fire on the top of the mountain.
Exodus,24,18,Moses entered into the midst of the cloud and went up the mountain and Moses was on the mountain forty days and nights.

Exodus,25,25,And make a frame of a handbreadth around and below the top of it and put around it a gold molding as a border.
Exodus,25,26,You shall make for it four rings of gold and fasten them at the four corners that are on the table's four legs.
Exodus,25,27,Close against the frame shall the rings be as places for the poles to pass to carry the table [of showbread].
Exodus,25,28,You shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold that the table may be carried with them.

Exodus,32,6,And they rose up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.
Exodus,32,7,The Lord said to Moses Go down for your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves;
Exodus,32,8,They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten calf and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it and said These are your gods O Israel that brought you up out of the land of Egypt!
Exodus,32,9,And the Lord said to Moses I have seen this people and behold it is a stiff-necked people;
Exodus,32,10,Now therefore let Me alone that My wrath may burn hot against them and that I may destroy them; but I will make of you a great nation.
Exodus,32,11,But Moses besought the Lord his God and said Lord why does Your wrath blaze hot against Your people whom You have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?
Exodus,32,12,Why should the Egyptians say For evil He brought them forth to slay them in the mountains and consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from Your fierce wrath and change Your mind concerning this evil against Your people.
Exodus,32,13,[Earnestly] remember Abraham Isaac and Israel Your servants to whom You swore by Your own self and said to them I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed and they shall inherit it forever.
Exodus,32,14,Then the Lord turned from the evil which He had thought to do to His people.
Exodus,32,15,And Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tables of the Testimony in his hand tables or tablets that were written on both sides.
Exodus,32,16,The tables were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God graven upon the tables.
Exodus,32,17,And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said to Moses There is a noise of war in the camp.
Exodus,32,18,But Moses said It is not the sound of shouting for victory neither is it the sound of the cry of the defeated but the sound of singing that I hear.
Exodus,32,19,And as soon as he came near to the camp he saw the calf and the dancing. And Moses' anger blazed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.
Exodus,32,20,And he took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire and ground it to powder and scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.
Exodus,32,21,And Moses said to Aaron What did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?
Exodus,32,22,And Aaron said Let not the anger of my lord blaze hot; you know the people that they are set on evil.
Exodus,32,23,For they said to me Make us gods which shall go before us; as for this Moses the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt we do not know what has become of him.
Exodus,32,24,I said to them Those who have any gold let them take it off. So they gave it to me; then I cast it into the fire and there came out this calf.
Exodus,32,25,And when Moses saw that the people were unruly and unrestrained (for Aaron had let them get out of control so that they were a derision and object of shame among their enemies)
Exodus,32,26,Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said Whoever is on the Lord's side let him come to me. And all the Levites [the priestly tribe] gathered together to him.
Exodus,32,27,And he said to them Thus says the Lord God of Israel Every man put his sword on his side and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his companion and every man his neighbor.
Exodus,32,28,And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about 3000 men.
Exodus,32,29,And Moses said [to the Levites By your obedience to God's command] you have consecrated yourselves today [as priests] to the Lord each man [at the cost of being] against his own son and his own brother that the Lord may restore and bestow His blessing upon you this day.
Exodus,32,30,The next day Moses said to the people You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to the Lord; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.
Exodus,32,31,So Moses returned to the Lord and said Oh these people have sinned a great sin and have made themselves gods of gold!
Exodus,32,32,Yet now if You will forgive their sin--and if not blot me I pray You out of Your book which You have written!
Exodus,32,33,But the Lord said to Moses Whoever has sinned against Me I will blot him [not you] out of My book.
Exodus,32,34,But now go lead the people to the place of which I have told you. Behold My Angel shall go before you. Nevertheless in the day when I punish I will visit their sin upon them!
Exodus,32,35,And the Lord sent a plague upon the people because they made the calf which Aaron fashioned for them.
Exodus,33,1,THE LORD said to Moses Depart go up from here you and the people whom you have brought from the land of Egypt to the land which I swore to Abraham Isaac and Jacob saying To your descendants I will give it.
Exodus,33,2,I will send an Angel before you and I will drive out the Canaanite Amorite Hittite Perizzite Hivite and Jebusite.
Exodus,33,3,Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up among you for you are a stiff-necked people lest I destroy you on the way.
Exodus,33,4,When the people heard these evil tidings they mourned and no man put on his ornaments.
Exodus,33,5,For the Lord had said to Moses Say to the Israelites You are a stiff-necked people! If I should come among you for one moment I would consume and destroy you. Now therefore [penitently] leave off your ornaments that I may know what to do with you.
Exodus,33,6,And the Israelites left off all their ornaments from Mount Horeb onward.
Exodus,33,7,Now Moses used to take [his own] tent and pitch it outside the camp far off from the camp and he called it the tent of meeting [of God with His own people]. And everyone who sought the Lord went out to [that temporary] tent of meeting which was outside the camp.
Exodus,33,8,When Moses went out to the tent of meeting all the people rose and stood every man at his tent door and looked after Moses until he had gone into the tent.
Exodus,33,9,When Moses entered the tent the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the door of the tent and the Lord would talk with Moses.
Exodus,33,10,And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the tent door and all the people rose up and worshiped every man at his tent door.
Exodus,33,11,And the Lord spoke to Moses face to face as a man speaks to his friend. Moses returned to the camp but his minister Joshua son of Nun a young man did not depart from the [temporary prayer] tent.
Exodus,33,12,Moses said to the Lord See You say to me Bring up this people but You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet You said I know you by name and you have also found favor in My sight.
Exodus,33,13,Now therefore I pray You if I have found favor in Your sight show me now Your way that I may know You [progressively become more deeply and intimately acquainted with You perceiving and recognizing and understanding more strongly and clearly] and that I may find favor in Your sight. And [Lord do] consider that this nation is Your people.
Exodus,33,14,And the Lord said My Presence shall go with you and I will give you rest.
Exodus,33,15,And Moses said to the Lord If Your Presence does not go with me do not carry us up from here!
Exodus,33,16,For by what shall it be known that I and Your people have found favor in Your sight? Is it not in Your going with us so that we are distinguished I and Your people from all the other people upon the face of the earth?
Exodus,33,17,And the Lord said to Moses I will do this thing also that you have asked for you have found favor loving-kindness and mercy in My sight and I know you personally and by name.
Exodus,33,18,And Moses said I beseech You show me Your glory.
Exodus,33,19,And God said I will make all My goodness pass before you and I will proclaim My name THE LORD before you; for I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show mercy and loving-kindness on whom I will show mercy and loving-kindness.
Exodus,33,20,But He said You can not see My face for no man shall see Me and live.
Exodus,33,21,And the Lord said Behold there is a place beside Me and you shall stand upon the rock
Exodus,33,22,And while My glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by.
Exodus,33,23,Then I will take away My hand and you shall see My back; but My face shall not be seen.
Exodus,34,1,THE LORD said to Moses Cut two tables of stone like the first and I will write upon these tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke.
Exodus,34,2,Be ready and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai and present yourself there to Me on the top of the mountain.
Exodus,34,3,And no man shall come up with you neither let any man be seen throughout all the mountain; neither let flocks or herds feed before that mountain.
Exodus,34,4,So Moses cut two tables of stone like the first and he rose up early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai as the Lord had commanded him and took in his hand two tables of stone.
Exodus,34,5,And the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the Lord.
Exodus,34,6,And the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed The Lord! the Lord! a God merciful and gracious slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth
Exodus,34,7,Keeping mercy and loving-kindness for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin but Who will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children's children to the third and fourth generation.
Exodus,34,8,And Moses made haste to bow his head toward the earth and worshiped.
Exodus,34,9,And he said If now I have found favor and loving-kindness in Your sight O Lord let the Lord I pray You go in the midst of us although it is a stiff-necked people and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for Your inheritance.
Exodus,34,10,And the Lord said Behold I lay down [afresh the terms of the mutual agreement between Israel and Me] a covenant. Before all your people I will do marvels (wonders miracles) such as have not been wrought or created in all the earth or in any nation; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the Lord; for it is a terrible thing [fearful and full of awe] that I will do with you.
Exodus,34,11,Observe what I command you this day. Behold I drive out before you the Amorite Canaanite Hittite Perizzite Hivite and Jebusite.
Exodus,34,12,Take heed to yourself lest you make a covenant or mutual agreement with the inhabitants of the land to which you go lest it become a snare in the midst of you.
Exodus,34,13,But you shall destroy their altars dash in pieces their pillars (obelisks images) and cut down their Asherim [symbols of the goddess Asherah];
Exodus,34,14,For you shall worship no other god; for the Lord Whose name is Jealous is a jealous (impassioned) God
Exodus,34,15,Lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and when they play the harlot after their gods and sacrifice to their gods and one invites you you eat of his food sacrificed to idols
Exodus,34,16,And you take of their daughters for your sons and their daughters play the harlot after their gods and make your sons play the harlot after their gods.
Exodus,34,17,You shall make for yourselves no molten gods.
Exodus,34,18,The Feast of Unleavened Bread you shall keep. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread as I commanded you in the time of the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt.
Exodus,34,19,All the males that first open the womb among your livestock are Mine whether ox or sheep.
Exodus,34,20,But the firstling of a donkey [an unclean beast] you shall redeem with a lamb or kid and if you do not redeem it then you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And none of you shall appear before Me empty-handed.

Exodus,34,25,You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover be left until morning.
Exodus,34,26,The first of the firstfruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of the Lord your God. You shall not boil a kid in his mother's milk.
Exodus,34,27,And the Lord said to Moses Write these words for after the purpose and character of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.
Exodus,34,28,Moses was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he ate no bread and drank no water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant the Ten Commandments.
Exodus,34,29,When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tables of the Testimony in his hand he did not know that the skin of his face shone and sent forth beams by reason of his speaking with the Lord.
Exodus,34,30,When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses behold the skin of his face shone and they feared to come near him.
Exodus,34,31,But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him and [he] talked with them.
Exodus,34,32,Afterward all the Israelites came near and he gave them in commandment all the Lord had said to him in Mount Sinai.
Exodus,34,33,And when Moses had finished speaking with them he put a veil on his face.

Exodus,36,7,For the stuff they had was sufficient to do all the work and more.

Leviticus,5,1,IF ANYONE sins in that he is sworn to testify and has knowledge of the matter either by seeing or hearing of it but fails to report it then he shall bear his iniquity and willfulness.
Leviticus,5,2,Or if anyone touches an unclean thing whether the carcass of an unclean wild beast or of an unclean domestic animal or of unclean creeping things that multiply prolifically even if he is unaware of it and he has become unclean he is guilty.
Leviticus,5,3,Or if he touches human uncleanness of whatever kind the uncleanness may be with which he becomes defiled and he is unaware of it when he does know it then he shall be guilty.
Leviticus,5,4,Or if anyone unthinkingly swears he will do something whether to do evil or good whatever it may be that a man shall pronounce rashly taking an oath then when he becomes aware of it he shall be guilty in either of these.
Leviticus,5,5,When a man is guilty in one of these he shall confess the sin he has committed.
Leviticus,5,6,He shall bring his guilt or trespass offering to the Lord for the sin which he has committed a female from the flock a lamb or a goat for a sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement for his sin.

Leviticus,5,8,He shall bring them to the priest who shall offer the one for the sin offering first and wring its head from its neck but shall not sever it;
Leviticus,5,9,And he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering.
Leviticus,5,10,And he shall prepare the second bird for a burnt offering according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin which he has committed and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus,5,11,But if the offender cannot afford to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons then he shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil or frankincense on it for it is a sin offering.
Leviticus,5,12,He shall bring it to the priest who shall take a handful of it as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar on the offerings made by fire to the Lord; it is a sin offering.
Leviticus,5,13,Thus the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed in any of these things and he shall be forgiven; and the remainder shall be for the priest as in the cereal offering.
Leviticus,5,14,And the Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,5,15,If anyone commits a breach of faith and sins unwittingly in the holy things of the Lord he shall bring his trespass or guilt offering to the Lord a ram without blemish out of the flock valued by you in shekels of silver that is the shekel of the sanctuary for a trespass or guilt offering.
Leviticus,5,16,And he shall make restitution for what he has done amiss in the holy thing and shall add a fifth to it and give it to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass or guilt offering and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus,5,17,If anyone sins and does any of the things the Lord has forbidden though he was not aware of it yet he is guilty and shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus,5,18,He shall bring [to the priest] a ram without blemish out of the flock estimated by you to the amount [of the trespass] for a guilt or trespass offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him for the error which he committed unknowingly and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus,5,19,It is a trespass or guilt offering; he is certainly guilty before the Lord.
Leviticus,6,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,6,2,If anyone sins and commits a trespass against the Lord and deals falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit given him to keep or of bargain or pledge or of robbery or has oppressed his neighbor
Leviticus,6,3,Or has found what was lost and lied about it or swears falsely in any of all the things which men do and sin in so doing
Leviticus,6,4,Then if he has sinned and is guilty he shall restore what he took by robbery or what he secured by oppression or extortion or what was delivered him to keep in trust or the lost thing which he found
Leviticus,6,5,Or anything about which he has sworn falsely; he shall not only restore it in full but shall add to it one fifth more and give it to him to whom it belongs on the day of his trespass or guilt offering.
Leviticus,6,6,And he shall bring to the priest his trespass or guilt offering to the Lord a ram without blemish out of the flock valued by you to the amount of his trespass;
Leviticus,6,7,And the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord and he shall be forgiven for anything of all that he may have done by which he has become guilty.
Leviticus,6,8,And the Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,6,9,Command Aaron and his sons saying This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering shall remain on the altar all night until morning; the fire shall be kept burning on the altar.
Leviticus,6,10,And the priest shall put on his linen garment and put his linen breeches on his body and take up the ashes of what the fire has consumed with the burnt offering on the altar and put them beside the altar.
Leviticus,6,11,And he shall put off his garments and put on other garments and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
Leviticus,6,12,And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning on it; it shall not be allowed to go out. The priest shall burn wood on it every morning and lay the burnt offering in order upon it and he shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings.
Leviticus,6,13,The fire shall be burning continually upon the altar; it shall not go out.
Leviticus,6,14,And this is the law of the cereal offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord in front of the altar.
Leviticus,6,15,One of them shall take his handful of the fine flour of the cereal offering the oil of it and all the frankincense which is upon the cereal offering and burn it on the altar as the memorial of it a sweet and satisfying fragrance to the Lord.
Leviticus,6,16,And the remainder of it shall Aaron and his sons eat without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the Tent of Meeting shall they eat it.
Leviticus,6,17,It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of My offerings made by fire; it is most holy like the sin offering and the guilt offering.
Leviticus,6,18,Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it as his portion forever throughout your generations from the Lord's offerings made by fire; whoever touches them shall [first] be holy (consecrated and ceremonially clean).
Leviticus,6,19,And the Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,6,20,This is the offering which Aaron and his sons shall offer to the Lord on the day when one is anointed (and consecrated): the tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a regular cereal offering half of it in the morning and half of it at night.
Leviticus,6,21,On a griddle or baking pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is fried you shall bring it in; in broken and fried pieces shall you offer the cereal offering as a sweet and satisfying odor to the Lord.
Leviticus,6,22,And the priest among Aaron's sons who is consecrated and anointed in his stead shall offer it; by a statute forever it shall be entirely burned to the Lord.
Leviticus,6,23,For every cereal offering of the priest shall be wholly burned and not be eaten.
Leviticus,6,24,And the Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,6,25,Say to Aaron and his sons: This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the Lord; it is most holy.
Leviticus,6,26,The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it; in a sacred place shall it be eaten in the court of the Tent of Meeting.
Leviticus,6,27,Whoever or whatever touches its flesh shall [first] be dedicated and made clean and when any of its blood is sprinkled on a garment you shall wash that garment in a place set apart to God's worship.
Leviticus,6,28,But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken and if it is boiled in a bronze vessel that vessel shall be scoured and rinsed in water.
Leviticus,6,29,Every male among the priests may eat of this offering; it is most holy.
Leviticus,6,30,But no sin offering shall be eaten of which any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place; it shall be [wholly] burned with fire.
Leviticus,7,1,THIS IS the law of the guilt or trespass offering; it is most holy or sacred:
Leviticus,7,2,In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the guilt or trespass offering; the blood of it shall the priest dash against the altar round about.
Leviticus,7,3,And he shall offer all its fat the fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails
Leviticus,7,4,And the two kidneys and the fat that is on them at the loins and the lobe or appendage of the liver which he shall take away with the kidneys.
Leviticus,7,5,And the priest shall burn them on the altar for an offering made by fire to the Lord; it is a guilt or trespass offering.
Leviticus,7,6,Every male among the priests may eat of it; it shall be eaten in a sacred place; it is most holy.
Leviticus,7,7,As is the sin offering so is the guilt or trespass offering; there is one law for them: the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it.
Leviticus,7,8,And the priest who offers any man's burnt offering that priest shall have for himself the hide of the burnt offering which he has offered.
Leviticus,7,9,And every cereal offering that is baked in the oven and all that is prepared in a pan or on a griddle shall belong to the priest who offered it.
Leviticus,7,10,And every cereal offering mixed with oil or dry all the sons of Aaron may have one as well as another.
Leviticus,7,11,And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which shall be offered to the Lord:
Leviticus,7,12,If one offers it for a thanksgiving then he shall offer with the thank offering unleavened cakes mixed with oil and unleavened wafers spread with oil and cakes of fine flour mixed with oil.
Leviticus,7,13,With cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his sacrifice of thanksgiving with the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
Leviticus,7,14,And of it he shall offer one cake from each offering as an offering to the Lord; it shall belong to the priest who dashes the blood of the peace offerings.
Leviticus,7,15,The flesh of the sacrifice of thanksgiving presented as a peace offering shall be eaten on the day that it is offered; none of it shall be left until morning.
Leviticus,7,16,But if the sacrifice of the worshiper's offering is a vow or a freewill offering it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice and on the morrow that which remains of it shall be eaten;
Leviticus,7,17,But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be [wholly] burned with fire.
Leviticus,7,18,If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day then the one who brought it shall not be credited with it; it shall not be accepted. It shall be an abomination and an abhorred thing; the one who eats of it shall bear his iniquity and answer for it.
Leviticus,7,19,The flesh that comes in contact with anything that is not clean shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. As for the meat everyone who is clean [ceremonially] may eat of it.
Leviticus,7,20,But the one who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings that belong to the Lord when he is [ceremonially] unclean that person shall be cut off from his people [deprived of the privileges of association with them].
Leviticus,7,21,And if anyone touches any unclean thing--the uncleanness of man or an unclean beast or any unclean abomination--and then eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of the Lord's peace offerings that person shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus,7,22,And the Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,7,23,Say to the Israelites You shall eat no kind of fat of ox or sheep or goat.
Leviticus,7,24,The fat of the beast that dies of itself and the fat of one that is torn with beasts may be put to any other use but under no circumstances are you to eat of it.
Leviticus,7,25,For whoever eats the fat of the beast from which men offer an offering made by fire to the Lord that person shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus,7,26,Moreover you shall eat no blood of any kind whether of bird or of beast in any of your dwellings.
Leviticus,7,27,Whoever eats any kind of blood that person shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus,7,28,And the Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,7,29,Tell the Israelites He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the Lord shall bring his offering to the Lord; from the sacrifice of his peace offerings
Leviticus,7,30,He shall bring with his own hands the offerings made by fire to the Lord; he shall bring the fat with the breast that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before the Lord.
Leviticus,7,31,The priest shall burn the fat on the altar but the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons.
Leviticus,7,32,And the right thigh you shall give to the priest for an offering from the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
Leviticus,7,33,The son of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh for his portion.
Leviticus,7,34,For I have taken the breast that was waved and the thigh that was offered from the Israelites out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their perpetual due from the Israelites.
Leviticus,7,35,This is the anointing portion of Aaron and his sons out of the offerings to the Lord made by fire on the day when they were presented to minister to the Lord in the priest's office.
Leviticus,7,36,The Lord commanded this to be given them of the Israelites on the day when they were anointed. It is their portion perpetually throughout their generations.
Leviticus,7,37,This is the law of the burnt offering the cereal offering the sin offering the guilt or trespass offering the consecration offering and the sacrifice of peace offerings
Leviticus,7,38,Which the Lord ordered Moses on Mount Sinai on the day He commanded the Israelites to offer their sacrifices to the Lord in the Wilderness of Sinai.
Leviticus,8,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,8,2,Take Aaron and his sons with him and the garments [symbols of their office] and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread;
Leviticus,8,3,And assemble all the congregation at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
Leviticus,8,4,Moses did as the Lord commanded him and the congregation was assembled at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
Leviticus,8,5,Moses told the congregation This is what the Lord has commanded to be done.
Leviticus,8,6,Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.
Leviticus,8,7,He put on Aaron the long undertunic girded him with the long sash clothed him with the robe put the ephod (an upper vestment) upon him and girded him with the skillfully woven cords attached to the ephod binding it to him.
Leviticus,8,8,And Moses put upon Aaron the breastplate; also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim [articles upon which the high priest put his hand when seeking the divine will concerning the nation].
Leviticus,8,9,And he put the turban or miter on his head; on it in front Moses put the shining gold plate the holy diadem as the Lord commanded him.
Leviticus,8,10,And Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it and consecrated them.
Leviticus,8,11,And he sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its utensils and the laver and its base to consecrate them.
Leviticus,8,12,And he poured some of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head and anointed him to consecrate him.
Leviticus,8,13,And Moses brought Aaron's sons and put undertunics on them and girded them with sashes and wound turbans on them as the Lord commanded Moses.
Leviticus,8,14,Then he brought the bull of the sin offering and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.
Leviticus,8,15,Moses killed it and took the blood and put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger and poured the blood at the base of the altar and purified and consecrated the altar to make atonement for it.
Leviticus,8,16,He took all the fat that was on the entrails and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat and Moses burned them on the altar.
Leviticus,8,17,But the bull [the sin offering] and its hide its flesh and its dung he burned with fire outside the camp as the Lord commanded Moses.
Leviticus,8,18,He brought the ram for the burnt offering and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
Leviticus,8,19,And Moses killed it and dashed the blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus,8,20,He cut the ram into pieces and Moses burned the head the pieces and the fat.
Leviticus,8,21,And he washed the entrails and the legs in water; then Moses burned the whole ram on the altar; it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet and satisfying fragrance an offering made by fire to the Lord as the Lord commanded Moses.
Leviticus,8,22,And he brought the other ram the ram of consecration and ordination and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
Leviticus,8,23,And Moses killed it and took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot.
Leviticus,8,24,And he brought Aaron's sons and Moses put some of the blood on the tips of their right ears and the thumbs of their right hands and the great toes of their right feet; and Moses dashed the blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus,8,25,And he took the fat the fat tail all the fat that was on the entrails the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right thigh;
Leviticus,8,26,And out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord he took one unleavened cake a cake of oiled bread and one wafer and put them on the fat and on the right thigh;
Leviticus,8,27,And he put all these in Aaron's hands and his sons' hands and waved them for a wave offering before the Lord.
Leviticus,8,28,Then Moses took these things from their hands and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering as an ordination offering for a sweet and satisfying fragrance an offering made by fire to the Lord.
Leviticus,8,29,And Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering before the Lord; for of the ram of consecration and ordination it was Moses' portion as the Lord commanded Moses.
Leviticus,8,30,And Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments and upon his sons and their garments also; so Moses consecrated Aaron and his garments and his sons and his sons' garments.
Leviticus,8,31,And Moses said to Aaron and his sons Boil the flesh at the door of the Tent of Meeting and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecration and ordination as I commanded saying Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
Leviticus,8,32,And what remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire.
Leviticus,8,33,And you shall not go out of the door of the Tent of Meeting for seven days until the days of your consecration and ordination are ended; for it will take seven days to consecrate and ordain you.
Leviticus,8,34,As has been done this day so the Lord has commanded to do for your atonement.
Leviticus,8,35,At the door of the Tent of Meeting you shall remain day and night for seven days doing what the Lord has charged you to do that you die not; for so I am commanded.
Leviticus,8,36,So Aaron and his sons did all the things which the Lord commanded through Moses.
Leviticus,9,1,ON THE eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel;
Leviticus,9,2,And he said to Aaron Take a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering [each] without blemish and offer them before the Lord.
Leviticus,9,3,And say to the Israelites Take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb both a year old without blemish for a burnt offering
Leviticus,9,4,Also a bull and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the Lord and a cereal offering mixed with oil for today the Lord will appear to you.
Leviticus,9,5,They brought before the Tent of Meeting what Moses [had] commanded; all the congregation drew near and stood before the Lord.
Leviticus,9,6,And Moses said This is the thing which the Lord commanded you to do and the glory of the Lord will appear to you.
Leviticus,9,7,And Moses said to Aaron Draw near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and for the people; and offer the offering of the people and make atonement for them as the Lord commanded.
Leviticus,9,8,So Aaron drew near to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering which was designated for himself.
Leviticus,9,9,The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the altar's base;
Leviticus,9,10,But the fat the kidneys and the lobe of the liver from the sin offering he burned on the altar as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Leviticus,9,11,And the flesh and the hide Aaron burned with fire outside the camp.
Leviticus,9,12,He killed the burnt offering and Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood which he dashed round about upon the altar.
Leviticus,9,13,And they brought the burnt offering to him piece by piece and the head and Aaron burned them upon the altar.
Leviticus,9,14,And he washed the entrails and the legs and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.
Leviticus,9,15,Then Aaron presented the people's offering and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people and killed it and offered it for sin as he did the first sin offering.
Leviticus,9,16,And he presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.
Leviticus,9,17,And Aaron presented the cereal offering and took a handful of it and burned it on the altar in addition to the burnt offering of the morning.
Leviticus,9,18,He also killed the bull and the ram the sacrifice of peace offerings for the people; and Aaron's sons presented to him the blood which he dashed upon the altar round about
Leviticus,9,19,And the fat of the bull and of the ram the fat tail and that which covers the entrails and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver.
Leviticus,9,20,And they put the fat upon the breasts and Aaron burned the fat upon the altar;
Leviticus,9,21,But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before the Lord as Moses commanded.
Leviticus,9,22,Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them and came down [from the altar] after offering the sin offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings.
Leviticus,9,23,Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting and when they came out they blessed the people and the glory of the Lord [the Shekinah cloud] appeared to all the people [as promised].
Leviticus,9,24,Then there came a fire out from before the Lord and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar; and when all the people saw it they shouted and fell on their faces.
Leviticus,10,1,AND NADAB and Abihu the sons of Aaron each took his censer and put fire in it and put incense on it and offered strange and unholy fire before the Lord as He had not commanded them.
Leviticus,10,2,And there came forth fire from before the Lord and killed them and they died before the Lord.
Leviticus,10,3,Then Moses said to Aaron This is what the Lord meant when He said I [and My will not their own] will be acknowledged as hallowed by those who come near Me and before all the people I will be honored. And Aaron said nothing.
Leviticus,10,4,Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan sons of Uzziel uncle of Aaron and said to them Come near carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
Leviticus,10,5,So they drew near and carried them in their undertunics [stripped of their priestly vestments] out of the camp as Moses had said.
Leviticus,10,6,And Moses said to Aaron and Eleazar and Ithamar his sons [the father and brothers of the two priests whom God had slain for offering false fire] Do not uncover your heads or let your hair go loose or tear your clothes lest you die [also] and lest God's wrath should come upon all the congregation; but let your brethren the whole house of Israel bewail the burning which the Lord has kindled.
Leviticus,10,7,And you shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting lest you die for the Lord's anointing oil is upon you. And they did according to Moses' word.
Leviticus,10,8,And the Lord said to Aaron
Leviticus,10,9,Do not drink wine or strong drink you or your sons when you go into the Tent of Meeting lest you die; it shall be a statute forever in all your generations.
Leviticus,10,10,You shall make a distinction and recognize a difference between the holy and the common or unholy and between the unclean and the clean;
Leviticus,10,11,And you are to teach the Israelites all the statutes which the Lord has spoken to them by Moses.
Leviticus,10,12,And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons who were left Take the cereal offering that remains of the offerings of the Lord made by fire and eat it without leaven beside the altar for it is most holy.
Leviticus,10,13,You shall eat it in a sacred place because it is your due and your sons' due from the offerings made by fire to the Lord; for so I am commanded.
Leviticus,10,14,But the breast that is waved and the thigh that is offered you shall eat in a clean place you and your sons and daughters with you; for they are your due and your sons' due given out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the Israelites.
Leviticus,10,15,The thigh that is offered and the breast that is waved they shall bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat to wave for a wave offering before the Lord; and it shall be yours and your sons' with you as a portion or due perpetually as the Lord has commanded.
Leviticus,10,16,And Moses diligently tried to find [what had become of] the goat [that had been offered] for the sin offering and behold it was burned up [as waste]! And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar the sons of Aaron who were left alive and said
Leviticus,10,17,Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the Holy Place? It is most holy; and God has given it to you to bear and take away the iniquity of the congregation to make atonement for them before the Lord.
Leviticus,10,18,Behold the blood of it was not brought within the Holy Place; you should indeed have eaten [the flesh of it] in the Holy Place as I commanded.
Leviticus,10,19,But Aaron said to Moses Behold this very day in which they have [obediently] offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord such [terrible calamities] have befallen me [and them]! If I [and they] had eaten the most holy sin offering today [humbled as we have been by the sin of our kinsmen and God's judgment upon them] would it have been acceptable in the sight of the Lord?
Leviticus,10,20,And when Moses heard that he was pacified.
Leviticus,11,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Leviticus,11,2,Say to the Israelites: These are the animals which you may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.
Leviticus,11,3,Whatever parts the hoof and is cloven-footed and chews the cud any of these animals you may eat.
Leviticus,11,4,Nevertheless these you shall not eat of those that chew the cud or divide the hoof: the camel because it chews the cud but does not divide the hoof; it is unclean to you.
Leviticus,11,5,And the coney or rock badger because it chews the cud but does not divide the hoof; it is unclean to you.
Leviticus,11,6,And the hare because it chews the cud but does not divide the hoof; it is unclean to you.
Leviticus,11,7,And the swine because it divides the hoof and is cloven-footed but does not chew the cud; it is unclean to you.
Leviticus,11,8,Of their flesh you shall not eat and their carcasses you shall not touch; they are unclean to you.
Leviticus,11,9,These you may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales in the waters in the seas and in the rivers these you may eat;
Leviticus,11,10,But all that have not fins and scales in the seas and in the rivers of all the creeping things in the waters and of all the living creatures which are in the waters they are [to be considered] an abomination and abhorrence to you.
Leviticus,11,11,They shall continue to be an abomination to you; you shall not eat of their flesh but you shall detest their carcasses.
Leviticus,11,12,Everything in the waters that has not fins or scales shall be abhorrent and detestable to you.
Leviticus,11,13,These you shall have in abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten for they are detestable: the eagle the ossifrage the ospray
Leviticus,11,14,The kite the whole species of falcon
Leviticus,11,15,Every kind of raven
Leviticus,11,16,The ostrich the nighthawk the sea gull every species of hawk
Leviticus,11,17,The owl the cormorant the ibis
Leviticus,11,18,The swan the pelican the vulture
Leviticus,11,19,The stork all kinds of heron the hoopoe and the bat.
Leviticus,11,20,All winged insects that go upon all fours are to be an abomination to you;
Leviticus,11,21,Yet of all winged insects that go upon all fours you may eat those which have legs above their feet with which to leap on the ground.
Leviticus,11,22,Of these you may eat: the whole species of locust of bald locust of cricket and of grasshopper.
Leviticus,11,23,But all other winged insects which have four feet shall be detestable to you.
Leviticus,11,24,And by [contact with] these you shall become unclean; whoever touches the carcass of them shall be unclean until the evening
Leviticus,11,25,And whoever carries any part of their carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.
Leviticus,11,26,Every beast which parts the hoof but is not cloven-footed or does not chew the cud is unclean to you; everyone who touches them shall be unclean.
Leviticus,11,27,And all that go on their paws among all kinds of four-footed beasts are unclean to you; whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening
Leviticus,11,28,And he who carries their carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.
Leviticus,11,29,These also are unclean to you among the creeping things [that multiply greatly] and creep upon the ground: the weasel the mouse any kind of great lizard
Leviticus,11,30,The gecko the land crocodile the lizard the sand lizard and the chameleon.
Leviticus,11,31,These are unclean to you among all that creep; whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening.
Leviticus,11,32,And upon whatever they may fall when they are dead it shall be unclean whether it is an article of wood or clothing or skin (bottle) or sack any vessel in which work is done; it must be put in water and it shall be unclean until the evening; so it shall be cleansed.
Leviticus,11,33,And every earthen vessel into which any of these [creeping things] falls whatever may be in it shall be unclean and you shall break the vessel.
Leviticus,11,34,Of all the food [in one of these unclean vessels] which may be eaten that on which such water comes shall be unclean and all drink that may be drunk from every such vessel shall be unclean.
Leviticus,11,35,And everything upon which any part of their carcass falls shall be unclean; whether an oven or pan with a lid or hearth for pots it shall be broken in pieces; they are unclean and shall be unclean to you.
Leviticus,11,36,Yet a spring or a cistern or reservoir of water shall be clean; but whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean.
Leviticus,11,37,If a part of their carcass falls on seed which is to be sown it shall be clean;
Leviticus,11,38,But if any water be put on the seed and any part of their carcass falls on it it shall be unclean to you.
Leviticus,11,39,If any animal of which you may eat dies [unslaughtered] he who touches its carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
Leviticus,11,40,And he who eats of its carcass [ignorantly] shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; he also who carries its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.
Leviticus,11,41,And everything that creeps on the ground and [multiplies in] swarms shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus,11,42,Whatever goes on its belly and whatever goes on all fours or whatever has more [than four] feet among all things that creep on the ground and swarm you shall not eat; for they are detestable.
Leviticus,11,43,You shall not make yourselves loathsome and abominable [by eating] any swarming thing that [multiplies by] swarms neither shall you make yourselves unclean with them that you should be defiled by them.
Leviticus,11,44,For I am the Lord your God; so consecrate yourselves and be holy for I am holy; neither defile yourselves with any manner of thing that multiplies in large numbers or swarms.
Leviticus,11,45,For I am the Lord Who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God; therefore you shall be holy for I am holy.
Leviticus,11,46,This is the law of the beast and of the bird and of every living creature that moves in the waters and creeps on the earth and multiplies in large numbers
Leviticus,11,47,To make a difference (a distinction) between the unclean and the clean and between the animal that may be eaten and the animal that may not be eaten.
Leviticus,12,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,12,2,Say to the Israelites If a woman conceives and bears a male child she shall be unclean seven days unclean as during her monthly discomfort.
Leviticus,12,3,And on the eighth day the child shall be circumcised.
Leviticus,12,4,Then she shall remain [separated] thirty-three days to be purified [from her loss] of blood; she shall touch no hallowed thing nor come into the [court of the] sanctuary until the days of her purifying are over.
Leviticus,12,5,But if the child she bears is a girl then she shall be unclean two weeks as in her periodic impurity and she shall remain separated sixty-six days to be purified [from her loss] of blood.
Leviticus,12,6,When the days of her purifying are completed whether for a son or for a daughter she shall bring a lamb a year old for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering to the door of the Tent of Meeting to the priest;
Leviticus,12,7,And he shall offer it before the Lord and make atonement for her and she shall be cleansed from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who has borne a male or a female child.
Leviticus,12,8,If she is unable to bring a lamb [for lack of means] then she shall bring two turtledoves or young pigeons one for a burnt offering the other for a sin offering; the priest shall make atonement for her and she shall be clean.
Leviticus,13,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Leviticus,13,2,When a man has a swelling on his skin a scab or a bright spot and it becomes the disease of leprosy in his skin then he shall be brought to the priest to Aaron or one of his sons.
Leviticus,13,3,The priest shall look at the diseased spot on his skin and if the hair in it has turned white and the disease appears depressed and deeper than his skin it is a leprous disease; and the priest shall examine him and pronounce him unclean.
Leviticus,13,4,If the bright spot is white on his skin not depressed and the hair on it not turned white the priest shall quarantine the person or bind up the spot for seven days.
Leviticus,13,5,And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day and if the disease in his estimation is at a standstill and has not spread in the skin then the priest shall quarantine the person or bind up the spot seven more days.
Leviticus,13,6,And the priest shall examine him again the seventh day and if the diseased part has a more normal color and the disease has not spread in the skin the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only an eruption or a scab; and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
Leviticus,13,7,But if the eruption or scab spreads farther in the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing he shall be seen by the priest again.
Leviticus,13,8,If the priest sees that the eruption or scab is spreading in the skin then he shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy.
Leviticus,13,9,When the disease of leprosy is in a man he shall be brought to the priest;
Leviticus,13,10,And the priest shall examine him and if there is a white swelling in the skin and the hair on it has turned white and there is quick raw flesh in the swelling
Leviticus,13,11,It is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his body and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not bind the spot up for he is unclean.
Leviticus,13,12,But if [supposed] leprosy breaks out in the skin and it covers all the skin of him who has the disease from head to foot wherever the priest looks
Leviticus,13,13,The priest shall examine him; if the [supposed] leprosy covers all his body he shall pronounce him clean of the disease; it is all turned white and he is clean.
Leviticus,13,14,But when the raw flesh appears on him he shall be unclean.
Leviticus,13,15,And the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean; for the raw flesh is unclean; it is leprosy.
Leviticus,13,16,But if the raw flesh turns again and becomes white he shall come to the priest
Leviticus,13,17,And the priest shall examine him and if the diseased part is turned to white again then the priest shall pronounce him clean who had the disease; he is clean.
Leviticus,13,18,And when there is in the skin of the body [the scar of] a boil that is healed
Leviticus,13,19,And in the place of the boil there is a white swelling or a bright spot reddish white and it is shown to the priest
Leviticus,13,20,And if when the priest examines it it looks lower than the skin and the hair on it is turned white the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the disease of leprosy; it has broken out in the boil.
Leviticus,13,21,But if the priest examines it and finds no white hair in it and it is not lower than the skin but appears darker then the priest shall bind it up for seven days.
Leviticus,13,22,If it spreads in the skin [he] shall pronounce him unclean; it is diseased.
Leviticus,13,23,But if the bright spot does not spread it is the scar of the boil and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
Leviticus,13,24,Or if there is any flesh in the skin of which there is a burn by fire and the quick flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot reddish white or white
Leviticus,13,25,Then the priest shall examine it and if the hair in the bright spot is turned white and it appears deeper than the skin it is leprosy broken out in the burn. Therefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the disease of leprosy.
Leviticus,13,26,But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the bright spot and it is not lower than the rest of the skin but is darker then the priest shall bind it up for seven days.
Leviticus,13,27,And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day; if it is spreading in the skin then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy.
Leviticus,13,28,But if the bright spot has not spread but is darker it is a swelling from the burn and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is the scar of the burn.
Leviticus,13,29,When a man or woman has a disease upon the head or in the beard
Leviticus,13,30,The priest shall examine the diseased place; if it appears to be deeper than the skin with yellow thin hair in it the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a mangelike leprosy of the head or beard.
Leviticus,13,31,If the priest examines the spot infected by the mangelike disease and it does not appear deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it the priest shall bind up the spot for seven days.
Leviticus,13,32,On the seventh day the priest shall examine the diseased spot; if the mange has not spread and has no yellow hair in it and does not look deeper than the skin
Leviticus,13,33,Then the patient shall be shaved except the mangelike spot; and the priest shall bind up the spot seven days more.
Leviticus,13,34,On the seventh day the priest shall look at the mangelike spot; if the mange has not spread and looks no deeper than the skin he shall pronounce the patient clean; he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
Leviticus,13,35,But if the mangelike spot spreads in the skin after his cleansing
Leviticus,13,36,Then the priest shall examine him and if the mangelike spot is spread in the skin the priest need not look for the yellow hair; the patient is unclean.
Leviticus,13,37,But if in his estimation the mange is at a standstill and has black hair in it the mangelike disease is healed; he is clean; the priest shall pronounce him clean.
Leviticus,13,38,When a man or a woman has on the skin bright spots even white bright spots
Leviticus,13,39,Then the priest shall look and if the bright spots in the skin are a dull white it is a harmless eruption; he is clean.
Leviticus,13,40,If a man's hair has fallen from his head he is bald but he is clean.
Leviticus,13,41,And if his hair has fallen out from the front of his head he has baldness of the forehead but he is clean.
Leviticus,13,42,But if there is on the bald head or forehead a reddish white diseased spot it is leprosy breaking out on his baldness.
Leviticus,13,43,Then the priest shall examine him and if the diseased swelling is reddish white on his bald head or forehead like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body
Leviticus,13,44,He is a leprous man; he is unclean; the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his disease is on his head.
Leviticus,13,45,And the leper's clothes shall be rent and the hair of his head shall hang loose and he shall cover his upper lip and cry Unclean unclean!
Leviticus,13,46,He shall remain unclean as long as the disease is in him; he is unclean; he shall live alone [and] his dwelling shall be outside the camp.
Leviticus,13,47,The garment also that the disease of leprosy [symbolic of sin] is in whether a wool or a linen garment
Leviticus,13,48,Whether it be in woven or knitted stuff or in the warp or woof of linen or of wool or in a skin or anything made of skin
Leviticus,13,49,If the disease is greenish or reddish in the garment or in a skin or in the warp or woof or in anything made of skin it is the plague of leprosy; show it to the priest.
Leviticus,13,50,The priest shall examine the diseased article and shut it up for seven days.
Leviticus,13,51,He shall examine the disease on the seventh day; if [it] is spread in the garment or in the article whatever service it may be used for the disease is a rotting or corroding leprosy; it is unclean.
Leviticus,13,52,He shall burn the garment whether diseased in warp or woof in wool or linen or anything made of skin; for it is a rotting or corroding leprosy to be burned in the fire.
Leviticus,13,53,But if the priest finds the disease has not spread in the garment in the warp or the woof or in anything made of skin
Leviticus,13,54,Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which the plague is and he shall shut it up seven days more.
Leviticus,13,55,And the priest shall examine the diseased article after it has been washed and if the diseased portion has not changed color though the disease has not spread it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire; it is a rotting or corroding [disease] whether the leprous spot be inside or outside.
Leviticus,13,56,If the priest looks and the diseased portion is less noticeable after it is washed he shall tear it out of the garment or the skin (leather) or out of the warp or woof.
Leviticus,13,57,If it appears still in the garment either in the warp or in the woof or in anything made of skin it is spreading; you shall burn the diseased part with fire.
Leviticus,13,58,But the garment or the woven or knitted stuff or warp or woof or anything made of skin from which the disease departs when you have washed it shall then be washed a second time and be clean.
Leviticus,13,59,This is the law for a leprous disease in a garment of wool or linen either in the warp or woof or in anything made of skin to pronounce it clean or unclean.
Leviticus,14,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,14,2,This shall be the law of the leper on the day when he is to be pronounced clean: he shall be brought to the priest [at a meeting place outside the camp];
Leviticus,14,3,The priest shall go out of the camp [to meet him]; and [he] shall examine him and if the disease is healed in the leper
Leviticus,14,4,Then the priest shall command to take for him who is to be cleansed two living clean birds and cedar wood and scarlet [material] and hyssop.
Leviticus,14,5,And the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over fresh running water.
Leviticus,14,6,As for the living bird he shall take it the cedar wood and the scarlet [material] and the hyssop and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird killed over the running water;
Leviticus,14,7,And he shall sprinkle [the blood] on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times and shall pronounce him clean and shall let go the living bird into the open field.
Leviticus,14,8,He who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes shave off all his hair and bathe himself in water; and he shall be clean. After that he shall come into the camp but stay outside his tent seven days.
Leviticus,14,9,But on the seventh day he shall shave all his hair off his head his beard his eyebrows and his [body]; and he shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water and be clean.
Leviticus,14,10,On the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish and three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a cereal offering mixed with oil and one log of oil.
Leviticus,14,11,And the priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to be cleansed and these things before the Lord at the door of the Tent of Meeting;
Leviticus,14,12,The priest shall take one of the male lambs and offer it for a guilt or trespass offering and the log of oil and wave them for a wave offering before the Lord.
Leviticus,14,13,He shall kill the lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering in the sacred place [the court of the tabernacle]; for as the sin offering is the priest's so is the guilt or trespass offering; it is most holy;
Leviticus,14,14,And the priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt or trespass offering and put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot.
Leviticus,14,15,And the priest shall take some of the log of oil and pour it into the palm of his own left hand;
Leviticus,14,16,And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand and shall sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times before the Lord;
Leviticus,14,17,And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put some on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot on the blood of the guilt or trespass offering [which he has previously placed in each of these places].
Leviticus,14,18,And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour upon the head of him who is to be cleansed and make atonement for him before the Lord.
Leviticus,14,19,And the priest shall offer the sin offering and make atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness and afterward kill the burnt offering [victim].
Leviticus,14,20,And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the cereal offering on the altar; and he shall make atonement for him and he shall be clean.
Leviticus,14,21,If the cleansed leper is poor and cannot afford so much he shall take one lamb for a guilt or trespass offering to be waved to make atonement for him and one tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a cereal offering and a log of oil
Leviticus,14,22,And two turtledoves or two young pigeons such as he can afford one for a sin offering the other for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,14,23,He shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing to the priest at the door of the Tent of Meeting before the Lord.
Leviticus,14,24,And the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt or trespass offering and the log of oil and shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord.
Leviticus,14,25,And he shall kill the lamb of the guilt or trespass offering and the priest shall take some of the blood of the offering and put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot.
Leviticus,14,26,And the priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand
Leviticus,14,27,And shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the Lord.
Leviticus,14,28,The priest shall put some of the oil in his hand on the tip of the right ear of the one to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot on the places where he has put the blood of the guilt offering.
Leviticus,14,29,The rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed to make atonement for him before the Lord.
Leviticus,14,30,And he shall offer one of the turtledoves or of the young pigeons such as he is able to get
Leviticus,14,31,As he can afford one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering together with the cereal offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him who is to be cleansed before the Lord.
Leviticus,14,32,This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy who is not able to get what is required for his cleansing.
Leviticus,14,33,And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Leviticus,14,34,When you have come into the land of Canaan which I give to you for a possession and I put the disease of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession
Leviticus,14,35,Then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest It seems to me there is some sort of disease in my house.
Leviticus,14,36,Then the priest shall command that they empty the house before [he] goes in to examine the disease so that all that is in the house may not be declared unclean; afterward [he] shall go in to see the house.
Leviticus,14,37,He shall examine the disease and if it is in the walls of the house with depressed spots of dark green or dark red appearing beneath [the surface of] the wall
Leviticus,14,38,Then the priest shall go out of the door and shut up the house seven days.
Leviticus,14,39,The priest shall come again on the seventh day and shall look; and if the disease has spread in the walls of the house
Leviticus,14,40,He shall command that they take out the diseased stones and cast them into an unclean place outside the city.
Leviticus,14,41,He shall cause the house to be scraped within round about and the plaster or mortar that is scraped off to be emptied out in an unclean place outside the city.
Leviticus,14,42,And they shall put other stones in the place of those stones and he shall plaster the house with fresh mortar.
Leviticus,14,43,If the disease returns breaking out in the house after he has removed the stones and has scraped and plastered the house
Leviticus,14,44,Then the priest shall come and look and if the disease is spreading in the house it is a rotting or corroding leprosy in the house; it is unclean.
Leviticus,14,45,He shall tear down the house--its stones and its timber and all the plaster or mortar of the house--and shall carry them forth out of the city to an unclean place.
Leviticus,14,46,Moreover he who enters the house during the whole time that it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.
Leviticus,14,47,And he who lies down or eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
Leviticus,14,48,But if the priest inspects it and the disease has not spread after the house was plastered he shall pronounce the house clean because the disease is healed.
Leviticus,14,49,He shall take to cleanse the house two birds cedar wood scarlet [material] and hyssop;
Leviticus,14,50,And he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water
Leviticus,14,51,And he shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet [material] and the living bird and dip them in the blood of the slain bird and in the running water and sprinkle the house seven times.
Leviticus,14,52,And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird the running water the living bird the cedar wood the hyssop and the scarlet [material].
Leviticus,14,53,But he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field; so he shall make atonement for the house and it shall be clean.
Leviticus,14,54,This is the law for all kinds of leprous diseases and mangelike conditions
Leviticus,14,55,For the leprosy of a garment or of a house
Leviticus,14,56,And for a swelling or an eruption or a scab or a bright spot
Leviticus,14,57,To teach when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law of leprosy.
Leviticus,15,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Leviticus,15,2,Say to the Israelites When any man has a running discharge from his body because of his discharge he is unclean.
Leviticus,15,3,This shall be [the law concerning] his uncleanness in his discharge: whether his body runs with his discharge or has stopped [running] it is uncleanness in him.
Leviticus,15,4,Every bed on which the one who has the discharge lies is unclean and everything on which he sits shall be unclean.
Leviticus,15,5,Whoever touches that person's bed shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
Leviticus,15,6,And whoever sits on anything on which he who has the discharge has sat shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
Leviticus,15,7,And he who touches the flesh of him who has the discharge shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
Leviticus,15,8,And if he who has the discharge spits on him who is clean then he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
Leviticus,15,9,And any saddle on which he who has the discharge rides shall be unclean.
Leviticus,15,10,Whoever touches anything that has been under him shall be unclean until evening; and he who carries those things shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,11,Whomever he who has the discharge touches without rinsing his hands in water shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,12,The earthen vessel that he with the discharge touches shall be broken and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.
Leviticus,15,13,When he who has a discharge is cleansed of it he shall count seven days for his purification then wash his clothes bathe in running water and be clean.
Leviticus,15,14,On the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and come before the Lord to the door of the Tent of Meeting and give them to the priest;
Leviticus,15,15,And the priest shall offer them one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering; and [he] shall make atonement for the man before the Lord for his discharge.
Leviticus,15,16,And if any man has a discharge of semen he shall wash all his body in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,17,And every garment and every skin on which the sperm comes shall be washed with water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,18,The woman also with whom a man with emission of semen shall lie they shall both bathe themselves in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,19,And if a woman has a discharge her [regular] discharge of blood of her body she shall be in her impurity or separation for seven days and whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,20,And everything that she lies on in her separation shall be unclean; everything also that she sits on shall be unclean.
Leviticus,15,21,And whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,22,Whoever touches anything she sat on shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,23,And if her flow has stained her bed or anything on which she sat when he touches it he shall be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,24,And if any man lie with her and her impurity be upon him he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.
Leviticus,15,25,And if a woman has an issue of blood for many days not during the time of her separation or if she has a discharge beyond the time of her [regular] impurity all the days of the issue of her uncleanness she shall be as in the days of her impurity; she shall be unclean.
Leviticus,15,26,Every bed on which she lies all the days of her discharge shall be as the bed of her impurity and whatever she sits on shall be unclean as in her impurity.
Leviticus,15,27,And whoever touches those things shall be unclean and shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,28,But if she is cleansed of her discharge then she shall wait seven days and after that she shall be clean.
Leviticus,15,29,And on the eighth day she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at the door of the Tent of Meeting;
Leviticus,15,30,He shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering; and he shall make atonement for her before the Lord for her unclean discharge.
Leviticus,15,31,Thus you shall separate the Israelites from their uncleanness lest they die in their uncleanness by defiling My tabernacle that is in the midst of them.
Leviticus,15,32,This is the law for him who has a discharge and for him who has emissions of sperm being made unclean by it;
Leviticus,15,33,And for her who is sick with her impurity and for any person who has a discharge whether man or woman and for him who lies with her who is unclean.
Leviticus,16,1,AFTER THE death of Aaron's two sons when they drew near before the Lord [offered false fire] and died
Leviticus,16,2,The Lord said to Moses Tell Aaron your brother he must not come at all times into the Holy of Holies within the veil before the mercy seat upon the ark lest he die; for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.
Leviticus,16,3,But Aaron shall come into the holy enclosure in this way: with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,16,4,He shall put on the holy linen undergarment and he shall have the linen breeches upon his body and be girded with the linen girdle or sash and with the linen turban or miter shall he be attired; these are the holy garments; he shall bathe his body in water and then put them on.
Leviticus,16,5,He shall take [at the expense] of the congregation of the Israelites two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,16,6,And Aaron shall present the bull as the sin offering for himself and make atonement for himself and for his house [the other priests].
Leviticus,16,7,He shall take the two goats and present them before the Lord at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
Leviticus,16,8,Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats--one lot for the Lord the other lot for Azazel or removal.
Leviticus,16,9,And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the Lord's lot fell and offer him as a sin offering.
Leviticus,16,10,But the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel or removal shall be presented alive before the Lord to make atonement over him that he may be let go into the wilderness for Azazel (for dismissal).
Leviticus,16,11,Aaron shall present the bull as the sin offering for his own sins and shall make atonement for himself and for his house [the other priests] and shall kill the bull as the sin offering for himself.
Leviticus,16,12,He shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the [bronze] altar before the Lord and his two hands full of sweet incense beaten small and bring it within the veil [into the Holy of Holies]
Leviticus,16,13,And put the incense on the fire [in the censer] before the Lord that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon [the ark of] the Testimony lest he die.
Leviticus,16,14,He shall take of the bull's blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the front [the east side] of the mercy seat and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
Leviticus,16,15,Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering that is for [the sins of] the people and bring its blood within the veil [into the Holy of Holies] and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bull and sprinkle it on the mercy seat and before the mercy seat.
Leviticus,16,16,Thus he shall make atonement for the Holy Place because of the uncleanness of the Israelites and because of their transgressions even all their sins; and so shall he do for the Tent of Meeting that remains among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
Leviticus,16,17,There shall be no man in the Tent of Meeting when the high priest goes in to make atonement in the Holy of Holies [within the veil] until he comes out and has made atonement for his own sins and those of his house [the other priests] and of all the congregation of Israel.
Leviticus,16,18,And he shall go out to the altar [of burnt offering in the court] which is before the Lord and make atonement for it and shall take some of the blood of the bull and of the goat and put it on the horns of the altar round about.
Leviticus,16,19,And he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his fingers seven times and cleanse it and hallow it from the uncleanness of the Israelites.
Leviticus,16,20,And when he has finished atoning for the Holy of Holies and the Tent of Meeting and the altar [of burnt offering] he shall present the live goat;
Leviticus,16,21,And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over him all the iniquities of the Israelites and all their transgressions all their sins; and he shall put them upon the head of the goat [the sin-bearer] and send him away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is timely (ready fit).
Leviticus,16,22,The goat shall bear upon himself all their iniquities carrying them to a land cut off (a land of forgetfulness and separation not inhabited)! And the man leading it shall let the goat go in the wilderness.
Leviticus,16,23,Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting and put off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the Holy of Holies and leave them there;
Leviticus,16,24,And he shall bathe his body with water in a sacred place and put on his garments and come forth and offer his burnt offering and that of the people and make atonement for himself and for them.
Leviticus,16,25,And the fat of the sin offering he shall burn upon the altar.
Leviticus,16,26,The man who led the sin-bearing goat out and let him go for Azazel or removal shall wash his clothes and bathe his body and afterward he may come into the camp.
Leviticus,16,27,The bull and the goat for the sin offering whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy of Holies shall be carried forth without the camp; their skins their flesh and their dung shall be burned with fire.
Leviticus,16,28,And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water and afterward he may come into the camp.
Leviticus,16,29,It shall be a statute to you forever that in the seventh month [nearly October] on the tenth day of the month you shall afflict yourselves [by fasting with penitence and humiliation] and do no work at all either the native-born or the stranger who dwells temporarily among you.
Leviticus,16,30,For on this day atonement shall be made for you to cleanse you; from all your sins you shall be clean before the Lord.
Leviticus,16,31,It is a sabbath of [solemn] rest to you and you shall afflict yourselves [by fasting with penitence and humiliation]; it is a statute forever.
Leviticus,16,32,And the priest who shall be anointed and consecrated to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead shall make atonement wearing the holy linen garments;
Leviticus,16,33,He shall make atonement for the Holy Sanctuary for the Tent of Meeting and for the altar [of burnt offering in the court] and shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
Leviticus,16,34,This shall be an everlasting statute for you that atonement may be made for the Israelites for all their sins once a year. And Moses did as the Lord commanded him.
Leviticus,17,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,17,2,Tell Aaron his sons and all the Israelites This is what the Lord has commanded:
Leviticus,17,3,If any man of the house of Israel kills an ox or lamb or goat in the camp or kills it outside the camp
Leviticus,17,4,And does not bring it to the door of the Tent of Meeting to offer it as an offering to the Lord before the Lord's tabernacle [guilt for shedding] blood shall be imputed to that man; he has shed blood and shall be cut off from among his people.
Leviticus,17,5,This is so that the Israelites rather than offer their sacrifices [to idols] in the open field [where they slew them] may bring them to the Lord at the door of the Tent of Meeting to the priest to offer them as peace offerings to the Lord.
Leviticus,17,6,And the priest shall dash the blood on the altar of the Lord at the door of the Tent of Meeting and burn the fat for a sweet and satisfying fragrance to the Lord.
Leviticus,17,7,So they shall no more offer their sacrifices to goatlike gods or demons or field spirits after which they have played the harlot. This shall be a statute forever to them throughout their generations.
Leviticus,17,8,And you shall say to them Whoever of the house of Israel or of the strangers who dwell temporarily among you offers a burnt offering or sacrifice
Leviticus,17,9,And does not bring it to the door of the Tent of Meeting to offer it to the Lord shall be cut off from among his people.
Leviticus,17,10,Any one of the house of Israel or of the strangers who dwell temporarily among them who eats any kind of blood against that person I will set My face and I will cut him off from among his people [that he may not be included in the atonement made for them].
Leviticus,17,11,For the life (the animal soul) is in the blood and I have given it for you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life [which it represents].
Leviticus,17,12,Therefore I have said to the Israelites No person among you shall eat blood neither shall any stranger who dwells temporarily among you eat blood.
Leviticus,17,13,And any of the Israelites or of the strangers who sojourn among them who takes in hunting any clean beast or bird shall pour out its blood and cover it with dust.
Leviticus,17,14,As for the life of all flesh the blood of it represents the life of it; therefore I said to the Israelites You shall partake of the blood of no kind of flesh for the life of all flesh is its blood. Whoever eats of it shall be cut off.
Leviticus,17,15,And every person who eats what dies of itself or was torn by beasts whether he is native-born or a temporary resident shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until evening; then shall he be clean.
Leviticus,17,16,But if he does not wash his clothes or bathe his body he shall bear his own iniquity [for it shall not be borne by the sacrifice of atonement].
Leviticus,18,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,18,2,Say to the Israelites I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,18,3,You shall not do as was done in the land of Egypt in which you dwelt nor shall you do as is done in the land of Canaan to which I am bringing you; neither shall you walk in their statutes.
Leviticus,18,4,You shall do My ordinances and keep My statutes and walk in them. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,18,5,You shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances which if a man does he shall live by them. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,18,6,None of you shall approach anyone close of kin to him to have sexual relations. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,18,7,The nakedness of your father which is the nakedness of your mother you shall not uncover; she is your mother; you shall not have intercourse with her.
Leviticus,18,8,The nakedness of your father's wife you shall not uncover; it is your father's nakedness.
Leviticus,18,9,You shall not have intercourse with or uncover the nakedness of your sister the daughter of your father or of your mother whether born at home or born abroad.
Leviticus,18,10,You must not have sexual relations with your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter; their nakedness you shall not uncover for they are your own flesh.
Leviticus,18,11,You must not have intercourse with your father's wife's daughter; begotten by your father she is your sister; you shall not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus,18,12,You shall not have intercourse with your father's sister; she is your father's near kinswoman.
Leviticus,18,13,You shall not have sexual relations with your mother's sister for she is your mother's near kinswoman.
Leviticus,18,14,You shall not have intercourse with your father's brother's wife; you shall not approach his wife; she is your aunt.
Leviticus,18,15,You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son's wife; you shall not have intercourse with her.
Leviticus,18,16,You shall not have intercourse with your brother's wife; she belongs to your brother.
Leviticus,18,17,You shall not marry a woman and her daughter nor shall you take her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter to have intercourse; they are [her] near kinswomen; it is wickedness and an outrageous offense.
Leviticus,18,18,You must not marry a woman in addition to her sister to be a rival to her having sexual relations with the second sister when the first one is alive.
Leviticus,18,19,Also you shall not have intercourse with a woman during her [menstrual period or similar] uncleanness.
Leviticus,18,20,Moreover you shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife to defile yourself with her.
Leviticus,18,21,You shall not give any of your children to pass through the fire and sacrifice them to Molech [the fire god] nor shall you profane the name of your God [by giving it to false gods]. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,18,22,You shall not lie with a man as with a woman; it is an abomination.
Leviticus,18,23,Neither shall you lie with any beast and defile yourself with it; neither shall any woman yield herself to a beast to lie with it; it is confusion perversion and degradedly carnal.
Leviticus,18,24,Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways for in all these things the nations are defiled which I am casting out before you.
Leviticus,18,25,And the land is defiled; therefore I visit the iniquity of it upon it and the land itself vomits out her inhabitants.
Leviticus,18,26,So you shall keep My statutes and My ordinances and shall not commit any of these abominations neither the native-born nor any stranger who sojourns among you
Leviticus,18,27,For all these abominations have the men of the land done who were before you and the land is defiled--
Leviticus,18,28,[Do none of these things] lest the land spew you out when you defile it as it spewed out the nation that was before you.
Leviticus,18,29,Whoever commits any of these abominations shall be cut off from among [his] people.
Leviticus,18,30,So keep My charge: do not practice any of these abominable customs which were practiced before you and defile yourselves by them. I am the Lord your God.

Leviticus,19,6,It shall be eaten the same day you offer it and on the day following; and if anything remains until the third day it shall be burned in the fire.
Leviticus,19,7,If it is eaten at all the third day it is loathsome; it will not be accepted.

Leviticus,19,9,And when you reap the harvest of your land you shall not reap your field to its very corners neither shall you gather the fallen ears or gleanings of your harvest.

Leviticus,19,20,And if a man lies carnally with a woman who is a slave betrothed to a husband and not yet ransomed or given her freedom they shall be punished [after investigation]; they shall not be put to death because she was not free;
Leviticus,19,21,But he shall bring his guilt or trespass offering to the Lord to the door of the Tent of Meeting a ram for a guilt or trespass offering.
Leviticus,19,22,The priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt or trespass offering before the Lord for his sin and he shall be forgiven for committing the sin.
Leviticus,19,23,And when you come into the land and have planted all kinds of trees for food then you shall count the fruit of them as inedible and forbidden to you for three years; it shall not be eaten.

Leviticus,19,28,You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead nor print or tattoo any marks upon you; I am the Lord.
Leviticus,19,29,Do not profane your daughter by causing her to be a harlot lest the land fall into harlotry and become full of wickedness.
Leviticus,19,30,You shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,19,31,Turn not to those [mediums] who have familiar spirits or to wizards; do not seek them out to be defiled by them. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,19,32,You shall rise up before the hoary head and honor the face of the old man and [reverently] fear your God. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,19,33,And if a stranger dwells temporarily with you in your land you shall not suppress and mistreat him.

Leviticus,19,37,You shall observe all My statutes and ordinances and do them. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,20,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,20,2,Moreover you shall say to the Israelites Any one of the Israelites or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel who gives any of his children to Molech [the fire god worshiped with human sacrifices] shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
Leviticus,20,3,I also will set My face against that man [opposing him withdrawing My protection from him and excluding him from My covenant] and will cut him off from among his people because he has given of his children to Molech defiling My sanctuary and profaning My holy name.
Leviticus,20,4,And if the people of the land do at all hide their eyes from the man when he gives one of his children [as a burnt offering] to Molech [the fire god] and they overlook it or neglect to take legal action to punish him winking at his sin and do not kill him [as My law requires]
Leviticus,20,5,Then I will set My face against that man and against his family and will cut him off from among their people him and all who follow him to [unfaithfulness to Me and thus] play the harlot after Molech.
Leviticus,20,6,The person who turns to those who have familiar spirits and to wizards [being unfaithful to Israel's Maker Who is her Husband and thus] playing the harlot after them I will set My face against that person and will cut him off from among his people [that he may not be included in the atonement made for them].
Leviticus,20,7,Consecrate yourselves therefore and be holy; for I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,20,8,And you shall keep My statutes and do them. I am the Lord Who sanctifies you.

Leviticus,20,15,And if a man lies carnally with a beast he shall surely be [stoned] to death and you shall slay the beast.
Leviticus,20,16,If a woman approaches any beast and lies carnally with it you shall [stone] the woman and the beast; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.
Leviticus,20,17,If a man takes his sister his father's or his mother's daughter and sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness it is a wicked and shameful thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people; he has had sexual relations with his sister; he shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus,20,18,And if a man shall lie with a woman having her menstrual pains and shall uncover her nakedness he has made naked her fountain and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood; and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.

Leviticus,20,23,You shall not walk in the customs of the nation which I am casting out before you; for they did all these things and therefore I was wearied and grieved by them.
Leviticus,20,24,But I have said to you You shall inherit their land and I will give it to you to possess a land flowing with milk and honey. I am the Lord your God Who has separated you from the peoples.
Leviticus,20,25,You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean and between the unclean fowl and the clean; and you shall not make yourselves detestable with beast or with bird or with anything with which the ground teems or that creeps which I have set apart from you as unclean.

Leviticus,21,2,Except for his near [blood] kin for his mother father son daughter brother
Leviticus,21,3,And for his sister a virgin who is near to him because she has had no husband; for her he may be defiled.

Leviticus,21,5,The priests [like the other Israelite men] shall not shave the crown of their heads or clip off the corners of their beard or make any cuttings in their flesh.
Leviticus,21,6,They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God; for they offer the offerings made by fire to the Lord the bread of their God; therefore they shall be holy.
Leviticus,21,7,They shall not take a wife who is a harlot or polluted or profane or divorced for [the priest] is holy to his God.
Leviticus,21,8,You shall consecrate him therefore for he offers the bread of your God; he shall be holy to you for I the Lord Who sanctifies you am holy.
Leviticus,21,9,The daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire [after being stoned].
Leviticus,21,10,But he who is the high priest among his brethren upon whose head the anointing oil was poured and who is consecrated to put on the [sacred] garments shall not let the hair of his head hang loose or rend his clothes [in mourning]
Leviticus,21,11,Neither shall he go in where any dead body lies nor defile himself [by doing so even] for his father or for his mother;

Leviticus,21,16,And the Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,21,17,Say to Aaron Any one of your sons in their successive generations who has any blemish let him not come near to offer the bread of his God.
Leviticus,21,18,For no man who has a blemish shall approach [God's altar to serve as priest] a man blind or lame or he who has a disfigured face or a limb too long
Leviticus,21,19,Or who has a fractured foot or hand
Leviticus,21,20,Or is a hunchback or a dwarf or has a defect in his eye or has scurvy or itch or scabs or skin trouble or has damaged testicles.
Leviticus,21,21,No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a blemish and is disfigured or deformed shall come near [the altar] to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire. He has a blemish; he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.
Leviticus,21,22,He may eat the bread of his God both of the most holy and of the holy things
Leviticus,21,23,But he shall not come within the veil or come near the altar [of incense] because he has a blemish that he may not desecrate and make unclean My sanctuaries and hallowed things; for I the Lord do sanctify them.
Leviticus,21,24,And Moses told it to Aaron and to his sons and to all the Israelites.
Leviticus,22,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,22,2,Say to Aaron and his sons that they shall stay away from the holy things which the Israelites dedicate to Me that they may not profane My holy name; I am the Lord.
Leviticus,22,3,Tell them Any one of your offspring throughout your generations who goes to the holy things which the Israelites dedicate to the Lord when he is unclean that [priest] shall be cut off from My presence and excluded from the sanctuary; I am the Lord.
Leviticus,22,4,No man of the offspring of Aaron who is a leper or has a discharge shall eat of the holy things [the offerings and the showbread] until he is clean. And whoever touches any person or thing made unclean by contact with a corpse or a man who has had a discharge of semen
Leviticus,22,5,Or whoever touches any dead creeping thing by which he may be made unclean or a man from whom he may acquire uncleanness whatever it may be
Leviticus,22,6,The priest who has touched any such thing shall be unclean until evening and shall not eat of the holy things unless he has bathed with water.
Leviticus,22,7,When the sun is down he shall be clean and afterward may eat of the holy things for they are his food.
Leviticus,22,8,That which dies of itself or is torn by beasts he shall not eat defiling himself with it. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,22,9,The priests therefore shall observe My ordinance lest they bear sin for it and die thereby if they profane it. I am the Lord Who sanctifies them.
Leviticus,22,10,No outsider [not of the family of Aaron] shall eat of the holy thing [which has been offered to God]; a sojourner with the priest or a hired servant shall not eat of the holy thing.
Leviticus,22,11,But if a priest buys a slave with his money the slave may eat of the holy thing and he also who is born in the priest's house; they may eat of his food.
Leviticus,22,12,If a priest's daughter is married to an outsider [not of the priestly tribe] she shall not eat of the offering of the holy things.
Leviticus,22,13,But if a priest's daughter is a widow or divorced and has no child and returns to her father's house as in her youth she shall eat of her father's food; but no stranger shall eat of it.
Leviticus,22,14,And if a man eats unknowingly of the holy thing [which has been offered to God] then he shall add one-fifth of its value to it and repay that amount to the priest for the holy thing.
Leviticus,22,15,The priests shall not profane the holy things the Israelites offer to the Lord
Leviticus,22,16,And so cause them [by neglect of any essential observance] to bear the iniquity when they eat their holy things; for I the Lord sanctify them.
Leviticus,22,17,And the Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,22,18,Say to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites Whoever of the house of Israel and of the foreigners in Israel brings his offering whether to pay a vow or as a freewill offering which is offered to the Lord for a burnt offering
Leviticus,22,19,That you may be accepted you shall offer a male without blemish of the young bulls the sheep or the goats.
Leviticus,22,20,But you shall not offer anything which has a blemish for it will not be acceptable for you.

Leviticus,22,22,Animals blind or made infirm and weak or maimed or having sores or a wen or an itch or scabs you shall not offer to the Lord or make an offering of them by fire upon the altar to the Lord.

Leviticus,22,24,You shall not offer to the Lord any animal which has its testicles bruised or crushed or broken or cut neither sacrifice it in your land.
Leviticus,22,25,Neither shall you offer as the bread of your God any such animals obtained from a foreigner [who may wish to pay respect to the true God] because their defects render them unfit; there is a blemish in them; they will not be accepted for you.
Leviticus,22,26,And the Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,22,27,When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born it shall remain for seven days with its mother; and from the eighth day on it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire to the Lord.
Leviticus,22,28,And whether [the mother] is a cow or a ewe you shall not kill her and her young both in one day.
Leviticus,22,29,And when you sacrifice an offering of thanksgiving to the Lord sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.
Leviticus,22,30,It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall leave none of it until the next day. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,22,31,So shall you heartily accept My commandments and conform your life and conduct to them. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,22,32,Neither shall you profane My holy name [applying it to an idol or treating it with irreverence or contempt or as a byword]; but I will be hallowed among the Israelites. I am the Lord Who consecrates and makes you holy
Leviticus,22,33,Who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord.

Leviticus,23,11,And he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord that you may be accepted; on the next day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it [before the Lord].

Leviticus,23,14,And you shall eat neither bread nor parched grain nor green ears until this same day when you have brought the offering of your God; it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your houses.
Leviticus,23,15,And you shall count from the day after the Sabbath from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering seven Sabbaths; [seven full weeks] shall they be.
Leviticus,23,16,Count fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath; then you shall present a cereal offering of new grain to the Lord.

Leviticus,23,28,And you shall do no work on this day for it is the Day of Atonement to make atonement for you before the Lord your God.
Leviticus,23,29,For whoever is not afflicted [by fasting in penitence and humility] on this day shall be cut off from among his people [that he may not be included in the atonement made for them].

Leviticus,23,38,This is in addition to the Sabbaths of the Lord and besides your gifts and all your vowed offerings and all your freewill offerings which you give to the Lord.
Leviticus,23,39,Also on the fifteenth day of the seventh month [nearly October] when you have gathered in the fruit of the land you shall keep the feast of the Lord for seven days the first day and the eighth day each a Sabbath.
Leviticus,23,40,And on the first day you shall take the fruit of pleasing trees [and make booths of them] branches of palm trees and boughs of thick (leafy) trees and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days.
Leviticus,23,41,You shall keep it as a feast to the Lord for seven days in the year a statute forever throughout your generations; you shall keep it in the seventh month.
Leviticus,23,42,You shall dwell in booths (shelters) for seven days: All native Israelites shall dwell in booths
Leviticus,23,43,That your generations may know that I made the Israelites dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,23,44,Thus Moses declared to the Israelites the set or appointed feasts of the Lord.
Leviticus,24,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,24,2,Command the Israelites that they bring to you pure oil from beaten olives for the light [of the golden lampstand] to cause a lamp to burn continually.
Leviticus,24,3,Outside the veil of the Testimony [between the Holy and the Most Holy Places] in the Tent of Meeting Aaron shall keep it in order from evening to morning before the Lord continually; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
Leviticus,24,4,He shall keep the lamps in order upon the lampstand of pure gold before the Lord continually.
Leviticus,24,5,And you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it; two-tenths of an ephah shall be in each cake [of the showbread or bread of the Presence].
Leviticus,24,6,And you shall set them in two rows six in a row upon the table of pure gold before the Lord.
Leviticus,24,7,You shall put pure frankincense [in a bowl or spoon] beside each row that it may be with the bread as a memorial portion an offering to be made by fire to the Lord.
Leviticus,24,8,Every Sabbath day Aaron shall set the showbread in order before the Lord continually; it is on behalf of the Israelites an everlasting covenant.
Leviticus,24,9,And the bread shall be for Aaron and his sons and they shall eat it in a sacred place for it is for [Aaron] a most holy portion of the offerings to the Lord made by fire a perpetual due [to the high priest].
Leviticus,24,10,Now the son of an Israelite woman whose father was an Egyptian went out among the Israelites and he and a man of Israel quarreled and strove together in the camp.
Leviticus,24,11,The Israelite woman's son blasphemed the Name [of the Lord] and cursed. They brought him to Moses--his mother was Shelomith the daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan.
Leviticus,24,12,And they put him in custody until the will of the Lord might be declared to them.
Leviticus,24,13,And the Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,24,14,Bring him who has cursed out of the camp and let all who heard him lay their hands upon his head; then let all the congregation stone him.
Leviticus,24,15,And you shall say to the Israelites Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.
Leviticus,24,16,And he who blasphemes the Name of the Lord he shall surely be put to death and all the congregation shall certainly stone him; the stranger as well as he who was born in the land shall be put to death when he blasphemes the Name [of the Lord].
Leviticus,24,17,And he who kills any man shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus,24,18,And he who kills a beast shall make it good beast for beast.
Leviticus,24,19,And if a man causes a blemish or disfigurement on his neighbor it shall be done to him as he has done:
Leviticus,24,20,Fracture for fracture eye for eye tooth for tooth; as he has caused a blemish or disfigurement on a man so shall it be done to him.
Leviticus,24,21,He who kills a beast shall replace it; he who kills a man shall be put to death.
Leviticus,24,22,You shall have the same law for the sojourner among you as for one of your own nationality for I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,24,23,Moses spoke to the Israelites and they brought him who had cursed out of the camp and stoned him with stones. Thus the Israelites did as the Lord commanded Moses.
Leviticus,25,1,THE LORD said to Moses on Mount Sinai
Leviticus,25,2,Say to the Israelites When you come into the land which I give you then shall the land keep a sabbath to the Lord.
Leviticus,25,3,For six years you shall sow your field and for six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its fruits.
Leviticus,25,4,But in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land a sabbath to the Lord; you shall neither sow your field nor prune your vineyard.
Leviticus,25,5,What grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap and the grapes on your uncultivated vine you shall not gather for it is a year of rest to the land.
Leviticus,25,6,And the sabbath rest of the [untilled] land shall [in its increase] furnish food for you for your male and female slaves your hired servant and the temporary resident who lives with you
Leviticus,25,7,For your domestic animals also and for the [wild] beasts in your land; all its yield shall be for food.
Leviticus,25,8,And you shall number seven sabbaths or weeks of years for you seven times seven years so the total time of the seven weeks of years shall be forty-nine years.
Leviticus,25,9,Then you shall sound abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month [almost October]; on the Day of Atonement blow the trumpet in all your land.
Leviticus,25,10,And you shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you; and each of you shall return to his ancestral possession [which through poverty he was compelled to sell] and each of you shall return to his family [from whom he was separated in bond service].
Leviticus,25,11,That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; in it you shall not sow or reap and store what grows of itself or gather the grapes of the uncultivated vines.
Leviticus,25,12,For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you; you shall eat the [sufficient] increase of it out of the field.
Leviticus,25,13,In this Year of Jubilee each of you shall return to his ancestral property.
Leviticus,25,14,And if you sell anything to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor you shall not wrong one another.
Leviticus,25,15,According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor. And he shall sell to you according to the number of years [remaining in which you may gather] the crops [before you must restore the property to him].
Leviticus,25,16,If the years [to the next Jubilee] are many you may increase the price and if the years remaining are few you shall diminish the price for the number of the crops is what he is selling to you.
Leviticus,25,17,You shall not oppress and wrong one another but you shall [reverently] fear your God. For I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,25,18,Therefore you shall do and give effect to My statutes and keep My ordinances and perform them and you will dwell in the land in safety.
Leviticus,25,19,The land shall yield its fruit; you shall eat your fill and dwell there in safety.
Leviticus,25,20,And if you say What shall we eat in the seventh year if we are not to sow or gather in our increase?
Leviticus,25,21,Then [this is My answer:] I will command My [special] blessings on you in the sixth year so that it shall bring forth [sufficient] fruit for three years.
Leviticus,25,22,And you shall sow in the eighth year but eat of the old store of produce; until the crops of the ninth year come in you shall eat of the old supply.
Leviticus,25,23,The land shall not be sold into perpetual ownership for the land is Mine; you are [only] strangers and temporary residents with Me.
Leviticus,25,24,And in all the country you possess you shall grant a redemption for the land [in the Year of Jubilee].
Leviticus,25,25,If your brother has become poor and has sold some of his property if any of his kin comes to redeem it he shall [be allowed to] redeem what his brother has sold.
Leviticus,25,26,And if the man has no one to redeem his property and he himself has become more prosperous and has enough to redeem it
Leviticus,25,27,Then let him count the years since he sold it and restore the overpayment to the man to whom he sold it and return to his ancestral possession.
Leviticus,25,28,But if he is unable to redeem it it shall remain in the buyer's possession until the Year of Jubilee when it shall be set free and he may return to it.
Leviticus,25,29,If a man sells a dwelling house in a fortified city he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year he may have the right of redemption.
Leviticus,25,30,And if it is not redeemed within a full year then the house that is in the fortified city shall be made sure permanently and without limitations for him who bought it throughout his generations. It shall not go free in the Year of Jubilee.
Leviticus,25,31,But the houses of the unwalled villages shall be counted with the fields of the country. They may be redeemed and they shall go free in the Year of Jubilee.
Leviticus,25,32,Nevertheless the cities of the Levites the houses in the cities of their possession the Levites may redeem at any time.
Leviticus,25,33,But if a house is not redeemed by a Levite the sold house in the city they possess shall go free in the Year of Jubilee for the houses in the Levite cities are their ancestral possession among the Israelites.
Leviticus,25,34,But the field of unenclosed or pasture lands of their cities may not be sold; it is their perpetual possession.
Leviticus,25,35,And if your [Israelite] brother has become poor and his hand wavers [from poverty sickness or age and he is unable to support himself] then you shall uphold (strengthen relieve) him [treating him with the courtesy and consideration that you would] a stranger or a temporary resident with you [without property] so that he may live [along] with you.
Leviticus,25,36,Charge him no interest or [portion of] increase but fear your God so your brother may [continue to] live along with you.
Leviticus,25,37,You shall not give him your money at interest nor lend him food at a profit.
Leviticus,25,38,I am the Lord your God Who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
Leviticus,25,39,And if your brother becomes poor beside you and sells himself to you you shall not compel him to serve as a bondman (a slave not eligible for redemption)
Leviticus,25,40,But as a hired servant and as a temporary resident he shall be with you; he shall serve you till the Year of Jubilee
Leviticus,25,41,And then he shall depart from you he and his children with him and shall go back to his own family and return to the possession of his fathers.
Leviticus,25,42,For the Israelites are My servants; I brought them out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as bondmen.
Leviticus,25,43,You shall not rule over him with harshness (severity oppression) but you shall [reverently] fear your God.
Leviticus,25,44,As for your bondmen and your bondmaids whom you may have they shall be from the nations round about you of whom you may buy bondmen and bondmaids.
Leviticus,25,45,Moreover of the children of the strangers who sojourn among you of them you may buy and of their families that are with you which they have begotten in your land and they shall be your possession.
Leviticus,25,46,And you shall make them an inheritance for your children after you to hold for a possession; of them shall you take your bondmen always but over your brethren the Israelites you shall not rule one over another with harshness (severity oppression).
Leviticus,25,47,And if a sojourner or stranger with you becomes rich and your [Israelite] brother becomes poor beside him and sells himself to the stranger or sojourner with you or to a member of the stranger's family
Leviticus,25,48,After he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brethren may redeem him:
Leviticus,25,49,Either his uncle or his uncle's son may redeem him or a near kinsman may redeem him; or if he has enough and is able he may redeem himself.
Leviticus,25,50,And [the redeemer] shall reckon with the purchaser of the servant from the year when he sold himself to the purchaser to the Year of Jubilee and the price of his release shall be adjusted according to the number of years. The time he was with his owner shall be counted as that of a hired servant.
Leviticus,25,51,If there remain many years [before the Year of Jubilee] in proportion to them he must refund [to the purchaser] for his release [the overpayment] for his acquisition.
Leviticus,25,52,And if little time remains until the Year of Jubilee he shall count it over with him and he shall refund the proportionate amount for his release.
Leviticus,25,53,And as a servant hired year by year shall he deal with him; he shall not rule over him with harshness (severity oppression) in your sight [make sure of that].
Leviticus,25,54,And if he is not redeemed during these years and by these means then he shall go free in the Year of Jubilee he and his children with him.
Leviticus,25,55,For to Me the Israelites are servants My servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,26,1,YOU SHALL make for yourselves no idols nor shall you erect a graven image pillar or obelisk nor shall you place any figured stone in your land to which or on which to bow down; for I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,26,2,You shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,26,3,If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments and do them
Leviticus,26,4,I will give you rain in due season and the land shall yield her increase and the trees of the field yield their fruit.
Leviticus,26,5,And your threshing [time] shall reach to the vintage and the vintage [time] shall reach to the sowing time and you shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land securely.
Leviticus,26,6,I will give peace in the land; you shall lie down and none shall fill you with dread or make you afraid; and I will clear ferocious (wild) beasts out of the land and no sword shall go through your land.
Leviticus,26,7,And you shall chase your enemies and they shall fall before you by the sword.
Leviticus,26,8,Five of you shall chase a hundred and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight; your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
Leviticus,26,9,For I will be leaning toward you with favor and regard for you rendering you fruitful multiplying you and establishing and ratifying My covenant with you.
Leviticus,26,10,And you shall eat the [abundant] old store of produce long kept and clear out the old [to make room] for the new.
Leviticus,26,11,I will set My dwelling in and among you and My soul shall not despise or reject or separate itself from you.
Leviticus,26,12,And I will walk in and with and among you and will be your God and you shall be My people.
Leviticus,26,13,I am the Lord your God Who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt that you should no more be slaves; and I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect [as free men].
Leviticus,26,14,But if you will not hearken to Me and will not do all these commandments
Leviticus,26,15,And if you spurn and despise My statutes and if your soul despises and rejects My ordinances so that you will not do all My commandments but break My covenant
Leviticus,26,16,I will do this: I will appoint over you [sudden] terror (trembling trouble) even consumption and fever that consume and waste the eyes and make the [physical] life pine away. You shall sow your seed in vain for your enemies shall eat it.
Leviticus,26,17,I [the Lord] will set My face against you and you shall be defeated and slain before your enemies; they who hate you shall rule over you; you shall flee when no one pursues you.
Leviticus,26,18,And if in spite of all this you still will not listen and be obedient to Me then I will chastise and discipline you seven times more for your sins.
Leviticus,26,19,And I will break and humble your pride in your power and I will make your heavens as iron [yielding no answer no blessing no rain] and your earth [as sterile] as brass.
Leviticus,26,20,And your strength shall be spent in vain for your land shall not yield its increase neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.
Leviticus,26,21,If you walk contrary to Me and will not heed Me I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
Leviticus,26,22,I will loose the wild beasts of the field among you which shall rob you of your children destroy your livestock and make you few so that your roads shall be deserted and desolate.
Leviticus,26,23,If by these means you are not turned to Me but determine to walk contrary to Me
Leviticus,26,24,I also will walk contrary to you and I will smite you seven times for your sins.
Leviticus,26,25,And I will bring a sword upon you that shall execute the vengeance [for the breaking] of My covenant; and you shall be gathered together within your cities and I will send the pestilence among you and you shall be delivered into the hands of the enemy.
Leviticus,26,26,When I break your staff of bread and cut off your supply of food ten women shall bake your bread in one oven and they shall ration your bread and deliver it again by weight; and you shall eat and not be satisfied.
Leviticus,26,27,And if in spite of all this you will not listen and give heed to Me but walk contrary to Me
Leviticus,26,28,Then I will walk contrary to you in wrath and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.
Leviticus,26,29,You shall eat the flesh of your sons and of your daughters.
Leviticus,26,30,And I will destroy your high places [devoted to idolatrous worship] and cut down your sun-images and throw your dead bodies upon the [wrecked] bodies of your idols and My soul shall abhor you [with deep and unutterable loathing].
Leviticus,26,31,I will lay your cities waste bring your sanctuaries to desolation and I will not smell the fragrance of your sweet and soothing odors [of offerings made by fire].
Leviticus,26,32,And I will bring the land into desolation and your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it.
Leviticus,26,33,I will scatter you among the nations and draw out [your enemies'] sword after you; and your land shall be desolate and your cities a waste.
Leviticus,26,34,Then shall the land [of Israel have the opportunity to] enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies' land; then shall the land rest to enjoy and receive payments for its sabbaths [divinely ordained for it].
Leviticus,26,35,As long as it lies desolate and waste it shall have rest the rest it did not have in your sabbaths when you dwelt upon it.
Leviticus,26,36,As for those who are left of you I will send dejection (lack of courage a faintness) into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; the sound of a driven leaf shall put them to hasty and tumultuous flight and they shall flee as if from the sword and fall when no one pursues them.
Leviticus,26,37,They shall stumble over one another as if to escape a sword when no one pursues them; and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
Leviticus,26,38,You shall perish among the nations; the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
Leviticus,26,39,And those of you who are left shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away like them.
Leviticus,26,40,But if they confess their own and their fathers' iniquity in their treachery which they committed against Me--and also that because they walked contrary to Me
Leviticus,26,41,I also walked contrary to them and brought them into the land of their enemies--if then their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they then accept the punishment for their iniquity
Leviticus,26,42,Then will I [earnestly] remember My covenant with Jacob My covenant with Isaac and My covenant with Abraham and [earnestly] remember the land.
Leviticus,26,43,But the land shall be left behind them and shall enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them; and they shall accept the punishment for their sins and make amends because they despised and rejected My ordinances and their soul scorned and rejected My statutes.
Leviticus,26,44,And yet for all that when they are in the land of their enemies I will not spurn and cast them away neither will I despise and abhor them to destroy them utterly and to break My covenant with them for I am the Lord their God.
Leviticus,26,45,But I will for their sake [earnestly] remember the covenant with their forefathers whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations that I might be their God. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,26,46,These are the statutes ordinances and laws which the Lord made between Him and the Israelites on Mount Sinai through Moses.
Leviticus,27,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Leviticus,27,2,Say to the Israelites When a man shall make a special vow of persons to the Lord at your valuation
Leviticus,27,3,Then your valuation of a male from twenty years old to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
Leviticus,27,4,And if the person is a female your valuation shall be thirty shekels.
Leviticus,27,5,And if the person is from five years old up to twenty years old then your valuation shall be for the male twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus,27,6,And if a child is from a month up to five years old then your valuation shall be for the male five shekels of silver and for the female three shekels.
Leviticus,27,7,And if the person is from sixty years old and above if it be a male then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus,27,8,But if the man is too poor to pay your valuation then he shall be set before the priest and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him.
Leviticus,27,9,If it is a beast of which men offer an offering to the Lord all that any man gives of such to the Lord shall be holy.
Leviticus,27,10,He shall not replace it or exchange it a good for a bad or a bad for a good; and if he makes any exchange of a beast for a beast then both the original offering and that exchanged for it shall be holy.
Leviticus,27,11,If it is an unclean animal such as is not offered as an offering to the Lord he shall bring the animal before the priest
Leviticus,27,12,And the priest shall value it whether it be good or bad; as you the priest value it so shall it be.
Leviticus,27,13,But if he wishes to redeem it he shall add a fifth to your valuation.
Leviticus,27,14,If a man dedicates his house to be sacred to the Lord the priest shall appraise it whether it be good or bad; as the priest appraises it so shall it stand.
Leviticus,27,15,If he who dedicates his house wants to redeem it he shall add a fifth of your valuation to it and it shall be his.
Leviticus,27,16,And if a man shall dedicate to the Lord some part of a field of his possession then your valuation shall be according to the seed [required] for it; [a sowing of] a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
Leviticus,27,17,If he dedicates his field during the Year of Jubilee it shall stand according to your full valuation.
Leviticus,27,18,But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee then the priest shall count the money value in proportion to the years that remain until the Year of Jubilee and it shall be deducted from your valuation.
Leviticus,27,19,If he who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it then he shall add a fifth of the money of your appraisal to it and it shall remain his.
Leviticus,27,20,But if he does not want to redeem the field or if he has sold it to another man it shall not be redeemed any more.
Leviticus,27,21,But the field when it is released in the Jubilee shall be holy to the Lord as a field devoted [to God or destruction]; the priest shall have possession of it.
Leviticus,27,22,And if a man dedicates to the Lord a field he has bought which is not of the fields of his [ancestral] possession
Leviticus,27,23,The priest shall compute the amount of your valuation for it up to the Year of Jubilee; the man shall give that amount on that day as a holy thing to the Lord.
Leviticus,27,24,In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him of whom it was bought to him to whom the land belonged [as his ancestral inheritance].
Leviticus,27,25,And all your valuations shall be according to the sanctuary shekel; twenty gerahs shall make a shekel.
Leviticus,27,26,But the firstling of the animals since a firstling belongs to the Lord no man may dedicate whether it be ox or sheep. It is the Lord's [already].
Leviticus,27,27,If it be of an unclean animal the owner may redeem it according to your valuation and shall add a fifth to it; or if it is not redeemed then it shall be sold according to your valuation.
Leviticus,27,28,But nothing that a man shall devote to the Lord of all that he has whether of man or beast or of the field of his possession shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to the Lord.
Leviticus,27,29,No one doomed to death [under the claim of divine justice] who is to be completely destroyed from among men shall be ransomed [from suffering the death penalty]; he shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus,27,30,And all the tithe of the land whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree is the Lord's; it is holy to the Lord.
Leviticus,27,31,And if a man wants to redeem any of his tithe he shall add a fifth to it.
Leviticus,27,32,And all the tithe of the herd or of the flock whatever passes under the herdsman's staff [by means of which each tenth animal as it passes through a small door is selected and marked] the tenth shall be holy to the Lord.
Leviticus,27,33,The man shall not examine whether the animal is good or bad nor shall he exchange it. If he does exchange it then both it and the animal substituted for it shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
Leviticus,27,34,These are the commandments which the Lord commanded Moses on Mount Sinai for the Israelites.
Numbers,1,1,THE LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai in the Tent of Meeting on the first day of the second month in the second year after they came out of the land of Egypt saying

Numbers,5,4,The Israelites did so and put them outside the camp; as the Lord said to Moses so the Israelites did.
Numbers,5,5,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,5,6,Say to the Israelites When a man or woman commits any sin that men commit by breaking faith with the Lord and that person is guilty
Numbers,5,7,Then he shall confess the sin which he has committed and he shall make restitution for his wrong in full and add a fifth to it and give it to him whom he has wronged.
Numbers,5,8,But if the man [wronged] has no kinsman to whom the restitution may be made let it be given to the Lord for the priest besides the ram of atonement with which atonement shall be made for the offender.
Numbers,5,9,And every offering of all the holy things of the Israelites which they bring to the priest shall be his.
Numbers,5,10,And every man's hallowed things shall be the priest's; whatever any man gives the priest shall be his.
Numbers,5,11,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,5,12,Say to the Israelites If any man's wife goes astray and commits an offense of guilt against him
Numbers,5,13,And a man lies with her carnally and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband and it is kept secret though she is defiled and there is no witness against her nor was she taken in the act
Numbers,5,14,And if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he is jealous and suspicious of his wife who has defiled herself--or if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he is jealous and suspicious of his wife though she has not defiled herself--
Numbers,5,15,Then shall the man bring his wife to the priest and he shall bring the offering required of her a tenth of an ephah of barley meal; but he shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincense on it [symbols of favor and joy] for it is a cereal offering of jealousy and suspicion a memorial offering bringing iniquity to remembrance.
Numbers,5,16,And the priest shall bring her near and set her before the Lord.
Numbers,5,17,And the priest shall take holy water [probably from the sacred laver] in an earthen vessel and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it in the water.
Numbers,5,18,And the priest shall set the woman before the Lord and let the hair of the woman's head hang loose and put the meal offering of remembrance in her hands which is the jealousy and suspicion offering. And the priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that brings the curse.
Numbers,5,19,Then the priest shall make her take an oath and say to the woman If no man has lain with you and if you have not gone astray to uncleanness with another instead of your husband then be free from any effect of this water of bitterness which brings the curse.
Numbers,5,20,But if you have gone astray and you are defiled some man having lain with you beside your husband
Numbers,5,21,Then the priest shall make the woman take the oath of the curse and say to the woman The Lord make you a curse and an oath among your people when the Lord makes your thigh fall away and your body swell.
Numbers,5,22,May this water that brings the curse go into your bowels and make your body swell and your thigh fall away. And the woman shall say So let it be so let it be.
Numbers,5,23,The priest shall then write these curses in a book and shall wash them off into the water of bitterness;
Numbers,5,24,And he shall cause the woman to drink the water of bitterness that brings the curse and the water that brings the curse shall enter into her [to try her] bitterly.
Numbers,5,25,Then the priest shall take the cereal offering of jealousy and suspicion out of the woman's hand and shall wave the offering before the Lord and offer it upon the altar.
Numbers,5,26,And the priest shall take a handful of the cereal offering as the memorial portion of it and burn it on the altar and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.
Numbers,5,27,And when he has made her drink the water then if she is defiled and has committed a trespass against her husband the curse water which she drank shall be bitterness and cause her body to swell and her thigh to fall away and the woman shall be a curse among her people.
Numbers,5,28,But if the woman is not defiled and is clean then she shall be free [from the curse] and be able to have children.
Numbers,5,29,This is the law of jealousy and suspicion when a wife goes aside to another instead of her husband and is defiled
Numbers,5,30,Or when the spirit of jealousy and suspicion comes upon a man and he is jealous and suspicious of his wife; then shall he set the woman before the Lord and the priest shall execute on her all this law.
Numbers,5,31,The [husband] shall be free from iniquity and guilt and that woman [if guilty] shall bear her iniquity.
Numbers,6,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Numbers,6,2,Say to the Israelites When either a man or a woman shall make a special vow the vow of a Nazirite that is one separated and consecrated to the Lord
Numbers,6,3,He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine or of strong drink and shall drink no grape juice or eat grapes fresh or dried.
Numbers,6,4,All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing produced from the grapevine not even the seeds or the skins.
Numbers,6,5,All the days of the vow of his separation and abstinence there shall no razor come upon his head. Until the time is completed for which he separates himself to the Lord he shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.
Numbers,6,6,All the days that he separates himself to the Lord he shall not go near a dead body.
Numbers,6,7,He shall not make himself unclean for his father mother brother or sister when they die because his separation and abstinence to his God is upon his head.
Numbers,6,8,All the days of his separation and abstinence he is holy to the Lord.
Numbers,6,9,And if any man dies very suddenly beside him and he has defiled his consecrated head then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day shall he shave it.
Numbers,6,10,On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest to the door of the Tent of Meeting
Numbers,6,11,And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering and make atonement for him because he sinned by reason of the dead body. He shall consecrate his head the same day
Numbers,6,12,And he shall consecrate and separate himself to the Lord for the days of his separation and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass or guilt offering; but the previous days shall be void and lost because his separation was defiled.
Numbers,6,13,And this is the law of the Nazirite when the days of his separation and abstinence are fulfilled. He shall be brought to the door of the Tent of Meeting
Numbers,6,14,And he shall offer his gift to the Lord one he-lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering and one ram without blemish for a peace offering
Numbers,6,15,And a basket of unleavened bread cakes of fine flour mingled with oil and wafers of unleavened bread spread with oil and their cereal offering and their drink offering.
Numbers,6,16,And the priest shall present them before the Lord and shall offer the person's sin offering and his burnt offering.
Numbers,6,17,And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offering to the Lord with the basket of unleavened bread; the priest shall offer also its cereal offering and its drink offering.
Numbers,6,18,And the Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the door of the Tent of Meeting and shall take the hair and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.
Numbers,6,19,And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaven the hair of his separation and abstinence.
Numbers,6,20,And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord; they are a holy portion for the priest with the breast that is waved and the thigh or shoulder that is offered; and after that the Nazirite may drink wine.
Numbers,6,21,This is the law for the Nazirite who has made a vow. His offering to the Lord besides what else he is able to afford shall be according to the vow which he has vowed; so shall he do according to the law for his separation and abstinence [as a Nazirite].
Numbers,6,22,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,6,23,Say to Aaron and his sons This is the way you shall bless the Israelites. Say to them
Numbers,6,24,The Lord bless you and watch guard and keep you;
Numbers,6,25,The Lord make His face to shine upon and enlighten you and be gracious (kind merciful and giving favor) to you;
Numbers,6,26,The Lord lift up His [approving] countenance upon you and give you peace (tranquility of heart and life continually).
Numbers,6,27,And they shall put My name upon the Israelites and I will bless them.
Numbers,7,1,ON THE day that Moses had fully completed setting up the tabernacle and had anointed and consecrated it and all its furniture and the altar and all its utensils and had anointed and set them apart for holy use
Numbers,7,2,The princes or leaders of Israel heads of their fathers' houses made offerings. These were the leaders of the tribes and were over those who were numbered.
Numbers,7,3,And they brought their offering before the Lord six covered wagons and twelve oxen; a wagon for each two of the princes or leaders and an ox for each one; and they brought them before the tabernacle.
Numbers,7,4,Then the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,7,5,Accept the things from them that they may be used in doing the service of the Tent of Meeting and give them to the Levites to each man according to his service.

Numbers,8,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Numbers,8,2,Say to Aaron When you set up and light the lamps the seven lamps shall be made to give light in front of the lampstand.
Numbers,8,3,And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps of the lampstand to give light in front of it as the Lord commanded Moses.
Numbers,8,4,And this was the workmanship of the candlestick: beaten or turned gold beaten work [of gold] from its base to its flowers; according to the pattern which the Lord had shown Moses so he made the lampstand.
Numbers,8,5,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,8,6,Take the Levites from among the Israelites and cleanse them.
Numbers,8,7,And thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of purification [water to be used in case of sin] upon them and let them pass a razor over all their flesh and wash their clothes and cleanse themselves.
Numbers,8,8,Then let them take a young bull and its cereal offering of fine flour mixed with oil and another young bull you shall take for a sin offering.
Numbers,8,9,You shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting and you shall assemble the whole Israelite congregation.
Numbers,8,10,And you shall present the Levites before the Lord and the Israelites shall put their hands upon the Levites
Numbers,8,11,And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the Lord as a wave offering from the Israelites and on their behalf that they may do the service of the Lord.
Numbers,8,12,Then the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bulls and you shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the Lord to make atonement for the Levites.
Numbers,8,13,And you shall present the Levites before Aaron and his sons and offer them as a wave offering to the Lord.
Numbers,8,14,Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the Israelites and the Levites shall be Mine [in a very special sense].
Numbers,8,15,And after that the Levites shall go in to do service at the Tent of Meeting when you have cleansed them and offered them as a wave offering.
Numbers,8,16,For they are wholly given to Me from among the Israelites; instead of all who open the womb the firstborn of all the Israelites I have taken the Levites for Myself.
Numbers,8,17,For all the firstborn of the Israelites are Mine both of man and beast; on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt [not of Israel] I consecrated them and set them apart for Myself.
Numbers,8,18,And I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn of the Israelites.
Numbers,8,19,And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the Israelites to do the service of the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting and to make atonement for them that there may be no plague among the Israelites if they should come near the sanctuary.
Numbers,8,20,So Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the Israelites did thus to the Levites; according to all that the Lord commanded Moses concerning [them] so did the Israelites to them.
Numbers,8,21,The Levites cleansed and purified themselves and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as a wave offering before the Lord and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.
Numbers,8,22,And after that the Levites went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting with the attendance of Aaron and his sons; as the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites so did they to them.
Numbers,8,23,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,8,24,This is what applies to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall go in to perform the work of the service of the Tent of Meeting
Numbers,8,25,And at the age of fifty years they shall retire from the warfare of the service and serve no more
Numbers,8,26,But shall help their brethren in the Tent of Meeting [attend to protecting the sacred things from being profaned] but shall do no regular or heavy service. Thus shall you direct the Levites in regard to their duties.
Numbers,9,1,THE LORD said to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt
Numbers,9,2,Let the Israelites keep the Passover at its appointed time.
Numbers,9,3,On the fourteenth day of this month in the evening you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and ordinances you shall keep it.
Numbers,9,4,So Moses told the Israelites they should keep the Passover.
Numbers,9,5,And they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month in the evening in the Wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the Lord commanded Moses so the Israelites did.
Numbers,9,6,And there were certain men who were defiled by touching the dead body of a man so they could not keep the Passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.
Numbers,9,7,Those men said to [Moses] We are defiled by touching the dead body. Why are we prevented from offering the Lord's offering at its appointed time among the Israelites?
Numbers,9,8,And Moses said to them Stand still and I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you.
Numbers,9,9,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,9,10,Say to the Israelites If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of touching a dead body or is far off on a journey still he shall keep the Passover to the Lord.
Numbers,9,11,On the fourteenth day of the second month in the evening they shall keep it and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
Numbers,9,12,They shall leave none of it until the morning nor break any bone of it; according to all the statutes for the Passover they shall keep it.
Numbers,9,13,But the man who is clean and is not on a journey yet does not keep the Passover that person shall be cut off from among his people because he did not bring the Lord's offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear [the penalty of] his sin.
Numbers,9,14,And if a stranger sojourns among you and will keep the Passover to the Lord according to [its] statutes and its ordinances so shall he do; you shall have one statute both for the temporary resident and for him who was born in the land.
Numbers,9,15,And on the day that the tabernacle was erected the cloud [of God's presence] covered the tabernacle that is the Tent of the Testimony; and at evening it was over the tabernacle having the appearance of [a pillar of] fire until the morning.
Numbers,9,16,So it was constantly; the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night.
Numbers,9,17,Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent after that the Israelites journeyed; and in the place where the cloud rested there the Israelites encamped.
Numbers,9,18,At the Lord's command the Israelites journeyed and at [His] command they encamped. As long as the cloud rested upon the tabernacle they remained encamped.
Numbers,9,19,Even when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days the Israelites kept the Lord's charge and did not set out.
Numbers,9,20,And sometimes the cloud was only a few days upon the tabernacle but according to the command of the Lord they remained encamped and at His command they journeyed.
Numbers,9,21,And sometimes the cloud remained [over the tabernacle] from evening only until morning but when the cloud was taken up they journeyed; whether it was taken up by day or by night they journeyed.
Numbers,9,22,Whether it was two days or a month or a longer time that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle dwelling on it the Israelites remained encamped; but when it was taken up they journeyed.
Numbers,9,23,At the command of the Lord they remained encamped and at [His] command they journeyed; they kept the charge of the Lord at the command of the Lord through Moses.
Numbers,10,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Numbers,10,2,Make two trumpets of silver; of hammered or turned work you shall make them that you may use them to call the congregation and for breaking camp.
Numbers,10,3,When they both are blown all the congregation shall assemble before you at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
Numbers,10,4,And if one blast on a single trumpet is blown then the princes or leaders heads of the tribes of Israel shall gather themselves to you.
Numbers,10,5,When you blow an alarm the camps on the east side [of the tabernacle] shall set out.
Numbers,10,6,When you blow an alarm the second time then the camps on the south side shall set out. An alarm shall be blown whenever they are to set out on their journeys.
Numbers,10,7,When the congregation is to be assembled you shall blow [the trumpets in short sharp tones] but not the blast of an alarm.
Numbers,10,8,And the sons of Aaron the priests shall blow the trumpets and the trumpets shall be to you for a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
Numbers,10,9,When you go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresses you then blow an alarm with the trumpets that you may be remembered before the Lord your God and you shall be saved from your enemies.
Numbers,10,10,Also in the day of rejoicing and in your set feasts and at the beginnings of your months you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and your peace offerings; thus they may be a remembrance before your God. I am the Lord your God.
Numbers,10,11,On the twentieth day of the second month in the second year [since leaving Egypt] the cloud [of the Lord's presence] was taken up from over the tabernacle of the Testimony
Numbers,10,12,And the Israelites took their journey by stages out of the Wilderness of Sinai and the [guiding] cloud rested in the Wilderness of Paran.
Numbers,10,13,When the journey was to begin at the command of the Lord through Moses
Numbers,10,14,In the first place went the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah by their companies; and over their host was Nahshon son of Amminadab.
Numbers,10,15,And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Issachar was Nethanel son of Zuar.
Numbers,10,16,And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun was Eliab son of Helon.
Numbers,10,17,When the tabernacle was taken down the sons of Gershon and Merari bearing [it] on their shoulders set out.
Numbers,10,18,The standard of the camp of Reuben set forward by their companies; and over Reuben's host was Elizur son of Shedeur.
Numbers,10,19,And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Simeon was Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai.
Numbers,10,20,And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Gad was Eliasaph son of Deuel.
Numbers,10,21,Then the Kohathites set forward bearing the holy things and the tabernacle was set up before they arrived.
Numbers,10,22,And the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim set forward according to their companies; and over Ephraim's host was Elishama son of Ammihud.
Numbers,10,23,Over the host of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh was Gamaliel son of Pedahzur.
Numbers,10,24,And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Abidan son of Gideoni.
Numbers,10,25,Then the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan which was the rear guard of all the camps set forward according to their companies; and over Dan's host was Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.
Numbers,10,26,And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Asher was Pagiel son of Ochran.
Numbers,10,27,And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali was Ahira son of Enan.
Numbers,10,28,This was the Israelites' order of march by their hosts when they set out.
Numbers,10,29,And Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite Moses' father-in-law We are journeying to the place of which the Lord said I will give it to you. Come with us and we will do you good for the Lord has promised good concerning Israel.
Numbers,10,30,And Hobab said to him I will not go; I will depart to my own land and to my family.
Numbers,10,31,And Moses said Do not leave us I pray you; for you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness and you will serve as eyes for us.
Numbers,10,32,And if you will go with us it shall be that whatever good the Lord does to us the same we will do to you.
Numbers,10,33,They departed from the mountain of the Lord [Mount Sinai] three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them during the three days' journey to seek out a resting-place for them.
Numbers,10,34,The cloud of the Lord was over them by day when they went forward from the camp.
Numbers,10,35,Whenever the ark set out Moses said Rise up Lord; let Your enemies be scattered; and let those who hate You flee before You.
Numbers,10,36,And when it rested he said Return O Lord to the ten thousand thousands in Israel.
Numbers,11,1,AND THE people grumbled and deplored their hardships which was evil in the ears of the Lord and when the Lord heard it His anger was kindled; and the fire of the Lord burned among them and devoured those in the outlying parts of the camp.
Numbers,11,2,The people cried to Moses and when Moses prayed to the Lord the fire subsided.
Numbers,11,3,He called the name of the place Taberah [burning] because the fire of the Lord burned among them.
Numbers,11,4,And the mixed multitude among them [the rabble who followed Israel from Egypt] began to lust greatly [for familiar and dainty food] and the Israelites wept again and said Who will give us meat to eat?
Numbers,11,5,We remember the fish we ate freely in Egypt and without cost the cucumbers melons leeks onions and garlic.
Numbers,11,6,But now our soul (our strength) is dried up; there is nothing at all [in the way of food] to be seen but this manna.
Numbers,11,7,The manna was like coriander seed and its appearance was like that of bdellium [perhaps a precious stone].
Numbers,11,8,The people went about and gathered it and ground it in mills or beat it in mortars and boiled it in pots and made cakes of it; and it tasted like cakes baked with fresh oil.
Numbers,11,9,And when the dew fell on the camp in the night the manna fell with it.
Numbers,11,10,And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families every man at the door of his tent; and the anger of the Lord blazed hotly and in the eyes of Moses it was evil.
Numbers,11,11,And Moses said to the Lord Why have You dealt ill with Your servants? And why have I not found favor in Your sight that You lay the burden of all this people on me?
Numbers,11,12,Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them forth that You should say to me Carry them in your bosom as a nursing father carries the sucking child to the land which You swore to their fathers [to give them]?
Numbers,11,13,Where should I get meat to give to all these people? For they weep before me and say Give us meat that we may eat.
Numbers,11,14,I am not able to carry all these people alone because the burden is too heavy for me.
Numbers,11,15,And if this is the way You deal with me kill me I pray You at once and be granting me a favor and let me not see my wretchedness [in the failure of all my efforts].
Numbers,11,16,And the Lord said to Moses Gather for Me seventy men of the elders of Israel whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; and bring them to the Tent of Meeting and let them stand there with you.
Numbers,11,17,And I will come down and talk with you there; and I will take of the Spirit which is upon you and will put It upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you so that you may not have to bear it yourself alone.
Numbers,11,18,And say to the people Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow and you shall eat meat; for you have wept in the hearing of the Lord saying Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt. Therefore the Lord will give you meat and you shall eat.
Numbers,11,19,You shall not eat one day or two or five or ten or twenty days
Numbers,11,20,But a whole month--until [you are satiated and vomit it up violently and] it comes out at your nostrils and is disgusting to you--because you have rejected and despised the Lord Who is among you and have wept before Him saying Why did we come out of Egypt?
Numbers,11,21,But Moses said The people among whom I am are 600000 footmen [besides all the women and children] and You have said I will give them meat that they may eat a whole month!
Numbers,11,22,Shall flocks and herds be killed to suffice them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be collected to satisfy them?
Numbers,11,23,The Lord said to Moses Has the Lord's hand (His ability and power) become short (thwarted and inadequate)? You shall see now whether My word shall come to pass for you or not.
Numbers,11,24,So Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and set them round about the Tent.
Numbers,11,25,And the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to him and took of the Spirit that was upon him and put It upon the seventy elders; and when the Spirit rested upon them they prophesied [sounding forth the praises of God and declaring His will]. Then they did so no more.
Numbers,11,26,But there remained two men in the camp named Eldad and Medad. The Spirit rested upon them and they were of those who were selected and listed yet they did not go out to the Tent [as told to do] but they prophesied in the camp.
Numbers,11,27,And a young man ran to Moses and said Eldad and Medad are prophesying [sounding forth the praises of God and declaring His will] in the camp.
Numbers,11,28,Joshua son of Nun the minister of Moses one of his chosen men said My lord Moses forbid them!
Numbers,11,29,But Moses said to him Are you envious or jealous for my sake? Would that all the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them!
Numbers,11,30,And Moses went back into the camp he and the elders of Israel.
Numbers,11,31,And there went forth a wind from the Lord and brought quails from the sea and let them fall [so they flew low] beside the camp about a day's journey on this side and on the other side all around the camp about two cubits above the ground.
Numbers,11,32,And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day and caught and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten homers; and they spread them out for themselves round about the camp [to cure them by drying].
Numbers,11,33,While the meat was yet between their teeth before it was consumed the anger of the Lord was kindled against the people and the Lord smote them with a very great plague.
Numbers,11,34,That place was called Kibroth-hattaavah [the graves of sensuous desire] because there they buried the people who lusted whose physical appetite caused them to sin.
Numbers,11,35,The Israelites journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah to Hazeroth where they remained.
Numbers,12,1,NOW MIRIAM and Aaron talked against Moses [their brother] because of his Cushite wife for he had married a Cushite woman.
Numbers,12,2,And they said Has the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? Has He not spoken also by us? And the Lord heard it.
Numbers,12,3,Now the man Moses was very meek (gentle kind and humble) or above all the men on the face of the earth.
Numbers,12,4,Suddenly the Lord said to Moses Aaron and Miriam Come out you three to the Tent of Meeting. And the three of them came out.
Numbers,12,5,The Lord came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the Tent door and called Aaron and Miriam and they came forward.
Numbers,12,6,And He said Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you I the Lord make Myself known to him in a vision and speak to him in a dream.
Numbers,12,7,But not so with My servant Moses; he is entrusted and faithful in all My house.
Numbers,12,8,With him I speak mouth to mouth [directly] clearly and not in dark speeches; and he beholds the form of the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?
Numbers,12,9,And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them and He departed.
Numbers,12,10,And when the cloud departed from over the Tent behold Miriam was leprous as white as snow. And Aaron looked at Miriam and behold she was leprous!
Numbers,12,11,And Aaron said to Moses Oh my lord I plead with you lay not the sin upon us in which we have done foolishly and in which we have sinned.
Numbers,12,12,Let her not be as one dead already half decomposed when he comes out of his mother's womb.
Numbers,12,13,And Moses cried to the Lord saying Heal her now O God I beseech You!
Numbers,12,14,And the Lord said to Moses If her father had but spit in her face should she not be ashamed for seven days? Let her be shut up outside the camp for seven days and after that let her be brought in again.
Numbers,12,15,So Miriam was shut up without the camp for seven days and the people did not journey on until Miriam was brought in again.
Numbers,12,16,Afterward [they] removed from Hazeroth and encamped in the Wilderness of Paran.
Numbers,13,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Numbers,13,2,Send men to explore and scout out [for yourselves] the land of Canaan which I give to the Israelites. From each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man every one a leader or head among them.
Numbers,13,3,So Moses by the command of the Lord sent scouts from the Wilderness of Paran all of them men who were heads of the Israelites.
Numbers,13,4,These were their names: of the tribe of Reuben Shammua son of Zaccur;
Numbers,13,5,Of the tribe of Simeon Shaphat son of Hori;
Numbers,13,6,Of the tribe of Judah Caleb son of Jephunneh;
Numbers,13,7,Of the tribe of Issachar Igal son of Joseph;
Numbers,13,8,Of the tribe of Ephraim Hoshea [that is Joshua] son of Nun;
Numbers,13,9,Of the tribe of Benjamin Palti son of Raphu;
Numbers,13,10,Of the tribe of Zebulun Gaddiel son of Sodi;
Numbers,13,11,Of the tribe of Joseph that is of the tribe of Manasseh Gaddi son of Susi;
Numbers,13,12,Of the tribe of Dan Ammiel son of Gemalli;
Numbers,13,13,Of the tribe of Asher Sethur son of Michael;
Numbers,13,14,Of the tribe of Naphtali Nahbi son of Vophsi;
Numbers,13,15,Of the tribe of Gad Geuel son of Machi.
Numbers,13,16,These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to explore and scout out the land. And Moses called Hoshea son of Nun Joshua.
Numbers,13,17,Moses sent them to scout out the land of Canaan and said to them Get up this way by the South (the Negeb) and go up into the hill country
Numbers,13,18,And see what the land is and whether the people who dwell there are strong or weak few or many
Numbers,13,19,And whether the land they live in is good or bad and whether the cities they dwell in are camps or strongholds
Numbers,13,20,And what the land is whether it is fat or lean whether there is timber on it or not. And be of good courage and bring some of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.
Numbers,13,21,So they went up and scouted through the land from the Wilderness of Zin to Rehob to the entrance of Hamath.
Numbers,13,22,And then went up into the South (the Negeb) and came to Hebron; and Ahiman Sheshai and Talmai [probably three tribes of] the sons of Anak were there. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
Numbers,13,23,And they came to the Valley of Eshcol and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes and they carried it on a pole between two [of them]; they brought also some pomegranates and figs.
Numbers,13,24,That place was called the Valley of Eshcol [cluster] because of the cluster which the Israelites cut down there.
Numbers,13,25,And they returned from scouting out the land after forty days.
Numbers,13,26,They came to Moses and Aaron and to all the Israelite congregation in the Wilderness of Paran at Kadesh and brought them word and showed them the land's fruit.
Numbers,13,27,They told Moses We came to the land to which you sent us; surely it flows with milk and honey. This is its fruit.
Numbers,13,28,But the people who dwell there are strong and the cities are fortified and very large; moreover there we saw the sons of Anak [of great stature and courage].
Numbers,13,29,Amalek dwells in the land of the South (the Negeb); the Hittite the Jebusite and the Amorite dwell in the hill country; and the Canaanite dwells by the sea and along by the side of the Jordan [River].
Numbers,13,30,Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said Let us go up at once and possess it; we are well able to conquer it.
Numbers,13,31,But his fellow scouts said We are not able to go up against the people [of Canaan] for they are stronger than we are.
Numbers,13,32,So they brought the Israelites an evil report of the land which they had scouted out saying The land through which we went to spy it out is a land that devours its inhabitants. And all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.
Numbers,13,33,There we saw the Nephilim [or giants] the sons of Anak who come from the giants; and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight.
Numbers,14,1,AND ALL the congregation cried out with a loud voice and [they] wept that night.
Numbers,14,2,All the Israelites grumbled and deplored their situation accusing Moses and Aaron to whom the whole congregation said Would that we had died in Egypt! Or that we had died in this wilderness!
Numbers,14,3,Why does the Lord bring us to this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and little ones will be a prey. Is it not better for us to return to Egypt?
Numbers,14,4,And they said one to another Let us choose a captain and return to Egypt.
Numbers,14,5,Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of Israelites.
Numbers,14,6,And Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh who were among the scouts who had searched the land rent their clothes
Numbers,14,7,And they said to all the company of Israelites The land through which we passed as scouts is an exceedingly good land.
Numbers,14,8,If the Lord delights in us then He will bring us into this land and give it to us a land flowing with milk and honey.
Numbers,14,9,Only do not rebel against the Lord neither fear the people of the land for they are bread for us. Their defense and the shadow [of protection] is removed from over them but the Lord is with us. Fear them not.
Numbers,14,10,But all the congregation said to stone [Joshua and Caleb] with stones. But the glory of the Lord appeared at the Tent of Meeting before all the Israelites.
Numbers,14,11,And the Lord said to Moses How long will this people provoke (spurn despise) Me? And how long will it be before they believe Me [trusting in relying on clinging to Me] for all the signs which I have performed among them?
Numbers,14,12,I will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and will make of you [Moses] a nation greater and mightier than they.
Numbers,14,13,But Moses said to the Lord Then the Egyptians will hear of it for You brought up this people in Your might from among them.
Numbers,14,14,And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You Lord are in the midst of this people [of Israel] that You Lord are seen face to face and that Your cloud stands over them and that You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.
Numbers,14,15,Now if You kill all this people as one man then the nations that have heard Your fame will say
Numbers,14,16,Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which He swore to give to them therefore He has slain them in the wilderness.
Numbers,14,17,And now I pray You let the power of my Lord be great as You have promised saying
Numbers,14,18,The Lord is long-suffering and slow to anger and abundant in mercy and loving-kindness forgiving iniquity and transgression; but He will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children upon the third and fourth generation.
Numbers,14,19,Pardon I pray You the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your mercy and loving-kindness just as You have forgiven [them] from Egypt until now.
Numbers,14,20,And the Lord said I have pardoned according to your word.
Numbers,14,21,But truly as I live and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord
Numbers,14,22,Because all those men who have seen My glory and My [miraculous] signs which I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness yet have tested and proved Me these ten times and have not heeded My voice
Numbers,14,23,Surely they shall not see the land which I swore to give to their fathers; nor shall any who provoked (spurned despised) Me see it.
Numbers,14,24,But My servant Caleb because he has a different spirit and has followed Me fully I will bring into the land into which he went and his descendants shall possess it.
Numbers,14,25,Now because the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valley tomorrow turn and go into the wilderness by way of the Red Sea.
Numbers,14,26,And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Numbers,14,27,How long will this evil congregation murmur against Me? I have heard the complaints the Israelites murmur against Me.
Numbers,14,28,Tell them As I live says the Lord what you have said in My hearing I will do to you:
Numbers,14,29,Your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness--of all who were numbered of you from twenty years old and upward who have murmured against Me
Numbers,14,30,Surely none shall come into the land in which I swore to make you dwell except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
Numbers,14,31,But your little ones whom you said would be a prey them will I bring in and they shall know the land which you have despised and rejected.
Numbers,14,32,But as for you your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.
Numbers,14,33,And your children shall be wanderers and shepherds in the wilderness for forty years and shall suffer for your whoredoms (your infidelity to your espoused God) until your corpses are consumed in the wilderness.
Numbers,14,34,After the number of the days in which you spied out the land [of Canaan] even forty days for each day a year shall you bear and suffer for your iniquities even for forty years and you shall know My displeasure [the revoking of My promise and My estrangement].
Numbers,14,35,I the Lord have spoken; surely this will I do to all this evil congregation who is gathered together against Me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed [by war disease plagues] and here they shall die.
Numbers,14,36,And the men whom Moses sent to search the land who returned and made all the congregation grumble and complain against him by bringing back a slanderous report of the land
Numbers,14,37,Even those men who brought the evil report of the land died by a plague before the Lord.
Numbers,14,38,But Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh who were among the men who went to search the land lived still.
Numbers,14,39,Moses told [the Lord's] words to all the Israelites and [they] mourned greatly.
Numbers,14,40,And they rose early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain saying Behold we are here and we intend to go up to the place which the Lord has promised for we have sinned.
Numbers,14,41,But Moses said Why now do you transgress the command of the Lord [to turn back by way of the Red Sea] since it will not succeed?
Numbers,14,42,Go not up for the Lord is not among you that you be not struck down before your enemies.
Numbers,14,43,For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you and you shall fall by the sword. Because you have turned away from following after the Lord therefore the Lord will not be with you.
Numbers,14,44,But they presumed to go up to the heights of the hill country; however neither the ark of the covenant of the Lord nor Moses departed out of the camp.
Numbers,14,45,Then the Amalekites came down and the Canaanites who dwelt in that hill country and smote the Israelites and beat them back even as far as Hormah.
Numbers,15,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Numbers,15,2,Say to the Israelites When you come into the land where you are to live which I am giving you
Numbers,15,3,And will make an offering by fire to the Lord from the herd or from the flock a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfill a special vow or as a freewill offering or in your set feasts to make a pleasant and soothing fragrance to the Lord
Numbers,15,4,Then shall he who brings his offering to the Lord bring a cereal offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil.
Numbers,15,5,And a fourth of a hin of wine for the drink offering you shall prepare with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice for each lamb.
Numbers,15,6,Or for a ram you shall prepare for a cereal offering two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil.
Numbers,15,7,And for the drink offering you shall offer a third of a hin of wine for a sweet and pleasing odor to the Lord. of the night.
Numbers,15,8,And when you prepare a bull for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice in fulfilling a special vow or peace offering to the Lord
Numbers,15,9,Then shall one offer with the bull a cereal offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil.
Numbers,15,10,And you shall bring for the drink offering half a hin of wine for an offering made by fire of a pleasant and soothing fragrance to the Lord.
Numbers,15,11,Thus shall it be done for each bull or for each ram or for each of the male lambs or of the kids.
Numbers,15,12,According to the number that you shall prepare so shall you do to everyone according to their number.
Numbers,15,13,All who are native-born shall do these things in this way in bringing an offering made by fire of a sweet and pleasant odor to the Lord.
Numbers,15,14,And if a stranger sojourns with you or whoever may be among you throughout your generations and he wishes to offer an offering made by fire of a pleasing and soothing fragrance to the Lord as you do so shall he do.
Numbers,15,15,There shall be one [and the same] statute [both] for you [of the congregation] and for the stranger who is a temporary resident with you a statute forever throughout your generations: as you are so shall the stranger be before the Lord.
Numbers,15,16,One law and one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you.
Numbers,15,17,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,15,18,Say to the Israelites When you come into the land to which I am bringing you
Numbers,15,19,Then when you eat of the food of the land you shall set apart a portion for a gift to the Lord [called a heave or taken-out offering].
Numbers,15,20,You shall set apart a cake made of the first of your coarse meal as a gift [to the Lord]; as an offering set apart from the threshing floor so shall you lift it out or heave it.
Numbers,15,21,Of the first of your coarse meal you shall give to the Lord a portion for a gift throughout your generations [your heave or lifted-out offering].
Numbers,15,22,When you have erred and have not observed all these commandments which the Lord has spoken to Moses
Numbers,15,23,Even all that the Lord has commanded you through Moses from the day that the Lord gave commandment and onward throughout your generations
Numbers,15,24,Then it shall be if it was done unwittingly or in error without the knowledge of the congregation that all the congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering for a pleasant and soothing fragrance to the Lord with its cereal offering and its drink offering according to the ordinance and one male goat for a sin offering.
Numbers,15,25,And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the Israelites and they shall be forgiven for it was an error and they have brought their offering an offering made by fire to the Lord and their sin offering before the Lord for their error.
Numbers,15,26,And all the congregation of the Israelites shall be forgiven and the stranger who lives temporarily among them because all the people were involved in the error.
Numbers,15,27,And if any person sins unknowingly or unintentionally he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering.
Numbers,15,28,And the priest shall make atonement before the Lord for the person who commits an error when he sins unknowingly or unintentionally to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.
Numbers,15,29,You shall have one law for him who sins unknowingly or unintentionally whether he is native born among the Israelites or a stranger who is sojourning among them.
Numbers,15,30,But the person who does anything [wrong] willfully and openly whether he is native-born or a stranger that one reproaches reviles and blasphemes the Lord and that person shall be cut off from among his people [that the atonement made for them may not include him].
Numbers,15,31,Because he has despised and rejected the word of the Lord and has broken His commandment that person shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.
Numbers,15,32,While the Israelites were in the wilderness they found a man who was gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.
Numbers,15,33,Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation.
Numbers,15,34,They put him in custody because it was not certain or clear what should be done to him.
Numbers,15,35,And the Lord said to Moses The man shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.
Numbers,15,36,And all the congregation brought him without the camp and stoned him to death with stones as the Lord commanded Moses.
Numbers,15,37,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,15,38,Speak to the Israelites and bid them make fringes or tassels on the corners in the borders of their garments throughout their generations and put upon the fringe of the borders or upon the tassel of each corner a cord of blue.
Numbers,15,39,And it shall be to you a fringe or tassel that you may look upon and remember all the commandments of the Lord and do them that you may not spy out and follow after [the desires of] your own heart and your own eyes after which you used to follow and play the harlot [spiritually if not physically]
Numbers,15,40,That you may remember and do all My commandments and be holy to your God.
Numbers,15,41,I am the Lord your God Who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord your God.
Numbers,16,1,NOW KORAH son of Izhar the son of Kohath the son of Levi with Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab and On son of Peleth sons of Reuben took men
Numbers,16,2,And they rose up before Moses with certain of the Israelites 250 princes or leaders of the congregation called to the assembly men well known and of distinction.
Numbers,16,3,And they gathered together against Moses and Aaron and said to them [Enough of you!] You take too much upon yourselves seeing that all the congregation is holy every one of them and the Lord is among them. Why then do you lift yourselves up above the assembly of the Lord?
Numbers,16,4,And when Moses heard it he fell upon his face.
Numbers,16,5,And he said to Korah and all his company In the morning the Lord will show who are His and who is holy and will cause him to come near to Him; him whom He has chosen will He cause to come near to Him.
Numbers,16,6,Do this: Take censers Korah and all your company
Numbers,16,7,And put fire in them and put incense upon them before the Lord tomorrow; and the man whom the Lord chooses shall be holy. You take too much upon yourselves you sons of Levi.
Numbers,16,8,And Moses said to Korah Hear I pray you you sons of Levi:
Numbers,16,9,Does it seem but a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel to bring you near to Himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord and to stand before the congregation to minister to them
Numbers,16,10,And that He has brought you near to Him and all your brethren the sons of Levi with you? Would you seek the priesthood also?
Numbers,16,11,Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against the Lord. And Aaron what is he that you murmur against him?
Numbers,16,12,And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab and they said We will not come up.
Numbers,16,13,Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness but you must also make yourself a prince over us?
Numbers,16,14,Moreover you have not brought us into a land that flows with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you bore out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!
Numbers,16,15,And Moses was very angry and said to the Lord Do not respect their offering! I have not taken one donkey from them nor have I hurt one of them.
Numbers,16,16,And Moses said to Korah You and all your company be before the Lord tomorrow you and they and Aaron.
Numbers,16,17,And let every man take his censer and put incense upon it and bring before the Lord every man his censer 250 censers; you also and Aaron each his censer.
Numbers,16,18,So they took every man his censer and they put fire in them and laid incense upon it and they stood at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron.
Numbers,16,19,Then Korah assembled all the congregation against Moses and Aaron before the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the congregation.
Numbers,16,20,And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Numbers,16,21,Separate yourselves from among this congregation that I may consume them in a moment.
Numbers,16,22,And they fell upon their faces and said O God the God of the spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and will You be angry with all the congregation?
Numbers,16,23,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,16,24,Say to the congregation Get away from around the tents of Korah Dathan and Abiram.
Numbers,16,25,Then Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram and the elders of Israel followed him.
Numbers,16,26,And he said to the congregation Depart I pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest you be consumed in all their sins.
Numbers,16,27,So they got away from around the tents of Korah Dathan and Abiram. And Dathan and Abiram came out and stood in the door of their tents with their wives and their sons and their little ones.
Numbers,16,28,And Moses said By this you shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these works for I do not act of my own accord:
Numbers,16,29,If these men die the common death of all men or if [only] what happens to everyone happens to them then the Lord has not sent me.
Numbers,16,30,But if the Lord causes a new thing [to happen] and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them and they go down alive into Sheol (the place of the dead) then you shall understand that these men have provoked (spurned despised) the Lord!
Numbers,16,31,As soon as he stopped speaking the ground under the offenders split apart
Numbers,16,32,And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households and [Korah and] all [his] men and all their possessions.
Numbers,16,33,They and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol (the place of the dead); and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the assembly.
Numbers,16,34,And all Israel who were round about them fled at their cry for they said Lest the earth swallow us up also.
Numbers,16,35,And fire came forth from the Lord and devoured the 250 men who offered the incense.
Numbers,16,36,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,16,37,Speak to Eleazar son of Aaron the priest that he take up the censers out of the burning and scatter the fire at a distance. For the censers are hallowed--
Numbers,16,38,The censers of these men who have sinned against themselves and at the cost of their own lives. Let the censers be made into hammered plates for a covering of the altar [of burnt offering] for they were used in offering before the Lord and therefore they are sacred. They shall be a sign [of warning] to the Israelites.
Numbers,16,39,Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers with which the Levites who were burned had offered incense and they were hammered into broad sheets for a covering of the [brazen] altar [of burnt offering]
Numbers,16,40,To be a memorial [a warning forever] to the Israelites so that no outsider that is no one not of the descendants of Aaron should come near to offer incense before the Lord lest he become as Korah and as his company as the Lord said to Eleazar through Moses.
Numbers,16,41,But on the morrow all the congregation of the Israelites murmured against Moses and Aaron saying You have killed the people of the Lord.
Numbers,16,42,When the congregation was gathered against Moses and Aaron they looked at the Tent of Meeting and behold the cloud covered it and they saw the Lord's glory.
Numbers,16,43,And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting.
Numbers,16,44,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,16,45,Get away from among this congregation that I may consume them in a moment. And Moses and Aaron fell on their faces.
Numbers,16,46,And Moses said to Aaron Take a censer and put fire in it from off the altar and lay incense on it and carry it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them. For there is wrath gone out from the Lord; the plague has begun!
Numbers,16,47,So Aaron took the burning censer as Moses commanded and ran into the midst of the congregation; and behold the plague was begun among the people; and he put on the incense and made atonement for the people.
Numbers,16,48,And he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed.
Numbers,16,49,Now those who died in the plague were 14700 besides those who died in the matter of Korah.
Numbers,16,50,And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the Tent of Meeting since the plague was stayed.
Numbers,17,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Numbers,17,2,Speak to the Israelites and get from them rods or staves one for each father's house from all their leaders according to their father's houses twelve rods. Write every man's name on his rod.
Numbers,17,3,And you shall write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi [his great-grandfather]. For there shall be one rod for the head of each father's house.
Numbers,17,4,You shall lay them up in the Tent of Meeting before [the ark of] the Testimony where I meet with you.
Numbers,17,5,And the rod of the man whom I choose shall bud and I will make to cease from Me the murmurings of the Israelites which they murmur against you.
Numbers,17,6,And Moses spoke to the Israelites and every one of their leaders gave him a rod or staff one for each leader according to their fathers' houses twelve rods and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
Numbers,17,7,And Moses deposited the rods before the Lord in the Tent of the Testimony.
Numbers,17,8,And the next day Moses went into the Tent of the Testimony and behold the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and brought forth buds and produced blossoms and yielded [ripe] almonds.
Numbers,17,9,Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord to all the Israelites; and they looked and each man took his rod.
Numbers,17,10,And the Lord told Moses Put Aaron's rod back before the Testimony [in the ark] to be kept as a [warning] sign for the rebels; and you shall make an end of their murmurings against Me lest they die.
Numbers,17,11,And Moses did so; as the Lord commanded him so he did.
Numbers,17,12,The Israelites said to Moses Behold we perish we are undone all undone!
Numbers,17,13,Everyone who comes near who comes near the tabernacle of the Lord dies or shall die! Are we all to perish?
Numbers,18,1,AND THE Lord said to Aaron You and your sons and your father's house with you shall bear and remove the iniquity of the sanctuary [that is the guilt for the offenses which the people unknowingly commit when brought into contact with the manifestations of God's presence]. And you and your sons with you shall bear and remove the iniquity of your priesthood [your own unintentional offenses].
Numbers,18,2,And your brethren also of the tribe of Levi the tribe of your [fore]father bring with you that they may be joined to you and minister to you; but only you and your sons with you shall come before the Tent of the Testimony [into the Holy Place where only priests may go and into the Most Holy Place which only the high priest dares enter].
Numbers,18,3,And the Levites shall attend you [as servants] and attend to all the duties of the Tent; only they shall not come near the sacred vessels of the sanctuary or to the brazen altar that they and also you [Aaron] die not.
Numbers,18,4,And they shall be joined to you and attend to the duties of the Tent of Meeting--all the [menial] service of the Tent--and no stranger [no layman anyone who is not a Levite] shall come near you [Aaron and your sons].
Numbers,18,5,And you shall attend to the duties of the sanctuary and attend to the altar [of burnt offering and the altar of incense] that there be no wrath any more upon the Israelites [as in the incident of Korah Dathan and Abiram].
Numbers,18,6,And I behold I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the Israelites; to you they are a gift given to the Lord to do the [menial] service of the Tent of Meeting.
Numbers,18,7,Therefore you and your sons with you shall attend to your priesthood for everything of the altar [of burnt offering and the altar of incense] and [of the Holy of Holies] within the veil and you shall serve. I give you your priesthood as a service of gift. And the stranger [anyone other than Moses or your sons Aaron] who comes near shall be put to death.
Numbers,18,8,And the Lord said to Aaron And I behold I have given you the charge of My heave offerings [whatever is taken out and kept of the offerings made to Me] all the dedicated and consecrated things of the Israelites; to you have I given them [as your portion] and to your sons as a continual allowance forever by reason of your anointing as priests.
Numbers,18,9,This shall be yours of the most holy things reserved from the fire: every offering of the people every cereal offering and sin offering and trespass offering of theirs which they shall render to Me shall be most holy for you [Aaron] and for your sons.
Numbers,18,10,As the most holy thing and in a sacred place shall you eat of it; every male [of your house] shall eat of it. It shall be holy to you.
Numbers,18,11,And this also is yours: the heave offering of their gift with all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I have given them to you and to your sons and to your daughters with you as a continual allowance forever; everyone in your house who is [ceremonially] clean may eat of it.
Numbers,18,12,All the best of the oil and all the best of the [fresh] wine and of the grain the firstfruits of what they give to the Lord to you have I given them.
Numbers,18,13,Whatever is first ripe in the land which they bring to the Lord shall be yours. Everyone who is [ceremonially] clean in your house may eat of it.
Numbers,18,14,Every devoted thing in Israel [everything that has been vowed to the Lord] shall be yours.
Numbers,18,15,Everything that first opens the womb in all flesh which they bring to the Lord whether it be of men or beasts shall be yours. Nevertheless the firstborn of man you shall surely redeem and the firstling of unclean beasts you shall redeem.
Numbers,18,16,And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shall you redeem according to your estimate [of their age] for the fixed price of five shekels in silver according to the shekel of the sanctuary which is twenty gerahs.
Numbers,18,17,But the firstling of a cow or of a sheep or of a goat you shall not redeem. They [as the firstborn of clean beasts belong to God and] are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood upon the altar and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire for a sweet and soothing odor to the Lord.
Numbers,18,18,And the flesh of them shall be yours as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are yours.
Numbers,18,19,All the heave offerings [the lifted-out and kept portions] of the holy things which the Israelites give to the Lord I give to you and to your sons and your daughters with you as a continual debt forever. It is a covenant of salt [that cannot be dissolved or violated] forever before the Lord for you [Aaron] and for your posterity with you.
Numbers,18,20,And the Lord said to Aaron You shall have no inheritance in the land [of the Israelites] neither shall you have any part among them. I am your portion and your inheritance among the Israelites.
Numbers,18,21,And behold I have given the Levites all the tithes in Israel for an inheritance in return for their service which they serve the [menial] service of the Tent of Meeting.
Numbers,18,22,Henceforth the Israelites shall not come near the Tent of Meeting [the covered sanctuary the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies] lest they incur guilt and die.
Numbers,18,23,But the Levites shall do the [menial] service of the Tent of Meeting and they shall bear and remove the iniquity of the people [that is be answerable for the legal pollutions of the holy things and offer the necessary atonements for unintentional offenses in these matters]. It shall be a statute forever in all your generations that among the Israelites the Levites have no inheritance [of land].
Numbers,18,24,But the tithes of the Israelites which they present as an offering to the Lord I have given to the Levites to inherit; therefore I have said to them Among the Israelites they shall have no inheritance. [They have homes and cities and pasturage to use but not to possess as their personal inheritance.]
Numbers,18,25,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,18,26,Moreover you shall say to the Levites When you take from the Israelites the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance then you shall present an offering from it to the Lord even a tenth of the tithe [paid by the people].
Numbers,18,27,And what you lift out and keep [your heave offering] shall be credited to you as though it were the grain of the threshing floor or as the fully ripe produce of the vine.
Numbers,18,28,Likewise you shall also present an offering to the Lord of all your tithes which you receive from the Israelites; and therefore you shall give this heave offering [lifted out and kept] for the Lord to Aaron the priest.
Numbers,18,29,Out of all the gifts to you you shall present every offering due to the Lord of all the best of it even the hallowed part lifted out and held back out of it [for the Levites].
Numbers,18,30,Therefore you shall say to them When you have lifted out and held back the best from it [and presented it to the Lord by giving it to yourselves the Levites] then it shall be counted to [you] the Levites just as if it were the increase of the threshing floor or of the winepress.
Numbers,18,31,And you may eat it in every place you and your households for it is your reward for your service in the Tent of Meeting.
Numbers,18,32,And you shall be guilty of no sin by reason of it when you have lifted out and held back the best of it; neither shall you have polluted the holy things of the Israelites neither shall you die [because of it].
Numbers,19,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Numbers,19,2,This is the ritual of the law which the Lord has commanded: Tell the Israelites to bring you a red heifer without spot in which is no blemish upon which a yoke has never come.
Numbers,19,3,And you shall give her to Eleazar the priest and he shall bring her outside the camp and she shall be slaughtered before him.
Numbers,19,4,Eleazar the priest shall take some of her blood with his finger and sprinkle it toward the front of the Tent of Meeting seven times.
Numbers,19,5,The heifer shall be burned in his sight her skin flesh blood and dung.
Numbers,19,6,And the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet [stuff] and cast them into the midst of the burning heifer.
Numbers,19,7,Then the priest shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water; afterward he shall come into the camp but he shall be unclean until evening.
Numbers,19,8,He who burns the heifer shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water and shall be unclean until evening.
Numbers,19,9,And a man who is clean shall collect the ashes of the heifer and put them outside the camp in a clean place and they shall be kept for the congregation of the Israelites for the water for impurity; it is a sin offering.
Numbers,19,10,And he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. This shall be to the Israelites and to the stranger who sojourns among them a perpetual statute.
Numbers,19,11,He who touches the dead body of any person shall be unclean for seven days.
Numbers,19,12,He shall purify himself with the water for impurity [made with the ashes of the burned heifer] on the third day and on the seventh day he shall be clean. But if he does not purify himself the third day then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
Numbers,19,13,Whoever touches the corpse of any who has died and does not purify himself defiles the tabernacle of the Lord and that person shall be cut off from Israel. Because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still upon him.
Numbers,19,14,This is the law when a man dies in a tent: all who come into the tent and all who are in the tent shall be unclean for seven days.
Numbers,19,15,And every open vessel which has no covering fastened upon it is unclean.
Numbers,19,16,And whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword or a dead body or a bone of a dead man or a grave shall be unclean for seven days.
Numbers,19,17,And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering and the running water shall be put with it in a vessel.
Numbers,19,18,And a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the vessels and upon the persons who were there and upon him who touched the bone or the slain or the naturally dead or the grave.
Numbers,19,19,And the clean person shall sprinkle [the water for purification] upon the unclean person on the third day and on the seventh day and on the seventh day the unclean man shall purify himself and wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean at evening.
Numbers,19,20,But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself that person shall be cut off from among the congregation because he has defiled the sanctuary of the Lord. The water for purification has not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.
Numbers,19,21,And it shall be a perpetual statute to them. He who sprinkles the water for impurity [upon another] shall wash his clothes and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening.
Numbers,19,22,And whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean and anyone who touches it shall be unclean until evening.
Numbers,20,1,AND THE Israelites the whole congregation came into the Wilderness of Zin in the first month. And the people dwelt in Kadesh. Miriam died and was buried there.
Numbers,20,2,Now there was no water for the congregation and they assembled together against Moses and Aaron.
Numbers,20,3,And the people contended with Moses and said Would that we had died when our brethren died [in the plague] before the Lord!
Numbers,20,4,And why have you brought up the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness that we should die here we and our livestock?
Numbers,20,5,And why have you made us come up out of Egypt to bring us into this evil place? It is no place of grain or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates. And there is no water to drink.
Numbers,20,6,Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting and fell on their faces. Then the glory of the Lord appeared to them.
Numbers,20,7,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,20,8,Take the rod and assemble the congregation you and Aaron your brother and tell the rock before their eyes to give forth its water and you shall bring forth to them water out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation and their livestock drink.
Numbers,20,9,So Moses took the rod from before the Lord as He commanded him.
Numbers,20,10,And Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation before the rock and Moses said to them Hear now you rebels; must we bring you water out of this rock?
Numbers,20,11,And Moses lifted up his hand and with his rod he smote the rock twice. And the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their livestock.
Numbers,20,12,And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron Because you did not believe in (rely on cling to) Me to sanctify Me in the eyes of the Israelites you therefore shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.
Numbers,20,13,These are the waters of Meribah [strife] where the Israelites contended with the Lord and He showed Himself holy among them.
Numbers,20,14,And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom saying Thus says your kinsman Israel: You know all the adversity and birth pangs that have come upon us [as a nation]:
Numbers,20,15,How our fathers went down to Egypt; we dwelt there a long time and the Egyptians dealt evilly with us and our fathers.
Numbers,20,16,But when we cried to the Lord He heard us and sent an angel and brought us forth out of Egypt. Now behold we are in Kadesh a city on your country's edge.
Numbers,20,17,Let us pass I pray you through your country. We will not pass through field or vineyard or drink of the water of the wells. We will go along the king's highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed your borders.
Numbers,20,18,But Edom said to him You shall not go through lest I come out against you with the sword.
Numbers,20,19,And the Israelites said to him We will go by the highway and if I and my livestock drink of your water I will pay for it. Only let me pass through on foot nothing else.
Numbers,20,20,But Edom said You shall not go through. And Edom came out against Israel with many people and a strong hand.
Numbers,20,21,Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory so Israel turned away from him.
Numbers,20,22,They journeyed from Kadesh and the Israelites even the whole congregation came to Mount Hor.
Numbers,20,23,And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor on the border of the land of Edom
Numbers,20,24,Aaron shall be gathered to his people. For he shall not enter the land which I have given to the Israelites because you both rebelled against My instructions at the waters of Meribah.
Numbers,20,25,Take Aaron and Eleazar his son and bring them up to Mount Hor.
Numbers,20,26,Strip Aaron of his vestments and put them on Eleazar his son and Aaron shall be gathered to his people and shall die there.
Numbers,20,27,And Moses did as the Lord commanded; and they went up Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
Numbers,20,28,And Moses stripped Aaron of his [priestly] garments and put them on Eleazar his son. And Aaron died there on the mountain top; and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
Numbers,20,29,When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead they wept and mourned for him thirty days all the house of Israel.
Numbers,21,1,WHEN THE Canaanite king of Arad who dwelt in the South (the Negeb) heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim [the route traveled by the spies sent out by Moses] he fought against Israel and took some of them captive.
Numbers,21,2,And Israel vowed a vow to the Lord and said If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand then I will utterly destroy their cities.
Numbers,21,3,And the Lord hearkened to Israel and gave over the Canaanites. And they utterly destroyed them and their cities; and the name of the place was called Hormah [a banned or devoted thing].
Numbers,21,4,And they journeyed from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea to go around the land of Edom and the people became impatient (depressed much discouraged) because [of the trials] of the way.
Numbers,21,5,And the people spoke against God and against Moses Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread neither is there any water and we loathe this light (contemptible unsubstantial) manna.
Numbers,21,6,Then the Lord sent fiery (burning) serpents among the people; and they bit the people and many Israelites died.
Numbers,21,7,And the people came to Moses and said We have sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and against you; pray to the Lord that He may take away the serpents from us. So Moses prayed for the people.
Numbers,21,8,And the Lord said to Moses Make a fiery serpent [of bronze] and set it on a pole; and everyone who is bitten when he looks at it shall live.
Numbers,21,9,And Moses made a serpent of bronze and put it on a pole and if a serpent had bitten any man when he looked to the serpent of bronze [ attentively expectantly with a steady and absorbing gaze] he lived.
Numbers,21,10,And the Israelites journeyed on and encamped at Oboth.
Numbers,21,11,They journeyed from Oboth and encamped at Iye-abarim in the wilderness opposite Moab toward the sunrise.
Numbers,21,12,From there they journeyed and encamped in the Valley of Zared.
Numbers,21,13,From there they journeyed and encamped on the other side of [the river] Arnon which is in the desert or wilderness that extends from the frontier of the Amorites; for [the river] Arnon is the boundary of Moab between Moab and the Amorites.
Numbers,21,14,That is why it is said in the Book of the Wars of the Lord: Waheb in Suphah and the valleys of [the branches of] the Arnon [River]
Numbers,21,15,And the slope of the valleys that stretch toward the site of Ar and find support on the border of Moab.
Numbers,21,16,From there the Israelites went on to Beer [a well] the well of which the Lord had said to Moses Assemble the people together and I will give them water.
Numbers,21,17,Then Israel sang this song Spring up O well! Let all sing to it
Numbers,21,18,The fountain that the princes opened that the nobles of the people hollowed out from their staves. And from the wilderness or desert [Israel journeyed] to Mattanah
Numbers,21,19,And from Mattanah to Nahaliel and from Nahaliel to Bamoth
Numbers,21,20,And from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab to the top of Pisgah which looks down upon Jeshimon and the desert.
Numbers,21,21,And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites saying
Numbers,21,22,Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field or vineyard; we will not drink the water of the wells. We will go by the king's highway until we have passed your border.
Numbers,21,23,But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border. Instead Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel into the wilderness and came to Jahaz and he fought against Israel.
Numbers,21,24,And Israel smote the king of the Amorites with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from the river Arnon to the river Jabbok as far as the Ammonites for the boundary of the Ammonites was strong.
Numbers,21,25,And Israel took all these cities and dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites in Heshbon and in all its towns.
Numbers,21,26,For Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand as far as [the river] Arnon.
Numbers,21,27,That is why those who sing ballads say Come to Heshbon let the city of Sihon be built and established.
Numbers,21,28,For fire has gone out of Heshbon a flame from the city of Sihon; it has devoured Ar of Moab and the lords of the heights of the Arnon.
Numbers,21,29,Woe to you Moab! You are undone O people of [the god] Chemosh! Moab has given his sons as fugitives and his daughters into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.
Numbers,21,30,We have shot them down; Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon and we have laid them waste as far as Nophah which reaches to Medeba.
Numbers,21,31,Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers,21,32,And Moses sent to spy out Jazer and they took its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.
Numbers,21,33,Then they turned and went up by the way of Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan went out against them he and all his people to battle at Edrei.
Numbers,21,34,But the Lord said to Moses Do not fear him for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites who dwelt at Heshbon.
Numbers,21,35,So the Israelites slew Og and his sons and all his people until there was not one left alive And they possessed his land.
Numbers,22,1,THE ISRAELITES journeyed and encamped in the plains of Moab on the east side of the Jordan [River] at Jericho.
Numbers,22,2,And Balak [the king of Moab] son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
Numbers,22,3,And Moab was terrified at the people and full of dread because they were many. Moab was distressed and overcome with fear because of the Israelites.
Numbers,22,4,And Moab said to the elders of Midian Now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us as the ox licks up the grass of the field. So Balak son of Zippor the king of the Moabites at that time
Numbers,22,5,Sent messengers to Balaam [a foreteller of events] son of Beor at Pethor which is by the [Euphrates] River even to the land of the children of his people to say to him There is a people come out from Egypt; behold they cover the face of the earth and they have settled down and dwell opposite me.
Numbers,22,6,Now come I beg of you curse this people for me for they are too powerful for me. Perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land for I know that he whom you bless is blessed and he whom you curse is cursed.
Numbers,22,7,And the elders of Moab and of Midian departed with the rewards of foretelling in their hands; and they came to Balaam and told him the words of Balak.
Numbers,22,8,And he said to them Lodge here tonight and I will bring you word as the Lord may speak to me. And the princes of Moab abode with Balaam [that night].
Numbers,22,9,And God came to Balaam and said What men are these with you?
Numbers,22,10,And Balaam said to God Balak son of Zippor king of Moab has sent to me saying
Numbers,22,11,Behold the people who came out of Egypt cover the face of the earth; come now curse them for me. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them and drive them out.
Numbers,22,12,And God said to Balaam You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people for they are blessed.
Numbers,22,13,And Balaam rose up in the morning and said to the princes of Balak Go back to your own land for the Lord refuses to permit me to go with you.
Numbers,22,14,So the princes of Moab rose up and went to Balak and said Balaam refuses to come with us.
Numbers,22,15,Then Balak again sent princes more of them and more honorable than the first ones.
Numbers,22,16,And they came to Balaam and said to him Thus says Balak son of Zippor I beg of you let nothing hinder you from coming to me.
Numbers,22,17,For I will promote you to very great honor and I will do whatever you tell me; so come I beg of you curse this people for me.
Numbers,22,18,And Balaam answered the servants of Balak If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God to do less or more.
Numbers,22,19,Now therefore I pray you tarry here again tonight that I may know what more the Lord will say to me.
Numbers,22,20,And God came to Balaam at night and said to him If the men come to call you rise up and go with them but still only what I tell you may you do.
Numbers,22,21,And Balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab.
Numbers,22,22,And God's anger was kindled because he went and the Angel of the Lord stood in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his donkey and his two servants were with him.
Numbers,22,23,And the donkey saw the Angel of the Lord standing in the way and His sword drawn in His hand and the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey to turn her into the way.
Numbers,22,24,But the Angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyards a wall on this side and a wall on that side.
Numbers,22,25,And when the donkey saw the Angel of the Lord she thrust herself against the wall and crushed Balaam's foot against it and he struck her again.
Numbers,22,26,And the Angel of the Lord went further and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
Numbers,22,27,And when the donkey saw the Angel of the Lord she fell down under Balaam and Balaam's anger was kindled and he struck the donkey with his staff.
Numbers,22,28,And the Lord opened the mouth of the donkey and she said to Balaam What have I done to you that you should strike me these three times?
Numbers,22,29,And Balaam said to the donkey Because you have ridiculed and provoked me! I wish there were a sword in my hand for now I would kill you!
Numbers,22,30,And the donkey said to Balaam Am not I your donkey upon which you have ridden all your life long until this day? Was I ever accustomed to do so to you? And he said No.
Numbers,22,31,Then the Lord opened Balaam's eyes and he saw the Angel of the Lord standing in the way with His sword drawn in His hand; and he bowed his head and fell on his face.
Numbers,22,32,And the Angel of the Lord said to him Why have you struck your donkey these three times? See I came out to stand against and resist you for your behavior is willfully obstinate and contrary before Me.
Numbers,22,33,And the ass saw Me and turned from Me these three times. If she had not turned from Me surely I would have slain you and saved her alive.
Numbers,22,34,Balaam said to the Angel of the Lord I have sinned for I did not know You stood in the way against me. But now if my going displeases You I will return.
Numbers,22,35,The Angel of the Lord said to Balaam Go with the men but you shall speak only what I tell you. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
Numbers,22,36,When Balak heard that Balaam had come he went out to meet him at the city of Moab on the border formed by the Arnon [River] at the farthest end of the boundary.
Numbers,22,37,Balak said to Balaam Did I not [earnestly] send to you to ask you [to come] to me? Why did you not come? Am not I able to promote you to honor?
Numbers,22,38,And Balaam said to Balak Indeed I have come to you but do I now have any power at all to say anything? The word that God puts in my mouth that shall I speak.
Numbers,22,39,And Balaam went with Balak and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.
Numbers,22,40,And Balak offered oxen and sheep and sent [portions] to Balaam and to the princes who were with him.
Numbers,22,41,And on the following day Balak took Balaam and brought him up into the high places of Bamoth-baal; from there he saw the nearest of the Israelites.
Numbers,23,1,AND BALAAM said to Balak Build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.
Numbers,23,2,And Balak did as Balaam had spoken and Balak and Balaam offered on each altar a bull and a ram.
Numbers,23,3,And Balaam said to Balak Stand by your burnt offering and I will go. Perhaps the Lord will come to meet me; and whatever He shows me I will tell you. And he went to a bare height.
Numbers,23,4,God met Balaam who said to Him I have prepared seven altars and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram.
Numbers,23,5,And the Lord put a speech in Balaam's mouth and said Return to Balak and thus shall you speak.
Numbers,23,6,Balaam returned to Balak who was standing by his burnt sacrifice he and all the princes of Moab.
Numbers,23,7,Balaam took up his [figurative] speech and said: Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram out of the mountains of the east saying Come curse Jacob for me; and come violently denounce Israel.
Numbers,23,8,How can I curse those God has not cursed? Or how can I [violently] denounce those the Lord has not denounced?
Numbers,23,9,For from the top of the rocks I see Israel and from the hills I behold him. Behold the people [of Israel] shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned and esteemed among the nations.
Numbers,23,10,Who can count the dust (the descendants) of Jacob and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous [those who are upright and in right standing with God] and let my last end be like theirs!
Numbers,23,11,And Balak said to Balaam What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies and here you have [thoroughly] blessed them instead!
Numbers,23,12,And Balaam answered Must I not be obedient and speak what the Lord has put in my mouth?
Numbers,23,13,Balak said to him Come with me I implore you to another place from which you can see them though you will see only the nearest and not all of them; and curse them for me from there.
Numbers,23,14,So he took Balaam into the field of Zophim to the top of [Mount] Pisgah and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
Numbers,23,15,Balaam said to Balak Stand here by your burnt offering while I go to meet the Lord yonder.
Numbers,23,16,And the Lord met Balaam and put a speech in his mouth and said Go again to Balak and speak thus.
Numbers,23,17,And when he returned to Balak he was standing beside his burnt offering and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him What has the Lord said?
Numbers,23,18,Balaam took up his [figurative] discourse and said: Rise up Balak and hear; listen [closely] to me son of Zippor.
Numbers,23,19,God is not a man that He should tell or act a lie neither the son of man that He should feel repentance or compunction [for what He has promised]. Has He said and shall He not do it? Or has He spoken and shall He not make it good?
Numbers,23,20,You see I have received His command to bless Israel. He has blessed and I cannot reverse or qualify it.
Numbers,23,21,[God] has not beheld iniquity in Jacob [for he is forgiven] neither has He seen mischief or perverseness in Israel [for the same reason]. The Lord their God is with Israel and the shout of praise to their King is among the people.
Numbers,23,22,God brought them forth out of Egypt; they have as it were the strength of a wild ox.
Numbers,23,23,Surely there is no enchantment with or against Jacob neither is there any divination with or against Israel. [In due season and even] now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel What has God wrought!
Numbers,23,24,Behold a people! They rise up as a lioness and lift themselves up as a lion; he shall not lie down until he devours the prey and drinks the blood of the slain.
Numbers,23,25,And Balak said to Balaam Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all.
Numbers,23,26,But Balaam answered Balak Did I not say to you All the Lord speaks that I must do?
Numbers,23,27,And Balak said to Balaam Come I implore you; I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there.
Numbers,23,28,So Balak brought Balaam to the top of [Mount] Peor that overlooks [the wilderness or desert] Jeshimon.
Numbers,23,29,And Balaam said to Balak Build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams.
Numbers,23,30,And Balak did as Balaam had said and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
Numbers,24,1,WHEN BALAAM saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel he did not go as he had done each time before [superstitiously] to meet with omens and signs in the natural world but he set his face toward the wilderness or desert.
Numbers,24,2,And Balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw Israel abiding in their tents according to their tribes. And the Spirit of God came upon him
Numbers,24,3,And he took up his [figurative] discourse and said: Balaam son of Beor the man whose eye is opened [at last to see clearly the purposes and will of God]
Numbers,24,4,He [Balaam] who hears the words of God who sees the vision of the Almighty falling down but having his eyes open and uncovered he says:
Numbers,24,5,How attractive and considerable are your tents O Jacob and your tabernacles O Israel!
Numbers,24,6,As valleys are they spread forth as gardens by the riverside as [rare spice] of lignaloes which the Lord has planted and as cedar trees beside the waters.
Numbers,24,7,[Israel] shall pour water out of his own buckets [have his own sources of rich blessing and plenty] and his offspring shall dwell by many waters and his king shall be higher than Agag and his kingdom shall be exalted.
Numbers,24,8,God brought [Israel] forth out of Egypt; [Israel] has strength like the wild ox; he shall eat up the nations his enemies crushing their bones and piercing them through with his arrows.
Numbers,24,9,He couched he lay down as a lion; and as a lioness who shall rouse him? Blessed [of God] is he who blesses you [who prays for and contributes to your welfare] and cursed [of God] is he who curses you [who in word thought or deed would bring harm upon you].
Numbers,24,10,Then Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam and he smote his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam I called you to curse my enemies and behold you have done nothing but bless them these three times.
Numbers,24,11,Therefore now go back where you belong and do it in a hurry! I had intended to promote you to great honor but behold the Lord has held you back from honor.
Numbers,24,12,Balaam said to Balak Did I not say to your messengers whom you sent to me
Numbers,24,13,If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold I cannot go beyond the command of the Lord to do either good or bad of my own will but what the Lord says that will I speak?
Numbers,24,14,And now behold I am going to my people; come I will tell you what this people [Israel] will do to your people [Moab] in the latter days.
Numbers,24,15,And he took up his [figurative] discourse and said: Balaam son of Beor speaks the man whose eye is opened speaks
Numbers,24,16,He speaks who heard the words of God and knew the knowledge of the Most High who saw the vision of the Almighty falling down but having his eyes open and uncovered:
Numbers,24,17,I see Him but not now; I behold Him but He is not near. A star (Star) shall come forth out of Jacob and a scepter (Scepter) shall rise out of Israel and shall crush all the corners of Moab and break down all the sons of Sheth [Moab's sons of tumult].
Numbers,24,18,And Edom shall be [taken as] a possession [Mount] Seir also shall be dispossessed who were Israel's enemies while Israel does valiantly.
Numbers,24,19,Out of Jacob shall one (One) come having dominion and shall destroy the remnant from the city.
Numbers,24,20,[Balaam] looked at Amalek and took up his [prophetic] utterance and said: Amalek is the foremost of the [neighboring] nations but in his latter end he shall come to destruction.
Numbers,24,21,And he looked at the Kenites and took up his [prophetic] utterance and said: Strong is your dwelling place and you set your nest in the rock.
Numbers,24,22,Nevertheless the Kenites shall be wasted. How long shall Asshur (Assyria) take you away captive?
Numbers,24,23,And he took up his [prophetic] speech and said: Alas who shall live when God does this and establishes [Assyria]?
Numbers,24,24,But ships shall come from Kittim [Cyprus and the greater part of the Mediterranean's east coast] and shall afflict Assyria and Eber [the Hebrews certain Arabs and descendants of Nahor] and he [the victor] also shall come to destruction.
Numbers,24,25,And Balaam rose up returned to his place and Balak also went his way.
Numbers,25,1,ISRAEL SETTLED down and remained in Shittim and the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab
Numbers,25,2,Who invited the [Israelites] to the sacrifices of their gods and [they] ate and bowed down to Moab's gods.
Numbers,25,3,So Israel joined himself to [the god] Baal of Peor. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.
Numbers,25,4,And the Lord said to Moses Take all the leaders or chiefs of the people and hang them before the Lord in the sun [after killing them] that the fierce anger of the Lord may turn away from Israel.
Numbers,25,5,And Moses said to the judges of Israel Each one of you slay his men who joined themselves to Baal of Peor.
Numbers,25,6,And behold one of the Israelites came and brought to his brethren a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses and of all the congregation of Israel while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting [over the divine judgment and the punishment].
Numbers,25,7,And when Phinehas son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest saw it he rose up from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand
Numbers,25,8,And went after the man of Israel into the inner room and thrust both of them through the man of Israel and the woman through her body. Then the [smiting] plague was stayed from the Israelites.
Numbers,25,9,Nevertheless those who died in the [smiting] plague were 24000.
Numbers,25,10,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,25,11,Phinehas son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest has turned my wrath away from the Israelites in that he was jealous with My jealousy among them so that I did not consume the Israelites in My jealousy.
Numbers,25,12,Therefore say Behold I give to Phinehas the priest My covenant of peace.
Numbers,25,13,And he shall have it and his descendants after him the covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was jealous for his God and made atonement for the Israelites.
Numbers,25,14,Now the man of Israel who was slain with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu a head of a father's house among the Simeonites.
Numbers,25,15,And the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi daughter of Zur; he was head of a father's house in Midian.
Numbers,25,16,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,25,17,Provoke hostilities with the Midianites and attack them
Numbers,25,18,For they harass you with their wiles with which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor and of Cozbi the daughter of the prince of Midian their sister who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.
Numbers,26,1,AFTER THE plague the Lord said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron the priest
Numbers,26,2,Take a census of all the [male] congregation of the Israelites from twenty years old and upward by their fathers' houses all in Israel able to go to war.

Numbers,26,64,But among these there was not a man of those numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest when they numbered the Israelites in the Wilderness of Sinai.

Numbers,27,14,For you disobeyed My order in the Wilderness of Zin during the strife of the congregation to uphold My sanctity [by strict obedience to My authority] at the waters before their eyes. [These are the waters of Meribah in Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin].
Numbers,27,15,And Moses said to the Lord

Numbers,27,21,He shall stand before Eleazar the priest who shall inquire for him before the Lord by the judgment of the Urim [one of two articles in the priest's breastplate worn when asking counsel of the Lord for the people]. At Joshua's word the people shall go out and come in both he and all the Israelite congregation with him.
Numbers,27,22,And Moses did as the Lord commanded him. He took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and all the congregation
Numbers,27,23,And he laid his hands upon him and commissioned him as the Lord commanded through Moses.

Numbers,29,40,And Moses told the Israelites all that the Lord commanded him.
Numbers,30,1,AND MOSES said to the heads or leaders of the tribes of Israel This is the thing which the Lord has commanded:
Numbers,30,2,If a man vows a vow to the Lord or swears an oath to bind himself by a pledge he shall not break and profane his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
Numbers,30,3,Also when a woman vows a vow to the Lord and binds herself by a pledge being in her father's house in her youth
Numbers,30,4,And her father hears her vow and her pledge with which she has bound herself and he offers no objection then all her vows shall stand and every pledge with which she has bound herself shall stand.
Numbers,30,5,But if her father refuses to allow her [to carry out her vow] on the day that he hears about it not any of her vows or of her pledges with which she has bound herself shall stand. And the Lord will forgive her because her father refused to let her [carry out her purpose].
Numbers,30,6,And if she is married to a husband while her vows are upon her or she has bound herself by a rash utterance
Numbers,30,7,And her husband hears of it and holds his peace concerning it on the day that he hears it then her vows shall stand and her pledge with which she bound herself shall stand.
Numbers,30,8,But if her husband refuses to allow her [to keep her vow or pledge] on the day that he hears of it then he shall make void and annul her vow which is upon her and the rash utterance of her lips by which she bound herself and the Lord will forgive her.
Numbers,30,9,But the vow of a widow or of a divorced woman with which she has bound herself shall stand against her.
Numbers,30,10,And if she vowed in her husband's house or bound herself by a pledge with an oath
Numbers,30,11,And her husband heard it and did not oppose or prohibit her then all her vows and every pledge with which she bound herself shall stand.
Numbers,30,12,But if her husband positively made them void on the day he heard them then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning her pledge of herself shall not stand. Her husband has annulled them and the Lord will forgive her.
Numbers,30,13,Every vow and every binding oath to humble or afflict herself her husband may establish it or her husband may annul it.
Numbers,30,14,But if her husband altogether holds his peace [concerning the matter] with her from day to day then he establishes and confirms all her vows or all her pledges which are upon her. He establishes them because he said nothing to [restrain] her on the day he heard of them.
Numbers,30,15,But if he shall nullify them after he hears of them then he shall be responsible for and bear her iniquity.
Numbers,30,16,These are the statutes which the Lord commanded Moses between a man and his wife and between a father and his daughter while in her youth in her father's house.
Numbers,31,1,THE LORD said to Moses
Numbers,31,2,Avenge the Israelites on the Midianites; afterward you shall be gathered to your [departed] people.
Numbers,31,3,And Moses said to the people Arm men from among you for the war that they may go against Midian and execute the Lord's vengeance on Midian [for seducing Israel].
Numbers,31,4,From each of the tribes of Israel you shall send 1000 to the war.
Numbers,31,5,So there were provided out of the thousands of Israel 1000 from each tribe 12000 armed for war.
Numbers,31,6,And Moses sent them to the war 1000 from each tribe together with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest with the [sacred] vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets to blow the alarm in his hand.
Numbers,31,7,They fought with Midian as the Lord commanded Moses and slew every male
Numbers,31,8,Including the five kings of Midian: Evi Rekem Zur Hur and Reba; also Balaam son of Beor they slew with the sword.
Numbers,31,9,And the Israelites took captive the women of Midian and their little ones and all their cattle their flocks and their goods as booty.
Numbers,31,10,They burned all the cities in which they dwelt and all their encampments.
Numbers,31,11,And they took all the spoil and all the prey both of man and of beast.
Numbers,31,12,Then they brought the captives the prey and the spoil to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the congregation of the Israelites at the camp on the plains of Moab by Jordan at Jericho.
Numbers,31,13,Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes or leaders of the congregation went to meet them outside the camp.
Numbers,31,14,But Moses was angry with the officers of the army the commanders of thousands and of hundreds who served in the war.
Numbers,31,15,And Moses said to them Have you let all the women live?
Numbers,31,16,Behold these caused the Israelites by the counsel of Balaam to trespass and act treacherously against the Lord in the matter of Peor and so a [smiting] plague came among the congregation of the Lord.
Numbers,31,17,Now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman who is not a virgin.
Numbers,31,18,But all the young girls who have not known man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.
Numbers,31,19,Encamp outside the camp seven days; whoever has killed any person and whoever has touched any slain purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day.
Numbers,31,20,You shall purify every garment all that is made of skins all work of goats' hair and every article of wood.
Numbers,31,21,And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to battle This is the statute of the law which the Lord has commanded Moses:
Numbers,31,22,Only the gold the silver the bronze the iron the tin and the lead
Numbers,31,23,Everything that can stand fire you shall make go through fire and it shall be clean. Nevertheless it shall also be purified with the water of impurity; and all that cannot stand fire [such as fabrics] you shall pass through water.
Numbers,31,24,And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and you shall be clean; then you shall come into the camp.
Numbers,31,25,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,31,26,Take the count of the prey that was taken both of man and of beast you and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers' houses of the congregation.
Numbers,31,27,Divide the booty into two [equal] parts between the warriors who went out to battle and all the congregation.
Numbers,31,28,And levy a tribute to the Lord from the warriors who went to battle one out of every 500 of the persons the oxen the donkeys and the flocks.
Numbers,31,29,Take [this tribute] from the warriors' half and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the Lord.
Numbers,31,30,And from the Israelites' half [of the booty] you shall take one out of every fifty of the persons the oxen the donkeys the flocks and of all livestock and give them to the Levites who have charge of the tabernacle of the Lord.
Numbers,31,31,And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses.
Numbers,31,32,The prey besides the booty which the men of war took was 675000 sheep
Numbers,31,33,And 72000 cattle
Numbers,31,34,And 61000 donkeys
Numbers,31,35,And 32000 persons in all of the women who were virgins.
Numbers,31,36,And the half share the portion of those who went to war was: 337500 sheep
Numbers,31,37,And the Lord's tribute of the sheep was 675;
Numbers,31,38,The cattle were 36000 of which the Lord's tribute was 72;
Numbers,31,39,The donkeys were 30500 of which the Lord's tribute was 61;
Numbers,31,40,The persons were 16000 of whom the Lord's tribute was 32 persons.
Numbers,31,41,And Moses gave the tribute which was the Lord's offering to Eleazar the priest as the Lord commanded Moses.
Numbers,31,42,And the Israelites' half Moses separated from that of the warriors'--
Numbers,31,43,Now the congregation's half was 337500 sheep
Numbers,31,44,And 36000 cattle
Numbers,31,45,And 30500 donkeys
Numbers,31,46,And 16000 persons--
Numbers,31,47,Even of the Israelites' half Moses took one of every 50 both of persons and of beasts and gave them to the Levites who had charge of the tabernacle of the Lord as the Lord commanded Moses.
Numbers,31,48,And the officers who were over the thousands of the army the commanders of thousands and hundreds came to Moses.
Numbers,31,49,They told [him] Your servants have counted the warriors under our command and not one man of us is missing.
Numbers,31,50,We have brought as the Lord's offering what each man obtained--articles of gold armlets bracelets signet rings earrings neck ornaments--to make atonement for ourselves before the Lord.
Numbers,31,51,Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them all the wrought articles.
Numbers,31,52,And all the gold of the offering that they offered to the Lord from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds was 16750 shekels.
Numbers,31,53,For the men of war had taken booty every man for himself.
Numbers,31,54,And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the Tent of Meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the Lord.
Numbers,32,1,NOW THE sons of Reuben and of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle and they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead [on the east side of the Jordan] and behold the place was suitable for cattle.
Numbers,32,2,So the sons of Gad and of Reuben came and said to Moses Eleazar the priest and the leaders of the congregation
Numbers,32,3,[The country around] Ataroth Dibon Jazer Nimrah Heshbon Elealeh Sebam Nebo and Beon
Numbers,32,4,The land the Lord smote before the congregation of Israel is a land for cattle and your servants have cattle.
Numbers,32,5,And they said If we have found favor in your sight let this land be given to your servants for a possession. Do not take us over the Jordan.
Numbers,32,6,And Moses said to the sons of Gad and of Reuben Shall your brethren go to war while you sit here?
Numbers,32,7,Why do you discourage the hearts of the Israelites from going over into the land which the Lord has given them?
Numbers,32,8,Thus your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land!
Numbers,32,9,For when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land they discouraged the hearts of the Israelites from going into the land the Lord had given them.
Numbers,32,10,And the Lord's anger was kindled on that day and He swore saying
Numbers,32,11,Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt from twenty years old and upward shall see the land which I swore to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob because they have not wholly followed Me--
Numbers,32,12,Except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun for they have wholly followed the Lord.
Numbers,32,13,And the Lord's anger was kindled against Israel and He made them wander in the wilderness for forty years until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord was consumed.
Numbers,32,14,And behold you are risen up in your fathers' stead a brood of sinful men to increase still more the fierce anger of the Lord against Israel.
Numbers,32,15,For if you turn from following Him He will again abandon them in the wilderness and you will destroy all this people.
Numbers,32,16,But they came near to him and said We will build sheepfolds here for our flocks and walled settlements for our little ones.
Numbers,32,17,But we will be armed and ready to go before the Israelites until we have brought them to their place. Our little ones shall dwell in the fortified settlements because of the people of the land.
Numbers,32,18,We will not return to our homes until the Israelites have inherited every man his inheritance.
Numbers,32,19,For we will not inherit with them on the [west] side of the Jordan and beyond because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.
Numbers,32,20,Moses replied If you will do as you say going armed before the Lord to war
Numbers,32,21,And every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before the Lord until He has driven out His enemies before Him
Numbers,32,22,And the land is subdued before the Lord then afterward you shall return and be guiltless [in this matter] before the Lord and before Israel and this land shall be your possession before the Lord.
Numbers,32,23,But if you will not do so behold you have sinned against the Lord; and be sure your sin will find you out.
Numbers,32,24,Build settlements for your little ones and folds for your sheep and do that of which you have spoken.
Numbers,32,25,And the sons of Gad and of Reuben said to Moses Your servants will do as my lord commands.
Numbers,32,26,Our little ones our wives our flocks and all our cattle shall be there in the cities of Gilead.
Numbers,32,27,But your servants will pass over every man armed for war before the Lord to battle as my lord says.
Numbers,32,28,So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of Israel.
Numbers,32,29,And Moses said to them If the sons of Gad and Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan every man armed to battle before the Lord and the land shall be subdued before you then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession.
Numbers,32,30,But if they will not pass over with you armed they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
Numbers,32,31,The sons of Gad and Reuben answered As the Lord has said to your servants so will we do.
Numbers,32,32,We will pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan that the possession of our inheritance on this side of the Jordan may be ours.
Numbers,32,33,Moses gave to them to the sons of Gad and of Reuben and to half the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan--the land with its cities and their territories even the cities round about the country.
Numbers,32,34,And the sons of Gad built Dibon Ataroth Aroer
Numbers,32,35,Atroth-shophan Jazer Jogbehah
Numbers,32,36,Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran fortified cities and folds for sheep.
Numbers,32,37,And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon Elealeh Kiriathaim
Numbers,32,38,Nebo and Baal-meon--their names were to be changed--and Shibmah; and they gave other names to the cities they built.
Numbers,32,39,And the sons of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.
Numbers,32,40,And Moses gave Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh and he settled in it.
Numbers,32,41,Jair son of Manasseh took their villages and called them Havvoth-jair.
Numbers,32,42,And Nobah took Kenath and its villages and called it Nobah after his own name.
Numbers,33,1,THESE ARE the stages of the journeys of the Israelites by which they went out of the land of Egypt by their hosts under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
Numbers,33,2,Moses recorded their starting places as the Lord commanded stage by stage; and these are their journeying stages from their starting places:
Numbers,33,3,They set out from Rameses on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the day after the Passover the Israelites went out [of Egypt] with a high hand and triumphantly in the sight of all the Egyptians
Numbers,33,4,While the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn whom the Lord had struck down among them; upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments.
Numbers,33,5,The Israelites set out from Rameses and encamped in Succoth.
Numbers,33,6,And they departed from Succoth and encamped in Etham which is at the edge of the wilderness.
Numbers,33,7,They set out from Etham and turned back to Pi-hahiroth east of Baal-zephon and they encamped before Migdol.

Numbers,33,37,And they removed from Kadesh and encamped at Mount Hor on the edge of Edom.
Numbers,33,38,Aaron the priest went up on Mount Hor at the command of the Lord and died there in the fortieth year after the Israelites came out of Egypt the first day of the fifth month.
Numbers,33,39,Aaron was 123 years old when he died on Mount Hor.
Numbers,33,40,The Canaanite king of Arad who lived in the South (the Negeb) in the land of Canaan heard of the coming of the Israelites.
Numbers,33,41,They set out from Mount Hor and encamped at Zalmonah.
Numbers,33,42,And they set out from Zalmonah and encamped at Punon.

Numbers,33,49,And they encamped by the Jordan from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.
Numbers,33,50,And the Lord said to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho
Numbers,33,51,Tell the Israelites When you have passed over the Jordan into the land of Canaan
Numbers,33,52,Then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you and destroy all their figured stones and all their molten images and completely demolish all their [idolatrous] high places
Numbers,33,53,And you shall take possession of the land and dwell in it for to you I have given the land to possess it.
Numbers,33,54,You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the large tribe you shall give a larger inheritance and to the small tribe you shall give a smaller inheritance. Wherever the lot falls to any man that shall be his. According to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit.
Numbers,33,55,But if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then those you let remain of them shall be as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides and they shall vex you in the land in which you dwell.
Numbers,33,56,And as I thought to do to them so will I do to you.
Numbers,34,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses
Numbers,34,2,Command the Israelites When you come into the land of Canaan (which is the land that shall be yours for an inheritance the land of Canaan according to its boundaries)
Numbers,34,3,Your south side shall be from the Wilderness of Zin along the side of Edom and your southern boundary from the end of the Salt [Dead] Sea eastward.
Numbers,34,4,Your boundary shall turn south of the ascent of Akrabbim and pass on to Zin and its end shall be south of Kadesh-barnea. Then it shall go on to Hazar-addar and pass on to Azmon.
Numbers,34,5,Then the boundary shall turn from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt and it shall terminate at the [Mediterranean] Sea.
Numbers,34,6,For the western boundary you shall have the Great Sea and its coast.
Numbers,34,7,And this shall be your north border: from the Great Sea mark out your boundary line to Mount Hor;
Numbers,34,8,From Mount Hor you shall mark out your boundary to the entrance of Hamath and its end shall be at Zedad;
Numbers,34,9,Then the northern boundary shall go on to Ziphron and the end of it shall be at Hazar-enan.
Numbers,34,10,You shall mark out your eastern boundary from Hazar-enan to Shepham;
Numbers,34,11,The boundary shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and shall descend and reach to the shoulder of the Sea of Chinnereth [the Sea of Galilee] on the east;
Numbers,34,12,And the boundary shall go down to the Jordan and the end shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land with its boundaries all around.
Numbers,34,13,Moses commanded the Israelites This is the land you shall inherit by lot which the Lord has commanded to give to the nine tribes and the half-tribe [of Manasseh]
Numbers,34,14,For the tribes of the sons of Reuben and of Gad by their fathers' houses have received their inheritance and also the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Numbers,34,15,The two and a half tribes have received their inheritance east of the Jordan at Jericho toward the sunrise.
Numbers,34,16,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,34,17,These are the men who shall divide the land to you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun.
Numbers,34,18,And [with them] you shall take one head or prince of each tribe to divide the land for inheritance.
Numbers,34,19,The names of the men are: Of the tribe of Judah Caleb son of Jephunneh;
Numbers,34,20,Of the tribe of the sons of Simeon Shemuel son of Ammihud;
Numbers,34,21,Of the tribe of Benjamin Elidad son of Chislon;
Numbers,34,22,Of the tribe of the sons of Dan a leader Bukki son of Jogli;
Numbers,34,23,Of the sons of Joseph: of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh a leader Hanniel son of Ephod;
Numbers,34,24,And of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim a leader Kemuel son of Shiphtan;

Numbers,34,28,And of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali a leader Pedahel son of Ammihud.
Numbers,34,29,These are the men whom the Lord commanded to divide the inheritance to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
Numbers,35,1,AND THE Lord said to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho
Numbers,35,2,Command the Israelites that they give to the Levites from the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and [suburb] pasturelands round about the cities' walls you shall give to the Levites also.
Numbers,35,3,They shall have the cities to dwell in and their [suburb] pasturelands shall be for their cattle for their wealth [in flocks] and for all their beasts.
Numbers,35,4,And the pasturelands of the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall reach from the wall of the city and outward 1000 cubits round about.
Numbers,35,5,You shall measure from the wall of the city outward on the east south west and north sides 2000 cubits the city being in the center. This shall belong to [the Levites] as [suburb] pasturelands for their cities.
Numbers,35,6,Of the cities which you shall give to the Levites there shall be the six cities of refuge which you shall give for the manslayer to flee into; and in addition to them you shall give forty-two cities.
Numbers,35,7,So all the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight; you shall give them with their adjacent [suburb] pasturelands.
Numbers,35,8,As for the cities you shall give from the possession of the Israelites from the larger tribes you shall take many and from the smaller tribes few; each tribe shall give of its cities to the Levites in proportion to its inheritance.
Numbers,35,9,And the Lord said to Moses
Numbers,35,10,Say to the Israelites When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan
Numbers,35,11,Then you shall select cities to be cities of refuge for you that the slayer who kills any person unintentionally and unawares may flee there.
Numbers,35,12,And the cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger that the manslayer may not die until he has had a fair trial before the congregation.
Numbers,35,13,And of the cities which you give there shall be your six cities for refuge.
Numbers,35,14,You shall give three cities on this [east] side of the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan to be cities of refuge.
Numbers,35,15,These six cities shall be a refuge for the Israelites and for the stranger and the temporary resident among them; that anyone who kills any person unintentionally and unawares may flee there.
Numbers,35,16,But if he struck him down with an instrument of iron so that he died he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers,35,17,And if he struck him down by throwing a stone by which a person may die and he died he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers,35,18,Or if he struck him down with a weapon of wood in his hand by which one may die and he died the offender is a murderer; he shall surely be put to death.
Numbers,35,19,The avenger of blood shall himself slay the murderer; when he meets him he shall slay him.
Numbers,35,20,But if he stabbed him through hatred or hurled at him by lying in wait so that he died
Numbers,35,21,Or in enmity struck him down with his hand so that he died he that smote him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall slay the murderer when he meets him.
Numbers,35,22,But if he stabbed him suddenly without enmity or threw anything at or upon him without lying in wait
Numbers,35,23,Or with any stone with which a man may be killed not seeing him and threw it at him so that he died and was not his enemy nor sought to harm him
Numbers,35,24,Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances.
Numbers,35,25,And the congregation shall rescue the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood and restore him to his city of refuge to which he had fled; and he shall live in it until the high priest dies who was anointed with the sacred oil.
Numbers,35,26,But if the slayer shall at any time come outside the limits of his city of refuge to which he had fled
Numbers,35,27,And the avenger of blood finds him outside the limits of his city of refuge and kills the manslayer he shall not be guilty of blood
Numbers,35,28,Because the manslayer should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the high priest's death the manslayer shall return to the land of his possession.
Numbers,35,29,And these things shall be for a statute and ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Numbers,35,30,Whoever kills any person [intentionally] the murderer shall be put to death on the testimony of witnesses; but no one shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness.
Numbers,35,31,Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.
Numbers,35,32,And you shall accept no ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge so that he may return to dwell in the land before the death of the high priest.
Numbers,35,33,So you shall not pollute the land in which you live; for blood pollutes the land and no atonement can be made for the land for the blood shed in it but by the blood of him who shed it.
Numbers,35,34,And you shall not defile the land in which you live in the midst of which I dwell for I the Lord dwell in the midst of the people of Israel.
Numbers,36,1,THE HEADS of the fathers' houses of the families of the sons of Gilead son of Machir the son of Manasseh of the fathers' houses of the sons of Joseph came near and spoke before Moses and the leaders the heads of the fathers' houses of the Israelites.
Numbers,36,2,They said The Lord commanded [you] my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the Israelites; and my lord was commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
Numbers,36,3,But if they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the Israelites then their inheritance will be taken from that of our fathers and added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they are received and belong; so it will be taken out of the lot of our inheritance.
Numbers,36,4,And when the Jubilee of the Israelites comes then their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe to which they are received and belong; so will their inheritance be taken away from that of the tribe of our fathers.
Numbers,36,5,And Moses commanded the Israelites according to the word of the Lord saying The tribe of the sons of Joseph is right.
Numbers,36,6,This is what the Lord commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad: Let them marry whom they think best; only they shall marry within the family of the tribe of their father.
Numbers,36,7,So shall no inheritance of the Israelites be transferred from tribe to tribe for every one of the Israelites shall cling to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
Numbers,36,8,And every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the Israelites shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father so that the Israelites may each one possess the inheritance of his fathers.
Numbers,36,9,So shall no inheritance be transferred from one tribe to another but each of the tribes of the Israelites shall cling to its own inheritance.
Numbers,36,10,The daughters of Zelophehad did as the Lord commanded Moses.
Numbers,36,11,For Mahlah Tirzah Hoglah Milcah and Noah the daughters of Zelophehad were married to sons of their father's brothers.
Numbers,36,12,They married into the families of the sons of Manasseh son of Joseph and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
Numbers,36,13,These are the commandments and ordinances which the Lord commanded the Israelites through Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan [River] at Jericho.
Deuteronomy,1,1,THESE ARE the words which Moses spoke to all Israel [still] on the [east] side of the Jordan [River] in the wilderness in the Arabah [the deep valley running north and south from the eastern arm of the Red Sea to beyond the Dead Sea] over near Suph between Paran and Tophel Laban Hazeroth and Dizahab.
Deuteronomy,1,2,It is [only] eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea [on Canaan's border; yet Israel took forty years to get beyond it].
Deuteronomy,1,3,And in the fortieth year on the first day of the eleventh month Moses spoke to the Israelites according to all that the Lord had given him in commandment to them
Deuteronomy,1,4,After He had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon and Og king of Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth [and] Edrei.
Deuteronomy,1,5,Beyond (east of) the Jordan in the land of Moab Moses began to explain this law saying
Deuteronomy,1,6,The Lord our God said to us in Horeb You have dwelt long enough on this mountain.
Deuteronomy,1,7,Turn and take up your journey and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all their neighbors in the Arabah in the hill country in the lowland in the South (the Negeb) and on the coast the land of the Canaanites and Lebanon as far as the great river the river Euphrates.
Deuteronomy,1,8,Behold I have set the land before you; go in and take possession of the land which the Lord swore to your fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give to them and to their descendants after them.
Deuteronomy,1,9,I said to you at that time I am not able to bear you alone.
Deuteronomy,1,10,The Lord your God has multiplied you and behold you are this day as the stars of the heavens for multitude.
Deuteronomy,1,11,May the Lord the God of your fathers make you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you as He has promised you!
Deuteronomy,1,12,How can I bear alone the weariness and pressure and burden of you and your strife?
Deuteronomy,1,13,Choose wise understanding experienced and respected men according to your tribes and I will make them heads over you.
Deuteronomy,1,14,And you answered me The thing which you have spoken is good for us to do.
Deuteronomy,1,15,So I took the heads of your tribes wise experienced and respected men and made them heads over you commanders of thousands and hundreds and fifties and tens and officers according to your tribes.
Deuteronomy,1,16,And I charged your judges at that time: Hear the cases between your brethren and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the stranger or sojourner who is with him.
Deuteronomy,1,17,You shall not be partial in judgment; but you shall hear the small as well as the great. You shall not be afraid of the face of man for the judgment is God's. And the case that is too hard for you you shall bring to me and I will hear it.
Deuteronomy,1,18,And I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.
Deuteronomy,1,19,And when we departed from Horeb we went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites as the Lord our God commanded us and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
Deuteronomy,1,20,And I said to you You have come to the hill country of the Amorites which the Lord our God gives us.
Deuteronomy,1,21,Behold the Lord your God has set the land before you; go up and possess it as the Lord the God of your fathers has said to you. Fear not neither be dismayed.
Deuteronomy,1,22,Then you all came near to me and said Let us send men before us that they may search out the land for us and bring us word again by what way we should go up and the cities into which we shall come.
Deuteronomy,1,23,The thing pleased me well and I took twelve men of you one for each tribe.
Deuteronomy,1,24,And they turned and went up into the hill country and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out.
Deuteronomy,1,25,And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us and brought us word again and said It is a good land which the Lord our God gives us.
Deuteronomy,1,26,Yet you would not go up but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,1,27,You were peevish and discontented in your tents and said Because the Lord hated us He brought us forth out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.
Deuteronomy,1,28,To what are we going up? Our brethren have made our hearts melt saying The people are bigger and taller than we are; the cities are great and fortified to the heavens. And moreover we have seen the [giantlike] sons of the Anakim there.
Deuteronomy,1,29,Then I said to you Dread not neither be afraid of them.
Deuteronomy,1,30,The Lord your God Who goes before you He will fight for you just as He did for you in Egypt before your eyes
Deuteronomy,1,31,And in the wilderness where you have seen how the Lord your God bore you as a man carries his son in all the way that you went until you came to this place.
Deuteronomy,1,32,Yet in spite of this word you did not believe (trust rely on and remain steadfast to) the Lord your God
Deuteronomy,1,33,Who went in the way before you to search out a place to pitch your tents in fire by night to show you by what way you should go and in the cloud by day.
Deuteronomy,1,34,And the Lord heard your words and was angered and He swore
Deuteronomy,1,35,Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see that good land which I swore to give to your fathers
Deuteronomy,1,36,Except [Joshua of course and] Caleb son of Jephunneh; he shall see it and to him and to his children I will give the land upon which he has walked because he has wholly followed the Lord.
Deuteronomy,1,37,The Lord was angry with me also for your sakes and said You also shall not enter Canaan.
Deuteronomy,1,38,But Joshua son of Nun who stands before you he shall enter there. Encourage him for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
Deuteronomy,1,39,Moreover your little ones whom you said would become a prey and your children who at this time cannot discern between good and evil they shall enter Canaan and to them I will give it and they shall possess it.
Deuteronomy,1,40,But as for you turn and journey into the wilderness by way of the Red Sea.
Deuteronomy,1,41,Then you said to me We have sinned against the Lord. We will go up and fight as the Lord our God commanded us. And you girded on every man his battle weapons and thought it a simple matter to go up into the hill country.
Deuteronomy,1,42,And the Lord said to me Say to them Do not go up or fight for I am not among you--lest you be dangerously hurt by your enemies.
Deuteronomy,1,43,So I spoke to you and you would not hear but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord and were presumptuous and went up into the hill country.
Deuteronomy,1,44,Then the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do and struck you down in Seir as far as Hormah.
Deuteronomy,1,45,And you returned and wept before the Lord but the Lord would not heed your voice or listen to you.
Deuteronomy,1,46,So you remained in Kadesh; many days you remained there.
Deuteronomy,2,1,THEN WE turned and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea as the Lord directed me; and for many days we journeyed around Mount Seir.
Deuteronomy,2,2,And the Lord spoke to me [Moses] saying
Deuteronomy,2,3,You have roamed around this mountain country long enough; turn northward.
Deuteronomy,2,4,And command the Israelites You are to pass through the territory of your kinsmen the sons of Esau who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So watch yourselves carefully.
Deuteronomy,2,5,Do not provoke or stir them up for I will not give you of their land no not enough for the sole of your foot to tread on for I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.
Deuteronomy,2,6,You shall buy food from them for money that you may eat and you shall also buy water from them for money that you may drink.
Deuteronomy,2,7,For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand. He knows your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years the Lord your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.
Deuteronomy,2,8,So we passed on from our brethren the sons of Esau who dwelt in Seir away from the Arabah (wilderness) and from Elath and from Ezion-geber. We turned and went by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
Deuteronomy,2,9,And the Lord said to me Do not trouble or assault Moab or contend with them in battle for I will not give you any of their land for a possession because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot for a possession.
Deuteronomy,2,10,(The Emim dwelt there in times past a people great and many and tall as the Anakim.
Deuteronomy,2,11,These also are known as Rephaim [of giant stature] as are the Anakim but the Moabites call them Emim.
Deuteronomy,2,12,The Horites also formerly lived in Seir but the sons of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and dwelt in their stead as Israel did to the land of their possession which the Lord gave to them.)
Deuteronomy,2,13,Now rise up and go over the brook Zered. So we went over the brook Zered.
Deuteronomy,2,14,And the time from our leaving Kadesh-barnea until we had come over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years until the whole generation of the men of war had perished from the camp as the Lord had sworn to them.
Deuteronomy,2,15,Moreover the hand of the Lord was against them to exterminate them from the midst of the camp until they were all gone.
Deuteronomy,2,16,So when all the men of war had died from among the people
Deuteronomy,2,17,The Lord spoke to me [Moses] saying
Deuteronomy,2,18,You are this day to pass through Ar the border of Moab.
Deuteronomy,2,19,But when you come near the territory of the sons of Ammon do not trouble or assault them or provoke or stir them up for I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites for a possession because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.
Deuteronomy,2,20,(That also is known as a land of Rephaim [of giant stature]; Rephaim dwelt there formerly but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim
Deuteronomy,2,21,A people great and many and tall as the Anakim. But the Lord destroyed them before [Ammon] and they dispossessed them and settled in their stead
Deuteronomy,2,22,As He did for the sons of Esau who dwell in Seir when He destroyed the Horites from before them and they dispossessed them and settled in their stead even to this day.
Deuteronomy,2,23,As for the Avvim who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza the Caphtorim who came from Caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their stead.)
Deuteronomy,2,24,Rise up take your journey and pass over the Valley of the Arnon. Behold I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite king of Heshbon and his land; begin to possess it and contend with him in battle.
Deuteronomy,2,25,This day will I begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples who are under the whole heavens who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.
Deuteronomy,2,26,So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace saying
Deuteronomy,2,27,Let me pass through your land. I will go only by the road turning aside neither to the right nor to the left.
Deuteronomy,2,28,You shall sell me food to eat and sell me water to drink; only let me walk through
Deuteronomy,2,29,As the sons of Esau who dwell in Seir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar did for me until I go over the Jordan into the land which the Lord our God gives us.
Deuteronomy,2,30,But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for the Lord your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that He might give him into your hand as at this day.
Deuteronomy,2,31,And the Lord said to me [Moses] Behold I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to take possession that you may succeed him and occupy his land.
Deuteronomy,2,32,Then Sihon came out against us he and all his people to fight at Jahaz.
Deuteronomy,2,33,And the Lord our God gave him over to us and we defeated him and his sons and all his people.
Deuteronomy,2,34,At the same time we took all his cities and utterly destroyed every city--men women and children. We left none to remain.
Deuteronomy,2,35,Only the cattle we took as booty for ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we had captured.
Deuteronomy,2,36,From Aroer which is on the edge of the Arnon Valley and from the city that is in the valley as far as Gilead there was no city too high and strong for us; the Lord our God delivered all to us.
Deuteronomy,2,37,Only you did not go near the land of the Ammonites that is to any bank of the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country and wherever the Lord our God had forbidden us.
Deuteronomy,3,1,THEN WE turned and went up the road to Bashan and Og king of Bashan came out against us he and all his people to battle at Edrei.
Deuteronomy,3,2,And the Lord said to me Do not fear him for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon.
Deuteronomy,3,3,So the Lord our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his people and we smote him until not one was left to him.
Deuteronomy,3,4,And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them sixty cities the whole region of Argob the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
Deuteronomy,3,5,All these cities were fortified with high and haughty walls gates and bars besides a great many unwalled villages.
Deuteronomy,3,6,And we utterly destroyed them as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon utterly destroying every city--men women and children.
Deuteronomy,3,7,But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for booty for ourselves.
Deuteronomy,3,8,So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon
Deuteronomy,3,9,(The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion and the Amorites call it Senir)
Deuteronomy,3,10,All the cities of the plain and all Gilead and all Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
Deuteronomy,3,11,For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the [gigantic] Rephaim. Behold his bedstead was of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the Ammonites? Nine cubits was its length and four cubits its breadth using the cubit of a man [the forearm to the end of the middle finger].
Deuteronomy,3,12,When we took possession of this land I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory from Aroer which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon and half the hill country of Gilead and its cities.
Deuteronomy,3,13,The rest of Gilead and all of Bashan the kingdom of Og that is all the region of Argob in Bashan I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. It is called the land of Rephaim [of giant stature].
Deuteronomy,3,14,Jair son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob that is Bashan as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites and called it after his own name Havvoth-jair so called to this day.
Deuteronomy,3,15,And I gave Gilead to Machir [son of Manasseh].
Deuteronomy,3,16,And to the Reubenites and Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the Valley of the Arnon with the middle of the valley as the boundary of it as far over as the river Jabbok the boundary of the Ammonites
Deuteronomy,3,17,The Arabah also with the Jordan as its boundary from Chinnereth as far as the Sea of the Arabah the Salt [Dead] Sea under the cliffs [of the headlands] of Pisgah on the east.
Deuteronomy,3,18,And I commanded you at that time saying The Lord your God has given you this land to possess it; you [Reuben Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh] shall go over [the Jordan] armed before your brethren the other Israelites all that are able for war.
Deuteronomy,3,19,But your wives and your little ones and your cattle--I know that you have many cattle--shall remain in your cities which I have given you
Deuteronomy,3,20,Until the Lord has given rest to your brethren as to you and until they also possess the land which the Lord your God has given them beyond the Jordan. Then shall you return every man to the possession which I have given you.
Deuteronomy,3,21,And I commanded Joshua at that time saying Your own eyes have seen all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings [Sihon and Og]; so shall the Lord do to all the kingdoms into which you are going over [the Jordan].
Deuteronomy,3,22,You shall not fear them for the Lord your God shall fight for you.
Deuteronomy,3,23,And I besought the Lord at that time saying
Deuteronomy,3,24,O Lord God You have only begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth that can do according to Your works and according to Your might?
Deuteronomy,3,25,I pray You [will You not just] let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan that goodly mountain country [with Hermon] and Lebanon?
Deuteronomy,3,26,But the Lord was angry with me on your account and would not listen to me; and the Lord said to me That is enough! Say no more to Me about it.
Deuteronomy,3,27,Get up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward and behold it with your eyes for you shall not go over this Jordan.
Deuteronomy,3,28,But charge Joshua and encourage and strengthen him for he shall go over before this people and he shall cause them to possess the land which you shall see.
Deuteronomy,3,29,So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,NOW LISTEN and give heed O Israel to the statutes and ordinances which I teach you and do them that you may live and go in and possess the land which the Lord the God of your fathers gives you.
Deuteronomy,4,2,You shall not add to the word which I command you neither shall you diminish it that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.
Deuteronomy,4,3,Your eyes still see what the Lord did because of Baal-peor; for all the men who followed the Baal of Peor the Lord your God has destroyed from among you
Deuteronomy,4,4,But you who clung fast to the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day.
Deuteronomy,4,5,Behold I have taught you statutes and ordinances as the Lord my God commanded me that you should do them in the land which you are entering to possess.
Deuteronomy,4,6,So keep them and do them for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who when they hear all these statutes will say Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
Deuteronomy,4,7,For what great nation is there who has a god so near to them as the Lord our God is to us in all things for which we call upon Him?
Deuteronomy,4,8,And what large and important nation has statutes and ordinances so upright and just as all this law which I set before you today?
Deuteronomy,4,9,Only take heed and guard your life diligently lest you forget the things which your eyes have seen and lest they depart from your [mind and] heart all the days of your life. Teach them to your children and your children's children--
Deuteronomy,4,10,Especially how on the day that you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb the Lord said to me Gather the people together to Me and I will make them hear My words that they may learn [reverently] to fear Me all the days they live upon the earth and that they may teach their children.
Deuteronomy,4,11,And you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven with darkness cloud and thick gloom.
Deuteronomy,4,12,And the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the voice of the words but saw no form; there was only a voice.
Deuteronomy,4,13,And He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform the Ten Commandments and He wrote them on two tables of stone.
Deuteronomy,4,14,And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you the statutes and precepts that you might do them in the land which you are going over to possess.
Deuteronomy,4,15,Therefore take good heed to yourselves since you saw no form of Him on the day the Lord spoke to you on Horeb out of the midst of the fire
Deuteronomy,4,16,Beware lest you become corrupt by making for yourselves [to worship] a graven image in the form of any figure the likeness of male or female
Deuteronomy,4,17,The likeness of any beast that is on the earth or of any winged fowl that flies in the air
Deuteronomy,4,18,The likeness of anything that creeps on the ground or of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth.
Deuteronomy,4,19,And beware lest you lift up your eyes to the heavens and when you see the sun moon and stars even all the host of the heavens you be drawn away and worship them and serve them things which the Lord your God has allotted to all nations under the whole heaven.
Deuteronomy,4,20,But the Lord has taken you and brought you forth out of the iron furnace out of Egypt to be to Him a people of His own possession as you are this day.
Deuteronomy,4,21,Furthermore the Lord was angry with me because of you and He swore that I should not go over the Jordan and that I should not enter the good land which the Lord your God gives you for an inheritance.
Deuteronomy,4,22,But I must die in this land; I must not cross the Jordan; but you shall go over and possess that good land.
Deuteronomy,4,23,Take heed to yourselves lest you forget the covenant of the Lord your God which He made with you and make for yourselves a graven image in the form of anything which the Lord your God has forbidden you.
Deuteronomy,4,24,For the Lord your God is a consuming fire a jealous God.
Deuteronomy,4,25,When children shall be born to you and children's children and you have grown old in the land if you corrupt yourselves by making a graven image in the form of anything and do evil in the sight of the Lord your God provoking Him to anger
Deuteronomy,4,26,I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that you shall soon utterly perish from the land which you are going over the Jordan to possess. You will not live long upon it but will be utterly destroyed.
Deuteronomy,4,27,And the Lord will scatter you among the peoples and you will be left few in number among the nations to which the Lord will drive you.
Deuteronomy,4,28,There you will serve gods the work of men's hands wood and stone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell.
Deuteronomy,4,29,But if from there you will seek (inquire for and require as necessity) the Lord your God you will find Him if you [truly] seek Him with all your heart [and mind] and soul and life.
Deuteronomy,4,30,When you are in tribulation and all these things come upon you in the latter days you will turn to the Lord your God and be obedient to His voice.
Deuteronomy,4,31,For the Lord your God is a merciful God; He will not fail you or destroy you or forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.
Deuteronomy,4,32,For ask now of the days that are past which were before you since the day that God created man upon the earth and ask from one end of the heavens to the other whether such a great thing as this has ever occurred or been heard of anywhere.
Deuteronomy,4,33,Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire as you heard and live?
Deuteronomy,4,34,Or has God ever tried to go and take for Himself a nation from the midst of another nation by trials by signs by wonders by war by a mighty hand by an outstretched arm and by great terrors as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
Deuteronomy,4,35,To you it was shown that you might realize and have personal knowledge that the Lord is God; there is no other besides Him.
Deuteronomy,4,36,Out of heaven He made you hear His voice that He might correct discipline and admonish you; and on earth He made you see His great fire and you heard His words out of the midst of the fire.
Deuteronomy,4,37,And because He loved your fathers He chose their descendants after them and brought you out from Egypt with His own Presence by His mighty power
Deuteronomy,4,38,Driving out nations from before you greater and mightier than yourselves to bring you in to give you their land for an inheritance as it is this day;
Deuteronomy,4,39,Know recognize and understand therefore this day and turn your [mind and] heart to it that the Lord is God in the heavens above and upon the earth beneath; there is no other.
Deuteronomy,4,40,Therefore you shall keep His statutes and His commandments which I command you this day that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may prolong your days in the land which the Lord your God gives you forever.
Deuteronomy,4,41,Then Moses set apart three cities [of refuge] beyond the Jordan to the east
Deuteronomy,4,42,That the manslayer might flee there who slew his neighbor unintentionally and had not previously been at enmity with him that fleeing to one of these cities he might save his life:
Deuteronomy,4,43,Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.
Deuteronomy,4,44,This is the law which Moses set before the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,4,45,These are the testimonies and the laws and the precepts which Moses spoke to the Israelites when they came out of Egypt
Deuteronomy,4,46,Beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth-peor in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who dwelt at Heshbon whom Moses and the Israelites smote when they came out of Egypt.
Deuteronomy,4,47,And they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan the two kings of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan to the east
Deuteronomy,4,48,From Aroer which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon as far as Mount Sirion (that is Hermon)
Deuteronomy,4,49,And all the Arabah (lowlands) beyond the Jordan eastward as far as the Sea of the Arabah [the Dead Sea] under the slopes and springs of Pisgah.
Deuteronomy,5,1,AND MOSES called all Israel and said to them Hear O Israel the statutes and ordinances which I speak in your hearing this day that you may learn them and take heed and do them.
Deuteronomy,5,2,The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
Deuteronomy,5,3,The Lord made this covenant not with our fathers but with us who are all of us here alive this day.
Deuteronomy,5,4,The Lord spoke with you face to face at the mount out of the midst of the fire.
Deuteronomy,5,5,I stood between the Lord and you at that time to show you the word of the Lord for you were afraid because of the fire and went not up into the mount. He said
Deuteronomy,5,6,I am the Lord your God Who brought you out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage.
Deuteronomy,5,7,You shall have no other gods before Me or besides Me.
Deuteronomy,5,8,You shall not make for yourself [to worship] a graven image or any likeness of anything that is in the heavens above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth.
Deuteronomy,5,9,You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me
Deuteronomy,5,10,And showing mercy and steadfast love to thousands and to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments.
Deuteronomy,5,11,You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in falsehood or without purpose.
Deuteronomy,5,12,Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy as the Lord your God commanded you.
Deuteronomy,5,13,Six days you shall labor and do all your work
Deuteronomy,5,14,But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work you or your son or your daughter or your manservant or your maidservant or your ox or your donkey or any of your livestock or the stranger or sojourner who is within your gates that your manservant and your maidservant may rest as well as you.
Deuteronomy,5,15,And [earnestly] remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm; therefore the Lord your God commanded you to observe and take heed to the Sabbath day.
Deuteronomy,5,16,Honor your father and your mother as the Lord your God commanded you that your days may be prolonged and that it may go well with you in the land which the Lord your God gives you.

Deuteronomy,5,21,Neither shall you covet your neighbor's wife nor desire your neighbor's house his field his manservant or his maidservant his ox or his donkey or anything that is your neighbor's.
Deuteronomy,5,22,These words the Lord spoke to all your assembly at the mountain out of the midst of the fire the cloud and the thick darkness with a loud voice; and He spoke not again [added no more]. He wrote them on two tables of stone and gave them to me [Moses].
Deuteronomy,5,23,And when you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness while the mountain was burning with fire you came near me all the heads of your tribes and your elders;
Deuteronomy,5,24,And you said Behold the Lord our God has shown us His glory and His greatness and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire; we have this day seen that God speaks with man and man still lives.
Deuteronomy,5,25,Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer we shall die.
Deuteronomy,5,26,For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of fire as we have and lived?
Deuteronomy,5,27,Go near [Moses] and hear all that the Lord our God will say. And speak to us all that the Lord our God will speak to you; and we will hear and do it.
Deuteronomy,5,28,And the Lord heard your words when you spoke to me and the Lord said to me I have heard the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They have said well all that they have spoken.
Deuteronomy,5,29,Oh that they had such a [mind and] heart in them always [reverently] to fear Me and keep all My commandments that it might go well with them and with their children forever!
Deuteronomy,5,30,Go and say to them Return to your tents.
Deuteronomy,5,31,But you [Moses] stand here by Me and I will tell you all the commandments and the statutes and the precepts which you shall teach them that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess.

Deuteronomy,6,20,When your son asks you in time to come What is the meaning of the testimonies and statutes and precepts which the Lord our God has commanded you?
Deuteronomy,6,21,Then you shall say to your son We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
Deuteronomy,6,22,And the Lord showed signs and wonders great and evil against Egypt against Pharaoh and all his household before our eyes;
Deuteronomy,6,23,And He brought us out from there that He might bring us in to give us the land which He swore to give our fathers.
Deuteronomy,6,24,And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes to [reverently] fear the Lord our God for our good always that He might preserve us alive as it is this day.
Deuteronomy,6,25,And it will be accounted as righteousness (conformity to God's will in word thought and action) for us if we are watchful to do all this commandment before the Lord our God as He has commanded us.
Deuteronomy,7,1,WHEN THE Lord your God brings you into the land which you are entering to possess and has plucked away many nations before you the Hittites the Girgashites the Amorites the Canaanites the Perizzites the Hivites and the Jebusites seven nations greater and mightier than you
Deuteronomy,7,2,And when the Lord your God gives them over to you and you smite them then you must utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them or show mercy to them.
Deuteronomy,7,3,You shall not make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son nor shall you take his daughter for your son
Deuteronomy,7,4,For they will turn away your sons from following Me that they may serve other gods; so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you and He will destroy you quickly.
Deuteronomy,7,5,But thus shall you deal with them: you shall break down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and hew down their Asherim [symbols of the goddess Asherah] and burn their graven images with fire.
Deuteronomy,7,6,For you are a holy and set-apart people to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen you to be a special people to Himself out of all the peoples on the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy,7,7,The Lord did not set His love upon you and choose you because you were more in number than any other people for you were the fewest of all people.
Deuteronomy,7,8,But because the Lord loves you and because He would keep the oath which He had sworn to your fathers the Lord has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondage from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
Deuteronomy,7,9,Know recognize and understand therefore that the Lord your God He is God the faithful God Who keeps covenant and steadfast love and mercy with those who love Him and keep His commandments to a thousand generations
Deuteronomy,7,10,And repays those who hate Him to their face by destroying them; He will not be slack to him who hates Him but will requite him to his face.
Deuteronomy,7,11,You shall therefore keep and do the instruction laws and precepts which I command you this day.
Deuteronomy,7,12,And if you hearken to these precepts and keep and do them the Lord your God will keep with you the covenant and the steadfast love which He swore to your fathers.
Deuteronomy,7,13,And He will love you bless you and multiply you; He will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your land your grain your new wine and your oil the increase of your cattle and the young of your flock in the land which He swore to your fathers to give you.
Deuteronomy,7,14,You shall be blessed above all peoples; there shall not be male or female barren among you or among your cattle.
Deuteronomy,7,15,And the Lord will take away from you all sickness and none of the evil diseases of Egypt which you knew will He put upon you but will lay them upon all who hate you.
Deuteronomy,7,16,And you shall consume all the peoples whom the Lord your God will give over to you; your eye shall not pity them neither shall you serve their gods for that would be a snare to you.
Deuteronomy,7,17,If you say in your [minds and] hearts These nations are greater than we are; how can we dispossess them?
Deuteronomy,7,18,You shall not be afraid of them but remember [earnestly] what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt
Deuteronomy,7,19,The great trials which your eyes saw the signs the wonders the mighty hand and the outstretched arm by which the Lord your God brought you out. So shall the Lord your God do to all the people of whom you are afraid.
Deuteronomy,7,20,Moreover the Lord your God will send the hornet among them until those who are left and hide themselves from you are destroyed.
Deuteronomy,7,21,You shall not dread them for the Lord your God is among you a mighty and terrible God.
Deuteronomy,7,22,And the Lord your God will clear out those nations before you little by little; you may not consume them quickly lest the beasts of the field increase among you.
Deuteronomy,7,23,But the Lord your God will give them over to you and will confuse them with a mighty panic until they are destroyed.
Deuteronomy,7,24,And He will give their kings into your hand and you shall make their name perish from under the heavens; there shall no man be able to stand before you until you have destroyed them.
Deuteronomy,7,25,The graven images of their gods you shall burn with fire. You shall not desire the silver or gold that is on them nor take it for yourselves lest you be ensnared by it for it is an abomination to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,7,26,Neither shall you bring an abomination (an idol) into your house lest you become an accursed thing like it; but you shall utterly detest and abhor it for it is an accursed thing.
Deuteronomy,8,1,ALL THE commandments which I command you this day you shall be watchful to do that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swore to give to your fathers.
Deuteronomy,8,2,And you shall [earnestly] remember all the way which the Lord your God led you these forty years in the wilderness to humble you and to prove you to know what was in your [mind and] heart whether you would keep His commandments or not.
Deuteronomy,8,3,And He humbled you and allowed you to hunger and fed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers know that He might make you recognize and personally know that man does not live by bread only but man lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord.
Deuteronomy,8,4,Your clothing did not become old upon you nor did your feet swell these forty years.
Deuteronomy,8,5,Know also in your [minds and] hearts that as a man disciplines and instructs his son so the Lord your God disciplines and instructs you.
Deuteronomy,8,6,So you shall keep the commandments of the Lord your God to walk in His ways and [reverently] fear Him.
Deuteronomy,8,7,For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land a land of brooks of water of fountains and springs flowing forth in valleys and hills;
Deuteronomy,8,8,A land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of olive trees and honey;
Deuteronomy,8,9,A land in which you shall eat food without shortage and lack nothing in it; a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills you can dig copper.
Deuteronomy,8,10,When you have eaten and are full then you shall bless the Lord your God for all the good land which He has given you.
Deuteronomy,8,11,Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God by not keeping His commandments His precepts and His statutes which I command you today
Deuteronomy,8,12,Lest when you have eaten and are full and have built goodly houses and live in them
Deuteronomy,8,13,And when your herds and flocks multiply and your silver and gold is multiplied and all you have is multiplied
Deuteronomy,8,14,Then your [minds and] hearts be lifted up and you forget the Lord your God Who brought you out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage
Deuteronomy,8,15,Who led you through the great and terrible wilderness with its fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water but Who brought you forth water out of the flinty rock
Deuteronomy,8,16,Who fed you in the wilderness with manna which your fathers did not know that He might humble you and test you to do you good in the end.
Deuteronomy,8,17,And beware lest you say in your [mind and] heart My power and the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth.
Deuteronomy,8,18,But you shall [earnestly] remember the Lord your God for it is He Who gives you power to get wealth that He may establish His covenant which He swore to your fathers as it is this day.
Deuteronomy,8,19,And if you forget the Lord your God and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish.
Deuteronomy,8,20,Like the nations which the Lord makes to perish before you so shall you perish because you would not obey the voice of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,9,1,HEAR O Israel. You are to cross the Jordan today to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you are cities great and fortified up to the heavens
Deuteronomy,9,2,A people great and tall the sons of the Anakim whom you know and of whom you have heard it said Who can stand before the sons of Anak?
Deuteronomy,9,3,Know therefore this day that the Lord your God is He Who goes over before you as a devouring fire. He will destroy them and bring them down before you; so you shall dispossess them and make them perish quickly as the Lord has promised you.
Deuteronomy,9,4,Do not say in your [mind and] heart after the Lord your God has thrust them out from before you It is because of my righteousness that the Lord has brought me in to possess this land--whereas it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is dispossessing them before you.
Deuteronomy,9,5,Not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your [minds and] hearts do you go to possess their land; but because of the wickedness of these nations the Lord your God is driving them out before you and that He may fulfill the promise which the Lord swore to your fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob.
Deuteronomy,9,6,Know therefore that the Lord your God does not give you this good land to possess because of your righteousness for you are a hard and stubborn people.
Deuteronomy,9,7,[Earnestly] remember and forget not how you provoked the Lord your God to wrath in the wilderness; from the day you left the land of Egypt until you came to this place you have been rebellious against the Lord.
Deuteronomy,9,8,Even in Horeb you provoked the Lord to wrath and the Lord was so angry with you that He would have destroyed you.
Deuteronomy,9,9,When I went up the mountain to receive the tables of stone the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I neither ate food nor drank water.
Deuteronomy,9,10,And the Lord delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them were all the words which the Lord spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
Deuteronomy,9,11,And at the end of forty days and forty nights the Lord gave me the two tables of stone the tables of the covenant.
Deuteronomy,9,12,And the Lord said to me Arise go down from here quickly for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made for themselves a molten image.
Deuteronomy,9,13,Furthermore the Lord said to me I have seen this people and behold they are stubborn and hard.
Deuteronomy,9,14,Let me alone that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under the heavens; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.
Deuteronomy,9,15,So I turned and came down from the mountain and the mountain was burning with fire. And the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
Deuteronomy,9,16,And I looked and behold you had sinned against the Lord your God; you had made for yourselves a molten calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way which the Lord had commanded you.
Deuteronomy,9,17,I took the two tables cast them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes.
Deuteronomy,9,18,Then I fell down before the Lord as before for forty days and forty nights; I neither ate food nor drank water because of all the sin you had committed in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord to provoke Him to anger.
Deuteronomy,9,19,For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure which the Lord held against you enough to destroy you. But the Lord listened to me that time also.
Deuteronomy,9,20,And the Lord was very angry with Aaron angry enough to have destroyed him and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
Deuteronomy,9,21,And I took your sin the calf which you had made and burned it with fire and crushed it grinding it very small until it was as fine as dust; and I cast the dust of it into the brook that came down out of the mountain.
Deuteronomy,9,22,At Taberah also and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked the Lord to wrath.
Deuteronomy,9,23,Likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea saying Go up and possess the land which I have given you then you rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God and you did not believe Him or trust and rely on Him or obey His voice.
Deuteronomy,9,24,You have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you.
Deuteronomy,9,25,So I fell down and lay prostrate before the Lord forty days and nights because the Lord had said He would destroy you.
Deuteronomy,9,26,And I prayed to the Lord O Lord God do not destroy Your people and Your heritage whom You have redeemed through Your greatness whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
Deuteronomy,9,27,Remember [earnestly] Your servants Abraham Isaac and Jacob; look not at the stubbornness of this people or at their wickedness or at their sin
Deuteronomy,9,28,Lest the land from which You brought us out say Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which He promised them and because He hated them He has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
Deuteronomy,9,29,Yet they are Your people and Your inheritance whom You brought out by Your mighty power and by Your outstretched arm.
Deuteronomy,10,1,AT THAT time the Lord said to me Hew two tables of stone like the first and come up to Me on the mountain and make an ark of wood.
Deuteronomy,10,2,And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke and you shall put them in the ark.
Deuteronomy,10,3,So I [Moses] made an ark of acacia wood and hewed two tables of stone like the first and went up the mountain with the two tables of stone in my [one] hand.
Deuteronomy,10,4,And the Lord wrote on the tables as at the first writing the Ten Commandments which the Lord had spoken to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly; and the Lord gave them to me.
Deuteronomy,10,5,And I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as the Lord commanded me.
Deuteronomy,10,6,(The Israelites journeyed from the wells of the sons of Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and there he was buried and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.
Deuteronomy,10,7,From there they journeyed to Gudgodah and then to Jotbathah a land of brooks [dividing the valley].
Deuteronomy,10,8,At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord to stand before the Lord to minister to Him and to bless in His name unto this day.
Deuteronomy,10,9,Therefore Levi has no part or inheritance with his brethren; the Lord is his inheritance as the Lord your God promised him.)
Deuteronomy,10,10,And I [Moses] stayed on the mountain as the first time forty days and nights and the Lord listened to me at that time also; the Lord would not destroy you.
Deuteronomy,10,11,And the Lord said to me Arise journey on before the people that they may go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them.
Deuteronomy,10,12,And now Israel what does the Lord your God require of you but [reverently] to fear the Lord your God [that is] to walk in all His ways and to love Him and to serve the Lord your God with all your [mind and] heart and with your entire being
Deuteronomy,10,13,To keep the commandments of the Lord and His statutes which I command you today for your good?
Deuteronomy,10,14,Behold the heavens and the heaven of heavens belong to the Lord your God the earth also with all that is in it and on it.
Deuteronomy,10,15,Yet the Lord had a delight in loving your fathers and He chose their descendants after them you above all peoples as it is this day.
Deuteronomy,10,16,So circumcise the foreskin of your [minds and] hearts; be no longer stubborn and hardened.
Deuteronomy,10,17,For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords the great the mighty the terrible God Who is not partial and takes no bribe.
Deuteronomy,10,18,He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow and loves the stranger or temporary resident and gives him food and clothing.
Deuteronomy,10,19,Therefore love the stranger and sojourner for you were strangers and sojourners in the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy,10,20,You shall [reverently] fear the Lord your God; you shall serve Him and cling to Him and by His name and presence you shall swear.
Deuteronomy,10,21,He is your praise; He is your God Who has done for you these great and terrible things which your eyes have seen.
Deuteronomy,10,22,Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons in all and now the Lord your God has made you as the stars of the heavens for multitude.
Deuteronomy,11,1,THEREFORE YOU shall love the Lord your God and keep His charge His statutes His precepts and His commandments always.
Deuteronomy,11,2,And know this day--for I am not speaking to your children who have not [personally] known and seen it--the instruction and discipline of the Lord your God: His greatness His mighty hand and His outstretched arm;
Deuteronomy,11,3,His signs and His deeds which He did in Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land;
Deuteronomy,11,4,And what He did to the army of Egypt to their horses and chariots how He made the waters of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued you and how the Lord has destroyed them to this day;
Deuteronomy,11,5,And what He did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place;
Deuteronomy,11,6,And what He did to Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab the son of Reuben how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up them their households their tents and every living thing that followed them in the midst of all Israel.
Deuteronomy,11,7,For your eyes have seen all the great work of the Lord which He did.
Deuteronomy,11,8,Therefore you shall keep all the commandments which I command you today that you may be strong and go in and possess the land which you go across [the Jordan] to possess
Deuteronomy,11,9,And that you may live long in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers to give to them and to their descendants a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy,11,10,For the land which you go in to possess is not like the land of Egypt from which you came out where you sowed your seed and watered it with your foot laboriously as in a garden of vegetables.
Deuteronomy,11,11,But the land which you enter to possess is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water of the rain of the heavens
Deuteronomy,11,12,A land for which the Lord your God cares; the eyes of the Lord your God are always upon it from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
Deuteronomy,11,13,And if you will diligently heed My commandments which I command you this day--to love the Lord your God and to serve Him with all your [mind and] heart and with your entire being--
Deuteronomy,11,14,I will give the rain for your land in its season the early rain and the latter rain that you may gather in your grain your new wine and your oil.
Deuteronomy,11,15,And I will give grass in your fields for your cattle that you may eat and be full.
Deuteronomy,11,16,Take heed to yourselves lest your [minds and] hearts be deceived and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them
Deuteronomy,11,17,And the Lord's anger be kindled against you and He shut up the heavens so that there will be no rain and the land will not yield its fruit and you perish quickly off the good land which the Lord gives you.
Deuteronomy,11,18,Therefore you shall lay up these My words in your [minds and] hearts and in your [entire] being and bind them for a sign upon your hands and as forehead bands between your eyes.
Deuteronomy,11,19,And you shall teach them to your children speaking of them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road when you lie down and when you rise up.
Deuteronomy,11,20,And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and on your gates
Deuteronomy,11,21,That your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers to give them as long as the heavens are above the earth.
Deuteronomy,11,22,For if you diligently keep all this commandment which I command you to do to love the Lord your God to walk in all His ways and to cleave to Him--
Deuteronomy,11,23,Then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than you.
Deuteronomy,11,24,Every place upon which the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness to Lebanon and from the River the river Euphrates to the western sea [the Mediterranean] your territory shall be.
Deuteronomy,11,25,There shall no man be able to stand before you; the Lord your God shall lay the fear and the dread of you upon all the land that you shall tread as He has said to you.
Deuteronomy,11,26,Behold I set before you this day a blessing and a curse--
Deuteronomy,11,27,The blessing if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you this day;
Deuteronomy,11,28,And the curse if you will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God but turn aside from the way which I command you this day to go after other gods which you have not known.
Deuteronomy,11,29,And when the Lord your God has brought you into the land which you go to possess you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
Deuteronomy,11,30,Are they not beyond the Jordan west of the road where the sun goes down in the land of the Canaanites living in the Arabah opposite Gilgal beside the oaks or terebinths of Moreh?
Deuteronomy,11,31,For you are to cross over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God gives you and you shall possess it and live in it.
Deuteronomy,11,32,And you shall be watchful to do all the statutes and ordinances which I set before you this day.
Deuteronomy,12,1,THESE ARE the statutes and ordinances which you shall be watchful to do in the land which the Lord the God of your fathers gives you to possess all the days you live on the earth.
Deuteronomy,12,2,You shall surely destroy all the places where the nations you dispossess served their gods upon the high mountains and the hills and under every green tree.
Deuteronomy,12,3,You shall break down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and burn their Asherim with fire; you shall hew down the graven images of their gods and destroy their name out of that place.
Deuteronomy,12,4,You shall not behave so toward the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,12,5,But you shall seek the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put His Name and make His dwelling place and there shall you come;
Deuteronomy,12,6,And there you shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices your tithes and the offering of your hands and your vows and your freewill offerings and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock.

Deuteronomy,12,8,You shall not do according to all we do here [in the camp] this day every man doing whatever looks right in his own eyes.
Deuteronomy,12,9,For you have not yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the Lord your God gives you.
Deuteronomy,12,10,But when you go over the Jordan and dwell in the land which the Lord your God causes you to inherit and He gives you rest from all your enemies round about so that you dwell in safety
Deuteronomy,12,11,Then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause His Name [and His Presence] to dwell there; to it you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings your sacrifices your tithes and what the hand presents [as a first gift from the fruits of the ground] and all your choicest offerings which you vow to the Lord.
Deuteronomy,12,12,And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God you and your sons and your daughters and your menservants and your maidservants and the Levite that is within your towns since he has no part or inheritance with you.
Deuteronomy,12,13,Be watchful not to offer your burnt offerings in every place you see.
Deuteronomy,12,14,But in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of your tribes there you shall offer your burnt offerings and there you shall do all I command you.
Deuteronomy,12,15,However you may kill and eat flesh in any of your towns whenever you desire according to the provision for the support of life with which the Lord your God has blessed you; those [ceremonially] unclean and the clean may eat of it as of the gazelle and the hart.
Deuteronomy,12,16,Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it upon the ground as water.
Deuteronomy,12,17,You may not eat within your towns the tithe of your grain or of your new wine or of your oil or the firstlings of your herd or flock or anything you have vowed or your freewill offerings or the offerings from your hand [of garden products].
Deuteronomy,12,18,But you shall eat them before the Lord your God in the place which the Lord your God shall choose you and your son and your daughter your manservant and your maidservant and the Levite that is within your towns; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God in all that you undertake.

Deuteronomy,12,20,When the Lord your God enlarges your territory as He promised you and you say I will eat flesh because you crave flesh you may eat flesh whenever you desire.
Deuteronomy,12,21,If the place where the Lord your God has chosen to put His Name [and Presence] is too far from you then you shall kill from your herd or flock which the Lord has given you as I [Moses] have commanded you; eat in your towns as much as you desire.
Deuteronomy,12,22,Just as the roebuck and the hart is eaten so you may eat of it [but not offer it]; the unclean and the clean alike may eat of it.
Deuteronomy,12,23,Only be sure that you do not eat the blood for the blood is the life and you may not eat the life with the flesh.
Deuteronomy,12,24,You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the earth like water.
Deuteronomy,12,25,You shall not eat it that all may go well with you and with your children after you when you do what is right in the sight of the Lord.

Deuteronomy,12,28,Be watchful and obey all these words which I command you that it may go well with you and with your children after you forever when you do what is good and right in the sight of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,12,29,When the Lord your God cuts off before you the nations whom you go to dispossess and you dispossess them and live in their land
Deuteronomy,12,30,Be watchful that you are not ensnared into following them after they have been destroyed before you and that you do not inquire after their gods saying How did these nations serve their gods? We will do likewise.
Deuteronomy,12,31,You shall not do so to the Lord your God for every abominable thing which the Lord hates they have done for their gods. For even their sons and their daughters they have burned in the fire to their gods.
Deuteronomy,12,32,Whatever I command you be watchful to do it; you shall not add to it or diminish it.
Deuteronomy,13,1,IF A prophet arises among you or a dreamer of dreams and gives you a sign or a wonder
Deuteronomy,13,2,And the sign or the wonder he foretells to you comes to pass and if he says Let us go after other gods--gods you have not known--and let us serve them
Deuteronomy,13,3,You shall not listen to the words of that prophet or to that dreamer of dreams. For the Lord your God is testing you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your [mind and] heart and with your entire being.
Deuteronomy,13,4,You shall walk after the Lord your God and [reverently] fear Him and keep His commandments and obey His voice and you shall serve Him and cling to Him.
Deuteronomy,13,5,But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death because he has talked rebellion and turning away from the Lord your God Who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage; that man has tried to draw you aside from the way in which the Lord your God commanded you to walk. So shall you put the evil away from your midst.
Deuteronomy,13,6,If your brother the son of your mother or your son or daughter or the wife of your bosom or your friend who is as your own life entices you secretly saying Let us go and serve other gods--gods you have not known you nor your fathers
Deuteronomy,13,7,Of the gods of the peoples who are round about you near you or far away from you from one end of the earth to the other--
Deuteronomy,13,8,You shall not give consent to him or listen to him; nor shall your eye pity him nor shall you spare him or conceal him.
Deuteronomy,13,9,But you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first upon him to put him to death and afterwards the hands of all the people.
Deuteronomy,13,10,And you shall stone him to death with stones because he has tried to draw you away from the Lord your God Who brought you out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage.
Deuteronomy,13,11,And all Israel shall hear and [reverently] fear and shall never again do any such wickedness as this among you.
Deuteronomy,13,12,If you hear it said in one of your cities which the Lord your God has given you in which to dwell
Deuteronomy,13,13,That certain base fellows have gone out from your midst and have enticed away the inhabitants of their city saying Let us go and serve other gods--gods you have not known--
Deuteronomy,13,14,Then you shall inquire and make search and ask diligently. And behold if it is true and certain that such an abominable thing has been done among you
Deuteronomy,13,15,You shall surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword destroying it utterly and all who are in it and its beasts with the edge of the sword.
Deuteronomy,13,16,And you shall collect all its spoil into the midst of its open square and shall burn the city with fire with every bit of its spoil [as a whole burnt offering] to the Lord your God. It shall be a heap [of ruins] forever; it shall not be built again.
Deuteronomy,13,17,And nothing of the accursed thing shall cling to your hand so that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of His anger and show you mercy and have compassion on you and multiply you as He swore to your fathers
Deuteronomy,13,18,If you obey the voice of the Lord your God to keep all His commandments which I command you this day to do what is right in the eyes of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,14,1,YOU ARE the sons of the Lord your God; you shall not cut yourselves or make any baldness on your foreheads for the dead

Deuteronomy,22,19,And they shall fine him 100 shekels of silver and give them to the father of the young woman because he has brought an evil name upon a virgin of Israel. And she shall be his wife; he may not divorce her all his days.
Deuteronomy,22,20,But if it is true that the evidences of virginity were not found in the young woman
Deuteronomy,22,21,Then they shall bring her to the door of her father's house and the men of her city shall stone her to death because she has wrought [criminal] folly in Israel by playing the harlot in her father's house. So you shall put away the evil from among you.
Deuteronomy,22,22,If a man is found lying with another man's wife they shall both die the man who lay with the woman and the woman. So you shall purge the evil from Israel.
Deuteronomy,22,23,If a maiden who is a virgin is engaged to be married and a man finds her in the city and lies with her
Deuteronomy,22,24,Then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city and shall stone them to death--the young woman because she did not cry for help though she was in the city and the man because he has violated his neighbor's [promised] wife. So shall you put away evil from among you.
Deuteronomy,22,25,But if a man finds the betrothed maiden in the open country and the man seizes her and lies with her then only the man who lay with her shall die.
Deuteronomy,22,26,But you shall do nothing to the young woman; she has committed no sin punishable by death for this is as when a man attacks and slays his neighbor
Deuteronomy,22,27,For he came upon her in the open country and the betrothed girl cried out but there was no one to save her.
Deuteronomy,22,28,If a man finds a girl who is a virgin who is not betrothed and he seizes her and lies with her and they are found
Deuteronomy,22,29,Then the man who lay with her shall give to the girl's father fifty shekels of silver and she shall be his wife because he has violated her; he may not divorce her all his days.
