Acts,16,18,"And she kept doing this for many days. But Paul, feeling really annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, 'By the power of Jesus Christ, get out of her.' And the spirit left her immediately."
Acts,16,19,"Then, when her bosses realized that their money-making scheme was ruined, they grabbed Paul and Silas and brought them to the rulers in the central square."
Acts,16,20,"So they brought them to the officials, like, these guys are Jewish and they're like causing major chaos in our city."
Acts,16,21,"And like, they were trying to push these rules on us, but honestly, as Romans, we can't accept that stuff or even follow it."
Acts,16,22,Then the whole crowd ganged up on them: and the officials tore off their outfits and ordered them to get beaten up.
Acts,16,23,"And after beating them up, they threw them into prison and told the jailor to make sure they stayed locked up tight."
Acts,16,24,"When they were given this task, they totally threw them into the super sketchy prison and straight up locked their feet in those old-school stocks."
Acts,16,25,"So, like, it was midnight, right? And Paul and Silas started praying and jamming out to God, and all the peeps locked up with them heard it and everything. It was lit!"
Acts,16,26,"Yo, outta nowhere, there's this huge earthquake that's shaking the foundations of the prison. And boom, just like that, all the doors swing open and everybody's chains break free."
Acts,16,27,"So, this guard wakes up from his nap and notices that the prison doors are wide open. Panicking, he grabs his sword and contemplates ending it all, thinking that the prisoners had escaped."
Acts,16,28,"Yo, Paul straight up shouted at them, like 'Bruh, chill! Don't do anything reckless, we're all right here, fam.'"
Acts,16,29,"So he grabbed his phone flashlight, hopped in, and walked over feeling nervous and excited, then he dropped to the ground in front of Paul and Silas."
Acts,16,30,"So we took them out and asked, yo guys, what's the move to be saved?"
Acts,16,31,"They were like, yo, just trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you'll be saved, along with your fam, fam."
Acts,16,32,"And they started talking to him about what the Lord had to say, and to everyone at his place."
Acts,16,33,"And he immediately took them in the middle of the night, and cleaned up their wounds; and he, along with everyone in his group, got baptized right away."
Acts,16,34,"And when he brought them to his crib, he threw some dank food their way, and celebrated, fully believing in God with his whole crew."
Acts,16,35,"And like, when morning came, the government dudes sent their squad, and they were like, 'Yo, set those bros free, man.'"
Acts,16,36,"So, like, the prison guard comes up to Paul and he's all like, 'Yo, the higher-ups want you free, bro. So, peace out and go on your way, no drama.'"
Acts,16,37,"But Paul was like, 'Dude, they totally publicly beat us without a trial, even though we're Roman citizens! And now they wanna sneakily kick us out? No way, man! They gotta come here and take us out themselves.'"
Acts,16,38,So the guys spilled the tea to the officials: and they were shook when they found out that they were Romans.
Acts,16,39,"So, like, these people came up and were like, 'Hey, could you, like, leave the city?'"
Acts,16,40,"So they left the prison and went to Lydia's crib, and when they saw their squad, they showed them some love and then dipped."
Acts,17,1,"So, like, after they went through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they arrived in Thessalonica, which had this cool synagogue for the Jewish peeps:"
Acts,17,2,"So Paul, being his chill self, joined them and chilled for three sabbath days, having deep convos straight from the scriptures."
Acts,17,3,"Basically, I started off by explaining that it was necessary for Christ to go through suffering and then come back to life. Oh, and by the way, the Jesus I've been talking about is none other than the promised Messiah!"
Acts,17,4,"And like, a bunch of them totally believed and started hanging out with Paul and Silas, you know? And there was this huge crowd of super faithful Greeks who were totally into it, and quite a number of important women also joined in."
Acts,17,5,"But those Jews who didn't believe, fueled by jealousy, recruited some sketchy individuals from the lower ranks of society. They formed a group, stirred up chaos throughout the city, and attacked the house of Jason. Their goal was to drag them out and expose them to the public."
Acts,17,6,"And when they couldn't find them, they grabbed Jason and a few others and brought them before the city authorities, shouting, 'These dudes who be rocking the world have shown up here too!'"
Acts,17,7,"So, like, Jason totally welcomed this person. And apparently, all of them are like totally going against Caesar's rules by claiming that Jesus is, like, some kind of king or whatever."
Acts,17,8,"And they totally shook up the crowd and the city big shots, like, the moment they caught wind of what went down."
Acts,17,9,"So, like, they made Jason and the others give them some kind of commitment or guarantee, and after that, they just let them go."
Acts,17,10,"So, like, right away, the crew sent Paul and Silas off to Berea in the middle of the night. When they arrived there, they totally headed straight to the Jewish synagogue."
Acts,17,11,These people were way cooler than the ones in Thessalonica because they were totally down to listen and they checked out the scriptures every day to make sure they were legit.
Acts,17,12,"So like, a ton of them totally believed, even these super cool Greek ladies and a bunch of dudes too."
Acts,17,13,"But when the Jews in Thessalonica found out that Paul was spreading the word of God in Berea, they went over there too and started causing trouble among the people."
Acts,17,14,"Then, like right away, the squad sent Paul to dip towards the ocean vibes, but Silas and Timotheus stayed put, keeping it chill."
Acts,17,15,"So Paul's squad took him to Athens. Before they set off, they told Silas and Timotheus to hurry up and join them, then they bounced."
Acts,17,16,"So like, Paul was chillin' in Athens, right? But when he peeped the whole city worshipping idols, it totally shook him to the core. Like, they were all about that idolatry life, you know?"
Acts,17,17,"So he had arguments in the synagogue with the Jewish peeps, and with the ones who were all about dat faith life, and even in the marketplace, he would kick it with anyone who crossed his path and had something to say."
Acts,17,18,"So, like, there were these philosophers, you know? Some were all about Epicurus, and others were really into Stoicism. They came across this guy, and some of them were like, 'What's this dude blabbering about?' And others were like, 'He seems to be promoting these weird gods or something.' 'Cause he was preaching to them about Jesus and how He rose from the dead."
Acts,17,19,"So they grabbed him and brought him to Areopagus, saying, 'Hey, can you fill us in on this new teaching you've been talking about?' (Areopagus, also known as Mars' hill, was like the Supreme Court of Athens)"
Acts,17,20,"Yo, you drop some real bizarre vibes on us, fam. Like, what's the deal with these things? We're just tryna understand, you know?"
Acts,17,21,"(Because literally everyone in Athens, both residents and visitors, were completely obsessed with gossiping and staying up-to-date with the latest news.)"
Acts,17,22,"Then Paul, like, stood in this really important place called Mars' hill, and he was like, 'Hey, you dudes from Athens, I can totally see that you're, like, way too superstitious and stuff. Mars' hill, which is, like, the court of the Areopagites, if you didn't know."
Acts,17,23,"So, as I was passing by and checking out your worship vibes, I came across this altar with a label that said, 'TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.' It seems you're worshiping this deity in ignorance, so let me enlighten you about who that actually is. Basically, you had some gods going on there."
Acts,17,24,"Yo, the one who created the whole world and everything in it, knows that he's the boss of both heaven and earth. He doesn't chill in buildings made by humans, though."
Acts,17,25,"God isn't about that worshippedd with human hands' vibe, like He needs anything. He's the one who gives everyone life, breath, and everything they need, ya know?"
Acts,17,26,God has created all people from the same blood to live on the entire earth. He has already planned out the specific times and places for everyone to live.
Acts,17,27,"They should totally search for the Lord, like, maybe try to connect with him and actually find him, 'cause he's, like, not really far from any of us or anything. üôè"
Acts,17,28,"Dude, like, everything about us is all because of Him. We exist, we do stuff, we live... it's all because of Him, ya know? It's like those poets you guys quote, they were onto something when they said we're basically His children too, man."
Acts,17,29,"Since we are like God's children, we shouldn't think that the divine nature is comparable to shiny stuff like gold, silver, or stone that people carve with fancy skills."
Acts,17,30,"Back in the day, God let it slide when people didn't know any better; but now, He's telling everyone, without exception, to turn their lives around and start fresh."
Acts,17,31,"Yo, listen up! The big man upstairs has set a day when He's gonna judge the whole world with fairness, and He's gonna do it through this dude He specifically picked out. And here's a solid guarantee for everyone: He raised this guy from the dead, so you know He means business. Believe it or not, it's legit!"
Acts,17,32,"And like, when they found out about the whole resurrection thing, some started making fun of it, you know? And others were like, 'Okay, tell us more about this stuff later.'"
Acts,17,33,And Paul dipped out from the squad.
Acts,17,34,"Yo, some people were down with him and really believed in what he was all about. One of those peeps was Dionysius the Areopagite, and there was also a woman named Damaris, along with some others who joined them on this faith journey."
Acts,18,1,"So, like, after Paul was done chillin' in Athens, he bounced and made his way to Corinth."
Acts,18,2,"So there was this dude named Aquila, a Jew from Pontus, who had just arrived from Italy with his wife Priscilla. See, Emperor Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Anyway, Aquila and Priscilla ended up meeting them."
Acts,18,3,"And since he was in the same line of work as them, he stayed with them and worked together: because they all made tents for a living."
Acts,18,4,"And like, he was totally dropping knowledge in the synagogue every sabbath, and he managed to persuade both the Jews and the Greeks, you know?"
Acts,18,5,"So, Silas and Timotheus arrived from Macedonia, and Paul felt really compelled to share a strong message with the Jewish people. He testified that Jesus is the Christ, the chosen one from God."
Acts,18,6,"And when they like totally went against Him and started being all disrespectful and saying like, totally irreverent stuff, He was just like, shook, you know? And then He was all like, your bad energy and negative vibes are on your own conscience, it's not my fault at all, seriously. So, starting now, I'm just gonna vibe with the non-Jewish peeps, you feel me?"
Acts,18,7,"Then he left from there and went to this guy's crib called Justus, who was a legit God-follower and happened to live right next to the synagogue."
Acts,18,8,"Crispus, the head honcho at the synagogue, totally vibed with the Lord, and his whole fam jumped on board too. Plus, a bunch of the peeps in Corinth heard the good word and hopped on the faith train, getting baptized and all."
Acts,18,9,"So, like, the Lord was all, talking to Paul in the middle of the night through this epic vision, and He was like, 'Don't be scared, bro, but say what's on your mind and never stay quiet:'"
Acts,18,10,"Don't worry, I'm right there by your side and no one can harm you. There's actually a bunch of awesome people in this city!"
Acts,18,11,"And he stayed there for a whole year and six months, spreading the word of God to the people."
Acts,18,12,"So, like, when Gallio was the big shot in charge of Achaia, the Jews all banded together and totally rebelled against Paul. They dragged him to court and stuff."
Acts,18,13,"They said, 'This person is trying to get others to worship God in a way that goes against the rules.'"
Acts,18,14,"So, like, Paul was about to speak up, but then Gallio, this guy in charge, was like, 'Hey Jews, if it was some serious crime or wicked behavior we're talking about here, then it would make sense for me to hear you out.'"
Acts,18,15,"But, like, if it's all about, you know, just words and names, and your law and stuff, then you can handle it yourselves, fam. 'Cause I'm not gonna be the one to make a call on that kind of stuff, you know what I mean?"
Acts,18,16,And he kicked them off the judgment seat.
Acts,18,17,"So, like, all the Greeks ganged up on Sosthenes, who was, like, in charge of the synagogue and totally gave him a beatdown right there in front of the judge's seat. And Gallio couldn't care less about any of that drama."
Acts,18,18,"So Paul stayed there for a pretty long time and then said bye to his buddies. He hopped on a boat and went to Syria, bringing along Priscilla and Aquila. Oh, and he cut his hair in Cenchrea because he made a promise."
Acts,18,19,So he went to Ephesus and left them there. But he went into the synagogue and started talking with the Jews.
Acts,18,20,"When they wanted him to stay longer, he said no way, not gonna happen;"
Acts,18,21,"But I said goodbye to them, telling them that I absolutely had to go to this lit feast happening in Jerusalem. But don't worry, I'll come back to you, if it's God's vibe. And then I dipped from Ephesus on a boat."
Acts,18,22,"So, like, this dude arrived in Caesarea, said hi to the church peeps, and then headed down to Antioch."
Acts,18,23,"And after he had chilled there for a bit, he bounced and totally explored the whole land of Galatia and Phrygia, boosting all the disciples along the way."
Acts,18,24,"So there was this dude, Apollos, a Jew from Alexandria. This guy was super well-spoken and knew his stuff when it came to the scriptures. He pulled up to Ephesus, ready to preach."
Acts,18,25,"This dude knew what‚Äôs up with the Lord; and he was all about it, sharing and teaching about the Lord without slacking, but only knew about John's baptism."
Acts,18,26,"And he straight up started speaking with confidence in the synagogue: and when Aquila and Priscilla heard what he had to say, they were like, 'Yo, come chill with us,' and they fully explained, like, all the deets about God and stuff to him in the most flawless way."
Acts,18,27,"And when he wanted to go to Achaia, the squad wrote a message, telling the homies to welcome him with open arms. And when he arrived, he straight up hooked up the crew who believed through some serious grace, giving them major support and blessings."
Acts,18,28,"Because he totally owned the Jews, like in front of everyone, by using the scriptures to prove that Jesus is the real deal, the chosen one. Like, the ultimate Christ."
Acts,19,1,"So, like, Apollos was chilling in Corinth, and then Paul rolled up to Ephesus after passing through some nearby areas. And guess what? He stumbled upon a group of peeps who were already disciples."
Acts,19,2,"He asked them, Yo, have y'all experienced the Holy Ghost ever since you started believing? And they were like, No, bro, we haven't even heard if there's such a thing as the Holy Ghost."
Acts,19,3,"And he was like, yo, what's the deal with your baptism situation? And they were like, oh, we got baptized by John, bro."
Acts,19,4,"So Paul was like, 'Yo, John was all about that baptism of repentance. He was telling people to believe in Christ Jesus, who was gonna come after him.'"
Acts,19,5,"When they heard that, they decided to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
Acts,19,6,"And then Paul was like, 'Yo, let me put my hands on them.' And boom, the Holy Ghost showed up and these peeps started speaking in mad languages and speaking some future predictions, y'know."
Acts,19,7,"And there were like 12 dudes, you know."
Acts,19,8,"So, like, he enters the synagogue and straight up starts speaking with confidence for, like, three months. He's debating and convincing people about all things related to the kingdom of God, you know?"
Acts,19,9,"But when some people became stubborn and didn't believe, they started dissing that whole thing in front of everyone. So, he bounced and took his crew with him, and they started debating every day at this spot called Tyrannus' crib."
Acts,19,10,"And this went on for like two years, so basically everyone who lived in Asia got to hear about Jesus and stuff, like it didn't matter if they were Jews or Greeks or whatever."
Acts,19,11,"And yo, God pulled off some real dope miracles through Paul's hands:"
Acts,19,12,"Then they took handkerchiefs or aprons from his body and gave them to the sick, and their diseases healed, and the evil spirits left them."
Acts,19,13,"So there were these Jewish guys, kind of drifters, who decided to try and cast out evil spirits by using the name of the Lord Jesus. They were like, 'Yo, we command you in the name of Jesus, just like Paul does.'"
Acts,19,14,"And there were like seven dudes, sons of this guy named Sceva, who was a Jew and all-important priest, and they were doing their thing."
Acts,19,15,"The bad vibe replied, like, I totally recognize Jesus and Paul, but who are you guys, though?"
Acts,19,16,"Then this dude possessed by a seriously messed up spirit straight up attacked them, defeated them, and totally overpowered them, causing them to run out of that house butt naked and injured."
Acts,19,17,"And everyone in Ephesus, whether they were Jews or Greeks, found out about this. They all got really scared, and they started talking a lot about how amazing Jesus is."
Acts,19,18,"Lots of believers came forward, opened up, and shared about their actions."
Acts,19,19,"A bunch of people who were into all sorts of weird stuff gathered up their books and straight-up burned them in front of everyone. They calculated the value of those books, and dang, it turned out to be worth a whopping fifty grand in silver!"
Acts,19,20,The word of God was flexin' hard and straight up dominating.
Acts,19,21,"Once everything was done, Paul was like, 'Yo, I've got this crazy plan in my head. I'm gonna hit up Macedonia and Achaia, and then head over to Jerusalem. And you know what? I've gotta go to Rome too, after I've been in Jerusalem.'"
Acts,19,22,"Then he DM'ed Timotheus and Erastus, his two trusted squad members, to head over to Macedonia. But he decided to chill in Asia for a while on his own."
Acts,19,23,"And at that time, there was a lot of commotion about that whole movement."
Acts,19,24,"So there was this dude named Demetrius, who was a sick silversmith. He used to make these lit silver shrines for the goddess Diana, and it was a major cash flow for all the other craftsmen in town."
Acts,19,25,"So, like, he gathered all the peeps with the same job and was like, yo guys, we all know that this is how we make that bread."
Acts,19,26,"And you, like, totally see and hear how Paul has been influencing so many people, not just in Ephesus but pretty much all over Asia. He's been lowkey convincing them that those handmade statues aren't actually divine gods, ya know?"
Acts,19,27,"Dude, our whole gig is at serious risk of being trashed! And on top of that, people might start dissing the super powerful goddess Diana and ruining her awesome reputation. She's worshipped by everyone in Asia and the whole world, so we can't let that happen!"
Acts,19,28,"And when they heard {what was said}, they got really angry and started yelling, saying, Diana of the Ephesians is absolutely amazing."
Acts,19,29,"And the entire city was totally shook: they grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus, these Macedonian dudes who were Paul's travel buddies, and everyone burst into the theater like a mob."
Acts,19,30,"And when Paul tried to join the crew, his homies were like, 'Nah, chill.'"
Acts,19,31,"And some of the popular figures from Asia who were close to him messaged him, asking him not to go to the theater."
Acts,19,32,"So, like, everyone started yelling different things, and it was super chaotic 'cause nobody really knew why they were all there in the first place."
Acts,19,33,"Then they pulled Alexander to the front from the crowd, the Jewish folks pushing him forward. And Alexander gave a little wave with his hand, and was about to explain himself to the people."
Acts,19,34,"But once they found out he was a Jew, everyone started shouting in unison for about two hours straight, saying, 'Diana of the Ephesians is totally awesome!'"
Acts,19,35,"And after the townclerk calmed the crowd, he was like, yo dudes from Ephesus, who on this planet doesn't know that our city is all about worshipping the amazing goddess Diana and that dope statue that totally fell from Jupiter?"
Acts,19,36,"So, since these things are pretty undeniable, you should just chill and not do something hasty."
Acts,19,37,Because you've brought these dudes here who ain't stealin' from churches or dissin' your goddess.
Acts,19,38,"So, like, if Demetrius and his crew got some issue with someone, they can take it to court and stuff. The law is all open and there are these deputies and everything, so they can just sort it out there. Ya know, let them handle it legally and stuff. *dabs*"
Acts,19,39,"But if you want to know something about other stuff, it will be decided in a legit meet-up. {legit: or, regular}"
Acts,19,40,"Yo, we're risking getting called out for the chaos that went down today. It's like, we got nothing to back us up, no legit reason why all these people gathered here."
Acts,19,41,"And after saying that, he let everyone go."
Acts,20,1,"Once the chaos settled down, Paul hit up his squad, gave 'em a big hug, and bounced to head over to Macedonia."
Acts,20,2,"And like, after he finished doing his thing in those places and gave them a bunch of motivational speeches, he went to Greece."
Acts,20,3,"So he stayed there for like three months. But then, those sneaky Jews tried to ambush him because he was planning to go to Syria. So, he changed his mind and decided to go back through Macedonia instead."
Acts,20,4,"So this guy named Sopater from Berea, and these other cool dudes Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, and Gaius from Derbe, and Timotheus also joined him as they headed into Asia. Oh, and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia came along too!"
Acts,20,5,These people who went ahead waited for us in Troas.
Acts,20,6,"So we left Philippi after the whole bread situation ended, and made our way to Troas in 5 days. We ended up chilling there for a solid 7 days."
Acts,20,7,"So, like, on the Sunday, when the squad gathered to chill and eat, Paul started dropping some serious knowledge, knowing he was gonna bounce the next day. He kept on speaking non-stop until midnight, man."
Acts,20,8,"Yo, there were mad lit vibes in that upper room where they all came together."
Acts,20,9,"So, there was this dude named Eutychus, y'know? He was sitting by a window, totally knocked out in a deep sleep while Paul was preaching up a storm. And then, outta nowhere, Eutychus falls from the third-floor window and is like, straight-up dead."
Acts,20,10,"So Paul goes over, falls on the guy, and gives him a big hug. He says, 'Chill, don't stress out! He's totally alive!'}"
Acts,20,11,"So, when he finally returned and had some food, and had a long and chill conversation until dawn, he bounced."
Acts,20,12,"And they brought the young man back, and they were pretty relieved."
Acts,20,13,"So, like, we went ahead and hopped on a boat, and cruised over to Assos. Our plan was to pick up Paul there, 'cause he told us in advance that he wanted to walk the rest of the way."
Acts,20,14,"And when he caught up with us at Assos, we gave him the lowdown and rolled over to Mitylene together."
Acts,20,15,"And we kept moving and arrived near Chios the next day; then the following day we reached Samos and stayed at Trogyllium; and the day after that, we made it to Miletus."
Acts,20,16,"So Paul was like, 'I'm gonna sail past Ephesus because I don't wanna waste time in Asia.' He was in a rush to get to Jerusalem for Pentecost, if that was even possible for him."
Acts,20,17,So this dude from Miletus hit up Ephesus and texted the OGs of the church to come through.
Acts,20,18,"So when they came to him, he was like, 'Guys, you already know that since day one I arrived in Asia, I've been with you all the time, no exceptions.'"
Acts,20,19,"Dedicated to the Lord with a humble mindset, shedding plenty of tears, and facing countless struggles brought on by the sneaky Jews."
Acts,20,20,"And I didn't hold back anything that would benefit you, but I straight-up showed you and taught you, both in public and from door to door."
Acts,20,21,"Spreading the word to both Jews and Greeks, telling them to change their ways and believe in God and have faith in our Lord Jesus Christ."
Acts,20,22,"Yo, check it out! So, like, I'm totally heading to Jerusalem, all tied up in the spirit, you know? But here's the thing, I have no clue what's gonna go down when I get there, man. It's gonna be wild!"
Acts,20,23,"But, like, the Holy Ghost keeps telling me in every city that I'm gonna face some serious challenges and tough times ahead, you know? Like, I'll be dealing with all these bonds and afflictions, just waiting for me. It's gonna be intense, man. #HolyGhostVibes"
Acts,20,24,"But like, none of these things bother me at all. I legit don't even care about my own life, as long as I can finish what I'm doing with mad joy. I'm all about spreading the word of the Lord Jesus and sharing the crazy good news about God's grace."
Acts,20,25,"Yo, listen up! I just wanna say, I know all of you, the ones I've been spreading the good news about God's kingdom to, won't be seeing my face around here anymore."
Acts,20,26,"So, like, I gotta say, guys, that today I can totally vouch for myself that I'm, like, totally innocent and not responsible for the harm of anyone. No blood on my hands, fam."
Acts,20,27,Because I ain't held back from spillin' the beans on every single thing God's got in mind.
Acts,20,28,"Yo, listen up, fam! Make sure you look out for yourselves and the whole squad, 'cause the Holy Spirit put you in charge as leaders to take care of God's crew. You gotta nourish the church that God bought with His own blood."
Acts,20,29,"Yo, listen up, I got the 411 on this. Once I peace out, there's gonna be some seriously shady characters tryna infiltrate your squad, and trust me, they ain't gonna show no mercy to any of y'all."
Acts,20,30,"And even among your own crew, there will be people who pop up spewing twisted stuff, trying to lead others astray and grab some followers for themselves."
Acts,20,31,"So like, stay woke and remember, for like three whole years, I was constantly dropping serious knowledge bombs and giving warnings to everyone nonstop, even quarantining with my tears and all."
Acts,20,32,"Yo, fam! I wanna shout out to all y'all and pass you on to God's dope word of grace. It's gonna straight up lift you up, and hook you up with a lit inheritance alongside all the holy ones. #blessed"

Acts,20,34,"Like, you all already know, that I've totally worked hard with my own hands to take care of myself and my crew."
Acts,20,35,"Yo, I've totally shown you everything and like, it's super important that you put in the effort to help out those who are struggling and also keep in mind what Jesus said, yo. He straight up claimed that it's way more dope to give than to receive."
Acts,20,36,"And when he said this, he totally got down on his knees and prayed with everyone there."
Acts,20,37,"And they all started crying so hard, and they ran up to Paul and gave him a big hug and a bunch of kisses,"
Acts,20,38,"He felt super sad about what he said, you know, that they wouldn't see him again. And they rolled with him until he hopped on that ship."
Acts,21,1,"After we ditched them and set sail, we made a beeline for Coos, then the next day we cruised on over to Rhodes, and from there to Patara."
Acts,21,2,So we hopped on a ship heading to Phenicia and got going.
Acts,21,3,"So, like, we found Cyprus and we were like, 'nah, we outta here!' We sailed to Syria and docked at Tyre because that's where we were supposed to unload the ship's cargo."

Acts,21,6,"So, like, after saying our goodbyes, we hopped on a ship and headed back home, you know."
Acts,21,7,"So, like, after we were done with our journey from Tyre, we arrived in Ptolemais, said what's up to the homies, and hung out with them for, like, a day."
Acts,21,8,"And the next day, those of us who were with Paul left and arrived in Caesarea. We went to the crib of Philip, who was one of the top seven evangelists, and stayed with him."
Acts,21,9,"And this dude had four daughters, who were legit virgins and also had the gift of prophecy."
Acts,21,10,"So, like, we were staying there for a while, and then this prophet dude named Agabus showed up, all the way from Judaea."
Acts,21,11,"And when he came to us, he took Paul's belt and tied his own hands and feet. Then he said, 'This is what the Holy Spirit says will happen to the guy who owns this belt. The Jews in Jerusalem will tie him up just like this and hand him over to the non-Jewish people.'"
Acts,21,12,"And when we heard all this, both us and the locals pleaded with him not to head to Jerusalem."
Acts,21,13,"So Paul was like, 'Why are y'all crying and making me so sad? I'm willing to do more than just get arrested, I'm even ready to die for Jesus' sake in Jerusalem.'"
Acts,21,14,"And when he was like, nah, we were like, okay, whatever God wants, man."
Acts,21,15,"After chillin' for a bit, we hopped in our rides and headed to Jerusalem."
Acts,21,16,"Some of the Caesarea disciples came with us and brought along this dude Mnason from Cyprus, who's been following Jesus for a hot minute. We were gonna crash at his place."
Acts,21,17,"When we arrived in Jerusalem, the squad welcomed us with open arms."
Acts,21,18,"The next day, Paul came with us to see James, and all the elders were there too."
Acts,21,19,"After saying hello to them, he enthusiastically shared all the amazing stuff that God did among the non-Jewish peeps through his kickass work."
Acts,21,20,"And when they heard it, they totally praised the Lord, and were like, 'Bro, check it out! There are legit thousands of Jews who have hopped on the belief train, and they're all super hyped about following the law:'"
Acts,21,21,"So, word on the street is that you've been telling Jews who live among non-Jews to ditch Moses. You're apparently saying they don't need to circumcise their kids or follow any customs."
Acts,21,22,So what's the deal? Everyone's gotta gather up because they want to hear that you've arrived.
Acts,21,23,"So, like, do what we're telling you, okay? There are four dudes who are totally committed to this vow thing."
Acts,21,24,"So, like, hang out with them and do this purifying thing together. And make sure you chip in and pay your share so they can shave their heads. It's important for everyone to see that all those rumors about you are total BS and that you're actually living a legit life, following all the rules and stuff."
Acts,21,25,"Regarding the Gentiles who believe, we have communicated and agreed that they don't need to follow all those rules, except for avoiding food offered to idols, consuming blood, eating strangled animals, and engaging in sexual immorality."
Acts,21,26,So Paul gathered the squad and the next day they all got themselves cleaned up and went into the temple. It was to show that their purification period was complete and they were ready to offer sacrifices for everyone.
Acts,21,27,"And after like, almost a week, these Jews from Asia spotted him in the temple, totally causing a ruckus and getting everyone riled up, and then they went and grabbed him."
Acts,21,28,"Yo, listen up, fellow peeps! We need your backup! This dude right here is spreading some serious hate against our peeps, our laws, and this sacred spot. He even had the audacity to let Greeks step foot in the temple and make it all impure."
Acts,21,29,"For, like, they had already seen Trophimus, this dude from Ephesus, with him in the city. And they thought, you know, that Paul had taken him into the temple."
Acts,21,30,"And the entire city was shook, and all the people gathered in one spot: they grabbed Paul and pulled him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were closed."
Acts,21,31,"And as they were about to take him out, the leader of the squad got word that all of Jerusalem was going crazy."
Acts,21,32,"So this guy just rounds up his squad, including soldiers and centurions, and straight up bolts towards them. And when the chief captain and his crew show up, these dudes stop beating up Paul and bounce."
Acts,21,33,"And then the main homie captain came over, snatched him up, put two chains on him, and straight up asked him who he was and what he be up to."
Acts,21,34,"There were people shouting all sorts of things in the crowd, and it was so chaotic that he couldn't figure out what was happening for sure. So he ordered for the person to be taken to the castle."
Acts,21,35,"And when he reached the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the aggressive crowd."
Acts,21,36,"Like, a bunch of people were legit chasing after him, screaming, 'Get rid of this guy!'"
Acts,21,37,"So, like, when Paul was about to go into the castle, he was all like, 'Hey, can I chat with you, chief captain?' And the chief captain was like, 'Wait, can you actually speak Greek?'"
Acts,21,38,"Wait, aren't you that Egyptian dude who recently caused chaos and took like, four thousand murderers out to the wilderness?"
Acts,21,39,"So, like, Paul was all like, 'Yo, listen up! I'm a Jewish dude from Tarsus, this lit city in Cilicia. Don't underestimate it, it's pretty dope. Anyway, bro, I really need you to let me speak to the peeps.'"
Acts,21,40,"So, like, when Paul finally got permission, he went up on the stairs and used hand gestures to get the attention of the crowd. And when it got all quiet, he started speaking to them in Hebrew, saying,"
Acts,22,1,"Yo, guys, listen up, I'm about to explain myself to you."
Acts,22,2,"(And when they heard that he was speaking in Hebrew to them, they became even more quiet, and he said,)"
Acts,22,3,"Yo, listen up! I'm totally a dude, a Jewish dude to be precise. I was born in Tarsus, a rad city in Cilicia, but I was raised right here in this city under the guidance of Gamaliel. He taught me all about following our ancestors' law in the most perfect way. I was super passionate about God, just like all of you are today."
Acts,22,4,"I used to go all out, like hardcore, trying to shut down this whole movement. I was arresting both dudes and chicks, sending them straight to jail. No mercy."
Acts,22,5,"The high priest totally backs me up on this, along with all the elders. They even gave me official letters to bring over to the brothers in Damascus. I made my way there, ready to bring back the ones who were held captive, and bring them to Jerusalem for some serious consequences."
Acts,22,6,"So, like, while I was on my trip, getting close to Damascus in the middle of the day, outta nowhere this huge light surrounded me, coming straight from heaven, you know?"
Acts,22,7,"So, I totally face planted and suddenly heard this voice saying, 'Yo, Saul, Saul, why you gotta come at me like that?'"
Acts,22,8,"So, I'm like, 'Yo, who are you, bro?' And then he's like, 'I'm Jesus from Nazareth, man - the one you've been giving a hard time.'"
Acts,22,9,"And, like, the people with me totally saw this awesome light and got scared, but they didn't actually hear the voice of the guy talking to me."
Acts,22,10,"So, like, I was all like, 'Yo, what's the move, Lord?' And the Lord goes, 'Dude, get up and head to Damascus. That's where you'll find out what you gotta do, straight up.'"
Acts,22,11,"And like, dude, I couldn't see anything because that light was so freaking blinding, but yo, they guided me by the hand and I ended up in Damascus."
Acts,22,12,"So there was this guy, Ananias, who was super religious and followed all the rules. He had a great reputation among all the Jewish peeps living in that area."
Acts,22,13,"This dude came up to me, stood there, and was like, 'Yo bro Saul, get your vision back.' And boom, I looked up at him immediately."
Acts,22,14,"And he was like, yo, the God of our ancestors has totally picked you to know what he wants, and to like, meet this righteous dude and listen to what he's gotta say."
Acts,22,15,"So, like, you gotta share with everyone what you've seen and heard, okay? Spread the word, be his witness to everyone, man!"
Acts,22,16,"Yo, why you waiting around? Get up, get baptized, and cleanse yourself from all your wrongdoings, while callin' on the Lord's name."
Acts,22,17,"So, when I went back to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I suddenly went into a trance;"
Acts,22,18,"And then he appeared to me saying, like, 'Hurry up and skedaddle out of Jerusalem ASAP, 'cause they ain't gonna listen to your story about me."
Acts,22,19,"So, I was like, yo Lord, you know how I've been throwin' peeps in jail and like, straight up whippin' 'em in every temple 'cause they believed in you, right?"
Acts,22,20,"Yo, when they spilled the blood of that martyr Stephen, I was right there, lowkey agreeing with his execution, and holding onto the clothes of the ones who did it."
Acts,22,21,"So, like, he told me to bounce, you know? 'Cause I'm about to be sent way far away to, like, the non-Jewish peeps."
Acts,22,22,"They totally listened to what he was saying, and then they started yelling out, like 'Get rid of this person from the Earth, they shouldn't even be alive.'"
Acts,22,23,"And like, they shouted and absolutely yeeted their clothes and yeeted clumps of dust into the air,"
Acts,22,24,"The big boss ordered to bring him to the headquarters, and told them to interrogate him with some intense questioning; so he could understand why everyone was freaking out about him."
Acts,22,25,"And like, when they were tying him up with those thongs, Paul straight up said to the centurion standing there, 'Yo, is it even legal for you to whip a dude who's a Roman citizen, and hasn't even been tried or anything?'"
Acts,22,26,"When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, like, dude, be careful with your moves: this guy is a true Roman, okay?"
Acts,22,27,"So this big shot comes up to him and is like, 'Yo, you a Roman?' And he's like, 'Yeah, man!'"
Acts,22,28,"The leader dude was like, yo, I had to pay a lot to get this freedom. And Paul was like, nah man, I was born with it."
Acts,22,29,"And suddenly they let him go, the ones who were about to interrogate him. And even the captain was spooked when he found out he was a Roman citizen and now realized he had wrongly put him in chains."
Acts,22,30,"The next day, because he wanted to find out exactly why the Jews were accusing him, he set him free from his chains, and ordered the high priests and their council to show up. He brought Paul down and presented him to them."
Acts,23,1,"So, like, Paul was totally focused on the council and he was all like, 'Yo dudes, I've been living with a clear conscience before God up until now.'"
Acts,23,2,"Then the high priest Ananias was all like, 'Yo, guys! Give this dude a good smack on the mouth!'"
Acts,23,3,"Paul straight up called him out like, bro, God's gonna totally strike you down, you hypocrite! How can you sit there acting all high and mighty, judging me based on the law, but then turn around and order me to be punished against the law? Not cool, man."
Acts,23,4,"And the people nearby were like, 'Are you seriously dissin' God's top dog priest?'"
Acts,23,5,"Paul was like, 'Yo, my bad, y'all. I didn't realize that was the high priest, 'cause you know it's written, 'Thou shalt not diss the ruler of your peeps.'"
Acts,23,6,"So, like, Paul realized that some people in the council were Sadducees and others were Pharisees, and he's all like, 'Hey guys, listen up, I'm a Pharisee, just like my dad. They're calling me out on my beliefs about the hope and resurrection of the dead.'"
Acts,23,7,"And when he said that, there was, like, a huge drama going down between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The crowd was totally split on what to believe."
Acts,23,8,"So like, the Sadducees are all like, 'Nah, there's no resurrection and no angels or spirits, bruh.' But the Pharisees, on the other hand, they're like, 'Yeah, we totally believe in all of that! Angels, spirits, resurrection and all!'"
Acts,23,9,"So then everyone started freaking out, and the scribes from the Pharisees' crew got up and started arguing, saying, 'We don't see anything wrong with this dude. But if a ghost or an angel really spoke to him, maybe we shouldn't be picking a fight with God.'"
Acts,23,10,"So, like, there was this huge argument and the main guy in charge got super scared that Paul would get totally attacked by the angry mob. He ordered his soldiers to quickly rescue Paul from them and bring him into the fortress."
Acts,23,11,"And like, that night, God comes up to him and says, 'Hey, Paul! Don't stress, bro. Just like how you spoke up about me in Jerusalem, you gotta spread the word in Rome too, ya know?'"
Acts,23,12,"In the morning, some of the Jewish peeps joined forces and made a hardcore pact to swear that they won't eat or drink until they take out Paul. No joke, they were dead serious about it. Like, swear on their lives serious."
Acts,23,13,"And there were like, over 40 peeps who plotted this whole thing."
Acts,23,14,"So, they went to the top religious leaders and older folks, and were like, 'Yo, we've made a super intense promise to not eat anything until we take down Paul!'"
Acts,23,15,"So, like, you guys need to tell the chief captain that he should bring that dude down to you tomorrow. Act as if you want to get more info on him, you know, casually. And just so you know, we're totally prepared to take him out before he even gets close."
Acts,23,16,"And when Paul's cousin heard about their plotting, he went to the party spot, snuck in, and spilled the tea to Paul."
Acts,23,17,"So Paul was like, 'Yo, centurion dude, come here!' And he said, 'Bring this young dude to the head honcho, 'cause he's got something important to tell him.'"
Acts,23,18,"So he like, took him and brought him to the big boss, and was like, 'Yo, Paul the prisoner told me to bring this dude to you, 'cause he's got something important to say.'"
Acts,23,19,"Then the main dude grabbed his hand and they went off to the side, all hush-hush, and he asked, 'Yo, what's the scoop you wanna spill?'"
Acts,23,20,"So basically, this person was like, 'Yo, the Jews want you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow. They act like they wanna ask him some questions and stuff.'"
Acts,23,21,"But don't give in to them, dude. There's like over 40 homies lurking, who made a crazy oath not to eat or drink until they take him out. They're all prepped and waiting for some assurance from you."
Acts,23,22,"Like, the head honcho officer totally let the young dude bounce and was like, yo, don't spill the beans to anyone about what you just spilled to me, alright?"
Acts,23,23,"So he's like, 'Yo, get two centurions and tell 'em to gather a squad of 200 soldiers to roll out to Caesarea. And make sure there are 70 horsemen and 200 spearmen too. We outta here at 3 am sharp, boys!"
Acts,23,24,"Yo, get some lit animals so they can carry Paul and make sure he arrives safely to Governor Felix."
Acts,23,25,"So like, he wrote a letter and it was like this:"
Acts,23,26,"Yo, Governor Felix, it's Claudius Lysias coming at ya with some mad respect."
Acts,23,27,"So, like, these Jews were totally about to kill this dude, but I swooped in with my squad and saved him, 'cause I found out he was a Roman. Just doing my thing, you know?"
Acts,23,28,"When I wanted to find out why they were accusing him, I brought him before their crew:"
Acts,23,29,"So this person I observed was being accused of breaking their laws, but there wasn't any solid evidence to prove that they deserved to be executed or imprisoned."
Acts,23,30,"So, when I got word that the Jews were plotting against this guy, I immediately sent a message to you and instructed his accusers to spill the tea on him. Catch you later."
Acts,23,31,"So, like, the soldiers did what they were told and took Paul, sneaking him off to Antipatris under the cover of night."
Acts,23,32,The next day they let the horsemen join him and went back to the castle:
Acts,23,33,"So like, when they rolled up to Caesarea and dropped off the letter to the governor, they also brought Paul and put him in front of the governor, you know."
Acts,23,34,"So, like, the governor read the letter and was all like, 'Yo, where's this dude from?' And then, when he found out that he was from Cilicia..."
Acts,23,35,"When your haters show up, I'll listen to what you have to say, alright? And then he told them to keep him locked up in Herod's courthouse."
Acts,24,1,"So, like, after five days, this dude named Ananias, who was the high priest, rolls up with the elders and this speaker guy named Tertullus, and he spills the tea to the governor about Paul."
Acts,24,2,"So, like, when Tertullus started accusing him, he was all like, 'Dude, because of you we're living in total peace and doing amazing things for our nation, thanks to your amazing leadership and all'"
Acts,24,3,"Dude, we totally appreciate that all the time and everywhere, bro Felix. Super grateful, no doubt."
Acts,24,4,"Yo, I don't wanna drag this out, but can you please hear us out real quick? We just got a few things to say, and we really hope you'll be cool about it."
Acts,24,5,"Yo, this guy we've come across is totally causing chaos and stirring up trouble among all the Jews across the globe. He's like the main leader of the Nazarenes, man."
Acts,24,6,"This person was totally disrespecting the temple, so we apprehended them and were planning to give them a fair trial according to our laws."
Acts,24,7,"But then this super intense guy Lysias showed up and totally swooped in, snatching him right out of our grip with major force."
Acts,24,8,"He told his accusers to come to you, so that by questioning them, you can find out for yourself all the things we're accusing him of."
Acts,24,9,"The Jews were like, 'Yeah, that's true!'"
Acts,24,10,"So, like, Paul, after the governor like signaled him to speak, was all, 'Yo, I know you've been a judge for, like, hella years in this nation, so I'ma answer your questions with mad enthusiasm and confidence.'"
Acts,24,11,"So, just so you know, it's been only twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship."
Acts,24,12,"And like, they totally didn't catch me causing any drama in the temple, or stirring up the crowd, or even in the synagogues or the city, you know?"
Acts,24,13,"They can't back up any of the things they're accusing me of, it's all just talk and no evidence."
Acts,24,14,"Yo, I gotta be real with you here. Even though some people label it as heresy, I'm all about worshipping the God my ancestors worshipped. I believe in everything that's written in the law and the prophets, no doubt."
Acts,24,15,"And like, you know, stay hopeful and stuff towards God, cuz even they believe that there's gonna be, like, a resurrection of all the dead, no matter if they were good peeps or not."
Acts,24,16,And here's what I work on: making sure I always have a clear conscience when it comes to God and other people.
Acts,24,17,"So, like, after a bunch of years, I showed up to hook up my people with some good vibes and offerings."
Acts,24,18,"So, like, these Jews from Asia caught me in the temple being all pure and chill, not causing any commotion or making a scene."
Acts,24,19,"Who should have been here before you, and raise any concerns if they had any issues with me."
Acts,24,20,"Otherwise, ask these peeps right here if they got any dirt on me while I was up in front of the council."
Acts,24,21,"But there's this one thing I gotta say, when I was chilling with them, I brought up the whole resurrection of the dead and now y'all are grillin' me about it."
Acts,24,22,"And when Felix heard all that, and he knew about it more accurately, he decided to hold off and said, once Lysias the top boss arrives, I'll have a full understanding of what's going on with you."
Acts,24,23,"Then he told the centurion to watch over Paul, and to allow him to have freedom, and not stop any of his friends from helping or visiting him."
Acts,24,24,"So, like, after a few days, Felix and his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish and all, they called for Paul and listened to him talk about, you know, the whole faith in Christ thing."
Acts,24,25,"So this dude was talking about doing the right thing, being in control, and the consequences that are gonna happen later. And it totally freaked out Felix, like he was shaking and stuff. And he was like, 'Alright, man, I'll catch you later when I have more time.'"
Acts,24,26,He was hoping to get some money from Paul so he could set him free. That's why he kept calling him more often and had conversations with him.
Acts,24,27,"But after two years, this guy named Porcius Festus enters Felix's place, and Felix, wanting to please the Jews, leaves Paul in chains."
Acts,25,1,"So like, when Festus arrived in the province, after three days he headed from Caesarea up to Jerusalem."
Acts,25,2,"So, like, the head priest and the top Jews, they came up to him and told him about Paul, and they were all begging him,"
Acts,25,3,They wanted to trick him into coming to Jerusalem so they could ambush and eliminate him.
Acts,25,4,"But Festus was like, nah, let's keep Paul in Caesarea for now, and I'll bounce outta here real soon."
Acts,25,5,"So, like, anyone among you who thinks they've got the skills, come roll with me and bring up any charges against this dude if he's done anything wrong."
Acts,25,6,"So, after hanging out with them for, like, over ten days, he went down to Caesarea. The next day, while casually sitting on the judgment seat, he was like, 'Hey, bring Paul over here.' (By the way, some copies say it was only eight or ten days, not more than that.)"
Acts,25,7,"And once he arrived, the Jews from Jerusalem surrounded him and made a bunch of serious complaints against Paul, but they couldn't back them up with evidence."
Acts,25,8,"So, when he was defending himself, I didn't do anything wrong, bro. I didn't break any Jewish laws, disrespect the temple, or even go against Caesar, like seriously. No offenses here, dude."
Acts,25,9,"But Festus, like, trying to make the Jews happy, responded to Paul and was like, 'Yo, are you down to go up to Jerusalem and let them judge you there in front of me?'"
Acts,25,10,"So Paul was like, 'Yo, I'm standing in front of Caesar's judgment seat, where they're gonna judge me. Just so you know, I didn't do anything wrong to the Jews, and you totally know that."
Acts,25,11,"Yo, if I've done anything wrong or deserve to face the consequences, I ain't gonna shy away from it. But if these peeps ain't got no legit accusations against me, ain't nobody gonna hand me over to 'em. I ain't playin' around, I'm takin' this to Caesar."
Acts,25,12,"So Festus, after discussing it with the crew, responded, 'Did you really ask to go to Caesar? Then off to Caesar you shall go.'"
Acts,25,13,"So like, after a while, King Agrippa and Bernice rolled up to Caesarea to say what's up to Festus."
Acts,25,14,"So, like, after chillin' there for a while, Festus straight up told King Agrippa about Paul's situation, you know? He was all like, 'Yo, there's this dude Paul who got stuck in prison by Felix, and he's still locked up and stuff'."
Acts,25,15,"When I was in Jerusalem, the top priests and elders of the Jewish community came up to me and spilled the tea about this person, hoping to get some serious justice on them."
Acts,25,16,"I was like, dude, the Romans don't just send someone off to die without giving them a chance to face their accusers and defend themselves against the crimes they're accused of, ya know?"
Acts,25,17,"So, when they arrived here, I wasted no time and the very next day, I took my seat on the judgment throne and ordered the dude to be brought forward."
Acts,25,18,"So, like, when those people were accusing me, they didn't even bring up any of the stuff I thought they would!"
Acts,25,19,"But they had some questions because of their own old beliefs, and they were wondering about this guy Jesus, who died but Paul insisted was alive."
Acts,25,20,"And because I was unsure about these kinds of things, I asked {them} if they were planning to go to Jerusalem and settle these matters there. {I was unsure...: or, I didn't know how to investigate this}"
Acts,25,21,"So, like, Paul was all, 'Yo, I wanna take my case to Augustus,' and I was like, 'Sure, I'll keep you chill until I can send you to Caesar.' (BTW, 'hearing' also means judgmentt,' just so you know.)"
Acts,25,22,"Agrippa was like, 'Yo, Festus, I wanna hear this guy for myself too. Tomorrow, he's gonna drop some knowledge on ya.'"
Acts,25,23,"The next day, when Agrippa and Bernice came in with a big show and went into the courtroom, accompanied by top-notch authority figures and influential people from the city, Paul was brought out in obedience to Festus' orders."
Acts,25,24,"So like, Festus was all like, 'Yo King Agrippa and everyone here, you peeps see this guy? The whole Jewish crew has been giving me major trouble about him, at both Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ain't worthy of living anymore.'"
Acts,25,25,"But, like, when I realized that he didn't actually do anything deserving of death, and, like, he even asked to be heard by Augustus, I decided to send him."
Acts,25,26,"I don't have anything specific to write to my lord, so I brought him before you, especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after examining him, I'll have something to write."
Acts,25,27,"Like, it just doesn't make sense to me to like, send a prisoner without even saying what they're accused of, you know?"
Acts,26,1,"So Agrippa was like, 'Yo Paul, go ahead and speak up for yourself.' And Paul was like, 'Bet.' He reached out his hand and started speaking up for himself:"
Acts,26,2,"Yo, King Agrippa, I'm actually stoked right now because I get to defend myself today against all the accusations brought up by the Jews."
Acts,26,3,"Yo, I'm fully aware that you're a pro when it comes to all the traditions and issues in the Jewish community. That's why I'm sincerely asking you to vibe with me and listen up."
Acts,26,4,"All the Jews know how I've been living since I was young, starting from when I was with my own people in Jerusalem."
Acts,26,5,"Those who've known me since the beginning can vouch for me, that I used to be all about that straight-up, strict Pharisee life."
Acts,26,6,"So like, here I am getting judged for this super hopeful promise made by God to our ancestors, you know?"
Acts,26,7,"To this epic promise, our squad of twelve tribes is constantly flexing on serving God 24/7, all day, all night. We're all about that hope life, and that's exactly why those hater Jews are throwing shade at me, King Agrippa."
Acts,26,8,"Yo, why you trippin', acting like it's so unbelievable that God can bring people back to life?"
Acts,26,9,"Honestly, I was sitting here thinking that I should totally do a bunch of stuff that's, like, totally against Jesus of Nazareth's name, you know?"
Acts,26,10,"So, like, I did the same in Jerusalem, you know? I locked up a bunch of holy peeps in jail, all because the big priests said so. And, like, when they got killed, I totally went along with it, you know?"
Acts,26,11,"And I seriously gave them a hard time at every gathering place, and made them say disrespectful things; and I was ridiculously obsessed with going after them, chasing them all the way to distant cities."
Acts,26,12,"So, like, I was on my way to Damascus, right? And I had this legit authority and commission from the chief priests, you know?"
Acts,26,13,"Yo, king, at noon I straight up saw this lit light from heaven, like, brighter than the sun, just shining all around me and my squad on the road."
Acts,26,14,"So, like, we all ended up on the ground, and I straight up heard this voice talking to me, saying in Hebrew, Saull, Saul, why are you hating on me, bro? It's not gonna end well for you if you keep fighting against what I'm saying.'"
Acts,26,15,"So, like, I was all like, 'Who are you, dude?' And Jesus was like, 'I'm Jesus, man, the one you've been messing with.'"
Acts,26,16,"Yo, get up and get on your feet, cuz I showed up to you with a purpose. I'm here to make you a minister and a witness of all the sick things you've seen, and all the sick things I'm gonna show you in the future."
Acts,26,17,"Like, I got your back and I'm gonna save you from all those haters and non-believers, ya know? I'm sending you to preach the word to them peeps!"
Acts,26,18,"To help them see clearly, and to guide them away from darkness towards light, and from the control of Satan to God, so that they can receive forgiveness for their mistakes, and become part of the blessed group who are made holy through their trust in me."
Acts,26,19,"So, like, King Agrippa, I totally didn't ignore that epic vision from heaven:"
Acts,26,20,"So basically, he went and shared the news in places like Damascus, Jerusalem, and all over Judaea. And then, he reached out to the Gentiles too. He gave them a heads up, telling them they gotta change their ways, turn to God, and actually do some good stuff to show they mean it."
Acts,26,21,"So, like, these Jews totally caught me at the temple and were out to get me, ready to do some serious harm."
Acts,26,22,"So, like, with God's help and all, I've been going strong till this day, spreading the word to everyone, from the littlest to the biggest, just sayin' exactly what the prophets and Moses had said would happen, ya know?"
Acts,26,23,"It was necessary for Christ to go through tough times, be the first one to come back to life, and spread enlightenment to both the people and the non-Jews."
Acts,26,24,"And as he was talking like that, Festus shouted loudly, Paull, you're out of your mind; your extensive knowledge is driving you crazy.'"
Acts,26,25,"But he was like, 'Nah, I ain't trippin' here, most righteous Festus; just keep it real and speak the truth, no cap'."
Acts,26,26,"The king is totally aware of all this, and I can talk openly with him. I truly believe he knows everything, because this whole thing isn't some secret that happened behind closed doors."
Acts,26,27,"Yo, King Agrippa, you feelin' the prophets? I know you're on board with them."
Acts,26,28,"And Agrippa was like, 'Bro, you almost got me convinced to become a Christian.'"
Acts,26,29,"And Paul was like, honestly, I really wish that not only you, but also everyone who's listening to me right now, could be just as cool as me, except without these annoying chains holding me back."
Acts,26,30,"And after he said that, the king, the governor, Bernice, and all the people sitting with them got up:"
Acts,26,31,"And when they stepped away, they had a private conversation, like, 'Dude, this guy hasn't done anything that deserves punishment or being held captive.'"
Acts,26,32,"Agrippa told Festus, like, this dude could've been totally free if he hadn't gone and appealed to Caesar. So intense, bro."
Acts,27,1,"So, like, it was decided that we should head to Italy, and they handed over Paul and a few other prisoners to this guy named Julius, who was actually a centurion in Augustus' squad."
Acts,27,2,"So, we hopped on this dope ship from Adramyttium, planning to sail along the Asian shores. Oh, and by the way, we had Aristarchus, this lit Macedonian dude from Thessalonica, chilling with us."
Acts,27,3,"The next day, we stopped by Sidon. Julius was really cool to Paul, giving him the freedom to hang out with his buddies and chill for a bit."
Acts,27,4,"And when we dipped out of there, we cruised past Cyprus 'cause the wind was being a total buzzkill."
Acts,27,5,"So, like, after crossing the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we arrived at Myra, this totally rad city in Lycia."
Acts,27,6,"And then the centurion spotted a dope ship from Alexandria heading to Italy, so he was like, 'Yo, hop on fam,' and we all got on board."
Acts,27,7,"So, like, after we were, you know, sailing for, like, quite a long time and stuff, and we could barely make it across that place called Cnidus 'cause the wind was, like, totally against us, we decided to, like, sail below Crete, right across from Salmone. (BTW, Crete is also called Candy, just, you know, FYI)"
Acts,27,8,"And, like, after barely making it, they arrived at this place called The fair havens; pretty close to where the city of Lasea was located."
Acts,27,9,"So, like, after a long time passed and sailing became super risky because the fasting period was already over, Paul was like, 'Yo guys, heads up, the fasting thing happened on the tenth day of the seventh month, just FYI.'"
Acts,27,10,"Yo, dudes, I'm getting vibes that this trip is gonna be rough and super damaging. Not only will we lose all our cargo and the ship, but our lives are at risk too. (hurt: or, injury)"
Acts,27,11,But the centurion totally trusted the boss-man of the ship more than whatever Paul was saying.
Acts,27,12,"But since the harbor wasn't ideal for wintering, most people agreed to leave and try to reach Phenice instead, where they could spend the winter. Phenice, a harbor in Crete, is located in the southwest and northwest directions."
Acts,27,13,"And when the gentle breeze came from the south, thinking they had achieved what they wanted, they set sail along the coast of Crete."
Acts,27,14,"But like, not even that long after, this super intense wind storm came out of nowhere and it was called Euroclydon. Yeah, it totally hit them hard and stuff. #crazyweather"
Acts,27,15,"So, like, when the ship got caught in this crazy storm and couldn't sail against the wind, we were like, 'whatever' and just went with the flow."
Acts,27,16,"So, like, as we sailed under this cool island called Clauda, we totally had a major struggle trying to maneuver the boat like whoa:"
Acts,27,17,"Then they lifted it up and used supports to secure the ship. Worried about getting stuck in the treacherous sandbars, they lowered the sails and let the wind carry them."
Acts,27,18,"So like, we were like totally getting rocked by this crazy storm, and then the next day, they like started throwing stuff off the ship to make it lighter, you know?"
Acts,27,19,"And on the third day, we chucked the ship's gear ourselves."
Acts,27,20,"And like, the sun and stars were, like, totally gone for, like, a long time, and there was this crazy storm and stuff, and we were seriously losing all hope that we'd make it out alive."
Acts,27,21,"So, like, after not doing anything for a while, Paul stepped up and was like, 'Guys, you should've listened to me and not left Crete. We wouldn't be dealing with all this trouble and loss right now.'"
Acts,27,22,"Yo, listen up! I gotta encourage you to stay positive: nobody's gonna die here, except for the ship. So don't trip!"
Acts,27,23,"So, like, this angel of God came up to me last night, you know? They're totally on my side and I'm all about serving them, too."
Acts,27,24,"Paul, chill out, bro. You're gonna meet Caesar, no worries. And guess what? God's got your back, and everyone on this ship too!"
Acts,27,25,"Yo, dudes, don't stress: I totally trust in God that everything is gonna go just like He said it would."
Acts,27,26,"But yo, we gotta end up on this specific island."
Acts,27,27,"But like, after fourteen nights, we were just getting tossed around in Adria, and then around midnight, the shipmen were like, 'Yo, we're getting close to land or something'."
Acts,27,28,"They dropped the anchor and measured the depth to be twenty fathoms. A while later, they measured again and found it to be fifteen fathoms."
Acts,27,29,"So, like, they were really worried that we might crash into some rocks, ya know? And to avoid that, they threw four anchors from the back of the boat and were like praying for the day to come ASAP."
Acts,27,30,"And like, the sailors were about to like, jump off the ship and stuff, but then they, you know, lowered the boat into the sea, pretending like they were gonna throw down anchors from the front of the ship and stuff."
Acts,27,31,"Paul told the centurion and the soldiers, 'If these others don't stay on the ship, we won't make it out alive.'"
Acts,27,32,The soldiers totally yeeted the ropes off the boat and let it go free.
Acts,27,33,"As the day was dawning, Paul pleaded with everyone to have some grub, like yo, listen up. We've been fasting for fourteen whole days, like not eating anything and it's been crazy."
Acts,27,34,"Yo fam, I recommend you grab a snack ‚Äì it's good for your well-being. Trust me, not a single strand of hair is gonna fall from any of y'all's heads."
Acts,27,35,"And like, after saying that, he grabbed some bread and gave thanks to God in front of everyone. And then he broke it and started eating, you know."
Acts,27,36,"And they were all stoked, and they also grabbed some food."
Acts,27,37,"And like, there were like, 216 dudes with us on the ship and stuff."
Acts,27,38,"And after they had eaten their fill, they decided to lighten the ship by chucking the wheat into the sea."
Acts,27,39,"And when it was morning, they had no clue where they were: but they stumbled upon this sick creek with a lit shore, and they were like, 'Yo, let's try to steer the ship in there, if it's doable.'"
Acts,27,40,"And once they pulled up the anchors, they were like, 'let's go full speed ahead into the sea!' They untied the rudder bands and raised the mainsail, catching the wind and heading towards the shore. (They didn't bother bringing the anchors back, they just left them in the sea.)"
Acts,27,41,"So, like, the ship landed in this spot where two seas were colliding. The front part got totally stuck and couldn't budge, but the back part got wrecked by the huge waves."
Acts,27,42,"So the soldiers were like, 'Yo, we should totally take out the prisoners to prevent any of them from escaping by swimming.'"
Acts,27,43,"But this centurion dude, totally wanting to save Paul, stopped those peeps from doing their thing; and was like, 'Yo, all y'all who are good swimmers, jump into the ocean first and make it to land, you know?!"
Acts,27,44,"And the others, some on floating planks, and some on wreckage of the ship. And guess what? They all made it safely to the land."
Acts,28,1,"And once they got away, they found out that the island was called Melita."
Acts,28,2,"The uncultured peeps were actually pretty chill with us: they lit up a fire and welcomed all of us, yo! It was all 'cause it was raining hard and hella cold, you know?"
Acts,28,3,"So like, Paul grabbed a bunch of sticks and threw them on the fire, right? And then this snake came out of nowhere and bit him on the hand, major ouch."
Acts,28,4,"And when the savages peeped the {vicious} creature chilling on his hand, they whispered to each other, like, for sure this dude is a killer. Even though he survived the ocean, karma won't let him live."
Acts,28,5,"Then he quickly flicked the creature off and into the fire and didn't feel any harm, no cap."
Acts,28,6,"But, like, they were totally expecting him to, like, inflate or like, collapse and die all of a sudden. But, after they kept staring for, like, a long time and saw that nothing bad happened to him, they totally changed their minds and were all like, 'Dude, he's like a legit god'."
Acts,28,7,"Yo, in that same area, there were some pretty swaggy goods owned by the main dude of the island, his name was Publius. He welcomed us and let us crash at his place for three days, no cap, super nice of him."
Acts,28,8,"So, there was this one time when Publius' dad got really sick with a crazy high fever and a gnarly stomach issue. And then, out of nowhere, Paul shows up, offers up a heartfelt prayer, lays his hands on the guy, and BAM! Instant healing, just like that!"
Acts,28,9,"And after this happened, more people on the island who were sick with diseases came and got healed too:"
Acts,28,10,"They showed us mad respect, giving us so much love and when it was time to leave, they hooked us up with all the stuff we needed."
Acts,28,11,"So like, after three months, we bounced on this awesome ship from Alexandria that had been chillin' on the island all winter. And get this, the ship's vibe was all about Castor and Pollux."
Acts,28,12,"And when we got to Syracuse, we stayed there for, like, three whole days."
Acts,28,13,"Then we decided to change our course and headed towards Rhegium. After one day, a strong south wind picked up and we arrived in Puteoli the following day."
Acts,28,14,"So, like, we met up with our fellow peeps and they were all like, 'Yo, chill with us for a solid week.' And we were like, 'Sure, dude!' So then we headed towards Rome."
Acts,28,15,"And then, when the squad heard about us, they rolled up to meet us all the way to Appii forum and The three taverns. When Paul peeped them, he showed gratitude to God and got a major boost of confidence."
Acts,28,16,"So, like, when we arrived in Rome, the centurion handed over the prisoners to the captain of the guard. But Paul got to chill by himself with a soldier who was assigned to watch over him."
Acts,28,17,"So, like, after three whole days, Paul gathered all the top Jews, you know? And when they all assembled, he was all like, 'Hey dudes, listen up. I didn't do anything to harm our peeps or go against our traditions. But check it, I got arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to those Roman guys.'"
Acts,28,18,"You know, when they questioned me, they couldn't find any reason to keep me, 'cause I didn't do anything wrong."
Acts,28,19,"But dude, when those Jews started hating on {it}, I was literally forced to take it up with Caesar; not 'cause I had anything against my own peeps or anything."
Acts,28,20,"So I hit you up for a reason, you know? I wanted to hang out and have a chat with you. It's all about representing the hope of Israel, and it's got me locked down with this chain."
Acts,28,21,"And they were like, 'Yeah bro, we haven't got any letters from Judaea about you, and none of the homies who came here said anything bad about you.'"
Acts,28,22,"But we wanna know your thoughts on this, 'cause everywhere we go, people be hatin' on this group."
Acts,28,23,"So, they set a meeting with him and a bunch of people came over to his place. He started breaking it down for them, talking about the kingdom of God and making a case for Jesus. He dropped knowledge from the law of Moses and the prophets, going on for hours from morning till evening."
Acts,28,24,"And like, there were those who totally believed everything that was said, and then there were others who were like, nah, I don't believe it."
Acts,28,25,"And when they couldn't agree with each other, they went their separate ways, but not before Paul dropped some knowledge. He was like, 'Yo, the Holy Ghost spoke through the prophet Esaias to our ancestors and it was straight fire.'"
Acts,28,26,"So, like, go talk to these people and tell them, like, you're gonna hear stuff but not really get it, and you'll see things but not, like, really understand what's going on."
Acts,28,27,"These people's hearts are way too numb, their ears are like majorly blocked, and they've totally shut their eyes. It's like they don't even want to see and hear and get it, you know? If they did, they could totally change their ways and I'd hook them up with some healing vibes."
Acts,28,28,"Just so you know, God's got a message for all the non-Jewish peeps (aka Gentiles), and they're totally gonna be all ears for it."
Acts,28,29,"And like, after he said that, the Jews were like, peace out, and they totally had this intense debate among themselves, you know?"
Acts,28,30,"So, like, Paul chilled at his crib for, like, two whole years, in this rad house he rented, and he was totally cool with welcoming anyone who swung by to hang out with him."
Acts,28,31,"Spreading the good news about the kingdom of God and teaching all about the Lord Jesus Christ, with total confidence, no one holding him back."
Romans,1,1,"Yo, it's Paul here, just a loyal follower of Jesus Christ, chosen to rep as an apostle and completely dedicated to spreading the good word of God."
Romans,1,2,"(Like, God totally promised this way beforehand through His prophets in the super sacred scriptures,)"
Romans,1,3,"About Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born into the world as a descendant of King David, like a regular human being;"
Romans,1,4,"And declared, like, totally the Son of God with mad power, you know? It was all because of the spirit of ultimate holiness, and like, the fact that He came back to life after being dead and all. So legit, man. Just sayin'. {declared: Gr. determined}"
Romans,1,5,"We've been blessed with grace and the role of being apostles, to spread the message of faith to all nations, all for the glory of His name. {for obedience...: or, to the obedience of faith}"
Romans,1,6,You guys were also invited to the squad of Jesus Christ:
Romans,1,7,"Hey everyone in Rome, God loves you and thinks you're awesome. He's calling you to be super righteous and chill. Sending you lots of grace and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ, the ultimate homie."
Romans,1,8,"First and foremost, I wanna give a shoutout to my God, JC, for all of y'all. Your faith game is so strong, it's getting major props worldwide."
Romans,1,9,"God knows, I'm fully committed to serving Him with all my passion when it comes to spreading the good news about His Son. And let me tell you, I never stop praying for you, always mentioning you in my prayers!"
Romans,1,10,"Like, hoping that somehow, finally, I can have a dope trip by God's plan to come kick it with you."
Romans,1,11,"I really wanna meet up with you so I can hook you up with some next-level spiritual vibes, you know, to help you level up and get your life on solid ground."
Romans,1,12,"So basically, I'm hoping that both of us, you and me, can find some solace and support in our shared faith. {with: or, in}"
Romans,1,13,"Yo, fam, gotta fill you in on something. I've been meaning to link up with y'all for a while now, but stuff kept getting in the way. I wanna see some dope results from you, just like I do with the other non-believers. {among: or, in}"
Romans,1,14,"I owe something to both the Greeks and the Barbarians, to the smart ones and the not-so-smart ones too."
Romans,1,15,"Yo, I'm totally down to spread the good news to y'all in Rome, like, for real."
Romans,1,16,"I'm totally unashamed of spreading the good news about Jesus because it's like, super powerful and brings salvation to everyone who believes, starting with the Jewish peeps and then reaching out to the Greek community too."
Romans,1,17,"Yo, this verse is all about how God's goodness is shown when peeps put their trust in Him, and it keeps growing stronger with each act of faith. It's like written in the book, The righteous ones gotta live their best lives by staying faithful."
Romans,1,18,"Yo, God's anger from up above is lit against all the people out there who be straight up acting godless and doing shady stuff, while they know deep down what's right but still choose to be all messed up."
Romans,1,19,"Yo, like everyone can totally see and know about God without a doubt, 'cause He's made it super obvious to all of us. No cap, He's shown Himself to us, no doubt about it."
Romans,1,20,"Like, since the beginning of time, we can totally see all the awesome things God made to remind us of His unseen qualities, you know, His almighty power and divine nature. So, there's no excuse for not realizing how epic He is."
Romans,1,21,"Yo, listen up. Back in the day, when they knew God, they didn't give props to Him like they should've, and they totally forgot to be grateful. Instead, they got caught up in their own made-up fantasies and their hearts ended up all messed up."
Romans,1,22,"Thinking they were so smart, they ended up looking like clowns,"
Romans,1,23,"They totally transformed the awesome and untouchable God into cheap imitations of human, bird, animal, and reptile figures."
Romans,1,24,"So basically, God let them follow their own selfish desires and ended up dishonoring their bodies by indulging in impurity and doing inappropriate things with others."
Romans,1,25,"Like, seriously, who flipped the script on God's truth and started believing straight up lies? And not only that, they started putting all their energy and attention on the things created, rather than the ultimate Creator who's totally blessed forever. Amen, no cap. {more: or, instead}"
Romans,1,26,"And so, God allowed them to pursue impure desires: because even some of their women turned away from their natural desires and engaged in unnatural relationships:"
Romans,1,27,"And just like that, the guys, instead of engaging in natural relationships with women, developed intense desires for each other. They started engaging in inappropriate activities, which goes against what is considered acceptable. As a consequence of their mistake, they experienced the consequences they deserved."
Romans,1,28,"But since they refused to acknowledge God, He allowed them to follow their own foolish thoughts and engage in inappropriate behavior."
Romans,1,29,"Like, they were just full of all this uncool stuff, ya know? Like, doing things they shouldn't be doing, and being totally wicked, greedy, and all mean and stuff. They were just oozing with jealousy, literally killing each other with their words, and always causing drama, lying, and being super shady. Oh, and they couldn't stop gossiping, it was like their favorite hobby or something."
Romans,1,30,"People who talk behind others' backs, hate on God, spread negativity, act arrogant, boast about themselves, come up with wicked ideas, and disobey their parents,"
Romans,1,31,"They totally don't get it, always breaking promises, showing zero empathy, impossible to please, showing no mercy, being all anti-social and stuff."
Romans,1,32,Those who understand that God will judge those who engage in such actions and deem them deserving of death not only partake in those actions themselves but also applaud and derive enjoyment from others who do the same.
Romans,2,1,"So like, dude, you can't be making excuses, whoever you are that's all high and mighty with judgment. 'Cause when you go judging someone else, you're actually condemning yourself. 'Cause let's face it, you're doing the same stuff, bro."
Romans,2,2,But we know for sure that God's judgment is based on truth when it comes to those who do such things.
Romans,2,3,"Yo, do you really think that you, as the judge of those who do messed up stuff, can do the same and not face God's judgment?"
Romans,2,4,"Bro, do you like, not appreciate how insanely awesome and patient God's kindness and patience are? Don't you realize that His goodness is what guides you towards a change of heart, man?"
Romans,2,5,"But when you stubbornly refuse to change and keep your heart closed off, you're just storing up trouble for yourself, leading to a massive showdown when God's fair judgment is finally revealed."
Romans,2,6,"Like, everyone's gonna get what's coming to them based on their actions, you know:"
Romans,2,7,"For those who stay dedicated, patient, and consistently do good to seek for the incredible rewards of glory, honor, immortality, and eternal life:"
Romans,2,8,"But for those who love drama and refuse to listen to the facts, but choose to do wrong, they'll be filled with anger and righteous fury,"
Romans,2,9,"It's gonna get real tough and stressful for anyone who does bad stuff, starting with the Jewish peeps, but also for everyone else, you know; Gentiles included. {Gentile: Gr. Greek}"
Romans,2,10,"But let's give a shoutout to all the homies who stay grinding and doing good. It goes out to the OG Jews first, and then to the non-Jews too. You know, peace, honor, and blessings for all. (Gentile = Gr. Greek)"
Romans,2,11,"Yo, God does not play favorites, period."
Romans,2,12,"Like, if you mess up without knowing what's right or wrong, you'll face consequences just the same. And if you mess up when you actually know what's right, you'll be held accountable. Pretty straightforward, tbh."
Romans,2,13,"Listen up, fam! Just hearing the law ain't gonna cut it with God. Only those who actually obey the law will be considered righteous."
Romans,2,14,"So, like, even though the Gentiles don't have the law, they naturally do what the law says. It's like they become their own law, man."
Romans,2,15,"They naturally know what is right and wrong deep down, because their conscience tells them so. Their thoughts either accuse or excuse each other, as they wrestle with moral judgments."
Romans,2,16,"When God judges everyone's secrets through Jesus Christ, just like I preached in the good news."
Romans,2,17,"Yo, listen up! You're known as a Jew and you claim to be all about the law, practically bragging about your connection with God."
Romans,2,18,"And you totally get what he wants, and you're all like, thumbs up to the super awesome stuff, 'cause you know your stuff from the law; like, tryin' out what's different and all that."
Romans,2,19,"And you really believe that you're, like, the ultimate guide for clueless peeps and the shining beacon for those stuck in the shadows,"
Romans,2,20,"You're like the ultimate guide for clueless peeps, schooling the newbies with your deep knowledge and straight-up truth in the laws."
Romans,2,21,"So, like, you're all about preachin' and teachin' others, but have you ever thought about practicing what you preach? Like, you say stealin' is a big no-no, but do you actually follow your own advice? Just curious, ya know."
Romans,2,22,"Bro, you out here preaching against cheating, but you out here cheating yourself? And you all about hating on idols, but you out here disrespecting sacred things? No cap?"
Romans,2,23,"So, if you brag about following the rules, but then go and break those same rules, aren't you disrespecting God?"
Romans,2,24,"Seriously guys, God's name is getting dragged through the mud because of you, just like it says."
Romans,2,25,"Circumcision is totally worth it if you follow the rules, but if you're breaking the rules, your circumcision doesn't even count."
Romans,2,26,"So, like, if someone who's not circumcised follows the law and stuff, shouldn't it be seen as if they were circumcised?"
Romans,2,27,"And if someone who is uncircumcised by nature follows the law, would they not also judge you, who, although circumcised in the flesh, still breaks the law?"
Romans,2,28,"Because being Jewish isn't just about how you look on the outside, and being circumcised isn't just about having a physical mark:"
Romans,2,29,"But check it, being a Jew is about what's on the inside, not just the outside. It's all about that heart circumcision, you feel me? It's about having a spiritual transformation, not just following some rules on paper. And guess what? The real praise comes from God, not from other people."
Romans,3,1,"So, like what's the point of being a Jew? And circumcision, does it really make a difference?"
Romans,3,2,"Like, totally in every way, but for real, mainly 'cause they were entrusted with God's messages."
Romans,3,3,What if some peeps don't believe? Does that mean God's faith is canceled or what?
Romans,3,4,"No way that's gonna happen: like, God is totally true, but every person out there is just lying, you know? As it's written, the whole point is for you to prove your point and come out on top when people try to bring you down."
Romans,3,5,"But, like, if our bad behavior actually makes God's goodness shine even brighter, what's the deal? Is God like being unfair by bringing down his wrath? (I'm just saying this from a human perspective)"
Romans,3,6,"No way, dude! If that happens, how's God gonna judge everyone?"
Romans,3,7,"Like, if God's truth became, like, super obvious because of my lie and gave Him all the credit, why do people still consider me a sinner?"
Romans,3,8,"And like, you know, some people are spreading rumors that we're all about doing bad stuff just to get good results. But seriously, that's totally messed up. And those who think like that, well, they totally deserve to face the consequences, no doubt."
Romans,3,9,"So, like, are we, like, superior to them or what? Absolutely not, dude. We've already shown that both Jews and Gentiles are all guilty of sin; you know, we've charged them and stuff."
Romans,3,10,"Like, as it's been written, there isn't anyone who's totally righteous, like seriously, not even one person:"
Romans,3,11,"Yo, no one really gets it, and like, no one even bothers to really seek after God, ya know?"
Romans,3,12,"They've all gone off track, like, together they've become useless; like, seriously, no one is doing anything good, like literally no one."
Romans,3,13,"Yo, their throat is like a straight-up dumpster fire; they be spewing lies with their tongues; venomous snakes hide up behind their lips like, dang!"
Romans,3,14,Their speech is filled with negativity and resentment:
Romans,3,15,"They're quick to spill blood, it's crazy:"
Romans,3,16,Their ways are all about chaos and suffering:
Romans,3,17,And they have no clue what peace looks like:
Romans,3,18,They don't even have a shred of respect for God.
Romans,3,19,"So, like, we understand that whatever the law says, it says to those who gotta follow it, ya know? It's like, to make everybody just shut their mouths and realize that the whole world is in the wrong before God. Yeah, guilty AF, you feel me? {guilty...: or, subject to the judgment of God}"
Romans,3,20,"So, like, following the rules isn't gonna make anyone holyy' in the eyes of God, y'know? It's more about knowing what's right and wrong."
Romans,3,21,"But now, yo, God's righteousness is shown, no need for the law and all, and the law and the prophets vouch for it, y'know?"
Romans,3,22,"God's goodness is available to everyone who believes in Jesus, no matter who they are or where they come from. It doesn't matter who you are, faith in Jesus is the key to receiving God's righteousness."
Romans,3,23,"Like, everyone messes up, and falls short of God's rad glory;"
Romans,3,24,"We're totally in the clear, all because of God's incredible kindness and Jesus hooking us up with redemption:"
Romans,3,25,God put forward Jesus as the one who makes things right with Him through faith in His sacrifice. This shows God's fairness by forgiving the sins that have already happened because of His patience.
Romans,3,26,"So, like, God wants to show off his righteousness right now, you know? He wants to be fair and make anyone who believes in Jesus totally innocent and guilt-free. Pretty cool, huh?"
Romans,3,27,"So, like, where's all the bragging at, huh? Nowhere, that's where. And what's the deal with relying on your achievements? No way, dude. It's all about having faith, like, for real."
Romans,3,28,"So like, basically, we've figured out that peeps are made right with God through faith, not by doing good stuff according to the rules."
Romans,3,29,"Like, is God, like, only for the Jews? Or is He, like, also for the non-Jews? Totally, He's for everyone, even the non-Jews, too:"
Romans,3,30,"Yo, there's only one God who's all about leveling the playing field. Doesn't matter if you're circumcised or not, as long as you got faith, you're all good."
Romans,3,31,"So, like, does having faith mean that we can just ignore the law? Absolutely not! We totally stand by the law, you know?"
Romans,4,1,"So, like, what can we say about Abraham our founding father in terms of his physical existence?"
Romans,4,2,"So like, if Abraham was all about earning his place, he'd totally have something to brag about. But not when it comes to God, y'know?"
Romans,4,3,"Like, the scripture says what? Abraham totally trusted in God, and bam, God was like, 'You righteous, bro!'"
Romans,4,4,"So, like, if you're putting in the effort, you're gonna get the reward 'cause you earned it, not because someone's being nice and giving it to you without you doing anything."
Romans,4,5,"But for someone who doesn't hustle, but believes in the one who declares the wicked as righteous, their faith is seen as pure strength."
Romans,4,6,"Just like how David totally vibes about how awesome it is for someone to be blessed, like, God straight up gives them righteousness without them even having to do anything,"
Romans,4,7,"Like, seriously, those who have their wrongdoings forgiven and their sins hidden, they are totally blessed."
Romans,4,8,"Dude, the guy who the Lord doesn't count his sins is totally #blessed."
Romans,4,9,"So, like, is this whole blessing thing just for those who got circumcised, or is it for everyone, like the uncircumcised peeps too? 'Cause we're saying that Abraham's faith was what made him righteous, you know."
Romans,4,10,"So, like, when was it measured then? Was it when he was circumcised or not circumcised? Not when he was circumcised, but when he wasn't."
Romans,4,11,"And he got circumcised as a sign, proving that even though he wasn't circumcised before, it was a symbol of his faith and righteousness. He became the father figure for all who believe, whether they're circumcised or not. This way, righteousness can be credited to them too."
Romans,4,12,"And the one who started the whole circumcision thing is for everyone, not just for those who were born into it, but also for those who live out the same kind of faith as our ancestor Abraham did before he got circumcised."
Romans,4,13,"Yo fam, the whole world being inherited wasn't cuz of Abraham or his descendants following the rules, but it's all about having mad faith, ya feel me?"
Romans,4,14,"If those who follow the rules get all the rewards, then faith becomes useless and the promise becomes worthless."
Romans,4,15,Law just brings anger; breaking rules only happens when there are rules in the first place.
Romans,4,16,"So, basically, it works like this: it all comes down to having faith, because that's how you receive grace. The whole point is to make sure that the promise is guaranteed for everyone, not just those who follow the law, but also for those who have the same kind of faith as Abraham, who is basically the dad of all of us."
Romans,4,17,"(Just like it says, I've made you a dad to a ton of nations), before the God he believed in, who brings the dead back to life and speaks about things that don't even exist as if they already do. (like him or similar to him)"
Romans,4,18,"This dude had crazy faith when there was no hope left. He totally believed he'd become the dad of a ton of nations, just like it was promised - his fam would be massive!"
Romans,4,19,"And, like, dude had mad strong faith, so he didn't even trip about the fact that his bod was all dead and stuff, even though he was, like, a hundred years old. And he didn't freak over Sara's barrenness either, no biggie."
Romans,4,20,"He didn't doubt or hesitate about God's promise; instead, he flexed his faith and gave all the glory to God."
Romans,4,21,"And like, totally believing that what he like, pinky promised, he had the mad skills to actually get it done."
Romans,4,22,"So, like, because of that, it was like counted as righteous, you know?"
Romans,4,23,"But like, it wasn't just written for his benefit, ya know? It was all about that whole situation being attributed to him."
Romans,4,24,"But for us too, it's gonna be counted in our favor, if we're believers in the one who brought Jesus our Lord back to life;"
Romans,4,25,Jesus took the fall for all our mistakes and then came back to make us all really justified.
Romans,5,1,"So basically, since we're all good with God thanks to our faith, we've got peace vibes with Him all because of our main dude Jesus Christ:"
Romans,5,2,"Through faith, we have been granted access to this awesome grace, and we flex and hype up in anticipation of the incredible glory of God."
Romans,5,3,"And not just that, but we flex on tough times too, 'cause we know that tough times build up our patience."
Romans,5,4,"So, like, patience leads to having experience, and having experience gives hope, you know?"
Romans,5,5,"And having hope won't leave you feeling embarrassed or ashamed, because God's love is poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit that was given to us."
Romans,5,6,"Back in the day when we were all weaklings, at just the right moment, Christ went and died for all the godless people out there. {at just the right moment: or, at the perfect time}"
Romans,5,7,"It's like, seriously, who would be willing to sacrifice their life for someone who's just decent? But maybe, just maybe, there are a few gems out there who would go all the way for someone genuinely good."
Romans,5,8,"Yo, check it out! God showed how much he loves us by sending Christ to die for us, even when we were still messing up."
Romans,5,9,"Like, seriously y'all, listen up! 'Cause now that we've been made totally righteous by his blood, we're gonna be saved from all that anger and wrath through him. No cap!"
Romans,5,10,"Yo, peep this: back when we were straight up enemies of God, His Son's death totally made things right between us. And check it, now that we're all good and reconciled, we're gonna be saved big time by His lit life."
Romans,5,11,"And it's not just that, but we're also stoked about God through our main dude Jesus Christ, who hooked us up with some serious reconciliation vibes. Like, it's all good now, yo."
Romans,5,12,"So like, because of this one guy, sin totally invaded the world, bringing death along with it; and that's how death spread to everyone, because everyone has sinned, you know? (like, it's in their nature or something)"
Romans,5,13,"(Because before the rules came, sin was already in the world, but sin doesn't count if there's no rules."
Romans,5,14,"But, like, death was totally ruling the game since Adam until Moses, even over those who hadn't sinned in the same way as Adam did, you know? Adam was just like a preview of this awesome person who was gonna show up later."
Romans,5,15,"But, like, the wrong thing and the awesome gift are totally different. 'Cause, like, if one person messed up and made a lot of people dead, then like, way more awesome is God's kindness and the gift He gives through His kindness, you know? And, like, this awesome gift comes from just one dude, Jesus Christ, and it's been given to so many people. It's, like, everywhere!"
Romans,5,16,"And it's not like, just one person messed up, so then the gift is messed up too, okay? Like, judgey stuff happened because of one person and it was all like condemning and stuff, but the free gift is cool 'cause it covers a bunch of mistakes and makes things right."
Romans,5,17,"Okay, listen up fam! Check this out - just one homie's mistake caused death to take over the game. But yo, here's the good news: those who embrace mad grace and the righteousness gift are gonna straight up rule this life through one person, Jesus Christ. Like, no cap! (or, like, by one mistake)"
Romans,5,18,"So, like, because one person messed up and got us all in trouble, we were all pretty much guilty, but then this other awesome person came along and gave everyone this rad gift that makes us all justified and have a chance at a good life. Like, the one person messed up, but the other person made it right, you know?"
Romans,5,19,"Just like how one guy's disobedience made a bunch of people sinners, another guy's obedience will make a bunch of people righteous."
Romans,5,20,"And then the law came, which made people mess up even more. But guess what? Where there was a ton of messing up, grace showed up even bigger and better:"
Romans,5,21,"Just like how sin used to rule and bring about death, grace now reigns through righteousness, leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ, our ultimate homie."
Romans,6,1,"So like, what should we say, huh? Should we just keep on doing all the bad stuff, thinking that grace will cover it all?"
Romans,6,2,"No way, dude. Since we're dead to sin, how can we keep living like that?"
Romans,6,3,"Yo, don't you know that like, all of us who get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, we're basically getting baptized into his death? Like, it's a whole connection thing, you feel me? Like, we're joining in his whole death and resurrection vibe."
Romans,6,4,"So, like, when we get baptized, it's like being buried with Jesus and symbolizing his death. And just like how Jesus was raised from the dead by God's power, we too should live a whole new life, leaving our old ways behind."
Romans,6,5,"Like, if we've totally been joined together in, like, the same vibe as his death, we're totally gonna be in, like, the same vibe as his resurrection too, you know?"
Romans,6,6,"Like, yo, check this out: we gotta get this straight in our heads that our old selves got completely wrecked along with {him} on that cross, so that all that sin junk in us can be obliterated. From now on, we're done serving sin, okay?"
Romans,6,7,"When someone dies, they are no longer bound by sin. {justified: Gr. made right}"
Romans,6,8,"So, if we've embraced Christ's death, we totally believe that we'll also rock it with him in life:"
Romans,6,9,"Yo, just real quick, Christ was raised from the dead and He's totally immortal now. Death has no power over Him anymore."
Romans,6,10,"When Jesus died, he died once and for all to sin. But now that he lives, he lives completely devoted to God."
Romans,6,11,"Yo, fam, it's like you gotta think of yourselves as totally disconnected from sin, but fully alive and connected to God through Jesus Christ, our main homie and Lord."
Romans,6,12,"Don't let sin take over your physical self, so you won't just do whatever your desires tell you to."
Romans,6,13,"Don't let your actions be tools for doing wrong things; instead, make yourselves available to God, like people who have been brought back to life, and let your actions be tools for doing the right things for God. (instruments: Greek for arms, or, weapons)"
Romans,6,14,"Sin can't control you anymore: because you're not stuck following a bunch of rules, but you're living in grace."
Romans,6,15,"So like, should we just do bad stuff 'cause we're not bound by the rules anymore and all about that grace? Um, heck no."
Romans,6,16,"Y'all know that whoever you choose to serve and obey, that's who you become a servant to, whether it's following sinful ways that lead to death or being obedient to righteousness."
Romans,6,17,"But thank God, you used to be all about that sin life, but now you've fully embraced the teachings that were passed down to you and genuinely followed them. {which...: Gr. whereto ye were delivered}"
Romans,6,18,"Once you're like, totally rid of sin, you're like, all about serving righteousness, you know?"
Romans,6,19,"I'm gonna keep it relatable, 'cause I know being human can be tough sometimes. Look, I get it, you've been using your bodies to do some messed up stuff, one sin leading to another. But hey, it's time for a change! Start using your bodies to do what's good and pure now."
Romans,6,20,"Back when you were all caught up in doing all the wrong things, righteousness wasn't even on your radar. Ya feel? {from...: Gr. to righteousness}"
Romans,6,21,"Like, what were you even gaining from those things that you're now totally embarrassed about? 'Cause let's be real, in the long run, all that stuff leads to like, a total dead end."
Romans,6,22,"But like, now that you're not chained down by sin anymore and you're totally serving God, you're gonna bear some seriously holy fruits. And the ultimate prize? A completely lit everlasting life, fam."
Romans,6,23,"Like, if you do bad stuff, it's gonna cost you big time. Death, bro. But check this out, God's got something epic for you. Eternal life, man, all thanks to Jesus Christ, our VIP."
Romans,7,1,"Yo, fam, listen up! Guess y'all know the law, so lemme remind you: the law's got control over a person as long as they're alive, ya feel me?"
Romans,7,2,"If a woman is married, she has to stick with her hubby as long as he's alive. But if the hubby kicks the bucket, she's free from the marriage rules."
Romans,7,3,"So, like, if a woman is still married to her husband and she marries someone else, she's totally gonna be called an adulteress. But, if her husband kicks the bucket, she's totally free from that law, you know? So, she's not an adulteress anymore, even if she's married to another guy. Like, it's all good, no drama."
Romans,7,4,"So, fam, listen up. Y'all have totally moved on from the law, thanks to what Jesus did. It's like a marriage, except we're hitched to someone who rose from the dead! And the goal here is to produce some seriously good fruit for God."
Romans,7,5,"So when we were still caught up in our old ways, our desires driven by the rules were causing us to do sinful things, leading to destructive outcomes. {passions: Gr. strong feelings}"
Romans,7,6,"But now we're free from all those rules that held us down before. We're here to live with a fresh mindset, guided by our spirit, not bound by the old ways of doing things."
Romans,7,7,"So, like, you might be wondering if the law is, like, totally a bad thing? No way! Absolutely not. I mean, the truth is, the law actually helps us recognize what sin is. Honestly, I wouldn't have even known about things like lusting after stuff if the law hadn't been all like, 'Yo, don't be coveting things, fam.' And by 'coveting' I mean like, wanting something really badly in a not-so-cool way, just FYI."
Romans,7,8,"But, like, sin saw the commandment as an opportunity and made all kinds of intense desires rise up within me. 'Cause, ya know, without the law, sin was totally inactive."
Romans,7,9,"So, like, there was this time when I was just chillin' without any rules, but then the rules came and all of a sudden sin got, like, a major revival and I totally bit the dust."
Romans,7,10,"So like, I realized that this rule that's supposed to lead to a good life actually ends up bringing nothing but trouble."
Romans,7,11,"Like, sin totally used the commandment as a chance to deceive me and ended up totally killing my vibe."
Romans,7,12,"So, like, the law is like totally holy and the commandment is like super holy, and just, and good, you know?"
Romans,7,13,"So, like, the good stuff made death happen to me? No way, man. But, you know, sin, it wanted to show off how sinful it can be, so it caused death with the help of the good stuff. This way, sin becomes extra, extra sinful because of the commandment."
Romans,7,14,"Btw, fam, we know that the law is all spiritual and righteous and stuff. But tbh, I'm just living in the physical world, totally prone to sin and everything. It's like I've been 'sold' to sin, y'know?"
Romans,7,15,"Like, I gotta admit, I'm not totally down with the things I end up doing. It's like, there are things I really wanna do, but I never actually do 'em. Instead, I end up doing the stuff I totally despise. Ya feel me? {allow: Gr. know}"
Romans,7,16,"So if I end up doing something I don't want to, it means I agree that the law is actually good."
Romans,7,17,"Okay, so here's the deal: it's not really me doing it anymore, but it's the sin that's chillin' inside me."
Romans,7,18,"Yo, for real, I know that inside me (like, in my physical being), there's nothing good going on. Like, I want to do good, ya know, I have the intention and all, but I can't figure out, like, how to actually make it happen."
Romans,7,19,"I wanna do good, but tbh, I end up doing the opposite."
Romans,7,20,"So, like, sometimes when I do stuff that I know I shouldn't, it's not really me doing it, but it's this thing called sin that's chillin' inside me, you know?"
Romans,7,21,"So, like, I discovered this whole thing, right? Whenever I try to be a good person and all, feels like evil just pops up outta nowhere, you know?"
Romans,7,22,"I'm totally into God's law, deep down inside:"
Romans,7,23,"But, like, there's this other thing going on inside of me, you know? It's like a constant battle between what I know is right and what I end up doing. It's honestly exhausting, because I feel like I'm trapped by this sinful nature that's always there, just messing with me."
Romans,7,24,"Ugh, I'm such a mess! Who's gonna save me from this never-ending cycle of struggle? Like seriously, I need some major help to break free from this sucky situation."
Romans,7,25,"I'm grateful to God, thanks to Jesus Christ our Lord. So, in my head, I stay committed to following God's law, but when it comes to my body, I sometimes slip up and give in to sin."
Romans,8,1,"So, like, if you're all about Jesus and not living a trashy life, you won't be judged or anything. It's all about staying in the zone of good vibes and embracing the Spirit, ya know?"
Romans,8,2,"Like, yo, the power of the Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ has totally set me free from the whole rule of sin and death, you know?"
Romans,8,3,"So, like, the law couldn't really fix things 'cause it was weak due to our human nature. But God was like, 'Nah, I got this,' and sent His own Son in the form of a human, even though humans have flaws and stuff. And through this sacrifice, He totally condemned sin in our human nature and sorted things out. #gamechanger"
Romans,8,4,"So that we can follow the law in the right way, not by doing what our selfish desires tell us to do, but by living in tune with our true selves."
Romans,8,5,"Those who are obsessed with worldly desires focus on worldly things, but those who are tuned in to the Spirit prioritize spiritual matters."
Romans,8,6,"Being all about earthly desires leads to destruction, while being focused on a spiritual path leads to true existence and inner peace."
Romans,8,7,"Like, dude, the mind that's all about pleasing yourself is, like, totally at odds with God, you know? It's, like, totally not into following God's laws and, like, it can't even do it, man. #fleshythoughts"
Romans,8,8,"So, like, those who are all about satisfying their worldly desires can't really make God happy, you know?"
Romans,8,9,"But you're not all about the physical stuff, you're more focused on the spiritual vibes. That's if you've got God's Spirit hanging out in you, ya know? Here's the deal though, if anyone doesn't have Christ's Spirit, they're not really part of His squad."
Romans,8,10,"If you've got Christ vibes in you, your human shell is toast 'cause sin, but your spirit is lit AF thanks to righteousness."
Romans,8,11,"But if the Spirit of the one who brought Jesus back to life lives inside you, the same Spirit will also give life to your bodies that will eventually perish, all because of the Spirit's presence within you."
Romans,8,12,"So, my fam, we owe nothing to our basic desires. We shouldn't be all about indulging in them."
Romans,8,13,"If you keep living according to your basic desires, you're gonna be toast. But if you let your inner spirit take control and put those harmful actions to rest, you'll thrive."
Romans,8,14,"Those who follow the Spirit of God are like squad members, they are part of God's fam."
Romans,8,15,"Because you're not out here living in fear or feeling trapped anymore. No, you've got that adoption vibe going on. Now we can just scream out 'Abba, Father' with so much love and closeness."
Romans,8,16,"The Spirit totally backs us up, confirming that we're totally God's squad:"
Romans,8,17,"And like, if we're, like, God's children, then we're, like, totally heirs, you know? Heirs of God, and, like, bonus, we're joint-heirs with Christ! But, like, here's the thing, if we, like, go through suffering with Him, then, you know, we'll be so glorified together and stuff."
Romans,8,18,"Cause I think that the struggles we go through right now, like seriously, they ain't even worth comparing to the epic awesomeness that's gonna be unleashed within us."
Romans,8,19,The whole world is eagerly waiting for the day when the true power of God's children will be revealed.
Romans,8,20,"You know, everything in this world came under the influence of emptiness and meaninglessness, not by choice, but because of the one who caused it to happen, hoping for something better."
Romans,8,21,"Like, the whole creation is gonna be set free from like, all the messed up stuff and have this totally awesome freedom like the children of God, you know?"
Romans,8,22,We all know that everything around us is going through a lot of struggle and pain right now. It's like the whole world is groaning and laboring together.
Romans,8,23,"And not just them, but us too - who have the Spirit vibes poppin' - we also be feeling the struggle deep within. We're eagerly waiting to vibe with the adoption gang, when our bodies get that sweet redemption."
Romans,8,24,"Like, we're totally saved by hope, you know? But, like, if you can actually see what you're hoping for, it's not really hope, right? 'Cause, like, if dudes can already see it, why would they still be hoping for it?"
Romans,8,25,"But, like, if we're hoping for something we can't see, then we just gotta be patient and wait for it, you know?"
Romans,8,26,"And just like, the Spirit is totally there for us when we're feeling weak. 'Cause, ya know, sometimes we're not exactly sure what we should be praying for, but the Spirit, like, totally steps up and speaks up for us with these deep feelings that we can't even put into words."
Romans,8,27,"And the one who knows what's really going on inside you also knows what the Spirit is thinking, because the Spirit talks to God on behalf of the good people, just like God wants. (I mean, pretty awesome, right?!)"
Romans,8,28,"And, like, we totally know that everything, like, totally comes together for the best for those who, you know, love God and are like, totally meant to fulfill His purpose and all."
Romans,8,29,"God knew beforehand who he wanted to be part of his squad and he already had a plan to make them just like his Son, so that his Son can be the ultimate big bro among all his homies."
Romans,8,30,"And those he chose in advance, he also reached out to; and those he reached out to, he also made right; and those he made right, he also made worthy of honor."
Romans,8,31,"So like, what should we even say about all this? If God's got our back, who's gonna be able to mess with us?"
Romans,8,32,"Yo, listen up! The big man upstairs didn't even hold back his own son, but straight up sacrificed him for all of us. Like, if he can do that, don't you think he's gonna hook us up with everything we need? No doubt, fam!"
Romans,8,33,"Who gonna come at God's chosen ones? Like, bruh, it's God who's righteous and all, straight up."
Romans,8,34,"Like, who has the power to judge us, you know? It's totally Jesus, man! He died for us and then came back to life. And get this, He's chilling up there by God's side, making pleas on our behalf. That's some serious intercession game!"
Romans,8,35,"Yo, who's gonna separate us from Christ's love? Like, is it gonna be tough times, or feeling down, or straight up getting hated on, or no food, or being totally broke, or being in danger, or even violence?"
Romans,8,36,"Like, as it says in the book, we're getting destroyed all day long for your sake; people see us as defenseless sheep just waiting to be attacked."
Romans,8,37,"Seriously, in every single thing we totally slay because of the one who's madly in love with us."
Romans,8,38,"I truly believe that nothing, not even death or life, angels or rulers, can stop me, present issues or future challenges won't hold me back,"
Romans,8,39,"Like, there's nothing, no obstacles or anything, that can ever like, break the bond between us and God's ultimate love for us, which is found in Jesus Christ, our Lord. No matter what, we're totally connected and nothing can mess with that vibe."
Romans,9,1,"Yo, I'm keeping it real in the name of Christ, no lies here. My conscience, backed up by the Holy Ghost, can vouch for me."
Romans,9,2,My heart feels heavy and sad all the time. It's like carrying a ton of emotional weight.
Romans,9,3,"Honestly, I'd be willing to give up my connection with Christ if it meant my bros, my fam from the same bloodline, would be cool. Like, I'd separate myself from Him, no cap."
Romans,9,4,"Yo, let me tell you about the Israelites. They got the whole package, you feel me? They got the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the law, serving God, and the promises. It's like a total VIP deal, fam. *Note: 'covenants' can also be called 'testaments'."
Romans,9,5,"Like, yo, who are the OG fathers? And, like, in terms of the flesh, Christ was totally born, I mean, He's the boss, like the God who's all blessed forever. Amen, you know?"
Romans,9,6,"It's not like God's word doesn't matter anymore. Just because someone is from Israel, doesn't mean they are true Israelites."
Romans,9,7,"It's not all about being descendants of Abraham, but it's about being called descendants through Isaac."
Romans,9,8,"Like, you know, those who are born naturally, they ain't really God's children. But it's the ones who are part of God's plan and promise, they're the real deal."
Romans,9,9,"Listen up, fam! God's promise is straight fire. He's like, 'I'm gonna show up now and bless Sara with a baby boy.'"
Romans,9,10,"And it's not just that, but Rebecca also got pregnant by our dad Isaac."
Romans,9,11,"For, like, the kids who weren't even born yet, they hadn't done anything good or bad, you know? God had this whole plan, like, chosen beforehand, based on His own decision, not because of anything they did, but because He called them, you feel me?"
Romans,9,12,"They straight up told her, like the older kid's gonna be serving the younger one."
Romans,9,13,"Like, in the scriptures it says that I totally loved Jacob, but, um, Esau, well, let's just say I wasn't vibing with him."
Romans,9,14,"So like, what do we even say then? Is God being unfair? Absolutely not!"
Romans,9,15,"Like, God told Moses that He's gonna show mercy to whoever He wants and have compassion on whoever He wants, you know?"
Romans,9,16,"So, like, it's not about how badly you want it or how fast you chase after it, but it's all about God's mercy, you know."
Romans,9,17,"Yo, the Bible says to Pharaoh, like, I brought you into power for a reason - to flex my mad power through you and make sure everyone knows my name, everywhere on earth."
Romans,9,18,"So, like, God does whatever He wants, man. He's got the power to show mercy to anyone He chooses and, like, He can also make someone's heart all tough if He wants to, you know?"
Romans,9,19,"So, like, you might be thinking, why is he still blaming us? I mean, who can actually go against what he wants, right?"
Romans,9,20,"Seriously, bro, who do you think you are to question God? Can something that was made be like, 'Why did you create me like this?' Don't even try to argue with God, man."
Romans,9,21,"Doesn't the potter have control over the clay, so that from the same pile he can create one awesome masterpiece and another not-so-awesome one?"
Romans,9,22,"What if God, like, totally wanted to show his anger and flex his power, so he, like, totally put up with all those people who are super deserving of his wrath for a long time? They're basically a bunch of losers destined for destruction and obliterating. (like, fitted, you know what I mean?)"
Romans,9,23,"And so he could flex his ridiculously awesome glory on the chosen ones, who he had already prepped to shine bright like stars,"
Romans,9,24,"Like, even those he chose, not just from the Jewish crew, but also from all the other peeps?"
Romans,9,25,"Like, it's mentioned in this verse from Osee, where it says that God will totally consider them as His people, even though they weren't considered His people before, and they'll be super loved by Him, even though they weren't loved like that before."
Romans,9,26,"And it's gonna happen, like seriously, in the spot where people straight up said, 'Nah, you don't belong to me,' they're gonna be called the legit children of the amazing, yeah, the real deal, God."
Romans,9,27,"Esaias is like, hey guys, listen up! He's talking about Israel and how even though there's, like, so many of them, they're as abundant as sand on the seashore, only a small group will be saved, you know?"
Romans,9,28,"Yo, He's gonna wrap things up real quick and on point, all in righteousness. The Lord's about to do a speedy job on this earth, no doubt about it."
Romans,9,29,"And like Esaias said fam, if the Lord of Sabaoth didn't hook us up with a surviving seed, we would've been straight up Sodoma status, just like Gomorrha. {Sabaoth: meaning hosts in Hebrew, ya feel me?}"
Romans,9,30,"So, like, what do we say then? That the non-Jewish peeps, who weren't even trying to be good, have actually achieved goodness, you know, the goodness that comes from having faith."
Romans,9,31,"But Israel, who tried so hard to follow the rules of being righteous, didn't quite make it to the level of ultimate righteousness."
Romans,9,32,"Why tho? 'Cause they didn't believe in it, they were all like, Laww is everything.' But they tripped over that big ol' stumblingstone."
Romans,9,33,"Like, it's written and everything, right? Check it out, in Sion I placed this total stumblingstone and insane rock of offense. And you know what? Anyone who's down to believe in him won't even feel awkward or embarrassed or anything. It's true, dude!"
Romans,10,1,"Yo fam, I really want and pray to God that all my homies from Israel get saved."
Romans,10,2,"I gotta say, they're all about having mad love for God, but they're lacking in the knowledge department."
Romans,10,3,"So, like, they don't even know about God's righteousness, and they're all about making themselves look righteous. But they haven't like, accepted God's righteousness, ya know?"
Romans,10,4,"For real, like, Christ is the ultimate deal when it comes to righteousness for anyone who believes, you know?"
Romans,10,5,"Moses talks about following the law to be righteous. It means that if you do everything the law says, you'll thrive through it."
Romans,10,6,"But here's the thing, the way righteousness comes from faith is like, don't go thinking in your mind, 'Oh, who's gonna climb up to heaven and bring Christ down to us?'"
Romans,10,7,"Like, who's gonna go all the way down, you know, into the deep abyss? I mean, that's like, bringing Christ back from the dead territory, man."
Romans,10,8,"So, like, what does it say? The word is super close to you, like, in your mouth and in your heart, you know? It's all about having faith, which we totally talk about all the time!"
Romans,10,9,"So, like, if you openly acknowledge with your words that Jesus is your Lord and really trust in your core that God raised him back to life, you'll totally be saved."
Romans,10,10,"So, like, when you truly believe in your heart, you'll be in the good books with the big guy upstairs. But it's not just about thinking it, you gotta speak it out loud too, 'cause that's when the magic happens and you'll find salvation."
Romans,10,11,"The writings say, if you believe in him, you won't feel embarrassed."
Romans,10,12,"Like, there's literally no distinction between Jews and Greeks, fam. It's because we all got the same big boss up there, who's got mad blessings for everyone who reaches out to Him, you know?"
Romans,10,13,"Anyone who reaches out to the Lord will be safe and sound, no doubt."
Romans,10,14,"Yo, how can they be like, calling out to someone they don't even believe in? And how can they believe in someone they never even heard of? And like, how can they hear about it if no one's out there preaching about it?"
Romans,10,15,"And like, how can they preach, yo, unless they're, like, sent? Just as it's written, man, how awesome are the feet of those who spread the good news of peace and share cool news about awesome stuff!"
Romans,10,16,"But not everyone has followed the gospel. As Esaias says, 'Bruh, who actually believed what we were saying?' (Wait, did they even listen to us tho?)"
Romans,10,17,"So like, faith comes from hearing, and hearing comes from the word of God, you know?"
Romans,10,18,"Yo, check it. I'm just saying, didn't they hear the message? For real though, it's like their sound went all over the planet, and their words reached every corner of the world."
Romans,10,19,"But like, yo, did Israel not even realize? Moses straight up said, 'I'm gonna make you feel jealous when you see how I bless other peeps who aren't even considered a nation. And I'm gonna tick you off by showing love to a nation that's kinda foolish.'"
Romans,10,20,"Esaias was totally fearless and said, yo, I showed up unexpectedly to those who weren't even looking for me; I revealed myself to those who didn't even bother asking about me."
Romans,10,21,"But to Israel, God is like, 'Yo, I've been reaching out to you all day, but you keep being rebellious and arguing with me.'"
Romans,11,1,"So, like, wait a sec, did God just like straight up abandon his peeps? No way, dude. 'Cause I'm an Israelite too, you know, from the fam of Abraham and the tribe of Benjamin."
Romans,11,2,"Dude, God hasn't ditched the people He knew beforehand. Like, haven't you heard what the scripture says about Elias? He straight up prays to God, like 'Yo, Israel needs some help,' you know? Just saying. {of Elias: Gr. in Elias?}"
Romans,11,3,"Bruh, these guys straight up went and killed your prophets, destroyed your altars, and now I'm the only one left and they're out here tryna take me down too. Smh."
Romans,11,4,"Yo, what did God say in response to him? I actually still got 7K homies who haven't worshipped that Baal figure."
Romans,11,5,"Like, right now, there's still a bunch of people who are totally chosen by grace and stuff, you know?"
Romans,11,6,"And like, if it's all about God's grace, then it's not about doing good things anymore; otherwise, grace wouldn't really be grace, you know? But if it's all about doing good things, then it's not about God's grace anymore; otherwise, doing good things wouldn't really be doing good things."
Romans,11,7,"So, like, what's the deal? Israel didn't, like, get what they were looking for, but some chosen ones totally got it, and the others were, like, blinded or something... or maybe they were just, like, really stubborn or hardheaded or whatever."
Romans,11,8,"Just like it says in the book, God has made them so tired and unaware, with eyes that can't see and ears that can't hear. It's still like that today."
Romans,11,9,"So David was like, 'Their table? Big trap. Major stumbling block. Total payback. It's real.'"
Romans,11,10,"Make them totally clueless, so they can't even see what's going on, and make them hunch over forever."
Romans,11,11,"Yo, listen up! So, did they completely mess up and fall off track? Absolutely not, fam! In fact, because of their stumble, salvation has come to the non-Jews, you know, the Gentiles, just to shake things up and make 'em jealous."
Romans,11,12,"So, like, if their downfall made the world rich, and their decline made the Gentiles rich, just imagine how much more awesome their comeback will be, ya know? It's like their return will be way more epic and fulfilling, you feel me? {diminishing: or, decay, or, loss}"
Romans,11,13,"Yo, fam, I'm here to drop some truth for y'all non-Jews. Just so you know, I hold it down as the main apostle for non-Jewish peeps. Gotta flex on this important role of mine, ya feel?"
Romans,11,14,"Maybe by throwing some serious inspiration vibes, I can totally get my peeps who share my DNA to want what I've got going on, and possibly help them out along the way."
Romans,11,15,"Like, if getting rid of them is like bringing peace to the whole world, imagine how lit it'll be when they come back! It'll be like life springing up from the dead, yo!"
Romans,11,16,"Like, if the firstfruit is all legit, then the whole lump is totally legit too, ya know? And if the root is all sacred, then the branches are sacred too, like for real."
Romans,11,17,"Yo, listen up! So, check it, if some of the branches got snapped off, and you, being like a wild olive tree, got grafted into that crew, then you also get to share in the root and all the good stuff from that olive tree. Oh, and by the way, when it says 'among them', it really means 'for them' too. Just keeping you in the loop!"
Romans,11,18,"Don't flex on the branches, my dude. But if you really gotta flex, just remember, without the root, you ain't nothing, the root made you, bro."
Romans,11,19,"So like, you might say, 'Yo, those branches got snapped off so I could totally be grafted in!'"
Romans,11,20,"So, like, because they didn't believe, they got cut off, but you, like, you're still here because of your faith. Don't get all cocky and stuff, but, like, stay humble and have some respect, ya know?"
Romans,11,21,"Yo, listen up! If God didn't spare the natural branches, then you better watch out, because He might not spare you either."
Romans,11,22,"Check it out! God's all about being kind and strict. If some peeps messed up, He got serious on them. But if you stay on His good side, He's all about being kind to you. But watch out, if you don't, you'll end up cut off too."
Romans,11,23,"And, like seriously, if they can just stop being so doubtful, God can totally bring them back into the fold, you know?"
Romans,11,24,"Like, if you were, y'know, part of a wild olive tree by default, but then got connected to a good olive tree, totally against the norm, then it's, like, way more likely that these original branches will be connected back to their own olive tree, right?"
Romans,11,25,"Hey fam, I don't want y'all to be clueless about this secret, because I don't want you to think you're all that. Just so you know, Israel is in the dark about some stuff, but only until all the Gentiles have joined the crew. (BTW, blindness can also mean hardness)"
Romans,11,26,"And like, all of Israel is gonna be saved, like it's written and all, that Deliverer is gonna come outta Sion and be all, like, turning away ungodliness from Jacob and stuff:"
Romans,11,27,"This is my promise to them, when I erase their mistakes."
Romans,11,28,"When it comes to the good news, they may not be on our side, but when it comes to being chosen, they are loved because of our ancestors."
Romans,11,29,"God's gifts and calling can't be taken back, no regrets."
Romans,11,30,"So like, in the past you all were skeptical about God and stuff, but now you've scored some serious mercy because of their lack of belief. (Or you could say, they didn't really follow through)"
Romans,11,31,"Just like how these people have also not believed, so that through your kindness they can also experience mercy. {believed: or, obeyed}"
Romans,11,32,"God has like, gathered everyone up in this state of not believing, so that He can show mercy on all of us. Like, He's got our back and wants to help us out."
Romans,11,33,"Wow, just when you thought you knew everything, God's wisdom and knowledge come out of nowhere and blow your mind! His judgments are like total mysteries that you can never figure out, and his ways are so next level, no one can even handle them!"
Romans,11,34,"Like, who can really understand what the Lord is thinking? Or, you know, can anyone claim to be his personal advisor?"
Romans,11,35,"Like, who was the OG to give to God? And now karma's gonna pay them back and stuff?"
Romans,11,36,"Yo, everything comes from Him, happens through Him, and exists for Him. Give Him mad props forever. Amen, fam."
Romans,12,1,"Yo, fam, listen up! I urge you, my squad, based on all the awesome things God has done for us, to offer your bodies as a lit sacrifice. Like, be pure and pleasing to God, which is just, like, the reasonable thing to do, you know?"
Romans,12,2,"Don't just go with the flow and act like everyone else. Instead, change your mindset and let your thoughts be renewed. This way, you can find out what's truly good, acceptable, and perfect according to God's will."
Romans,12,3,"Alrighty, listen up, y'all! God has blessed me with some real grace, so I gotta drop some truth on each and every one of you. Don't go around thinking you're better than you actually are - that's a big no-no. Instead, keep it real and humble, knowing that God has given each person a unique level of faith. Stay grounded and stay focused, fam! üôèüíØ"
Romans,12,4,"Yo, like, we all part of one team, and each of us got our own unique roles, ya know?"
Romans,12,5,"So, like, all of us, there are many, ya know, but we're all part of this one crew in Christ, and we're all like, connected and stuff, like members of the same squad."
Romans,12,6,"So, like, we've all got different gifts, right? And, like, if you've got the gift of prophecy, then go ahead and prophesy, but make sure it's in line with your faith."
Romans,12,7,"For those of us who serve others, let's be patient and dedicated in our service. And for those who teach, let's be devoted and passionate in sharing knowledge."
Romans,12,8,"If you're good at giving advice, do it in a motivational way. If you're generous, don't make a big deal out of it, just keep it simple. If you're in charge, take your role seriously and put in the effort. And if you're showing kindness to others, do it with a cheerful heart."
Romans,12,9,"Keep love real, no fake vibes. Straight up hate the evil stuff, stick to the good vibes."
Romans,12,10,"Treat each other with mad love like a fam, giving props and showing respect; putting others above yourself; showing love for the squad"
Romans,12,11,Don't be lazy when it comes to work; be passionate about what you do; serve the Lord with enthusiasm;
Romans,12,12,"Celebrating the good vibes, staying chill through tough times, and keeping the prayers going strong without giving up;"
Romans,12,13,Helping out fellow believers in need and being welcoming to others.
Romans,12,14,Show love to those who give you a hard time: send positive vibes and don't send any negativity their way.
Romans,12,15,"Show love and support when your friends are happy, and empathize with them when they're feeling sad."
Romans,12,16,"Y'all should be chill with each other and on the same wavelength. Don't be all caught up in materialistic stuff, but instead show respect to everyone, no matter their status. And don't act like you're the smartest person ever. Remember to stay humble, ya know?"
Romans,12,17,"Don't play the revenge game, fam. Keep it real and do what's right in the eyes of everyone."
Romans,12,18,"If you can, try to live in peace with everyone as much as you can."
Romans,12,19,"Yo fam, don't seek revenge on your own, but instead make room for divine justice. It's written, 'I got this, vengeance is my gig. I'll handle it,' says the Lord."
Romans,12,20,"So, like, if your enemy is hungry, hook them up with some food; if they're thirsty, pass them a drink: 'cause, ya know, by doing that you'll be piling up hot coals on their head."
Romans,12,21,"Don't let evil get the upper hand, but crush it with kindness."
Romans,13,1,"Respect the authorities, man. 'Cause there's no power except God's power, ya dig? The ones in charge are there 'cause God put 'em there."
Romans,13,2,"So, like, anyone who, like, totally goes against authority is, like, totally going against what God wants, and, like, those who resist are just, like, bringing bad juju upon themselves."
Romans,13,3,"Yo, listen up! Rulers ain't here to scare ya if you're doing good stuff. So, why not chill and not be stressed about their authority? Just be a decent human and you'll earn some serious respect, man!"
Romans,13,4,"Yo, this dude is like God's representative sent to do good for you. But if you decide to do some shady stuff, watch out, 'cause he ain't playin'. He's God's guy, the one who dishes out payback to those who do evil."
Romans,13,5,"So like, you really gotta be obedient, not just because you're afraid of getting in trouble, but also because it's the right thing to do deep down."
Romans,13,6,"So, like, you gotta pay taxes and stuff. 'Cause, you know, those peeps who collect the money are like, doing God's work and all. They're always busy with this stuff, you feel me?"
Romans,13,7,"So make sure you give everyone what they deserve: taxes to the government, fees to the authorities, respect to those who deserve it, and honor to those who deserve honor."
Romans,13,8,"Don't owe anyone anything, just show love to each other, 'cause when you love someone, you've totally nailed the law."
Romans,13,9,"So basically, don't cheat, don't murder, don't steal, don't lie, don't be jealous of other people's stuff. Oh, and one more thing - treat others as you would like to be treated, fam."
Romans,13,10,"Love doesn't harm your squad, so it's the way to follow all the rules, you know?"
Romans,13,11,"And, like, knowing what's up with the present moment, it's totally time to wake up from being oblivious: 'cause our salvation is closer than we first thought, yo."
Romans,13,12,"The night is basically over, it's daytime soon: so let's ditch all the shady stuff we've been doing and gear up with some positive energy."
Romans,13,13,"Yo, let's keep it real and be straight up with our actions. No partying and getting wasted, no doing shady stuff in private, no unnecessary drama and jealousy."
Romans,13,14,"Instead, embrace the vibes of the Lord Jesus Christ and don't even think about indulging in worldly desires."

Romans,14,2,"Some people think they can eat anything, while others, who are more sensitive, stick to a plant-based diet."
Romans,14,3,"Don't hate on someone for what they eat, and don't judge someone who chooses not to eat the same things as you do. God accepts each of us, regardless of our dietary choices."
Romans,14,4,"Like, who are you to judge someone else's servant? It's up to their own master to decide if they succeed or fail. Yeah, they'll totally be supported because God has the power to keep them standing strong."
Romans,14,5,"Some people think one day is more important than others, while others think every day is equally important. Everyone should be confident in their own beliefs."
Romans,14,6,"If someone pays attention to a specific day, they do it as an offering to the Lord. But if someone doesn't pay attention to a specific day, it's also to the Lord that they don't pay attention. When someone eats, they do it as an act of gratitude towards God. And if someone doesn't eat, it's also to the Lord that they don't eat, and they give thanks to God."
Romans,14,7,"None of us live just for ourselves, and no one dies alone."
Romans,14,8,"So, like, whether we're alive or kickin' it in the afterlife, we're all about the Lord, you know? Whether we're rockin' this life or bouncin' to the next, we totally belong to the Lord."
Romans,14,9,"So basically, Jesus died and then came back to life, all so that he could be in charge of both the people who've passed away and those who are still alive."
Romans,14,10,"But like, why are you judging your bro? Or why are you like, not giving a frick about your bro? 'Cause, like, we're all gonna have to face the judgment seat of Christ, fam."
Romans,14,11,"Yo, listen up, God's got something to say. Just so you all know, as long as I'm alive, every single person out there is gonna have to bow down to me and admit that God's the real deal."
Romans,14,12,"So, like, every single one of us is gonna have to, like, answer to God, you know?"
Romans,14,13,"So, like, let's ditch the whole judging thing, 'kay? Instead, let's focus on making sure we don't trip up our bros with our actions or give them any reason to stumble."
Romans,14,14,"I totally get it and I'm convinced by the Lord Jesus that nothing is inherently dirty. But if someone thinks something is dirty, then it's dirty to them. #respect"
Romans,14,15,"But if your homie is bummed out about what you eat, you ain't really showing much love. Don't mess up their vibe with your food, 'cause Christ died for them too. (according to love)"
Romans,14,16,"So, like, don't let people hate on your good vibes, okay?"
Romans,14,17,"Bro, God's kingdom ain't about stuffing your face or chugging drinks; it's all about being right with Him, finding that inner peace, and embracing the pure joy the Holy Spirit brings."
Romans,14,18,"Like, if you're all about serving Christ and stuff, then God totally approves of you and people think you're legit."
Romans,14,19,"So, like, let's all go for the stuff that brings peace and helps each other grow, ya know?"
Romans,14,20,"Don't mess up God's creation by eating meat. Everything is actually okay to eat, but it's bad for someone who eats it knowing it's wrong."
Romans,14,21,"It's best to avoid eating meat or drinking alcohol if it causes your bro to trip up, get offended, or feel weak."
Romans,14,22,"You got faith? Keep it between you and God, man. The real deal is not feeling guilty about what you're cool with."
Romans,14,23,"If you're not sure about something and you still go for it, you're in a tough spot if it turns out wrong. Because when you do things without belief, it's considered a sin. Doubting here means thinking and being picky about what you should and shouldn't consume. Damned means you're in trouble and could face punishment."
Romans,15,1,"So, like, those of us who got it together should totally support and be there for our peeps who are struggling, instead of just focusing on our own pleasure."
Romans,15,2,"Yo, let's all be considerate of our neighbors to uplift them and promote positive vibes."
Romans,15,3,"Even Jesus wasn't all about himself; but, like it says, I took the heat for all the haters that dissed you."
Romans,15,4,"Like, everything that was written before was written to teach us, so that we can have hope and find patience and comfort in the scriptures, you know?"
Romans,15,5,"Yo, may the Almighty who's all about chillin' and lifting people up make you all vibe together and be on the same wavelength, just like how Jesus would want ya; following His lead and all that."
Romans,15,6,"So that we can all come together and give props to God, who's like the ultimate dad of our main man Jesus Christ."
Romans,15,7,"So, like, accept each other, just as Christ accepted us, bro, for the ultimate glory of God."
Romans,15,8,"So, like, Jesus Christ, he was totally, like, all about supporting the Jewish peeps and spreading God's truth, ya know? He wanted to keep the promises that were made to our ancestors, for real:"
Romans,15,9,"So that the non-Jewish peeps could give mad props to God for being so merciful; like it says in the book, 'That's why I'm gonna shout you out to all the non-Jews and jam out to your name.'"
Romans,15,10,"And once again he says, Yo, Gentiles, party it up with his peeps."
Romans,15,11,"And once more, Give props to the Lord, all you non-Jewish peeps; and give him a shoutout, everyone!"
Romans,15,12,"And like, Isaiah says, there's gonna be this really cool dude from the fam of Jesse who's gonna rise up and become the ruler of all the non-Jewish peeps. And the non-Jewish peeps are totally gonna put their trust in him, y'know?"
Romans,15,13,"Yo, the big man upstairs, who's all about hope, wants to hook you up with mad joy and peace when you believe. The goal is for you to have hella hope, powered up by the Holy Ghost."
Romans,15,14,"And I totally believe in you, my fam, that you all are like, full of goodness, equipped with all the knowledge, and totally capable of giving each other advice."
Romans,15,15,"Yo fam, I gotta keep it real with y'all. I'm hittin' you up with this message to remind you, thanks to God's mad blessings on me."
Romans,15,16,"So, like, I'm all about spreading the word of Jesus Christ to non-Jewish peeps, ya know? Sharing the good news of God and all that, making sure the worship and stuff from non-Jewish fam is totally legit and blessed by the Holy Spirit. #blessed"
Romans,15,17,"So, basically, I can totally flex about anything related to God, all thanks to Jesus Christ."
Romans,15,18,"I won't even mention anything that Christ hasn't done through me to teach the non-Jews to obey, both in what I say and what I do."
Romans,15,19,"By doing some intense supernatural stuff, with the power of the Holy Spirit, I've totally spread the good news of Jesus from Jerusalem all the way to Illyricum."
Romans,15,20,"Yeah, I've been all about spreading the good news, but not in places where people already know about Jesus, because that would be like building on someone else's work:"
Romans,15,21,"Like, it's written, there are gonna be people who haven't even heard about it, and they are totally gonna see it for themselves. And even those who haven't been told about it yet, they'll be able to figure it out."
Romans,15,22,"That's why I've had major setbacks and couldn't come see you. {major: or, loads of, or so many times}"
Romans,15,23,"But now, like, I've pretty much explored all of these areas and I've been wanting to visit you for, like, so many years now;"
Romans,15,24,"Whenever I travel to Spain, I'll visit you. I really hope to see you on my journey and have you accompany me on my way there. It will be great to spend some quality time with you before I continue my journey!"
Romans,15,25,But now I'm headed to Jerusalem to serve and support my fellow believers.
Romans,15,26,"So, like, the cool peeps in Macedonia and Achaia decided to hook up the struggling saints in Jerusalem with some much-needed cash. It's all about that love and support, my dudes."
Romans,15,27,"They're actually pretty happy about it, and they owe them big time. 'Cause if those non-believers are benefiting from their spiritual stuff, then they should totally help them out in practical ways too."
Romans,15,28,"So once I've finished this task and made sure this project is locked in, I'll swing by your place on my way to Spain."
Romans,15,29,"And I'm confident that when I see you, I'll bring the whole package of blessings from the good news of Jesus Christ."
Romans,15,30,"Hey fam, I'm reaching out to all of you, my fellow believers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and in the spirit of love. I'm asking y'all to join me in praying to God on my behalf. Let's come together and lift up some prayers, ya feel me?"
Romans,15,31,"Prayin' to be saved from those non-believers in Judaea and hopin' that my work in Jerusalem is appreciated by the saints, ya know? #NoHaters"
Romans,15,32,"I hope I can meet up with you and have a great time, all in accordance with God's plan, and we can chill and have a blast together."

Romans,16,17,"Yo, fam! Listen up, I'm telling you, squad, keep an eye on those peeps who be stirring up drama and causing trouble, going against the teachings you've been educated with. Flex on 'em and stay away from that negativity."
Romans,16,18,"Because those people, they're not about serving our OG Jesus Christ, they're all about chasing their own desires and using smooth talk to trick the naive and innocent."
Romans,16,19,"Your obedience has become known to everyone. I'm stoked about it for you! However, I want you to be smart about doing what's right and chill when it comes to getting into trouble. (simple: or, harmless)"
Romans,16,20,"And soon, the chill God will crush Satan beneath your kicks. May the good vibes of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. üôè"

Romans,16,25,"So, like, this guy has the ultimate power to like, make you all stable and stuff, following my gospel and all the things Jesus Christ preached, you know? It's all based on this super mysterious revelation that has been kept secret since the beginning of time, man!"
Romans,16,26,"Yo, listen up! This is a big reveal moment. The ancient texts from the prophets, by the order of the OG God, have brought this knowledge to all the nations, so everyone can choose to have faith and obey."
Romans,16,27,"Shoutout to God, the ultimate guru of wisdom. All the props and respect go to Him, thanks to Jesus Christ forever. Amen. This letter was written to the Romans while Phebe, a total rockstar serving at the church in Cenchrea, delivered it."
1 Corinthians,1,1,"Yo, it's Paul, chosen by God to be one of Jesus Christ's crew. Shout out to my bro Sosthenes for being part of this too."
1 Corinthians,1,2,"To all the squad at the Corinthian church, the ones who are living their best lives in Jesus Christ, chosen to be the ultimate holy squad, along with everyone out there who rep Jesus Christ our boss, whether they're with us or not:"
1 Corinthians,1,3,"Yo, may you be blessed with mad grace and peace from God our Father and the homie Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,1,4,"Yo, I wanna give thanks to my God for always having your back, 'cause you've been blessed with mad grace from Jesus Christ, fam."
1 Corinthians,1,5,"You all be flexin' with his blessings, with mad speaking skills and knowin' everything in every situation."
1 Corinthians,1,6,"Like, Christ's message totally got legitimized in you, fam:"
1 Corinthians,1,7,"So that you don't lack any dope gifts, keeping it chill and waiting for when our main homie Jesus Christ comes through: {coming: Gr. revelation}"
1 Corinthians,1,8,"And He will make sure you stay strong until the very end, so that you can be flawless on the day when our Lord Jesus Christ arrives."
1 Corinthians,1,9,"God is totally loyal, and He's the one who called you to be part of the squad with His Son, Jesus Christ, who's our awesome leader."
1 Corinthians,1,10,"Listen up, fam! I'm here to ask y'all, my brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to be on the same page and avoid any drama. Let's stay united and have a solid bond, thinking and making decisions together as one. No room for splits or disagreements, ya dig? (Note: 'divisions' means 'schisms', just so you know!)"
1 Corinthians,1,11,"So, like, word has spread to me through my homies from Chloe's squad, that y'all be having some serious drama going on among you."
1 Corinthians,1,12,"So, like, I gotta say this, you know? Every one of you is like, claiming 'I'm all about Paul,' or 'I follow Apollos,' or 'I'm team Cephas,' or even 'I'm all in for Christ, y'all.'"
1 Corinthians,1,13,"Yo, is Christ like, split into different factions? Did Paul get crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?"
1 Corinthians,1,14,"Bruh, I'm so relieved that I didn't baptize any of y'all except for Crispus and Gaius. Like, seriously though."
1 Corinthians,1,15,Just in case anyone starts saying that I baptized people thinking I'm some kind of big shot.
1 Corinthians,1,16,"Oh, by the way, I totally baptized Stephanas' whole crew, but honestly, I can't remember if there were any others that I baptized. üåä"
1 Corinthians,1,17,"So basically, Jesus didn't send me to baptize people, but to spread the good news and share the gospel. And let me tell you, it's not about using fancy words or sounding super smart, because that would take away the power of the message behind the cross of Christ. You feel me?"
1 Corinthians,1,18,"Like, to those who are like, totally lost, the message of the cross may seem so, like, dumb or whatever. But to us who are like, saved and stuff, it's all about God's ultimate power, you know?"
1 Corinthians,1,19,"Like, the scripture says, I'm gonna totally wreck the knowledge of all those smarty-pants and make the understanding of the clever ones completely useless."
1 Corinthians,1,20,"Like, where are all the smart ones at? Or the ones who know how to write really well? Or those who love to argue and stuff? Seriously, God totally made the wisdom of this world look dumb. Can't even handle it."
1 Corinthians,1,21,"Like, back in the day, God was all like, super wise and stuff, but the world, like, didn't even get it, you know? So, like, God decided to do something totally unexpected and save those who have faith by, get this, preaching, which everyone thought was kinda foolish. But hey, who's laughing now?"
1 Corinthians,1,22,The Jews are all about looking for signs and the Greeks are all about wisdom:
1 Corinthians,1,23,"Yo, we out here spreading the word about Jesus getting nailed on the cross. Some peeps, especially the Jews, trip over it; they just can't vibe with it. And then there's the Greeks, they straight up think it's all nonsense."
1 Corinthians,1,24,"But for those who are invited, whether they're Jews or Greeks, Christ is the ultimate power move from God, packing both the strength and the smarts."
1 Corinthians,1,25,"Yo, peeps, listen up! God's foolishness is actually wayyy smarter than us humans, and His weakness is like, super powered compared to our strength."
1 Corinthians,1,26,"Yo, guys, check it out. You see how not a whole lot of smart or powerful or rich folks are the ones getting called here, right?"
1 Corinthians,1,27,"Like, God totally chooses the stuff that seems dumb in the world to totally surprise the so-called smart ones, and He picks the stuff that seems weak to totally shock the powerful ones, you know?"
1 Corinthians,1,28,"Yo, check this out - God straight up picked the lowly and despised things of the world. And get this, even stuff that doesn't really exist, He chose to overthrow the things that do exist."
1 Corinthians,1,29,"So, like, nobody should be all like boasting or showing off when they're around Him."
1 Corinthians,1,30,"But like, in Christ Jesus, God made him, like, our source of wisdom, righteousness, holiness, and redemption, you know?"
1 Corinthians,1,31,"So, like it says, if you're flexing, flex on the Lord."
1 Corinthians,2,1,"Yo, fam, when I rolled up to you all, I didn't come with fancy words or deep knowledge, just straight-up sharing God's truth."
1 Corinthians,2,2,"Because, like, I made up my mind to be all about Jesus Christ and, ya know, His whole crucifixion situation, and that's it. No other distractions, no other knowledge."
1 Corinthians,2,3,"And, like, I was totally there for you when I didn't have it all together, and I was scared and seriously shaking."
1 Corinthians,2,4,"And I wasn't just using cool words and stuff to try and sound smart, but I was actually showing the power of the Spirit in the way I spoke and preached. Like, my words had some serious oomph and impact, ya know? It wasn't about just trying to persuade people with fancy talk."
1 Corinthians,2,5,"So, like, don't let your faith depend on human knowledge, but rather on the awesome power of God. (BTW, 'stand' means 'be' in Greek.)"
1 Corinthians,2,6,"But yo, we drop wisdom for those who got it together, you feel me? But it ain't the wisdom of this world or those big shots that end up being worthless, nah fam."
1 Corinthians,2,7,"But we're out here flexin' God's divine knowledge in a straight-up baffling way, like, His super secret wisdom that He planned way before the world even existed just so we could shine, fam:"
1 Corinthians,2,8,"None of the cool rulers in this world had a clue: If they did, they wouldn't have totally messed up and put the Almighty Glorious Lord on the cross."
1 Corinthians,2,9,"But like, as it's written, you can't even imagine the awesome stuff God has planned for those who are totally obsessed with Him. It's beyond what your eyes have seen, what your ears have heard, and what your mind can even comprehend. Seriously, mind-blowing things await those who truly love Him."
1 Corinthians,2,10,"God just straight up showed us everything through his Spirit, like, no cap. 'Cause the Spirit be investigating all things, like even the super deep stuff about God."
1 Corinthians,2,11,"Nobody knows a person's thoughts and feelings except their own spirit within them. Similarly, nobody can fully comprehend God's thoughts and ways except the Spirit of God."
1 Corinthians,2,12,"So, like, we're totally not about that worldly spirit, you know? But we've got this amazing spirit from God, and it's all about helping us understand and appreciate the awesome things that God has freely blessed us with."
1 Corinthians,2,13,"So, like, we're talking about some deep stuff here. But we're not using fancy words taught by smart humans. Nah, we're speaking the Holy Ghost's language, making those spiritual connections, you know?"
1 Corinthians,2,14,"However, someone who's not spiritually inclined won't get what God's all about. It's like nonsense to them. They just can't get it because it's on a whole other level."
1 Corinthians,2,15,"But someone who is in tune with the greater energy understands everything, yet they themselves are not understood by others."
1 Corinthians,2,16,"Like, seriously, who can even begin to understand the thoughts of the Lord? It's not like we can give Him advice or anything. But as believers, we have the same mind as Christ. It's, like, such a mega privilege, you know? {may: Gr. shall}"
1 Corinthians,3,1,"Yo, fam, I gotta keep it real with you. When I try to drop some wisdom on you, I can't come at you on some deep spiritual level. Nah, I gotta break it down like you're still rockin' the training wheels in this whole Christianity game."
1 Corinthians,3,2,"I've been giving you the basic stuff, not the advanced lessons: 'cause back then you couldn't handle it, and guess what? You still can't."
1 Corinthians,3,3,"You're still stuck in a worldly mindset: because there's jealousy, arguing, and cliques among you, aren't you just acting like everyone else?"
1 Corinthians,3,4,"Dude, some say, 'I'm with Paul,' and others are like, 'Nah man, I'm team Apollos.' Are you guys not being totally superficial?"
1 Corinthians,3,5,"So like, who even is Paul, and who's this Apollos dude? They're just like, servants who helped you believe in God, you know? Just doing their thing, like how the Lord made them to be."
1 Corinthians,3,6,"I did my part by starting it, Apollos did his part by nurturing it, but God made it grow."
1 Corinthians,3,7,"So basically, the person doing the planting and the one doing the watering don't really matter. It's all about God who brings the growth."
1 Corinthians,3,8,"So, like, the one who does the planting and the one who waters, they're totally on the same team, you know? And, like, every person will totally get their own reward based on, like, how much effort they put in. No joke."
1 Corinthians,3,9,"Because we're all on the hustle together with the Big Man Upstairs: you're His top-notch crew, His masterpiece. So, yeah, you can say we're like His planted crops or the blueprints to His epic architectural project. Just saying, farming vibes, man."
1 Corinthians,3,10,"Based on the supernatural favor from God that's been granted to me, like a skilled architect, I've laid the groundwork and someone else is building upon it. But everyone should be careful about how they continue to develop it."
1 Corinthians,3,11,"There's no other solid base we can build on other than the one we've already got - Jesus Christ, no less."
1 Corinthians,3,12,"Okay, so picture this: if someone tries to add stuff on top of this solid foundation, they can either choose valuable things like gold and silver or not-so-valuable things like wood, hay, or stubble."
1 Corinthians,3,13,"Everyone's work will be shown for what it really is: when the day comes, it'll be like a big reveal, with fire testing everything to see what kind of work each person has done. üî•"
1 Corinthians,3,14,"If someone's work stands the test of time, they'll get a sick reward, bro."
1 Corinthians,3,15,"If someone's work goes up in flames, they'll take a hit, but they'll still make it out alive, kinda like going through fire."
1 Corinthians,3,16,"Yo, don't you know that you are like God's house and the Spirit of God straight up lives in you?"
1 Corinthians,3,17,"If anyone disrespects God's place, they will be taken down by God; because that place is sacred, and guess what? That's where you come in. You're important, just so you know. üòá"
1 Corinthians,3,18,"Don't fool yourself, fam. If anyone thinks they're all that and wise in this world, they gotta embrace the power of being a fool in order to truly gain wisdom."
1 Corinthians,3,19,"The world's wisdom may seem dumb to God. Like, it's written, He catches smart people in their own clever schemes."
1 Corinthians,3,20,"And once again, like, God totally knows that the thoughts of people who think they're so smart are, like, totally pointless."
1 Corinthians,3,21,"So, like, don't go around flexing on people, okay? 'Cause everything is yours, man!"
1 Corinthians,3,22,"Whether it's Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or whoever's popular, or life, or death, or things happening now, or things yet to come ‚Äì you've got it all!"
1 Corinthians,3,23,"And y'all belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God."
1 Corinthians,4,1,"Yo, consider us as the OGs of Christ, holding it down as we handle God's deep secrets."
1 Corinthians,4,2,"And like, stewards gotta be legit loyal, ya know."
1 Corinthians,4,3,"But honestly, it's not a big deal to me if you or anyone else judges me. I mean, even I don't judge myself. #NoJudgment"
1 Corinthians,4,4,"So like, I don't even know my own faults, but that doesn't mean I'm innocent, y'know? It's the Lord who's the ultimate judge, like total vibes."
1 Corinthians,4,5,"So, like, don't be so quick to judge anything before it's time, until the Lord comes and spills the tea on all the shady stuff in the dark. Then, He'll expose everyone's true intentions and thoughts. And that's when each person will get their chance for major props from God."
1 Corinthians,4,6,"Yo, fam, let me break it down for ya. So, me and my boy Apollos, we kinda put ourselves in this story to teach you a lesson. Here's the deal: don't go thinking too highly of people, like, more than what's written about 'em. Don't get all arrogant and start comparing yourselves to each other."
1 Corinthians,4,7,"Like, who's responsible for your uniqueness compared to others? And what do you have that you didn't get from someone else? If you did receive it, why are you bragging as if you didn't get it from someone? Like, seriously, who made you so special?"
1 Corinthians,4,8,"Okay, listen up squad! Right now, you think you've got it all together, you're stacking up those riches, and acting like you're the kings of the world, leaving us behind. I really wish that you guys were actually reigning like you think you are, so that we could all be reigning together, you feel me?"
1 Corinthians,4,9,"So, like, I believe that God has kinda put us, the apostles, at the very end with, like, a job to do that might lead to our deaths and stuff. It's like we're some sort of show for everyone - you know, like a spectacle for both the world, angels, and people."
1 Corinthians,4,10,"We may seem foolish for following Christ, but you think you're wise because of Christ; we may appear weak, but you see yourselves as strong; you may think you're important, but we're often looked down upon."
1 Corinthians,4,11,"Bro, even until now, we're famished, thirsty, rocking no clothes, getting pushed around, and we don't even have a place to chill, tbh."
1 Corinthians,4,12,"And we hustle, grinding with our own hands: when we're hated on, we spread positivity; when we're oppressed, we tough it out:"
1 Corinthians,4,13,"Yo, people out here talking trash about us, but we're just staying humble. Society treats us like trash and we're constantly facing criticism and ridicule."
1 Corinthians,4,14,"Just so you know, I'm not trying to embarrass you or anything, but it's like I'm giving you a heads-up, my beloved crew."
1 Corinthians,4,15,"Even though you have countless people guiding you in the ways of Christ, you don't have many who truly care for you like a father. But let me tell you, I have become like a spiritual parent to you, bringing you into the faith through the good news of Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,4,16,"Yo, I'm really urging you guys, like, please, just follow my lead."
1 Corinthians,4,17,"That's why I sent Timotheus, who's like my fam and totally loyal to the Lord. He's gonna remind you of how I do things in line with Christ, just like I teach in every church, you know?"
1 Corinthians,4,18,"Yo, some of y'all actin' all high and mighty, thinkin' I ain't gonna roll up on you."
1 Corinthians,4,19,"But I'll be there soon, if the Lord's cool with it, and I'll figure out who's legit and who's just talkin' big game."
1 Corinthians,4,20,"Like, the kingdom of God isn't just about saying stuff, it's all about the real deal power."
1 Corinthians,4,21,"What's your deal? Should I come at you all strict and authoritative, or with love and a chill vibe?"
1 Corinthians,5,1,"So, apparently y'all have been hearing rumors about some serious scandalous stuff going on. Like, I'm talking about this whole situation where someone's been sleeping with their stepmom, and it's not even something the non-believers would dare to do. Seriously messed up, right?"
1 Corinthians,5,2,"And y'all are flexing, instead of being sad that the person who did this should be kicked out of your crew."
1 Corinthians,5,3,"So, like, even though I'm not physically there, my spirit is totally present and I've already made a decision about the person who did this. It's like I'm there with them, you know?"
1 Corinthians,5,4,"Yo, fam, when you all come together in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and my spirit is with you, with the mad power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
1 Corinthians,5,5,"To hand over someone to Satan, so their physical desires are destroyed but their soul is saved on the day of the Lord Jesus."
1 Corinthians,5,6,"Guys, it's not cool to boast like that. Don't you realize that even a small bit of negative influence can affect everything around it?"
1 Corinthians,5,7,"Get rid of all that old negativity, so you can become a fresh new vibe, just like you already are. 'Cause, you know, Jesus, our ultimate hero, sacrificed himself for our sake. Like, he went full-on selfless mode for us, ya know?"
1 Corinthians,5,8,"So, like, let's celebrate, but not with all that outdated negativity, like being mean and wicked and stuff. Instead, let's embrace the pure and genuine vibes of sincerity and truth. It's all about keeping it real, you know? #unleavenedbread #sincerityandtruth #goodvibesonly"
1 Corinthians,5,9,"Yo, in my previous message, I straight up told you not to hang with those who be getting into shady business."
1 Corinthians,5,10,"But that doesn't mean you should hang out with all the people out there who are into doing the naughty stuff, or the ones who are all about greed and taking advantage of others, or the ones obsessed with worshiping idols. If you tried to avoid them all, you'd have to leave this whole world, and that's just not possible."
1 Corinthians,5,11,"Yo, listen up fam. I gotta drop some knowledge on you. If you chill with someone who claims to be your bro, but they out here doing the dirty (eww), or always wantin' what others got, or worshiping mad idols, or always runnin' their mouth, or stayin' lit all the time, or straight up scammin' people, don't even bother sharin' a meal with 'em. Peace out."
1 Corinthians,5,12,"Why should I bother judging those outside our circle? Focus on judging those within it, right?"
1 Corinthians,5,13,"But God will judge those who are not believers. So, make sure to distance yourself from that person who is doing evil."
1 Corinthians,6,1,"Yo, why y'all takin' your beef to some random judge when you could solve it among your crew, the righteous ones?"
1 Corinthians,6,2,"Do y'all not realize that we saints are gonna flex our judgment on the whole world? And if y'all can handle judging the world, then why aren't you stepping up to handle the tiniest disputes, huh?"
1 Corinthians,6,3,"Like, do you not realize that we're gonna have the power to make judgments about angels? Dude, how much easier will it be to deal with everyday stuff then?"
1 Corinthians,6,4,"If you have any issues or disputes in this world, let those who are not the popular crowd in the church handle them."
1 Corinthians,6,5,"I gotta say, this is seriously disappointing. Like, seriously, is it even possible that there's not a single person with some wisdom among you? I mean, come on, isn't there at least one person who can settle disputes between their own crew?"
1 Corinthians,6,6,"But bruh, one sibling be straight up filing lawsuits against another sibling, for real, and on top of that, doing it in front of non-believers. Man, that's a mess."
1 Corinthians,6,7,"Okay, hear me out, fam. There's like a major issue going on among you, like for real. Y'all are constantly taking each other to court and stuff. But like, why not just chill and let it slide? I mean, why not swallow your pride and let yourself be taken advantage of instead? #FoodForThought"
1 Corinthians,6,8,"Dude, you're totally out of line, cheating and scamming your bros like that."
1 Corinthians,6,9,"Bruh, like, don't you know that all the unrighteous people won't even get to inherit God's kingdom? Don't let anyone trick you, 'cause ain't nobody who's into that fornication, idol-worshipping, adultery, acting all feminine, or messing around with other dudes gonna make it."
1 Corinthians,6,10,"Like, dudes, listen up! Thieves, greedy peeps, party animals, haters, and the money-hungry crew won't be getting into God's kingdom, ya feel me?"
1 Corinthians,6,11,"And yeah, some of you used to be like that. But now, you've had a major glow-up. You've been cleansed, set apart, and made right in the name of the Lord Jesus, all thanks to the power of the Spirit of our God."
1 Corinthians,6,12,"I can technically do whatever I want, but not everything is helpful or beneficial. Yeah, sure, I have the freedom to do it, but I ain't gonna let anything control me."
1 Corinthians,6,13,"Food is meant for the stomach, and the stomach for food, but both will be destroyed by God. However, our bodies are not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is meant for our bodies. 'Food' here refers to all kinds of sustenance, not just flesh."
1 Corinthians,6,14,"And like, God totally brought the Lord back to life, and He's totally gonna bring us back to life too, by His own mega power."
1 Corinthians,6,15,"Do you not realize that your bodies are part of Christ? So, should I take the parts of Christ and use them for inappropriate things? Absolutely not!"
1 Corinthians,6,16,"Yo, didn't ya know that if you hook up with a person who gets around, y'all become like, attached? This dude says that two peeps who do the dirty become like, a single entity or whatever."
1 Corinthians,6,17,"But if you're vibin' with the Lord, you become one spirit, man."
1 Corinthians,6,18,"Yo, stay away from hooking up. Like, any other sin a person does is outside their body, but if you're hooking up, you're messing with your own body, man."
1 Corinthians,6,19,"Like, do you not realize that your body is, like, the temple where the Holy Ghost lives inside you? It's, like, a gift from God and you totally don't belong to yourself, dude."
1 Corinthians,6,20,"You were paid a major price for, so show mad love to God with your body and spirit, which belong to Him."
1 Corinthians,7,1,"So, about what you messaged me...it's actually a good idea for guys to keep their distance from girls."
1 Corinthians,7,2,"But, like, to avoid doing the nasty, each dude should have his own wife, and each chick should have her own husband."
1 Corinthians,7,3,"Husbands, show love and respect to your wives, and wives, do the same for your husbands."
1 Corinthians,7,4,"In a relationship, neither the wife nor the husband has sole ownership of their bodies, they belong to each other equally."
1 Corinthians,7,5,"Don't scam each other, unless you're both cool with it for a bit, so you can focus on fasting and prayer. Then reunite, so Satan doesn't exploit your lack of self-control."
1 Corinthians,7,6,"But, like, just so you know, I'm saying this cuz I can, not 'cause I'm being bossy or anything."
1 Corinthians,7,7,"Yo, I wish everyone was chill AF like me. But y'know, God gives each person their own dope gifts, like one person vibes in one way, and another person does it in a whole different way."
1 Corinthians,7,8,"So, to all the single and widowed peeps out there, it's all good if you stay single, just like me."
1 Corinthians,7,9,"But, like, if they can't handle it, they should totally get married, you know? 'Cause it's way better to be married than all fired up and stuff."
1 Corinthians,7,10,"Now listen up, all you married folks! This isn't just me talking; the Lord Himself says that wives shouldn't leave their hubbies: no way, no how!"
1 Corinthians,7,11,"But if she decides to leave, she should stay single or work things out with her partner, and husbands shouldn't divorce their wives."
1 Corinthians,7,12,"But listen, this is just me talking, not the man upstairs: If a bro's got a wifey who doesn't believe, but she's cool with staying together, he shouldn't kick her to the curb."
1 Corinthians,7,13,"If a girl has a hubby who's not into all this faith stuff and he's cool with living together, then she shouldn't bail on him."
1 Corinthians,7,14,"Like, if one of the partners in a marriage doesn't believe in the same stuff, it's all cool because they still get this cool holy vibe from their spouse. And, check this out, their kids aren't seen as dirty or impure or anything anymore. They're totally in the holy club now."
1 Corinthians,7,15,"But if the unbeliever wants to leave, let them go. A fellow believer is not obligated in situations like these, because God has called us to chill vibes. (chill vibes: Greek - in a peaceful state)"
1 Corinthians,7,16,"Yo, wife, you don't even know if you can save your hubby. And yo, man, you can't really tell if you can save your wifey. Like, who knows, man?"
1 Corinthians,7,17,"Just like how God gave each person different gifts, and how the Lord has given everyone a calling, let them live accordingly. This is the way I want all churches to be."
1 Corinthians,7,18,"If someone is already circumcised, they shouldn't try to undo it. And if someone is not circumcised, there's no need for them to get circumcised."
1 Corinthians,7,19,"Circumcision doesn't matter, and neither does being uncircumcised. What really matters is following God's commandments."
1 Corinthians,7,20,"Like, everyone should stick to their own thing, you know? Keep doing what you were doing when you first started out ‚Äì no need to switch it up or try something different."
1 Corinthians,7,21,"Are you, like, labeled as a servant? Don't stress about it, bro. But if you have the chance to be set free, totally take it, man."
1 Corinthians,7,22,"The one who identifies as a servant under the Lord is actually free in the Lord's eyes. And similarly, the one who identifies as free is actually a servant of Christ. (freeman: in Greek, it means someone who's been set free)"
1 Corinthians,7,23,You were snatched up with some mad cash; don't be all caught up serving other peeps.
1 Corinthians,7,24,"Yo, guys, if you're doing your thing in a specific role, just stick with it and keep it real with God."
1 Corinthians,7,25,"So like, about staying pure, I don't have some strict rule from the big man upstairs. But hey, I'm gonna share my thoughts since I've been blessed with some mercy and try to be trustworthy."
1 Corinthians,7,26,"I guess this is cool considering the tough situation we're in right now, like I think it's a good idea for a dude to act this way. Like, when things get tough and you're in a tight spot, it's all good to handle it like this."
1 Corinthians,7,27,Are you in a committed relationship? Don't rush to break free. Are you single? Don't rush to get into a relationship.
1 Corinthians,7,28,"But, like, if you decide to tie the knot, it's not a sinful move, man. Even if a girl who's never been married chooses to get hitched, it's not a sin either. Just a heads up though, both of 'em may face some challenges in life, but hey, I'm just trying to be gentle with you, ya know?"
1 Corinthians,7,29,"Yo, listen up, fam. Time is ticking, so hear me out. I'm just sayin', my peeps, we don't have much time left. It's important for those who are married to live their lives as if they're not, y'know what I'm sayin'?"
1 Corinthians,7,30,"And those who cry, they cry without losing themselves; and those who are happy, they're happy without getting carried away; and those who buy things, they buy as if they didn't really own them;"
1 Corinthians,7,31,"And those who live in this world, use it responsibly, because the trends and vibes of this world won't last forever."
1 Corinthians,7,32,"But I just wanna say, being single has its perks. Someone who's not tied down can focus on things that matter to the big guy upstairs, ya know, making Him happy and all."
1 Corinthians,7,33,"But someone who's married focuses on worldly matters, trying to make their spouse happy."
1 Corinthians,7,34,"Well, let me tell you something, there's a pretty big distinction between a wife and a virgin. You see, an unmarried woman focuses on the Lord's matters, striving to be pure in both body and spirit. But a married woman, on the other hand, is more concerned about worldly matters and how to keep her husband happy."
1 Corinthians,7,35,"And I say this because it'll benefit you, not to trap you, but to guide you in the right direction, so that you can focus on serving the Lord without any distractions."
1 Corinthians,7,36,"But like, if a guy feels like he's not treating his girlfriend right, and she's, you know, reached a certain age and stuff, and it's, like, necessary and all, then he can do whatever he wants, and it's not really a sin, they can just get married and all."
1 Corinthians,7,37,"But yo, if someone's got that strong heart game and ain't feelin' the pressure to do somethin', but can control their own choices and already decided to stay pure, then they're doing great."
1 Corinthians,7,38,"So like, if someone marries, that's cool and all, but if they don't, that's even better."
1 Corinthians,7,39,"As long as her husband is alive, the wife has to follow the rules; but if her husband passes away, she's free to marry whoever she wants, as long as the person is also a believer."
1 Corinthians,7,40,"But it's better for her to stay the same way, according to my opinion. And I gotta say, I believe I've got the Holy Spirit too."
1 Corinthians,8,1,"When it comes to things offered to idols, we all know a thing or two. Knowledge can make you feel all high and mighty, but showing love builds people up."
1 Corinthians,8,2,"And if anyone thinks they know everything, they actually don't know anything the way they should know."
1 Corinthians,8,3,"But if anyone loves God, it's like everyone knows it about them."
1 Corinthians,8,4,"So like, about eating food that was sacrificed to idols, we all know that those idols are basically meaningless. There's only one true God in the world and no one else."
1 Corinthians,8,5,"You know, there are people who consider themselves gods, you know? They think they're all powerful, whether in the heavens or here on earth. They even go by many names and have a lot of followers, you know, like, lots of lords and stuff."
1 Corinthians,8,6,"Yo, for us there's only one God, the Father, who created everything and we're in Him, and there's only one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom everything exists, and we exist through Him."
1 Corinthians,8,7,"But not everyone knows this, you know? Like, there are some who, even though they know that idols are nothing, still eat food that has been sacrificed to idols. They feel guilty about it because their conscience isn't strong enough. And because they feel guilty, it messes with their moral compass."
1 Corinthians,8,8,"But eating meat doesn't make us better in God's eyes, and avoiding meat doesn't make us worse. It's not about how much we eat or don't eat, dude."
1 Corinthians,8,9,But be careful not to let your freedom become a stumbling block to those who are weak.
1 Corinthians,8,10,"Like, if someone sees you, who knows a lot, chilling in a restaurant that's all about those idols, won't it influence those with a weaker hold on things to like, eat the stuff that's offered to idols? They might get all empowered, you know? (Empowered means like, edified in Greek.)"
1 Corinthians,8,11,"And because of what you know, will the brother who is not strong in faith be destroyed, even though Christ died for him?"
1 Corinthians,8,12,"But, like, when you mess up and hurt your friends' feelings, especially if they're not as strong in their beliefs, you're not just letting them down, but you're also letting down Jesus, man."
1 Corinthians,8,13,"So, like, if eating meat will make my bro feel bad, I won't eat any meat for as long as the world exists, 'cause I don't wanna make my bro feel bad, ya know?"
1 Corinthians,9,1,"Dude, don't you know I'm, like, a legit apostle? And, yeah, I'm totally free too. I've actually seen Jesus Christ, our awesome Lord, with my own eyes, you know? And guess what, you guys are the epic result of my hard work for the Lord!"
1 Corinthians,9,2,"Even if I'm not considered an apostle by others, I'm definitely one to you guys: 'cause y'all are the proof that I'm legit in the Lord's eyes."
1 Corinthians,9,3,"Here's my response to those who question me,"
1 Corinthians,9,4,Don't we have the right to enjoy our food and drinks?
1 Corinthians,9,5,"Don't we have the right to bring along a sister, or maybe even a wife, just like the other apostles do and Jesus' bros and Cephas?"
1 Corinthians,9,6,"Like, why should me and Barnabas be the only ones expected to keep working? Don't we have the right to take a break too?"
1 Corinthians,9,7,Who goes into battle and pays for everything? Who plants a vineyard and doesn't get to enjoy the juicy grapes? And who takes care of a flock without indulging in some creamy milk?
1 Corinthians,9,8,Am I just saying this as a regular person? Doesn't the law say the same thing too?
1 Corinthians,9,9,"Like, in the law of Moses, it's written that you shouldn't like, cover the mouth of the ox while it's grinding the corn, you know? But like, does God really care about oxen?"
1 Corinthians,9,10,"Or is he saying this just for us? Definitely, he wrote this for our benefit: that the one who works should work with hope, and the one who puts in effort should share in that hope."
1 Corinthians,9,11,"If we've given you all this deep spiritual stuff, it's not a big deal if we get some material things in return, right?"
1 Corinthians,9,12,"If others have authority over you, don't we have even more? But we haven't actually used that power. Instead, we endure everything so we don't get in the way of spreading the good news about Christ."
1 Corinthians,9,13,Don't y'all know that the ones who work with sacred stuff get their needs met by the temple? And the ones who serve at the altar also share in its blessings?
1 Corinthians,9,14,"Just like that, the Lord has decided that those who spread the good news should be supported by it."
1 Corinthians,9,15,"But, like, I haven't used any of this stuff, you know? I didn't write all this just so people could do this to me. Seriously, I'd rather die than let anyone ruin my bragging rights."
1 Corinthians,9,16,"Even though I'm out here spreading the good news, I ain't got no reason to flex about it. It's like an obligation weighing heavy on me, like, seriously, bad vibes and regret if I don't go around spreading the good news!"
1 Corinthians,9,17,"If I willingly do this, I'll get a sweet reward, but if it's not my choice, I've been given a special responsibility for spreading the gospel."
1 Corinthians,9,18,"So, um, what do I get out of this, you know? Well, like, the thing is, when I spread the good news about Jesus, I wanna do it for free, you know, no charges or anything. I mean, I don't wanna misuse my authority or anything when it comes to sharing the gospel."
1 Corinthians,9,19,"Even though I'm totally free, I choose to serve everyone to make the most impact."
1 Corinthians,9,20,"So, when it came to hanging with my Jewish peeps, I totally adopted their customs and way of life, just so I could connect with them. And for those who are all about following the law, I played by the rules, because I wanted to win them over too."
1 Corinthians,9,21,"To those who don't follow the rules, I'm willing to adapt (not disregarding God's rules, but living by Christ's teachings) in order to connect with them."
1 Corinthians,9,22,"I entered their world, adapting to their weaknesses, so that I could win them over. I'm flexible in everything I do, aiming to save as many as I can."
1 Corinthians,9,23,"And I'm doing this for the sake of spreading the good news, so that I can be a part of it with {you}."
1 Corinthians,9,24,"Don't you know that everyone who competes in a race wants the prize, but only one wins? So go all out and give it your best shot, so you can come out on top."
1 Corinthians,9,25,"And anyone who goes all out to achieve their goals knows the importance of self-control. They do it for something that will eventually fade away, but we do it for something that lasts forever."
1 Corinthians,9,26,"So, like, I'm all in this race, but I'm not just going without a plan, ya know? And when it comes to fighting, it's not like I'm just throwing punches aimlessly in the air, man!"
1 Corinthians,9,27,"I stay in control of my own body and make sure it obeys me, so that even after telling others the truth, I won't be disqualified myself."
1 Corinthians,10,1,"Yo, fam, let me drop some knowledge on you. Back in the day, our ancestors were all chilling under this massive cloud and then they straight-up crossed the sea, like it was nothing. Just thought you should know, don't wanna leave you clueless, ya feel me?"
1 Corinthians,10,2,"And we all got baptized to Moses, like, in the cloud and in the sea, you know?"
1 Corinthians,10,3,And they all grubbed on the same lit spiritual meal;
1 Corinthians,10,4,"And they all had the same lit spiritual sippin': they drank from that mad spiritual Rock that flexed with them, and that Rock was Christ, fam. {followed...: or, straight up rolled with them}"
1 Corinthians,10,5,"But yo, God wasn't vibin' with a lot of 'em, 'cause they got straight up toppled in the wilderness."
1 Corinthians,10,6,"So, like, these things were sorta like examples for us, ya know? To remind us not to crave bad stuff, just like they did. #lessonlearned #temptation"
1 Corinthians,10,7,"Don't worship idols like some people did before. They just chilled, grubbed, and then turned up."
1 Corinthians,10,8,"Let's not engage in sexual immorality like some of them did, and ended up with twenty-three thousand dead in a single day."
1 Corinthians,10,9,"Let's not try to test Christ like some of them did, and they got completely wrecked by serpents."
1 Corinthians,10,10,"Don't even trip, like some of them did back in the day, complaining and getting wrecked in the process."
1 Corinthians,10,11,"So, like, all these things that went down with them, you know, were basically life lessons for us. They were written down to warn us, since we're the ones living in the end times and all. #LifeLessons #WakeUpCall"
1 Corinthians,10,12,"Yo, if you think you all that, be careful not to mess up and fall flat."
1 Corinthians,10,13,"Yo fam, don't trip 'bout the temptations that come your way. It's all basic stuff that everyone faces. But peep this, God's got your back. He's mad trustworthy and won't let you get tempted beyond your limits. Plus, He'll always hook you up with an exit strategy so you can handle it like a boss."
1 Corinthians,10,14,"So, fam, listen up, I urge y'all, my loved ones, step away from idol worship. #NoIdols"
1 Corinthians,10,15,"Listen up, yo! I'm talking to all the smart peeps out there. It's time for you to weigh in and decide what I'm about to drop."
1 Corinthians,10,16,"Yo, fam, the blessed cup we be sippin', ain't it, like, unitin' us with Jesus' blood? And the bread we be breakin', ain't it, like, unitin' us with Jesus' body?"
1 Corinthians,10,17,"Yo, fam, check it - even though there's a bunch of us, we all make up one tight squad. We're like a single piece of bread, and together we form one dope body. We all get to enjoy that same awesome bread, no one left out!"
1 Corinthians,10,18,"Yo, check it out! Like, think about Israel in their earthly existence, ya know? Don't those who chow down on the sacrifices get to be part of the altar scene?"
1 Corinthians,10,19,"Like, what's the deal then? Is the idol, like, actually worth anything? Or, is the stuff that people offer to idols actually worth anything?"
1 Corinthians,10,20,"But yo, like hear me out, the stuff those non-believers be sacrificin', they be offerin' it to straight up devils, not God. And yo, I don't want y'all gettin' down with the devil's crew, ya feel me?"
1 Corinthians,10,21,You can't sip from God's cup and sip from the devil's cup at the same time. You can't join in at God's table and party at the devil's table.
1 Corinthians,10,22,"Yo, can we make the Lord jelly? Like, are we even more flex than Him?"
1 Corinthians,10,23,"I have the freedom to do whatever, but not everything is helpful. I can do whatever, but not everything builds me up."
1 Corinthians,10,24,"Don't be self-centered, y'all, and look out for each other's bag üí∞."
1 Corinthians,10,25,"If you're buying food at the market, go ahead and eat it without worrying or overthinking about it."
1 Corinthians,10,26,"Yo, the earth is totally the Lord's, like, everything in it too."
1 Corinthians,10,27,"If someone who doesn't believe in what you do invites you to a party, and you feel like going, eat whatever they serve you without overthinking it or worrying about your beliefs."
1 Corinthians,10,28,"But, like, if someone tells you that this food has been offered to idols, don't eat it because of them and because of what you believe is right. 'Cause, you know, the earth and everything in it belongs to the Lord, so we gotta be mindful of that, dude."
1 Corinthians,10,29,"Listen up, fam, I'm talking about having respect for others' feelings, not just your own. Why should someone else's opinion define how free I am to live my life to the fullest?"
1 Corinthians,10,30,"So like, if I'm all about that grace and chill with it, why am I getting hate for being thankful? #blessed"
1 Corinthians,10,31,"So, like, whether you're munching on some snacks, chugging a beverage, or doing anything at all, make sure you're doing it in a way that totally honors God."
1 Corinthians,10,32,"Don't be a jerk to anyone - whether they're Jews, non-Jews, or part of the church fam. No discrimination here! üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è {Gentiles: Gr. Greeks}"
1 Corinthians,10,33,"Yo, I'm all about pleasing everyone and looking out for the greater good. It's not about getting something for myself, but about helping out many peeps and saving their souls, ya know."
1 Corinthians,11,1,"Y'all should totally imitate me, just like I imitate Christ."
1 Corinthians,11,2,"Yo, shoutout to all y'all for showing love and keeping it real by sticking with the things I taught ya. Respect to those who remember me and hold on to our traditions, like I taught ya."
1 Corinthians,11,3,"Just so you're aware, dudes, Christ is like the big boss for every guy out there, and for the ladies, the guy they're with is like their boss, and for Christ himself, God is His boss."
1 Corinthians,11,4,"If a dude prays or predicts stuff with his head covered, he disses himself and his head."
1 Corinthians,11,5,"But, like, if a girl is, like, praying or prophesying without covering her head, it's not cool. It's basically the same as if she shaved her head, which is not respectful, you know?"
1 Corinthians,11,6,"Yo, if a girl isn't wearing a head covering, she might as well shave her head. But if it's considered embarrassing for a girl to be shaved or have short hair, then she should definitely cover up."
1 Corinthians,11,7,A dude shouldn't bother covering his head because he's made in God's image and brings honor to Him. But girls bring honor to dudes.
1 Corinthians,11,8,"Cuz the guy ain't from the girl, but the girl is from the guy."
1 Corinthians,11,9,"Yo, the man wasn't made for the woman; it's the other way around, the woman was made for the man."
1 Corinthians,11,10,"That's why it's important for women to cover their heads as a symbol of respecting their husbands' authority, especially in the presence of angels."
1 Corinthians,11,11,"But yo, listen up, bro. Ain't no one complete without their partner, ya feel me? Whether it's a dude or a sis, we all need each other, all good under the hood, in the eyes of the big man upstairs."
1 Corinthians,11,12,"Just like, the woman came from the man, likewise the man exists because of the woman; but ultimately, everything comes from God."
1 Corinthians,11,13,Y'all need to decide for yourselves: is it cool for a woman to pray to God without covering her head?
1 Corinthians,11,14,"Like, doesn't even nature itself tell you that if a guy has long hair, it's like totally not cool?"
1 Corinthians,11,15,"If a woman has long hair, it's like totally a flex: cause like, her hair is given to her as her natural crown. *crown emoji*"
1 Corinthians,11,16,"But yo, if anyone be all up in your face, we ain't about that vibes, and neither are the churches of God."
1 Corinthians,11,17,"Listen up, fam, I gotta be real with you. I ain't giving props to y'all for this one. It's not cool how y'all be coming together, but things just end up going downhill."
1 Corinthians,11,18,"Yo, listen up. So, when y'all gather in church, word on the street is there's some serious drama going on with divisions and stuff. Gotta admit, I kinda believe it too. Just sayin'."
1 Corinthians,11,19,"Yo, there's gotta be some different beliefs and sects among y'all, so the peeps who are legit can stand out."
1 Corinthians,11,20,"So, when you all gather together in one spot, it's not for casually chowing down on the Lord's supper. It's more than just a meal, ya know? It's a sacred thing, a special occasion that you can't just take lightly."
1 Corinthians,11,21,"Cuz like, when we all chow down, everyone is so focused on getting their own grub that some end up starving while others get totally lit."
1 Corinthians,11,22,"Like, seriously? You have your own houses to eat and drink in, don't you? Or are you gonna diss the church of God and make those who don't have feel bad? What am I even supposed to say to you? Should I be all like, 'You're doing great, keep it up'? Nah, not feeling it. Sorry, not sorry. And by the way, when I say 'have not', I mean, are you poor or what?"
1 Corinthians,11,23,"So, like, I learned from the Lord and now I'm telling you guys this, that on the night Jesus got snaked by one of his own, he grabbed some bread, you know?"
1 Corinthians,11,24,"And like, after he blessed it, he broke the bread and was all like, 'Here, take it and eat it, fam. This bread represents my body, like totally broken for you. Whenever you do this, remember me, you know?'"
1 Corinthians,11,25,"And, like, in the same way, he, like, took the cup after eating and was like, 'Yo, this cup represents the new deal through my blood. So, whenever you drink it, remember me, you feel me?'"
1 Corinthians,11,26,"Whenever you eat this bread and drink from this cup, you're actually proclaiming the Lord's death until He returns. {or, proclaim}"
1 Corinthians,11,27,"So, like anyone who eats this bread and drinks {this} cup of the Lord, without real respect, is, like, totally disrespecting and being guilty of disrespecting the body and blood of the Lord."
1 Corinthians,11,28,"But, like, before you chow down on that bread and take a sip from that cup, take a moment to reflect on yourself, ya know?"
1 Corinthians,11,29,"If you chow down and gulp without showing respect, you're basically inviting trouble and totally oblivious to the significance of the Lord's body. {damnation: or, judgment}"
1 Corinthians,11,30,"That's why a lot of you are feeling so weak and getting sick, and sadly, many have already passed away."
1 Corinthians,11,31,"Like, if we, like, take time to evaluate ourselves, we won't have to worry about others judging us, ya know?"
1 Corinthians,11,32,"But when the haters come for us, the Lord gives us a reality check, so we don't end up in the same mess as everyone else."
1 Corinthians,11,33,"Yo, fam, when y'all gather to grub, make sure to wait for one another."
1 Corinthians,11,34,"If anyone is hungry, they should eat at home; so that when we gather, we don't end up in a bad situation. I'll take care of other matters when I arrive."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"Yo fam, listen up! When it comes to spiritual stuff, my peeps, I don't want y'all to be clueless, you feel me?"
1 Corinthians,12,2,"You all know that back in the day, you were just regular folks, caught up in worshiping those useless idols, just going with the flow."
1 Corinthians,12,3,"Just so you know, anyone who speaks through the Spirit of God wouldn't say anything disrespectful about Jesus. And no one can acknowledge Jesus as the Lord unless they're guided by the Holy Ghost."
1 Corinthians,12,4,"So, like, there are, like, different kinds of gifts, but it's, like, all from the same Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,5,"And there are different ways of running things, but it's all under the same Boss. {admin: or, gigs}"
1 Corinthians,12,6,"And there are different ways of doing things, but it's all the same God who's doing it all."
1 Corinthians,12,7,"But, like, the Spirit's vibes are totally given to everyone to benefit, you know?"
1 Corinthians,12,8,"Yo, peeps, listen up! The Holy Spirit blesses some with mad wisdom, while others get that knowledge flowin' from the same Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,9,"And some have mad trust in the vibes from the same energy; while others have the sick healing skills, thanks to that same energy."
1 Corinthians,12,10,"Some people have the ability to do miracles, others have the gift of prophecy. There are also those who can sense and understand different spirits. Some have the talent to speak in various languages, and others can interpret those languages."
1 Corinthians,12,11,"But, like, the same Spirit is, like, behind all these things, you know? It's, like, doin' its thing, you know? And it, like, gives everyone what they need, ya know? It's, like, on point with that."
1 Corinthians,12,12,"Just like how a person's body has different parts but all those parts together make up one whole body, the same goes for Jesus, he's like the ultimate squad."
1 Corinthians,12,13,"Through one Spirit, we all join together and become part of one crew, regardless of whether we're born into a Jewish or non-Jewish fam, or whether we're feeling tied down or living life wild and free. We all get to sip on that same spiritual vibe. (Greeks in the house, y'all!)"
1 Corinthians,12,14,"Dude, listen up! The human body isn't just one body part, it's made up of a bunch of them."
1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot is like, 'I'm not the hand, so I'm not even part of this crew,' does that mean it's not part of the squad?"
1 Corinthians,12,16,"And if the ear is like, yo, I'm not the eye, so I don't belong here as part of the body, does that mean it ain't part of the body?"
1 Corinthians,12,17,"Bruh, imagine if the whole body was just one big eye, like, how would you even hear anything? And if the whole body was just for hearing, then like, where would the sense of smell even come from?"
1 Corinthians,12,18,"But yo, God straight up positioned each one of us in the body, exactly how he wanted to, no cap."
1 Corinthians,12,19,"Like, if everyone was, like, just one part, where would the whole body be?"
1 Corinthians,12,20,"But hear me out, fam, we may be diverse in our talents and interests, but we're all part of the same squad, ya know?"
1 Corinthians,12,21,"The eye can't be all like to the hand, yo, I don't need you, and the head can't be all like to the feet, yo, I don't need y'all."
1 Corinthians,12,22,"Actually, those body parts that might seem weak are super important, like, way more than you realize:"
1 Corinthians,12,23,"And for those parts of the body that we consider less important, we give them even more importance and enhance their beauty. The parts that we might think are not so attractive actually become even more attractive."
1 Corinthians,12,24,"Our attractive body parts are not important; instead, God has brought our bodies together, giving greater honor to the part that was lacking."
1 Corinthians,12,25,"We should all be on the same wave, no division allowed in the squad. Everyone needs to look out for each other and show mad love and support. No room for drama, just unity fam. üôå"
1 Corinthians,12,26,"If one of us goes through pain, we all feel it too; but if one of us gets recognized, we all celebrate together."
1 Corinthians,12,27,"So, like, all of you are basically the body of Christ, each with your own unique parts and functions."
1 Corinthians,12,28,"And God has assigned different roles in the church: first, there are the cool apostles; then, we got the awesome prophets; next up, we got the wise teachers. And of course, we can't forget about the amazing miracles and the awesome gift of healing. We also got the supportive helpers and the organized leaders. Plus, there's a whole bunch of diverse languages going on too."
1 Corinthians,12,29,"Bruh, like, not everyone can be an apostle, a prophet, a teacher, or do miracles, ya know? Like, it's not everyone's thing, or like, superpower or something?"
1 Corinthians,12,30,"So, like, can everyone heal, speak in tongues, and interpret, ya know?"
1 Corinthians,12,31,"But, like, really desire the sickest talents, and yo, let me put you on to an even better path."
1 Corinthians,13,1,"Even if I can speak like a master of communication, both in human languages and in heavenly languages, but I don't have genuine love and kindness, it's like I'm just making noise, like an annoying horn or a clanging cymbal."
1 Corinthians,13,2,"Even if I can predict the future like a pro, unravel all the secrets of the universe, and know everything there is to know, and even if my faith can move literal mountains, without love, I'm basically a big zero."
1 Corinthians,13,3,"Even if I give away all my stuff to take care of the less fortunate, and even if I sacrifice myself for a cause, but I don't have love, it's all pointless."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Love is patient and kind; Love doesn't get jealous; Love doesn't show off and isn't full of itself, doesn't act without thinking"
1 Corinthians,13,5,"Doesn't act in a cringey way, doesn't only look out for herself, doesn't get riled up easily, doesn't have negative thoughts;"
1 Corinthians,13,6,"Don't get hype over doing bad stuff, but get hype over being real and true; {with the real and true: or, being real and true}"
1 Corinthians,13,7,"We must be able to handle everything, trust everything, have hope in everything, and persevere through everything."
1 Corinthians,13,8,Being kind always comes through: but predictions will fall short; speaking different languages will come to an end; understanding everything will fade away.
1 Corinthians,13,9,"Like, we only know like, part of the whole picture, you know? And when we predict stuff, it's only like, a piece of the puzzle."
1 Corinthians,13,10,"But once the perfect thing arrives, the imperfect will vanish."
1 Corinthians,13,11,"Back when I was a kid, I talked like a kid, I thought like a kid, and I acted like a kid. But now that I'm all grown up, I've left behind all those immature things. (Or you could say, I've started thinking more logically, rather than just going with my gut feeling). (Put away: Like, completely disappeared)"
1 Corinthians,13,12,"Right now everything seems kinda confusing and unclear, like looking through a smudged-up phone screen. But one day, we'll have a super clear and direct connection - no more guessing or uncertainty. Right now, I only understand a fraction of what's going on, but in the future, I'll get the full picture, just as I'm fully understood myself. {darkly: Gr. in a riddle}"
1 Corinthians,13,13,"So, like, the real deal is that faith, hope, and being kind to others are what really matters, you know? But out of these three, being kind to others totally takes the cake."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Make love your main pursuit and aspire to grow spiritually. But most importantly, focus on developing your ability to foresee and speak truth."
1 Corinthians,14,2,"When someone speaks in a language that others can't understand, they aren't speaking to people but to God. No one can understand them, but in the spirit, they are speaking mysteries."
1 Corinthians,14,3,"But the one who prophesies is all about lifting others up, giving advice, and bringing comfort."
1 Corinthians,14,4,"If you like, speaking in a language no one understands boosts your own growth, but if you're into foretelling the future, you're boosting the whole crew."
1 Corinthians,14,5,"I think it would be cool if all of you could speak in different languages, but it's even better if you can predict the future and stuff. Because the person who predicts the future is considered more important than the one who just speaks different languages, unless they can explain what they're saying so that everyone can learn and grow from it."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"Hey fam, listen up! If I pull up and start speaking in tongues, what's the point if it doesn't bring any benefit? The real deal is when I speak to you with some deep insights, knowledge, prophetic words, or straight-up teachings."
1 Corinthians,14,7,"Yo, even inanimate objects like pipes or harps gotta make distinct sounds, otherwise how are we supposed to tell the difference between a pipe and a harp?"
1 Corinthians,14,8,"Like, dude, if the trumpet makes a vague noise, who's gonna get ready for the battle, ya know?"
1 Corinthians,14,9,"So, like, if you don't speak in words that everyone can understand, how are they supposed to know what you're saying? It's like you're just talking to yourself, dude."
1 Corinthians,14,10,"So, like, there's a whole bunch of different voices out there in the world, and each one of them has, like, a meaning and stuff."
1 Corinthians,14,11,"So, like, if I don't get what someone is saying, I'll be like a total outsider to them, and they'll be a total outsider to me when they speak."
1 Corinthians,14,12,"Like, if you're all about that spiritual power, then go all out to build up the church. #1 priority, you know? #spiritualgoals #churchfamily"
1 Corinthians,14,13,"So, if someone starts speaking in a language that no one can understand, they should pray for the ability to interpret it."
1 Corinthians,14,14,"So like, if I pray in an, like, unknown language, it's more like my spirit is praying, but I don't actually understand what I'm saying, you know? Like, it doesn't really produce any understanding or results."
1 Corinthians,14,15,"So like, here's the deal. When I pray, I do it with my heart and my mind, ya know? And when I sing, I do it with the same vibe. Gotta have both spirit and understanding in the mix, man."
1 Corinthians,14,16,"And like, when you're blessing with the Spirit, how can the uneducated person fully vibe with what you're saying? They don't understand your gratitude, so how can they say 'Amen'?"
1 Corinthians,14,17,"You're legit good at giving thanks, but it's not helping anyone else grow."
1 Corinthians,14,18,"Man, I gotta give props to my God, I'm out here talkin' in tongues more than all y'all!"
1 Corinthians,14,19,"But when I'm in the church, I'd rather drop some knowledge with just a few words, using my own brain to teach others, than blabber on for ages in some language nobody understands."
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Yo, fam, don't stay ignorant like little kids, but when it comes to being malicious, stay pure like innocent children. However, when it's about engaging your intellect, level up and be mature AF. {men: Gr. perfect, or, of a ripe age}"
1 Corinthians,14,21,"Yo guys, check it out. The ancient laws say that I'm gonna use people who speak different languages to reach out to these peeps. But even with all that, they still ain't gonna listen to me, says the Lord."
1 Corinthians,14,22,"Yo, listen up! So, speaking in tongues is like a signal, not for the believers, but for those who ain't believers yet. But, when it comes to prophesying, it's not really for those who don't believe, it's for those who already believe."
1 Corinthians,14,23,"So, like, if the entire church gathers in one spot and everyone starts speaking in different languages, and then a bunch of unfamiliar people or non-believers show up, won't they think you're all crazy or something?"
1 Corinthians,14,24,"But yo, if everyone starts prophesying and there's someone who doesn't believe or is like totally clueless, they'll be convinced and judged by everyone around them, no doubt:"
1 Corinthians,14,25,And that's how his true feelings are revealed; so he'll totally respect God and let everyone know that God is totally real in you.
1 Corinthians,14,26,"So, fam, what's the deal? When y'all gather, each of you got a sick flow, some deep knowledge, a lit language, a mind-blowing insight, and a way to break it down. Let's make sure everything we do is all about building each other up."
1 Corinthians,14,27,"If anyone speaks in a language that others don't understand, only let two or at the most three people do it, and take turns. And make sure there's someone there to interpret for everyone else. (Two or three people speaking separately is cool too!)"
1 Corinthians,14,28,"But if no one can understand, just chill and stay quiet in the church. Talk to yourself and talk to God."
1 Corinthians,14,29,"Yo, like give the prophets a chance to spit some bars, maybe two or three of 'em, then let the others decide if they're legit or not."
1 Corinthians,14,30,"If someone else sitting nearby gets the tea, the first person should stay silent."
1 Corinthians,14,31,"Yo fam, all of you can drop some knowledge one at a time, so that everyone can learn and be uplifted."
1 Corinthians,14,32,"And like, the vibes of the prophets totally align with their own selves, ya know?"
1 Corinthians,14,33,"God isn't all about that chaos, but rather chill vibes, like in all the saints' hangouts. (chaos: Gr. tumult, or, unquietness)"
1 Corinthians,14,34,"Hey fam, when it comes to church gatherings, it's important for the ladies to keep it lowkey and not speak up. The vibe is all about being obedient, just like the law says."
1 Corinthians,14,35,"If anyone needs to know something, they can ask their partners at home. It's not cool for women to speak up in church."
1 Corinthians,14,36,"Wait, did the word of God originate from you? Or was it exclusively delivered to you?"
1 Corinthians,14,37,"If anyone believes they have the gift of being a prophet or spiritually connected, they should recognize that what I'm writing to you are the Lord's instructions."
1 Corinthians,14,38,"But, like, if anyone doesn't know, just let them stay clueless, ya know?"
1 Corinthians,14,39,"Yo, fam, you should be keen on prophesying and don't be hatin' on speaking in tongues."
1 Corinthians,14,40,"Make sure everything is done in a respectful and organized way, fam."
1 Corinthians,15,1,"Hey fam, listen up! I wanna drop some truth on you. It's about the gospel I shared with you before, and I know you've embraced it and are holding strong."
1 Corinthians,15,2,"This is how you can be saved too, as long as you remember what I told you. Don't let your belief be pointless. Hold on to what I said, alright?"
1 Corinthians,15,3,"So, like, I totally passed on to you the most important thing that I got myself, you know? How Jesus died for our sins, just like the scriptures said and all."
1 Corinthians,15,4,"And like, he got buried and then, like, he totally came back to life on the third day, just as the scriptures said, you know?"
1 Corinthians,15,5,"And he like totally appeared to Cephas, and then to the squad of twelve peeps:"
1 Corinthians,15,6,"Then, like, there were, like, over five hundred homies who saw him all at once; and most of them are still kicking it to this day, but some have passed on, you know."
1 Corinthians,15,7,"After that, he like totally pulled up on James, and then he flexed on all the apostles."
1 Corinthians,15,8,"And finally, he appeared to me too, like a surprise baby born before the expected time."
1 Corinthians,15,9,"Honestly, I'm like the smallest, least qualified apostle around, not even worthy of being called one, 'cause I totally used to go after the church of God."
1 Corinthians,15,10,"But thanks to God's grace, I am who I am, and that grace He gave me wasn't for nothing. I hustled harder than anyone else, but it wasn't just me ‚Äì it was God's grace working through me."
1 Corinthians,15,11,"So, like, whether it was me or them, that's how we spread the message, and that's how you all believed it, too."
1 Corinthians,15,12,"So, if peeps are spreading the word that Christ actually came back to life, then why are there some of y'all saying there's no such thing as life after death?"
1 Corinthians,15,13,"But hey, if there's no comeback for the departed peeps, then it's like Christ never even made a comeback:"
1 Corinthians,15,14,"And, like, if Christ didn't rise up, then our whole preaching is pointless, and, like, your faith is pointless too."
1 Corinthians,15,15,"So like, we totally lied about God, saying that He raised Christ from the dead. But if the dead don't actually rise, then we made that up too, fam."
1 Corinthians,15,16,"If dead people don't come back to life, then Jesus didn't come back to life either:"
1 Corinthians,15,17,"And if Jesus hasn't come back to life, then your faith is pointless; you're still stuck in your wrongdoings."
1 Corinthians,15,18,And those who have passed away believing in Christ have departed.
1 Corinthians,15,19,"If our hope in Christ is only for this life, then we're like, totally the most miserable people ever."
1 Corinthians,15,20,"But yo, Christ be like risen from the dead, and He's like the OG amongst all those who were sleeping."
1 Corinthians,15,21,"Like, death entered the scene because of a human, but yo, the dude Jesus brought the whole resurrection vibes back with his human self."
1 Corinthians,15,22,"Just like how we all eventually die because of Adam, we'll all be revived and given life through Christ."
1 Corinthians,15,23,"But everyone will have their turn: Christ goes first, the pioneer of new life; after that, those who belong to Him will follow when He comes."
1 Corinthians,15,24,"And that's when it's game over, God will hand over the kingdom to His OG, the Father. He'll totally shut down all forms of control, authority, and power."
1 Corinthians,15,25,"Yo, he's gotta keep ruling until he totally owns all his haters."
1 Corinthians,15,26,"Death's going down as the final enemy! üíÄ Crushed and obliterated, no doubt!"
1 Corinthians,15,27,"Because, like, he totally has full control over everything. But when he's like, 'Yeah, everything is under me,' it's obvious that it doesn't include the one who actually put everything under him."
1 Corinthians,15,28,"And when everything is under his control, the Son himself will also submit to the one who subjected everything to him, so that God may be everything to everyone."
1 Corinthians,15,29,"But like, if there's no resurrection of the dead, then what's the point of getting baptized on behalf of the dead, right? Like, why would they even bother doing that?"
1 Corinthians,15,30,And why are we risking it all every single hour?
1 Corinthians,15,31,"Honestly, guys, I gotta speak up about how stoked I am in Christ Jesus, our main dude. Like, I legit embrace a new life every single day. (Some peeps say 'your,' but I mean 'our' - it's a vibe.)"
1 Corinthians,15,32,"Yo, if I battled some crazy beasts in Ephesus just like any mortal would, what's the point if there's no resurrection? Let's just enjoy life, feast and party; 'cause tomorrow we might bite the dust anyways. {after...: or, to speak after the manner of men}"
1 Corinthians,15,33,"Don't be tricked, hanging out with negative people can ruin your vibe."
1 Corinthians,15,34,"Yo, wake up and start living righteously, and don't mess up; 'cause there are some peeps out there who don't even know about God, and that's kinda embarrassing, tbh."
1 Corinthians,15,35,"Yo, like, some peeps might be like, yo, how do the dead homies come back to life, and what kinda body they be rockin' tho?"
1 Corinthians,15,36,"Yo, dude, like, what you plant won't grow unless it's totally dead, y'know?"
1 Corinthians,15,37,"And whatever you plant, you're not planting the body that it's gonna turn into, just a plain seed, which could be wheat or something else."
1 Corinthians,15,38,"But, like, God gives it, like, a body as He, like, wants to, and every seed, you know, has its own body."
1 Corinthians,15,39,"Like, not all living beings are made the same, you know? There's this one type of flesh for humans, another for animals, another for fish, and yeah, even birds have their own kind of flesh!"
1 Corinthians,15,40,"Yo, there are like different types of bodies out there - some celestial and some, like, terrestrial. But here's the thing - the celestial bodies have their own unique glory, while the terrestrial bodies, they got another kinda glory going on. So, it's like two different vibes, you know?"
1 Corinthians,15,41,"Okay, so here's the deal: the sun's got its own kind of glory, the moon's got its own kind of glory, and even the stars have their own kind of glory. Like, every single star has its own unique level of awesomeness."
1 Corinthians,15,42,"The resurrection of the dead is totally lit, fam. It starts off all messed up and corrupted, but when it gets raised up, it's completely pure and untouchable, ya feel me?"
1 Corinthians,15,43,"Yo, listen up. When this thing is first dropped, it might not be looking too hot, ya know? It starts off kinda weak and with no honor. But hold up! When it's raised back up, it's on a whole 'nother level of glory and power! Like, it goes from zero to hero real quick."
1 Corinthians,15,44,"Like, when it's buried in the ground, it's all regular, right? But when it's brought back to life, it's all spiritual. So, there's like a regular body and then a spiritual body, you know?"
1 Corinthians,15,45,"And just like it was written, the first guy Adam became a living soul; the final Adam became a spirit that brings life."
1 Corinthians,15,46,"Like, dude, the spiritual stuff didn't come first, ya know? It was the natural stuff that came before, and then later came the spiritual stuff."
1 Corinthians,15,47,"The OG human is all about that earthly vibe, while the second dude is straight up the Lord coming straight outta heaven."
1 Corinthians,15,48,"Just like how people who are down-to-earth act like, well, down-to-earth, and those who are heavenly act all heavenly and stuff."
1 Corinthians,15,49,"And like, since we've been all about this earthly vibe and stuff, in the future we'll totally be rocking that heavenly aesthetic too."
1 Corinthians,15,50,"Yo fam, listen up, flesh and blood ain't gettin' into God's kingdom, you feel me? Like, corruption can't inherit incorruption, straight facts."
1 Corinthians,15,51,"Listen up, fam! I'm about to drop a mind-blowing truth bomb on you: Not everyone gonna sleep forever, but all of us gonna go through some major transformation, you feel me?"
1 Corinthians,15,52,"In, like, no time at all, super fast, when the ultimate signal goes off: 'cause the trumpet will sound, and those who passed away will be brought back perfect, and we'll undergo a total makeover."
1 Corinthians,15,53,"Like, this perishable thing has to embrace being indestructible, and this human thing has to embrace being immortal."
1 Corinthians,15,54,"And like, once our messed up, temporary selves are transformed into these like, perfect, eternal beings. That's when this old saying will totally come true, you know? It's like, Deathh got totally obliterated, dude!'"
1 Corinthians,15,55,"Yo, death, where's your sting? Yo, grave, where's your victory? Or should I say, hell?"
1 Corinthians,15,56,"Like, sin is totally what makes death sting, you know? And the law, it's like the ultimate power that sin holds."
1 Corinthians,15,57,"But yo, big shoutout to God, who totally hooks us up with the ultimate win through our main man Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,15,58,"So, fam, listen up! Stay rock-solid, never wavering, and keep grinding in the name of the Lord. You already know that all your hard work ain't for nothing when it's done for the Lord."
1 Corinthians,16,1,"Hey, fam! So, let's talk about the offering for our homies in need. Just like I told the churches in Galatia, I'm telling y'all the same thing. Let's do this, alright?"
1 Corinthians,16,2,"On the first day of the week, make sure everyone saves some money according to how much they've been blessed, so we won't have to collect funds when I arrive."
1 Corinthians,16,3,"And when I arrive, whoever you guys give the stamp of approval with your letters, I'm gonna send them to deliver your generous contribution to Jerusalem. (Generous contribution means like a dope gift, ya feel me?)"
1 Corinthians,16,4,"And if it's cool for me to go, they'll come with me."
1 Corinthians,16,5,"Yo, I'm gonna swing by Macedonia real soon, on my way to check in with you guys. Catch me passin' through Macedonia for real."
1 Corinthians,16,6,"And, like, I might chill with you for a while, like even through winter, so you can, like, help me on my journey wherever I'm headed."
1 Corinthians,16,7,"I won't be able to see you in person right now, but I hope I can hang out with you for a bit, if the Lord allows it."
1 Corinthians,16,8,But I'll stick around in Ephesus until Pentecost.
1 Corinthians,16,9,"Yo, listen up! A mega opportunity has come my way, and it's gonna be lit! But, gotta keep it real, there's gonna be haters and obstacles in the mix."
1 Corinthians,16,10,"If Timotheus shows up, make sure he can hang out with you with no stress- he's doing God's work, just like me!"
1 Corinthians,16,11,"So, like don't diss the dude, but send him off peacefully so he can come chill with me, 'cause I'm waiting for him with the squad."
1 Corinthians,16,12,"About our friend Apollos, I really wanted him to come visit you along with the gang. But it seems like he's got other plans for now and can't make it. Don't worry though, he'll drop by when it's more convenient for him."
1 Corinthians,16,13,"Yo, stay woke, stay faithful, be strong and stand firm like bosses."
1 Corinthians,16,14,"Yo, make sure everything you do is full of love."
1 Corinthians,16,15,"Yo fam, listen up! So, I'm just gonna ask ya, my bros and sis, you totally know that fam, Stephanas? They're like the OG believers in Achaia, and they're totally obsessed with serving the saints, like 24/7!"
1 Corinthians,16,16,"So, like, you gotta respect and listen to those who support us and work alongside us, ya know?"
1 Corinthians,16,17,"I'm stoked about Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus showing up, because they totally made up for what you were missing."
1 Corinthians,16,18,"They've totally lifted up my mood and yours too, so show some love to those who are awesome like that."
1 Corinthians,16,19,"Yo, the churches in Asia send their greetings to you. Aquila and Priscilla send you a big shoutout in the Lord, along with their home church fam."
1 Corinthians,16,20,"Hey fam, the whole squad says what's up. Show some love to each other with a wholesome kiss, y'all."
1 Corinthians,16,21,"Hey, it's Paul here, giving you a shoutout with my own hands."
1 Corinthians,16,22,"If anyone doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ, consider them totally out of sync, man."
1 Corinthians,16,23,May the vibes of our homie Jesus Christ be with you.
1 Corinthians,16,24,"Sending love to all y'all in Jesus Christ. Amen. The first letter to the Corinthians was written from Philippi by Stephanas, Fortunatus, Achaicus, and Timotheus."
2 Corinthians,1,1,"Yo, it's Paul! I'm an apostle of Jesus Christ because that's straight up what God wanted. And shoutout to my bro Timothy. This message is for all the homies in the church of God in Corinth and all the real ones in Achaia."
2 Corinthians,1,2,"Yo, may grace and peace be all up in your life, straight from God our Father and my homie, the Lord Jesus Christ. Keep it chill."
2 Corinthians,1,3,"God is lit, yo! He's like the ultimate dad to Jesus and the real OG of mercy and comfort, fam."
2 Corinthians,1,4,"God's got our back when life gets tough, so we can be there for others when they go through hardships, using the same comfort we've received from God."
2 Corinthians,1,5,"Just like how Christ went through a ton of suffering, we also get a whole lot of comfort from Him."
2 Corinthians,1,6,"And whether we go through tough times, it's for your comfort and salvation, which becomes powerful when we endure the same sufferings that we also go through. Or whether we find comfort, it's for your comfort and salvation."
2 Corinthians,1,7,"And we believe in you, knowing that just as you share in the difficult times, you will also experience comfort."
2 Corinthians,1,8,"Yo, fam, just wanna keep you in the loop and not leave you clueless about the tough situation we went through in Asia. It was seriously overwhelming, like way beyond what we could handle. We were so drained and discouraged that we thought we might not even make it out alive."
2 Corinthians,1,9,"But like, we were basically resigned to death, recognizing that we can't rely on ourselves but rather on God, the one who brings the dead back to life. Like, seriously, that's the real deal. {or, answer}"
2 Corinthians,1,10,"Dude, this guy totally saved us from, like, a huge death scare, and he keeps on saving us. We have mad trust that he's gonna continue coming through for us, man."
2 Corinthians,1,11,"Yo, also joining forces with prayers for us, so that the gift given to us by many people, gets much love and appreciation from everyone on our behalf."
2 Corinthians,1,12,"The reason we're stoked is because we have a clear conscience and sincerely try to live simply and godly. We're not relying on our own wisdom or thinking we're hot stuff, but on the grace of God. Our actions and how we live when interacting with the world and especially towards you, speak louder than words."
2 Corinthians,1,13,"So, basically, we're just writing to you and we're not throwing any new stuff your way. We're only talking about what you've already read and understood. And I'm confident that you'll keep on understanding it until the very end."
2 Corinthians,1,14,"Just like you guys have shown your support for us, acknowledging that we bring you joy, we feel the same way about you when the Lord Jesus comes."
2 Corinthians,1,15,"So, I was really planning to come to you earlier with full confidence, so that you could experience another wonderful thing."
2 Corinthians,1,16,"And like, I'm planning to swing by Macedonia on my way and then head back to you, and you guys can totally help me out and see me off on my journey to Judaea."
2 Corinthians,1,17,"So, when I thought about it this way, did I act lightly? Or when I make plans, do I base them on my own desires, saying both yes and no?"
2 Corinthians,1,18,"But like, for real, God is legit, so when we speak to you, we ain't flip-flopping or anything. Word."
2 Corinthians,1,19,"Yo, let's talk about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. He was totally preached to you by me, Silvanus, and Timotheus. And let me tell you, he wasn't wishy-washy or indecisive. Nah, in him, it was always a solid YES!"
2 Corinthians,1,20,"Like, all of God's promises in Jesus are totally legit and lit, and in Him it's like, 'Yes!' and 'Amen!' to bring glory to God through us, fam."
2 Corinthians,1,21,"Yo, the one who sets us up with you in Christ and blesses us, is none other than God."
2 Corinthians,1,22,God has also secured us and given us the real deal of the Spirit deep down in our hearts.
2 Corinthians,1,23,"Also, just so you know, I swear to God that I haven't come to Corinth yet because I didn't want to make things harder for you."
2 Corinthians,1,24,"We don't control your belief, but we're here to boost your happiness: 'cause when you've got faith, you're unstoppable."
2 Corinthians,2,1,"But, like, for real, I made up my mind that I'm not gonna bring any downer vibes when I come back to you."
2 Corinthians,2,2,"If I make you feel down, then who's the one that brings me happiness, except for the one who is also feeling down because of me?"
2 Corinthians,2,3,"And I texted you this, just in case when I showed up, I'd be bummed out by those I should've been stoked about; but I totally trust that you guys got this and my happiness totally vibes with all of you."
2 Corinthians,2,4,"I was going through a ton of hard times and my heart was hurting so bad when I wrote to you, with tears streaming down my face. It wasn't because I wanted to make you sad, but because I wanted you to understand just how much love I have for you, and it's overflowing."
2 Corinthians,2,5,"But, like, if anyone has caused grief, it's not like they've totally devastated me or anything, just a lil bit, ya know? So I won't go all heavy on you guys."
2 Corinthians,2,6,"For a guy like that, this punishment is totally enough. So many people saw it go down. (And by punishment, I mean like, a big criticism session.)"
2 Corinthians,2,7,"Instead, you should totally forgive him and show support, because you don't want him to be totally overwhelmed with sadness."
2 Corinthians,2,8,"So, like, I'm just askin' y'all to really show your love for him, ya know?"
2 Corinthians,2,9,"I wrote this to find out if you're really on point and obedient with everything. Just testing the waters, fam."
2 Corinthians,2,10,"If you forgive someone, I forgive them too, because when I forgive someone, I do it for your benefit in the name of Christ; or, in a sense, as if Christ himself were forgiving them."
2 Corinthians,2,11,"So that Satan doesn't outsmart us, because we know exactly how he operates."
2 Corinthians,2,12,"So, like, when I arrived in Troas to spread the word about Christ and His good news, God totally hooked me up with an opportunity, you know?"
2 Corinthians,2,13,"My spirit was so restless, 'cause I couldn't find my homie Titus. But after saying my goodbyes, I bounced and headed to Macedonia."
2 Corinthians,2,14,"Yo, shoutout to God for always making us win in Christ and spreading his knowledge through us everywhere we go!"
2 Corinthians,2,15,"Because when it comes to God, we're like that awesome vibe of Christ, both for those who are saved and those who don't make it:"
2 Corinthians,2,16,"For some people, we might be like a vibe of death leading to more death, while for others, we might be like a vibe of life leading to more life. Like, who even has the skills to handle these situations, you know?"
2 Corinthians,2,17,"Yo, not gonna lie, there ain't mad peeps like us, who be twisting up God's word and all that. Nah, we keep it real, striving to honor God and speak with pure intentions, knowing that He's watching, all in Christ's name. Respect."
2 Corinthians,3,1,"Do we have to start flexing on ourselves again? Or do we, like some people, need to show off with commendation posts or get shoutouts from you?"
2 Corinthians,3,2,"You guys are like our social media posts that speak from our souls, seen and followed by everyone out there in the online realm:"
2 Corinthians,3,3,"So, like, it's super obvious that you guys are like, the real deal when it comes to representing Christ. We're not talking about some ink on paper situation here, but rather the Spirit of the living God writing His message on your hearts, like, for real. No stone tablets here, we're talking about hearts of flesh, ya know?"
2 Corinthians,3,4,And we have this kind of trust in Christ towards God:
2 Corinthians,3,5,"It's not like we can totally handle everything on our own and just come up with awesome ideas by ourselves, you know? We rely on God for all our strength and abilities, dude."
2 Corinthians,3,6,"God has made us capable influencers of the new covenant; not just focused on rules and procedures, but driven by our inner passion: rules alone can crush, but our passion brings true life. {brings true life: or, gives new life}"
2 Corinthians,3,7,"But like, if the whole death thing, written and carved on stones, was lit AF, to the point where the peeps of Israel couldn't even handle looking at Moses' face cuz it was so on fire; that glory was gonna fade away, ya know?"
2 Corinthians,3,8,"Like, isn't the work of the Spirit totally gonna be amazing instead?"
2 Corinthians,3,9,"Because, like, if being all judgy and condemning is kinda impressive, then the whole, like, being all about doing the right thing is, like, way more impressive, you know? It's like, the glory level is on a whole new level."
2 Corinthians,3,10,"Bro, even the most fire thing ain't got no chance against this next level glory, y'know? It's like, so gloriously lit that everything else just fades into the background."
2 Corinthians,3,11,"Dude, if the old stuff was cool, the new stuff is even cooler."
2 Corinthians,3,12,"Since we have such hope, we're gonna speak straight up and say it like it is: {or maybe, like super boldly}"
2 Corinthians,3,13,"And not like Moses, who covered his face with a veil, so the Israelites couldn't fully see the ultimate outcome of what was no longer in effect:"
2 Corinthians,3,14,"But they couldn't understand: even until now, there's still a barrier that prevents them from fully grasping the meaning of the old testament; that barrier gets removed through Jesus Christ."
2 Corinthians,3,15,"But even till now, when people read about Moses, their hearts remain closed off."
2 Corinthians,3,16,"But once you start seeking the Lord, the fog will finally clear up."
2 Corinthians,3,17,"Yo, the Lord is, like, totally Spirit vibes, you know? And, like, wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, there's, like, ultimate freedom and stuff."
2 Corinthians,3,18,"But yo, we all, with a clear view like checking ourselves out in a mirror, peep the stunning greatness of the Lord. And guess what? We're transformed into that same dope image, leveling up and shining brighter, just like how the Spirit of the Lord does it. Mind-blowing, right?"
2 Corinthians,4,1,"So, like, since we have this amazing ministry, and we've been shown so much mercy, we're not giving up or losing hope, ya know?"
2 Corinthians,4,2,"But we've totally given up on being fake and sneaky, not trying to manipulate or twist God's word; instead, we're all about showing the truth and proving ourselves to everyone's conscience in God's eyes."
2 Corinthians,4,3,"But if our gospel is unknown, it's unknown to those who are lost:"
2 Corinthians,4,4,"The dude who runs this world has totally messed with the minds of those who don't believe, so they can't see the awesome truth of Jesus, who is like God in human form."
2 Corinthians,4,5,"We're not out here advertising ourselves, but we're all about Christ Jesus the Boss; we're just your crew serving you because of Jesus, you know?"
2 Corinthians,4,6,"Yo, like God, who straight up said 'Let there be light' back in the day, has like totally shined in our hearts to give us the insight into how incredible and glorious God is through Jesus Christ. Like, it's so legit, man. (hath means He who hath, by the way)"
2 Corinthians,4,7,"But like, we have this awesome treasure, right, but it's all in these basic vessels, you know? So that the sick power it's got comes straight from God, not from us messing it up."
2 Corinthians,4,8,"{We're} going through a lot, but we're not totally overwhelmed; {we're} confused, but not hopeless; {without hope: or, completely without help, or, resources}"
2 Corinthians,4,9,"Getting haters, but still got the squad; going through tough times, but we ain't gonna break;"
2 Corinthians,4,10,"Carrying with us the sacrifice of Jesus in our bodies, so that the power and presence of Jesus can be seen in our lives."
2 Corinthians,4,11,"Because we, who are alive, constantly face death for the sake of Jesus, so that Jesus' life can be revealed in our imperfect human bodies."
2 Corinthians,4,12,"So like, death's doing its thing to us, but there's this whole vibe of life going on with you."
2 Corinthians,4,13,"We totally vibe with the same spirit of faith, like it's written, I believed, so I went ahead and spoke up about it; and now, we're all about that belief life and speaking our truth too;"
2 Corinthians,4,14,Knowing that the person who brought back the Lord Jesus will also bring us back through Jesus and will present us together with you.
2 Corinthians,4,15,"Everything happens for you, so that God's amazing grace can be seen through the thankfulness of many, giving glory to God."
2 Corinthians,4,16,"So we don't give up, even though our physical selves may deteriorate, our inner selves are being renewed every day."
2 Corinthians,4,17,"The stuff we go through may feel difficult now, but it's just temporary. It's actually helping us gain a super amazing and everlasting kind of glory."
2 Corinthians,4,18,"Instead of focusing on what we can physically see, let's shift our attention to what's beyond our sight. You see, the things we see with our eyes are only temporary, but the things we can't see have everlasting impact."
2 Corinthians,5,1,"Cuz we know that if our temporary body here on earth gets wrecked, we've got a heavenly crib straight from God, a permanent pad that's out of this world."
2 Corinthians,5,2,"Because, like, we're totally over this world and we just can't wait to level up, rocking our heavenly crib, you know?"
2 Corinthians,5,3,"Like, if we're all dressed up, we won't end up looking bare, you know?"
2 Corinthians,5,4,"Because those of us who are in this temporary existence feel a sense of unease and heaviness within us. Not because we want to be without bodies, but because we long for something greater to cover us, so that our mortal nature can be completely transformed by the fullness of life."
2 Corinthians,5,5,"So, like God is the one who made us for this exact purpose, and he's also given us a taste of the Spirit."
2 Corinthians,5,6,"That's why we always stay confident, you know? Like, we're just chilling in our bodies, but that means we're not with the Lord, you feel me?"
2 Corinthians,5,7,"Because we believe in what's real, not just what we see:"
2 Corinthians,5,8,"We're totally sure, like, seriously, that it's way better to be away from our physical bods and be chillin' with the Lord, ya know?"
2 Corinthians,5,9,"That's why we work hard, whether we're here or not, to be recognized by him. #WorkEthic"
2 Corinthians,5,10,"Yo, we all gotta show up before Christ's big judgment seat, ya know? Everyone's gonna be held accountable for everything they did in their bodies, whether it's good or bad, fam."
2 Corinthians,5,11,"Yo, fam, recognizing the awesomeness of the Lord, we try to convince people to follow Him. And guess what, not only does God see through us, but I bet our message is also hitting you deep in your soul."
2 Corinthians,5,12,"We're not trying to show off to you again, but we want to give you something to be proud of on our behalf. This will help you clap back at those who are all talk and no action, pretending to be something they're not. (Note: 'in appearance' means they just put on a front.)"
2 Corinthians,5,13,"Whether we're acting a little crazy or keeping it together, we're doing it all for God or for your benefit."
2 Corinthians,5,14,"Our love for Christ guides us and helps us make this judgment: if Christ died for everyone, then everyone was dead."
2 Corinthians,5,15,"And, like, he totally sacrificed himself for everyone, so that those who are alive can stop being self-centered and start living for him, the one who died for them and even came back to life."
2 Corinthians,5,16,"So like, from now on, we don't judge people based on surface-level stuff, ya know? Even though we used to see Christ in a human way, now we've like leveled up and we see Him differently, man."
2 Corinthians,5,17,"So, like, if anyone is, like, totally in Christ, they become a whole new person. All the old stuff is gone, like, poof! Check it out, everything becomes, like, brand new. Like, seriously!"
2 Corinthians,5,18,"So, like, everything comes from God, who totally brought us back together with him through Jesus Christ and also gave us the super important job of bringing others back too;"
2 Corinthians,5,19,"Basically, God was in Christ, making things right between Himself and the world, not keeping track of their wrongdoings. And He gave us the responsibility of spreading the message of forgiveness."
2 Corinthians,5,20,"Listen up, fam! We're like representatives for Christ, relaying God's message to you. On behalf of Christ, we're urging you to make peace with God."
2 Corinthians,5,21,"Because he's taken on our sins, even though he never sinned himself, we get to be pure and righteous through God thanks to him."
2 Corinthians,6,1,"So, like, we're all on the same team, right? And we really hope that you don't just waste the awesome grace that God has given you, dude."
2 Corinthians,6,2,"He's like, 'Yo, I totally heard you when you needed me most, and I totally came through for you, like a boss. Guess what? Right now is the perfect time to make things right and embrace salvation. Don't sleep on it, dude, because this is your moment.'"
2 Corinthians,6,3,"Making sure to not cause any drama, so that people don't start hating on the ministry:"
2 Corinthians,6,4,"But in every situation, we show ourselves as true servants of God. We exercise great patience, endure through hardships, face unavoidable challenges, and persevere through difficult times. (approving: meaning, to commend)"
2 Corinthians,6,5,"Going through beatings, getting locked up, dealing with chaos and drama, working hard, pulling all-nighters, and going on hunger strikes; (or, going through constant ups and downs)"
2 Corinthians,6,6,"Through being genuine, being knowledgeable, being patient, being kind, being guided by the Holy Spirit, and through showing genuine love."
2 Corinthians,6,7,"With the legit truth, straight up God's power, and the ultimate flex of being righteous on both sides,"
2 Corinthians,6,8,"Through both respect and disrespect, through both negative and positive reputation: seen as tricksters, but still authentic;"
2 Corinthians,6,9,"We may be unknown to many, but well known to those who matter; we may experience setbacks and challenges, but we rise above and keep going strong; we face discipline and tough times, but we never lose our spirit."
2 Corinthians,6,10,"Even when I feel sad, I stay positive and joyful. Though I may not have much money, I bring abundance to others. I may appear to have nothing, but in reality, I have everything that truly matters."
2 Corinthians,6,11,"Yo, fam, listen up, Corinthians! We're keepin' it real and speakin' our minds, showin' ya that our love for ya is expansive."
2 Corinthians,6,12,"You're not restricted by us, but you're restricted by your own emotions."
2 Corinthians,6,13,"Alright, let's talk about repayment, my fam, y'all gotta expand your horizons too."
2 Corinthians,6,14,"Don't be in a relationship with someone who doesn't share your beliefs, like, seriously. What do people who do the right thing have in common with those who don't? And like, what kind of connection can light have with darkness? Just saying."
2 Corinthians,6,15,"Like, how can Christ and Belial even be on the same wavelength? And what's the deal with believers and infidels? They're like, from two totally different realms, man."
2 Corinthians,6,16,"Like, seriously, why would the temple of God even have anything in common with idols? You guys, like, are the temple of the living God, alright? God Himself said that He'll like, totally reside in you and walk with you. He's gonna be your God and you're gonna be His people, no doubt about it!"
2 Corinthians,6,17,"So, like, listen up. God's calling you to step away from that crowd and be your own person. Keep your distance from all the negative vibes and don't get involved in anything shady. If you do that, trust me, God's got your back and will welcome you with open arms."
2 Corinthians,6,18,"And I'll be like your Dad, and you'll be my BFFs, says the Almighty, all-powerful God."
2 Corinthians,7,1,"So, like, since we have these awesome promises, fam, let's, you know, ditch all the nasty stuff in our lives, both physically and spiritually, and work on being all holy and stuff, while respecting and revering God, okay?"
2 Corinthians,7,2,"Accept us; we haven't done wrong to anyone, we didn't mess up anyone's life, we didn't scam anyone."
2 Corinthians,7,3,"I ain't sayin' this to shame ya, 'cause I've mentioned before that you're deep in our hearts, ridin' through life and death together."
2 Corinthians,7,4,"I ain't gonna front, I'm pretty confident in my words to y'all. I gotta say, I'm hella proud of y'all too. Like, it really lifts my spirit and brings me mad happiness despite all the tough times we go through."
2 Corinthians,7,5,"So, when we came to Macedonia, our bodies were exhausted and we faced troubles from all directions. There were constant battles outside and fears within us."
2 Corinthians,7,6,"But yo, God, who always comes through for those feeling down, lifted our spirits when Titus showed up."
2 Corinthians,7,7,"And it's not just his presence, but how much better he felt because of the support and encouragement you gave him. He told us about your strong longing, your sadness, and how passionately you cared about me. It made me really happy."
2 Corinthians,7,8,"So, like, even though my letter made you feel bad, I'm not sorry about it. Well, actually, I was sorry for a bit, but then I realized that the letter did make you feel bad, even if it was just for a little while."
2 Corinthians,7,9,"I'm stoked, not because you felt sorry, but because you got real and repented. The way you realized your mistakes was totally godly, and it didn't mess anything up for you."
2 Corinthians,7,10,"When you genuinely feel sorry for your wrong actions, it leads to a change of heart that brings salvation, and you won't regret it. But if you're just feeling sorry because of worldly reasons, it only brings destruction in the end."
2 Corinthians,7,11,"Yo, check this out: when you were all sad in a godly way, it straight-up made you guys focus and be super careful. It made you clean up your act, get all fired up, feel kind of angry, and even feel a little scared. You wanted it so bad, you were totally passionate about it, and you were determined to set things right! In every way, you've shown that you're legit when it comes to this stuff."
2 Corinthians,7,12,"Yo, just so you know, I didn't write to you because of the person who did wrong or the person who got wronged. It was all about showing you how much we care about you, in the eyes of God."
2 Corinthians,7,13,"So, we were like, super comforted by your comfort, like, for real. And we were beyond hyped for the joy of Titus, because you all totally refreshed his spirit, fam."
2 Corinthians,7,14,"Yo, if I've talked you up to him at all, I ain't embarrassed about it. Like, we were totally straight up with you, and turns out, our hype about you to Titus was totally legit."
2 Corinthians,7,15,"And he really, really cares about you a lot, remembering how you all listened and respected him with a mix of awe and nervousness."
2 Corinthians,7,16,"I'm stoked that I can totally count on you for everything, no doubt."
2 Corinthians,8,1,"Yo, fam, just wanted to let y'all know about the sick grace of God that He hooked up the churches in Macedonia with. It's straight fire!"
2 Corinthians,8,2,"In a tough and challenging time, despite their struggles and financial hardship, their immense joy overflowed and led to them generously giving beyond their means. {liberality: Gr. simplicity}"
2 Corinthians,8,3,"Because I gotta admit, they really impressed me with how much they were willing to go above and beyond their usual limits."
2 Corinthians,8,4,They begged us earnestly to accept the gift and join in serving the saints together.
2 Corinthians,8,5,"And they didn't do it the way we expected, but they totally dedicated themselves to the Lord first, and then to us because it's what God wanted."
2 Corinthians,8,6,"We were so hyped for Titus to come through and complete the awesome work he started in you, spreading that same positive energy around. üíØ {grace: or, gift}"
2 Corinthians,8,7,"So like, since you're totally rocking it in faith, speaking up, knowing your stuff, and putting your all into everything, including your love for us, make sure you're also excelling in this amazing grace."
2 Corinthians,8,8,"I'm not trying to be all bossy, but I'm just bringing this up because of how enthusiastic everyone else is. It's a way to show that your love is real, no joke."
2 Corinthians,8,9,"Y'all know how Jesus Christ totally flexed his epic grace, right? Even though he was loaded, he straight up chose to become broke just for y'all. And get this, he did it so that y'all could become loaded with blessings. Pretty dope, huh?"
2 Corinthians,8,10,"And here's what I suggest: it's a good idea for you, who started doing it a year ago, to not only keep going, but also to have that same eagerness to continue. (forward: Gr. willing)"
2 Corinthians,8,11,"So go ahead and do it, like you were eager to start. Show that you're ready to actually follow through with what you said you would do."
2 Corinthians,8,12,"If you're genuinely down to put in the effort, it's all good as long as you're working with what you have, not what you don't have."
2 Corinthians,8,13,Not that I want others to have it easy while you guys are burdened:
2 Corinthians,8,14,"But let's be real, the goal is to make things fair, so that your extra stuff can help out others who are struggling, and their extra stuff can help you out too. It's all about leveling the playing field and creating a sense of equality, you know?"
2 Corinthians,8,15,"Like it's written, the one who stockpiled a ton didn't end up with anything extra, while the one who gathered just a little didn't run out of anything they needed."
2 Corinthians,8,16,"But shoutout to God, who totally gave Titus mad love and passion for you, fam."
2 Corinthians,8,17,"He totally got the message and was totally down to come see you, even though he wanted to do it himself anyway."
2 Corinthians,8,18,"And we've got this brother, known for his amazing work spreading the good news in all the churches, chilling with him too."
2 Corinthians,8,19,"Not only that, but this person was also chosen by the churches to go on a trip with us, bringing along their amazing talents and abilities. They'll use these gifts to honor the same Lord and let everyone know about your willingness and enthusiasm. gracee can be translated as an awesome gift)"
2 Corinthians,8,20,"Like, let's be real and not do anything that would make people think we're shady while we're handling this generous stuff."
2 Corinthians,8,21,"Doing the right thing, not just when God's watching, but also when everyone else is watching."
2 Corinthians,8,22,"And we've got our bro tagging along, who's always shown that he's on top of his game in many ways, but now he's even more on point, all because of how much trust we have in all of you. (For real, no cap!)"
2 Corinthians,8,23,"If anyone asks about Titus, he's like my right-hand dude, always helping me out with you guys. And if you've got questions about our brothers, they're like the ultimate representatives of the churches, spreading the amazingness of Christ."
2 Corinthians,8,24,"So, like, you should totally show them, like, in front of everyone, how much you love them and how stoked we are to shout you out."
2 Corinthians,9,1,"When it comes to helping out fellow believers, there's really no need for me to write to you about it, to be honest:"
2 Corinthians,9,2,"I know how enthusiastic you all are, and I can't help but brag about you to the peeps in Macedonia, because you were totally on top of things in Achaia like a whole year ago! Your passion has totally inspired so many others, no cap."
2 Corinthians,9,3,"But I've sent the homies, just so our flexing about you doesn't turn out to be pointless; like I said, so you can be prepared:"
2 Corinthians,9,4,"In case the peeps from Macedonia roll up with me and catch you off guard, we (not to be extra or anything) would be totally embarrassed after all that flexing."
2 Corinthians,9,5,"So, like, I totally felt it was important to encourage my fam to head your way and prepare in advance the awesome gifts you've been hyped about, so that everything is all set and generous, not out of greed. üéÅ"
2 Corinthians,9,6,"Listen up, fam! Here's the deal: if you be stingy with your seeds, you'll only get a lil' harvest in return. But if you go all out and sow abundantly, you'll reap a massive harvest, no doubt!"
2 Corinthians,9,7,"Everyone should give based on their own intentions, without hesitation or obligation, because God appreciates those who give wholeheartedly and with joy."
2 Corinthians,9,8,"And God is, like, totally capable of showering you with mad grace vibes, so that you can always have everything you need to do every kind of good stuff, like, on point."
2 Corinthians,9,9,"(Like, written in the books, it's all over the place, dude; he's been hooking up the less fortunate: his goodness is never gonna fade away."
2 Corinthians,9,10,"And the one who gives seeds to plant also provides bread for your meals, and multiplies the seeds you plant, and increases the good things that come from doing what is right üòâ"
2 Corinthians,9,11,We're totally blessed with everything and can be so generous that it makes us thank God for real. #abundancelife
2 Corinthians,9,12,"Yo, serving others in this way not only meets the needs of the saints, but also brings mad gratitude to God through many blessings;"
2 Corinthians,9,13,"When they see how you live out the gospel of Christ by serving others and generously supporting them, they will give glory to God."
2 Corinthians,9,14,"And because they've been praying for you, they're really stoked about the awesome grace of God flowing through you."
2 Corinthians,9,15,"Yo, shoutout to God for that insane gift He gave us, no words can even describe it. üôåüéÅ"
2 Corinthians,10,1,"Hey guys, it's your boy Paul here, and I just wanted to remind you, in the humble and chill vibes of Christ, that even though I may seem pretty low-key when I'm with you, I'm actually not afraid to speak up when I'm not around. Just saying! {in presence: or, in outward appearance}"
2 Corinthians,10,2,"Yo, listen up! When I'm around, I don't wanna come off as all cocky and confident, you know? I mean, sure, I'm ready to stand up against those who think we're all about the superficial stuff. Don't get it twisted, though."
2 Corinthians,10,3,"Even though we're living in the physical world, our battles aren't fought on a physical level."
2 Corinthians,10,4,"Yo fam, our weapons ain't basic, they straight up powerful through God, smashing them strong holds like a boss. #Blessed"
2 Corinthians,10,5,"Rejecting negative thoughts and staying humble before God, and taking control of our minds, making them align with Christ's teachings and values."
2 Corinthians,10,6,And being ready to deal with any disobedience after you have fully obeyed.
2 Corinthians,10,7,"Are you really judging people just based on their looks? If anyone believes that they belong to Christ, they should reconsider and remember that we also belong to Christ, just like them."
2 Corinthians,10,8,"But even though I could flex a bit about the power the Lord gave us to build you up, not tear you down, I ain't gonna front or be embarrassed about it:"
2 Corinthians,10,9,So I don't come across as trying to scare you with my messages.
2 Corinthians,10,10,"They say that his letters are super powerful, but when it comes to his actual presence, they claim he's weak and his speaking skills are trash. (They say this, apparently he says something else.)"
2 Corinthians,10,11,"Like, just so you know, we're totally the same in real life as we are online. So, if someone's acting all cool and stuff in their texts, they better bring that same energy when we all hang out in person, ya know?"
2 Corinthians,10,12,"We gotta stop trying to fit in or compete with the self-proclaimed cool kids. It's not smart to measure our worth based on them, constantly comparing ourselves to their standards. Trust me, that's not a wise move."
2 Corinthians,10,13,"But we won't flex on things beyond our limit, only based on the standard that God has given us, a standard that can even reach you."
2 Corinthians,10,14,"Because we don't overdo it, acting like we're too cool for you, as if we can't even reach you. The truth is, we've made it all the way to you, spreading the awesome news about Jesus Christ just like everywhere else!"
2 Corinthians,10,15,"Not flexing about stuff we didn't even contribute to, like using other people's hard work to make ourselves look good. But feeling hopeful that as your faith grows, we'll be able to grow and flourish even more, in line with our own standards, like big time. (or, grow...: or, become more awesome through you)"
2 Corinthians,10,16,"Spreading the good news in areas that are outside your circle, and not bragging about someone else's accomplishments that have been handed to us on a silver platter. (or guideline)"
2 Corinthians,10,17,"But if someone wants to show off, let them impress us with their devotion to the Lord."
2 Corinthians,10,18,"It's not about hyping yourself up to impress others, it's about receiving recognition from the Lord."
2 Corinthians,11,1,"Yo, I wish you could just like, hang with me for a sec and tolerate my foolishness, like seriously, put up with me. Like, for real, put up with me."
2 Corinthians,11,2,"I'm super protective of you, like in a godly way: because I've committed you to one main squeeze, so that I can totally show off a pure, clean-cut version of you to Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,3,"But I'm lowkey worried, like, seriously, because, you know, the serpent totally tricked Eve with his sneaky ways. I'm just scared that your minds might get messed up and stray away from the pure and simple truth that's found in Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,4,"So, like, if someone comes and starts preaching about a totally different Jesus than the one we've been talking about, or if you start believing in a whole different kind of spiritual energy that you haven't experienced before, or if you start accepting a completely different message about the good news, like, I guess you could totally put up with them. Like, it's up to you, man. Just sayin'!"
2 Corinthians,11,5,"Because, like, I totally think I'm just as legit as those top-notch apostles, ya know?"
2 Corinthians,11,6,"Even though I may not be the smoothest talker, I've got the wisdom game on lock. Trust me, we've proven ourselves completely in every way to you."
2 Corinthians,11,7,"Did I do something wrong by humbling myself so that you could be uplifted, just because I shared the good news of God with you without expecting anything in return?"
2 Corinthians,11,8,I borrowed some supplies from other churches to be able to help you.
2 Corinthians,11,9,"When I was hanging out with you guys and low on cash, I never relied on anyone to cover my expenses. The crew from Macedonia always had my back and filled in the gaps for me. I made sure not to be a burden on any of y'all, and I plan on keeping it that way."
2 Corinthians,11,10,"Yo, fam, let me tell you, I ain't gonna let nobody shut me down when it comes to sharing the real facts about Jesus Christ, especially in Achaia. Trust, ain't nobody gonna be able to silence me, you feel me?"
2 Corinthians,11,11,"So, like, why does it seem like I don't love you? But, hey, God actually knows what's up."
2 Corinthians,11,12,"So, like, whatever I do, I'm gonna keep doing it, just to make sure those who are looking for a reason to criticize have no chance. I want them to realize that they're no better than us, no matter what they boast about."
2 Corinthians,11,13,"These people who pretend to be apostles but are actually deceivers, they're just faking it and trying to pass off as followers of Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,14,"No cap, it's no surprise; 'cause Satan be out here flexin', lookin' like an angel with them bright vibes."
2 Corinthians,11,15,"So like, it totally makes sense if his squad also starts living righteously and doing good deeds. In the end, they'll get what they deserve based on their actions."
2 Corinthians,11,16,"Yo, listen up! Don't underestimate me, okay? Even if you do, just humor me for a sec, alright? It's time for me to flex a bit."
2 Corinthians,11,17,"I gotta be real with you, what I'm about to say isn't exactly what the Big Man upstairs would say. It's more like some silly bragging, but I'm feeling pretty confident about it."
2 Corinthians,11,18,"Since so many people flex their physical appearance, I'll flex too."
2 Corinthians,11,19,"You actually vibe with ignorant peeps, 'cause y'all are wise AF."
2 Corinthians,11,20,"Because it's a real struggle when someone tries to control you, exploit you, take advantage of you, or even tries to show off and disrespect you."
2 Corinthians,11,21,"I'm just gonna keep it real, I wanna address the haters who think we're weak. But hey, I gotta admit, whoever's out here flexin' (I'm saying some dumb stuff right now), I can flex too."
2 Corinthians,11,22,"Bruh, they Hebrews? Same here. They Israelites? Yup, me too. They got that Abraham bloodline? Well, guess what? Got that in me too."
2 Corinthians,11,23,"Are they really on Team Jesus? (No offense, but I totally got this) I've got them beat; I've hustled harder, taken more hits, gotten thrown behind bars more times, and come face to face with death more often."
2 Corinthians,11,24,"Bruh, I got whipped by those Jewish peeps like 5 times, 40 lashes minus one."
2 Corinthians,11,25,"I got beat up three times with rods, got stoned once (not the fun kind), had my ship wrecked three times, and spent a whole day and night deep underwater."
2 Corinthians,11,26,"Like, I've been on so many trips, and let me tell you, it's been wild! I've faced dangerous waters, encountered sketchy robbers, dealt with trouble from my own people, and faced all kinds of chaos in the city, the wilderness, and even at sea. And to top it off, I've had to watch out for fake friends!"
2 Corinthians,11,27,"Feelin' exhausted and in major pain, stayin' up all night, being hella hungry and thirsty, goin' on mad diets, dealin' with freezing cold and bein' totally naked."
2 Corinthians,11,28,"Other than dealing with external stuff, I've got this daily concern for all the churches on my plate."
2 Corinthians,11,29,Who's feeling down? Me too. Who's getting upset? I can totally relate.
2 Corinthians,11,30,"If I gotta flex, I'mma flex about the stuff that's got me down."
2 Corinthians,11,31,"The OG God and Dad of our main man Jesus Christ, who's totally epic and blessed for all eternity, knows I'm keeping it real, no cap."
2 Corinthians,11,32,"So, like, in Damascus, the ruler dude under King Aretas had, like, this strong crew guarding the city, wanting to catch me and all:"
2 Corinthians,11,33,"So, I was basically lowered down from a window using a basket and managed to sneak away from the clutches of the person chasing me."
2 Corinthians,12,1,"Honestly, I shouldn't brag about myself. Let's talk about the amazing things God has shown me in visions and revelations."
2 Corinthians,12,2,"So, like, I once heard about this dude who was connected with Jesus, like, more than fourteen years ago or something. I have no idea if he was physically there or had some kind of out-of-body experience, man. Only God knows for sure. But this guy, he got taken all the way up to the third heaven, dude. Crazy stuff, right?"
2 Corinthians,12,3,"So I met this guy, can't really say if I saw him in person or in spirit, I don't know, only God knows what's up;"
2 Corinthians,12,4,"So, like, he totally got taken up to paradise and heard like, super indescribable words that, like, no one is allowed to even say. {lawful: or, possible}"
2 Corinthians,12,5,"I want to give props to someone like that, but when it comes to me, I won't boast except in my weaknesses."
2 Corinthians,12,6,"Even though I might want to flex, I won't act stupid; I'll keep it real and speak the truth. But right now, I'll chill so nobody thinks I'm bragging more than what they see or hear about me."
2 Corinthians,12,7,"And like, just to keep me in check and stuff, because I totally didn't want to get all high and mighty with all these amazing things I've seen and experienced, there was this annoying thing that came my way. It was like an annoying message from Satan himself, just to remind me not to get too full of myself, you know?"
2 Corinthians,12,8,"So, I like totally begged the Lord three times to make this thing go away from me, you know?"
2 Corinthians,12,9,"And he was like, yo, my grace got you covered, no worries. Like, my strength is at its highest when you feel weak, you know? So, I'm totally cool with boasting about my flaws, because that's when the power of Christ really shows up in my life."
2 Corinthians,12,10,"So, like, I actually find joy in all the hardships, the haters, the struggles, the tough times, all because of Jesus, you know? 'Cause when I'm feeling weak, that's when I'm actually strong."
2 Corinthians,12,11,"I feel like an idiot for boasting, but you made me do it. I should've received praise from you, because I'm on par with the top apostles, even though I'm nothing special."
2 Corinthians,12,12,"Seriously, the signs of a legit apostle were happening right before your eyes, showing crazy patience, performing mind-blowing miracles, and pulling off some seriously awesome feats."
2 Corinthians,12,13,"So, like, what made you guys any different from other churches? The only thing was that I didn't, like, rely on you for financial stuff. Sorry if that bothered you."
2 Corinthians,12,14,"Yo, listen up! This is gonna be my third visit to you, and don't worry, I won't be a hassle. You see, I ain't in this for what you can give me, but rather for you. 'Cause it's the parents' job to provide for their kids, not the other way around."
2 Corinthians,12,15,"And I'm totally down to go all out for you, even if it means giving everything I've got; but the more I show my love for you, the less love I seem to get in return. {for your souls: in the original Greek, it means for the sake of your souls}"
2 Corinthians,12,16,"But, like, yeah, I didn't wanna bother you or anything, but honestly, I managed to outsmart you with some clever tricks."
2 Corinthians,12,17,Did I flex on you by any of the peeps I sent your way?
2 Corinthians,12,18,I was really looking forward to seeing Titus and I sent a brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Didn't we both follow the same mindset and walk together on the same path?
2 Corinthians,12,19,"Do you really think we're just making excuses to you? We're speaking openly before God through Christ, but hey, fam, everything we do is for your growth and development."
2 Corinthians,12,20,"I'm kinda worried that when I show up, you won't be the people I hoped you'd be and I'll end up being someone you don't want me to be. Like, I don't want us to get all caught up in arguing, being jealous of each other, getting all angry and causing drama, talking badly about each other behind our backs, spreading rumors, or causing chaos."
2 Corinthians,12,21,"And like, just in case, when I pull up again, my God will totally humble me in front of all y'all, and I'll be all devastated for real by the fact that many of y'all had already messed up big time, but still haven't turned away from all the impurity, sexual immorality, and wild behavior that y'all were into."
2 Corinthians,13,1,"Bruh, this is gonna be my third visit to y'all. You know the drill - when a couple of homies vouch for something, you know it's legit."
2 Corinthians,13,2,"Just FYI, I've already mentioned this before and I'm mentioning it again even though I'm not physically there right now. I'm writing to those who messed up in the past and to everyone else, letting you know that if I come back, I won't go easy on you."
2 Corinthians,13,3,"Y'all looking for evidence that Christ's words in me are legit? Well, let me tell ya, it ain't no weak sauce, it's straight up powerful in y'all."
2 Corinthians,13,4,"Even though he was nailed to the cross because he seemed weak, he's actually alive because of God's awesome power. We're pretty weak too, but we'll stay alive with him all because of God's amazing power that's directed toward you."
2 Corinthians,13,5,"Yo, check yourselves, like seriously, to make sure you're still holding onto your faith. Evaluate your own selves, and I mean really dig deep. Don't you realize that Jesus Christ is chillin' in you? Unless, of course, you're straight-up not about it."
2 Corinthians,13,6,"But I'm confident that you'll get it, we're definitely not losers."
2 Corinthians,13,7,"Yo, I'm straight up praying to God that y'all don't do any shady stuff. Not because we tryna look good or anything, but 'cause it's all about doing what's right, even if others think we're a bunch of losers."
2 Corinthians,13,8,"Like, we can't do anything to, like, oppose the truth, but we're totally down for spreading the truth."
2 Corinthians,13,9,We're stoked when we're feeling low and you're crushing it: and we're all about your growth and being on top of your game. Keep leveling up! #goals
2 Corinthians,13,10,"So, like, I'm writing this stuff even though I'm not there with you right now. I don't wanna come off as harsh when I'm actually there, you know? The Lord has given me this power to lift you up, not to tear you down."
2 Corinthians,13,11,"Yo, fam, before I bounce, listen up. Strive for greatness, stay positive, stay united, keep the peace. And trust, the God who's all about love and peace will roll with ya."
2 Corinthians,13,12,"Show some love with a sacred smooch, fam."
2 Corinthians,13,13,"Yo, all the saints be sendin' their love to you."
2 Corinthians,13,14,"Yo, may the Lord Jesus Christ hook you up with mad grace, and God shower you with love, and the Holy Ghost keep y'all connected. Amen. Oh, by the way, Titus and Lucas wrote this second letter to the Corinthians from Philippi in Macedonia."
Galatians,1,1,"Yo, it's Paul, a legit apostle, not chosen by any random dudes or through human means, but directly by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who totally raised Jesus from the dead and all that, no cap!"
Galatians,1,2,"Yo, shoutout to all the homies rollin' with me, sending love to the churches in Galatia:"
Galatians,1,3,"Yo, may you be blessed with mad grace and peace from God the Father and our homie, Jesus Christ,"
Galatians,1,4,"He like totally sacrificed himself for our sins, so we could like totally escape this messed up world we're living in, all in line with God's plan and our heavenly Father, you know?"
Galatians,1,5,Shout out to the one who deserves all the praise for eternity. Amen.
Galatians,1,6,"I'm shocked how quickly y'all switched up on the one who invited you to experience the goodness of Christ, and fell for another gospel:"
Galatians,1,7,"But hold up, there's actually no other gospel out there. Some people, though, are causing a ruckus and trying to twist up the good news of Christ."
Galatians,1,8,"But, like, even if we, or an angel straight from heaven, start preaching a different gospel to you than the one we've already told you, like, let him be totally cursed."
Galatians,1,9,"Just like I told you before, I'm saying it again: If anyone starts preaching a different gospel than what you already know, they better watch out for some serious consequences."
Galatians,1,10,"Do I even care about what people think? Nah, it's all about pleasing God. I'm not out here trying to impress anyone, 'cause if I was, I wouldn't be a true follower of Christ."
Galatians,1,11,"Just so you know, fam, the good news I preached to you didn't come from any human source."
Galatians,1,12,"Because, like, no one taught me this or anything, I straight up got it from Jesus himself, through His divine revelation, you know?"
Galatians,1,13,"Yo, y'all probably know about my past hustle when I was deep into the Jewish scene. I straight up went ham on God's church, no cap, and left it in ruins:"
Galatians,1,14,"And I was really into the whole Jewish religion thing, even more than others my age from my own country. I was super passionate about all the traditions my ancestors followed."
Galatians,1,15,"But when God, who like totally separated me from my mom's womb, and like called me by his amazing grace,"
Galatians,1,16,"To make his Son known in me, so that I can spread the word about him to all people, I didn't waste time talking to human beings about it:"
Galatians,1,17,"I didn't even bother heading to Jerusalem to meet up with the OG apostles before me. Instead, I jetted off to Arabia for a bit, then made my way back to Damascus."
Galatians,1,18,"So, like, after three years I went to Jerusalem to hang with Peter, and I stayed with him for fifteen days. {went up: or, returned}"
Galatians,1,19,"But I didn't come across any of the other apostles, just James, who was actually the brother of the Lord."
Galatians,1,20,"Yo, let me tell you something real, straight up, no cap, before the big man upstairs, I ain't about to front or lie or anything."
Galatians,1,21,"Then I, like, ended up in Syria and Cilicia, you know?"
Galatians,1,22,"And nobody knew what he looked like in the churches of Judaea, where all the believers in Christ were."
Galatians,1,23,"But like, they were only aware that, the dude who used to like totally harass us in the past, now he's like preaching the faith that he once totally destroyed."
Galatians,1,24,"And they were like, 'Yo, God is straight up lit in me!"
Galatians,2,1,"So, like, fourteen years later, I went to Jerusalem again with my homie Barnabas, and I brought along my boy Titus too."
Galatians,2,2,"So, like, I had this total revelation and I went to them and shared the gospel I'm preaching to the non-Jewish peeps. But I only talked to those who are kinda respected, you know? I didn't want all my hard work to be a waste or anything. {privately: or, separately}"
Galatians,2,3,"But even Titus, my Greek bro, wasn't pressured to get circumcised while kickin' it with me:"
Galatians,2,4,"And that's because of these fake friends who sneaked in without us noticing, trying to secretly check if our freedom in Christ Jesus is real, just so they can control us and take away our freedom:"
Galatians,2,5,"We didn't let them take control, not even for a minute, so that the real deal of the gospel sticks with you."
Galatians,2,6,"But to be honest, those who were supposedly important (whatever they were, it doesn't matter to me: God doesn't show favoritism to anyone) didn't add anything to my knowledge during our meeting."
Galatians,2,7,"But on the flip side, when they realized that spreading the good news to those who are not circumcised was entrusted to me, just as the mission to spread the good news to the circumcised was entrusted to Peter;"
Galatians,2,8,"For the one who did big things in Peter, making him an apostle to the Jewish people, also worked powerfully in me for the non-Jewish people."
Galatians,2,9,"And when James, Cephas, and John, who were like total legends, realized the mad blessings that were given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the warmest welcome, signifying that we should head off to spread the word to non-believers, and they should focus on our fellow Jews."
Galatians,2,10,"It's important for us to look out for the less fortunate, something that I was totally all about."
Galatians,2,11,"But yo, when Peter pulled up in Antioch, I straight up called him out, 'cause he was in the wrong, no cap."
Galatians,2,12,"Like, before the dude came from James, he was totally chillin' and eating with the non-Jewish peeps. But when those other dudes showed up, he straight up dipped and distanced himself, 'cause he was scared of the circumcision gang."
Galatians,2,13,"And like, the rest of the Jewish people were also pretending with him, to the point that Barnabas got caught up in their fake act too."
Galatians,2,14,"So, like, when I peeped that they weren't really keeping it real with the whole gospel thing, I straight up called out Peter in front of everyone. I was like, 'Yo, Peter, my dude, if you, as a Jewish homie, can live like a Gentile and not follow all the Jewish customs, why you gotta force the Gentiles to do the same? Like, that ain't cool, bro.'"
Galatians,2,15,"We, born Jewish, not out here sinning like the Gentiles,"
Galatians,2,16,"Yo fam, peep this: You gotta know that trying to be a good person and follow all the rules ain't gonna make you legit in God's eyes. It's all about puttin' your faith in Jesus Christ. We all believed in Him, not because of what we do, but because of faith. You can't earn your way into heaven by following the law, no way, it doesn't work like that."
Galatians,2,17,"But, like, if we're all about being made right with Christ and stuff, and then we turn out to still mess up and make mistakes, does that mean Christ is, like, encouraging us to sin? Absolutely not, dude."
Galatians,2,18,"Like, if I start rebuilding the stuff I already wrecked, I'm totally going against the rules, man."
Galatians,2,19,"So like, I totally died to the law because of the law, you know? Like, I did it so I can live my best life for God."
Galatians,2,20,"I'm down with Christ: still living my life, but it's not just about me, it's about Christ living through me. The way I go about this earthly existence is by having faith in the Son of God, who loved me and sacrificed himself for me."
Galatians,2,21,"I ain't gonna mess with God's grace, 'cause if being right with Him depended on following the rules, then Jesus died for nothing."
Galatians,3,1,"Yo, Galatians, seriously? Who put a spell on you so you wouldn't listen to the truth? It's like you totally missed seeing Jesus Christ right in front of you, crucified for all to see!"
Galatians,3,2,"Hey, here's something I'm curious about: Did you get the Spirit because you followed all the rules, or was it because you believed and trusted in what you heard?"
Galatians,3,3,"Are you guys like, seriously making that dumb mistake? Like, you started off with the Spirit and now you think you can become perfect just by relying on your own strength and abilities? SMH."
Galatians,3,4,"Bruh, did you go through all that struggle for nothing? Like, was it all for nothin'? So not cool, if it was for nothin'. I mean, it's like a huge waste, you know?"
Galatians,3,5,"So, the person who blesses you with the Spirit and pulls off epic miracles, does he do it through following a bunch of rules, or by simply trusting in your beliefs?"
Galatians,3,6,"Just like how Abraham totally believed in God, and bam, it was like total righteousness on his account, you feel me? {accounted: or, imputed}"
Galatians,3,7,"Just so you know, if you believe, then you're totally part of Abraham's crew."
Galatians,3,8,"And like, the scripture totally predicted that God would make the non-believers righteous through faith, and even way back then, it was preaching the good news to Abraham, sayin' like, 'Yo, all the nations are gonna be blessed through you!'"
Galatians,3,9,"So, like, all those who have faith are totally blessed, just like our homie Abraham, who was super faithful and all."
Galatians,3,10,"Those who rely solely on following the rules are in a tough spot, ya feel me? 'Cause if you don't keep up with every single thing written in the rulebook, you're cursed, man."
Galatians,3,11,"Okay, so listen up guys, it's pretty obvious that no one can impress God by following a bunch of rules. Seriously, it's crystal clear! Instead, the righteous ones are the ones who live by faith. Like, they trust in God and stuff, rather than relying on their own good deeds."
Galatians,3,12,"And the whole rule thing doesn't require just believing, but the dude who actually follows it will live a good life."
Galatians,3,13,"Yo, Christ totally saved us from being cursed by the law. He became the curse in our place, 'cause the book says, anyone who hangs on a tree is cursed, man."
Galatians,3,14,"So basically, thanks to Jesus Christ, even us non-Jews can get in on the whole Abraham blessing thing. And by having faith, we can totally score that promise of the Spirit."
Galatians,3,15,"Yo, fam, I'm just speaking in a relatable way here. When humans make a deal, even if it's just between them, once it's confirmed, no one can cancel it or change the terms. Just FYI, covenantt' can also mean 'testament'."
Galatians,3,16,"So, like, the promises made to Abraham and his descendants, right? He didn't say 'seeds' as in a bunch of people, but 'seed' as in one, and that's Christ."
Galatians,3,17,"So, like, check it out, God made this promise to like, Abraham, right? And then, like, four hundred and thirty years later, He brought in the whole law thing through Moses. But here's the deal, guys: that law can't just cancel out the promise God made. It's, like, totally ineffective against it."
Galatians,3,18,"If the whole deal is about following the rules, then it's not really about the promise. But instead, God straight-up promised Abraham this inheritance."
Galatians,3,19,"So, what's the deal with the law, you ask? Well, it was added because people were messing up left and right. It was only there temporarily, until the person that the promise was made to arrived. And get this, it was even put in place by angels, with the help of a mediator."
Galatians,3,20,"So, like, a mediator is not just there for one person, you know? God is like, the one and only, man."
Galatians,3,21,"So, like, is the law, like, totally going against what God promised? No way, dude! Like, if there was a law that could've given life, then, like, being righteous would've totally depended on following the law."
Galatians,3,22,"But yo, the Bible said everyone's got sin on lock, so that the promise of Jesus Christ through faith can be straight up given to those who believe."
Galatians,3,23,"But like, before we had faith, we were totally bound by this set of rules, like trapped until the time when our faith would be fully revealed, you know?"
Galatians,3,24,"So, like, the law was basically our guide, you know, to lead us to Christ, so that we could be made right with God through faith."
Galatians,3,25,"Once we've embraced faith, we no longer need someone bossing us around like a teacher."
Galatians,3,26,"You're all squad members of God, believing in Christ Jesus."
Galatians,3,27,"Yo, all y'all who got baptized in the name of Christ, you straight up rockin' Christ now."
Galatians,3,28,"In Christ Jesus, it doesn't matter if you're Jewish or Greek, if you're enslaved or free, or if you're a guy or a girl - we're all equal and united."
Galatians,3,29,"And if you're part of Team Christ, then you're like a descendant of Abraham and, like, entitled to all the good stuff that was promised."
Galatians,4,1,"Listen up, fam! Let me break it down for you. When it comes to the heir, if they're still a kid, they ain't no different than a regular servant, even if they're the boss of everything."
Galatians,4,2,"But, like, they're under these teachers and authority figures until the dad says it's time."
Galatians,4,3,"Like, back then, when we were kids, we were totally trapped under the basic rules of this world, you know?"
Galatians,4,4,"But, like, when everything was totally ready, God was like 'Yo, it's time!' and sent His Son down to Earth, born as a regular human, following all the rules and stuff."
Galatians,4,5,"To save those who were bound by the rules, so that we can become accepted as children."
Galatians,4,6,"And like, since you're, like, children of God, He, like, sent the Spirit of His Son into your hearts and it's all like, shouting out, 'Abba, Father'."
Galatians,4,7,"So basically, now you're not just someone doing chores, you're like part of the fam. And since you're part of the fam, you've got that inheritance hookup from God, all thanks to Jesus."
Galatians,4,8,"But back when you didn't even know God, you were out there worshiping things that aren't even real gods, you know?"
Galatians,4,9,"Yo, fam, once you've been woke to God, or better yet, God's been woke to you, why you gotta flip the script and go back to those weak and broke basics? Why you tryna get all chained up again to that basic life?"
Galatians,4,10,"Y'all are all about those days, months, times, and years."
Galatians,4,11,"Yo, gotta be real with ya, kinda worried I wasted my time on you."
Galatians,4,12,"Yo fam, listen up. I'm really feelin' it and I just gotta say, let's be on the same level, you know? I'm just like you, and you're just like me. No beef between us, we're all good here."
Galatians,4,13,"You already know that because of my physical weakness, I shared the good news with y'all from the very beginning."
Galatians,4,14,"And you didn't diss or turn away from the struggle I faced in my own body; instead, you embraced me like a heaven-sent messenger, just like Christ Jesus himself."
Galatians,4,15,"So, what happened to all that talk about how awesome things were? I can vouch for you guys - if it were even remotely possible, you would've literally taken out your own eyes and handed them to me. Like, seriously!"
Galatians,4,16,"So, like, am I your enemy now just because I'm telling you the straight facts?"
Galatians,4,17,"They're trying way too hard to impress you, but honestly, it's not cool. They're totally trying to make you feel left out just so they can be the center of attention. (And by 'you' I mean 'us'.)"
Galatians,4,18,"It's awesome to be totally hyped about something good all the time, not just when I'm around you."
Galatians,4,19,"Hey fam, my beloved squad, I've been going through some major struggles tryna help y'all grow until you become more like Christ inside."
Galatians,4,20,"Yo, I really wanna hang with y'all right now and switch up my vibe, 'cause I'm kinda unsure about where we stand. *shrugs*"
Galatians,4,21,"Yo, listen up all you who are all about following the rules, don't you even pay attention to what the rules actually say?"
Galatians,4,22,"So basically, back in the day, the story goes like this - Abraham had two sons, one with a servant girl, and the other with a totally independent chick."
Galatians,4,23,But the one who came from the slave woman was born in a normal way; but the one who came from the free woman was born because of a promise.
Galatians,4,24,"Yo, listen up! I got a cool story to tell ya. So, there's this deep stuff goin' on that's kind of like a hidden message, you know? It's all about these two agreements or contracts or whatever you wanna call 'em - like, they're important. One of 'em was given on this big mountain called Sinai, and it's all about being stuck and tied down, like you can't escape. That's where Agar comes in, just to give you a lil' background. Oh, by the way, when I say covenants, I mean testaments. And, for the record, Sinai is actually Sina in Greek, if you're all about the fancy terms."
Galatians,4,25,"So, Agar represents Mount Sinai in Arabia, and it's like how Jerusalem is today‚Äîboth of them are kind of stuck and held down with their people."
Galatians,4,26,"But like, the heavenly Jerusalem is totally free and like, legit the mom of all of us."
Galatians,4,27,"Because it's written, Yo, barren queen who ain't got no babies, get ready to celebrate! Start shouting, even though you didn't go through all the labor pains. 'Cause let me tell you, the one who feels deserted is gonna end up with way more kids than the one with a hubby."
Galatians,4,28,"Yo, fam, just like Isaac, we are the chosen ones, destined for greatness."
Galatians,4,29,"But just like back then, when the one who came into this world naturally made life difficult for the one who came through divine inspiration, it's the same story happening right now."
Galatians,4,30,"But like, here's what the scripture says, you know? Kick out the bondwoman and her son, 'cause the son of the bondwoman can't be the boss like the son of the freewoman, you feel me?"
Galatians,4,31,"So listen up, dudes and dudettes, we ain't stuck being slaves anymore, we're all about that freedom life."
Galatians,5,1,"So like, hold onto your freedom that Jesus hooked us up with, and don't get caught up in the chains of being tied down again."
Galatians,5,2,"Yo, listen up, peeps! It's your boy, Paul, here to drop some truth bombs. So, here's the deal: If you go ahead and get circumcised, it's not gonna do diddly-squat for your spiritual journey with Christ. Just saying."
Galatians,5,3,"Just to make it clear, I want to remind all the dudes who are circumcised that they're totally obligated to follow every single law. No loopholes, bro."
Galatians,5,4,"Yo, if you think following the law can save you, then you're missing the point. The whole grace thing? Yeah, you're totally slipping away from that."
Galatians,5,5,"Because, like, we're totally, like, relying on the Spirit and stuff, and we're all like super pumped for the hope of being righteous through our faith, you know?"
Galatians,5,6,"In Jesus' squad, whether you're cut or uncut doesn't matter at all - it's all about having faith that's fueled by love."
Galatians,5,7,"You were doing so good, who messed you up and made you not follow the truth anymore? {messed you up: or, pushed you back}"
Galatians,5,8,This mindset isn't from the one who's reaching out to you.
Galatians,5,9,A tiny vibe spreads major vibes.
Galatians,5,10,"I totally trust you in the Lord, that you won't have any other thoughts. But whoever causes you trouble will face the consequences, no matter who they are."
Galatians,5,11,"Yo, fam, if I'm still out here preaching about circumcision, why am I still getting hated on? That just means folks ain't trippin' anymore about the message of the cross."
Galatians,5,12,I wish those who annoy you could just disappear.
Galatians,5,13,"Yo, fam, listen up. You've been chosen to live free. But like, don't abuse that freedom as an excuse to satisfy your own desires. Instead, show love by serving each other selflessly."
Galatians,5,14,"Basically, the whole law can be summed up in just one thing: treat your neighbor the way you want to be treated."
Galatians,5,15,"But yo, if y'all attack and tear each other apart, just watch out that you don't end up totally destroying each other."
Galatians,5,16,"So, like, here's the deal: You gotta live your best life in the Spirit, and then you won't even feel tempted to satisfy your fleshly desires, you know? Trust me on this one."
Galatians,5,17,"It's like, our desires and our conscience are constantly at odds with each other, totally conflicting. It's a constant struggle, man. It's like we're trapped and can't do what we really want to do, you know?"
Galatians,5,18,"But if you let the Spirit guide you, you don't have to follow all the rules."
Galatians,5,19,"Alright, let me break it down for you. These are the things that show you're being driven by your selfish desires: cheating, hooking up casually, impurity, and being all about that inappropriate behavior."
Galatians,5,20,"Being obsessed with idols, practicing witchcraft, hating others, causing arguments, being jealous of someone's success, getting angry easily, constantly arguing, causing divisions, spreading false teachings,"
Galatians,5,21,"Yo, like, envy, killing, getting wasted, partying hard, and all that stuff are a big no-no. I've mentioned it before, just like I'm telling you now, that those who do these things won't be getting into the kingdom of God, ya know."
Galatians,5,22,"But like, the vibes that come with the Spirit are love, joy, peace, being patient for a hot sec, being chill and kind, being good, and having faith, ya know?"
Galatians,5,23,"Being humble and self-controlled, there's no rules against that vibe."
Galatians,5,24,"And those who belong to Christ have totally rejected giving in to their selfish desires and uncontrollable cravings. {affections: or, intense emotions}"
Galatians,5,25,"If we're all about that spiritual life, let's stay on that same wavelength in our actions too."
Galatians,5,26,"Yo, let's not be all about seeking attention for ourselves, constantly trying to provoke and be jealous of each other."
Galatians,6,1,"Hey fam, if one of our squad messes up, those of us who have got that spiritual maturity should help them out with humility, keeping in mind that we could easily fall into temptation too. {if: or, although}"
Galatians,6,2,"Support each other's struggles and be real with one another, 'cause that's how you live up to Christ's teachings."
Galatians,6,3,"So, like, if a dude thinks he's all that, but deep down he's actually nothing, he's just fooling himself, ya know?"
Galatians,6,4,"But hey, everyone should totally flex their own work, and then they'll feel stoked about themselves, not comparing to someone else."
Galatians,6,5,"Each person gotta handle their own stuff, no one else can do it for them."
Galatians,6,6,"If you're learning from someone, make sure to show them some love by sharing good things with them."
Galatians,6,7,"Don't be fooled, bro; you can't mess with God, I'm telling ya! Whatever you put out there, that's gonna come back at ya. #Truth"
Galatians,6,8,The person who focuses on doing whatever they want and indulging in their desires will eventually face the consequences of their actions; but the one who focuses on nourishing their inner self and spiritual growth will experience a fulfilling and eternal life.
Galatians,6,9,"And let's not get tired of doing good deeds, 'cause eventually we'll see some awesome results if we don't give up."
Galatians,6,10,"So, like, whenever we get the chance, let's be awesome to everyone, you know? But, like, we should totally prioritize showing love and kindness to our squad of believers."
Galatians,6,11,You peep how big of a text I've sent you with my own handwriting.
Galatians,6,12,"Those who want to look good on the outside try to pressure you into getting circumcised, just so they can avoid being criticized for their faith in Christ."
Galatians,6,13,Because even the ones who are all about following traditions aren't really sticking to the rules themselves. They just want you to conform and get circumcised so they can brag about it.
Galatians,6,14,"But like, no way would I ever flex or boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. 'Cause thanks to Him, the whole world doesn't really matter to me anymore, and I'm not concerned about fitting into the world's norms either. {by whom: or, whereby}"
Galatians,6,15,"Yo, listen up! In Christ Jesus, getting circumcised or not, doesn't make a difference, bro. It's all about being a totally new person, no matter what."
Galatians,6,16,"To all those who live by this principle, may they receive peace, mercy, and blessings upon the chosen people of God."
Galatians,6,17,"Yo, like, don't even try to mess with me anymore, cuz I straight-up rockin' the signs of my main man Jesus on my body, you feel me?"
Galatians,6,18,"Hey fam, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. ‚ÄπThis message to the Galatians was written from Rome.‚Ä∫"

Philippians,1,4,"Whenever I pray for y'all, it fills me with so much happiness and positive vibes!"
Philippians,1,5,Been vibin' with you in spreading the good news since day one till now;

Philippians,1,9,"Yo, I'm praying that your love game levels up, gaining mad knowledge and getting solid in all areas of understanding and making wise decisions; like, you know?!"
Philippians,1,10,"So you can vibe with things that are straight fire, and be genuine and drama-free until the day Jesus comes through; {vibe: or, test} {are...: or, be different}"
Philippians,1,11,"We gotta vibe with those righteous vibes, brought to us by Jesus Christ, all for giving props and showing love to God."
Philippians,1,12,"But yo, fam, I want you to peep this: the things that went down with me actually ended up boosting the spread of the gospel, my fellow homies."
Philippians,1,13,"So that everyone can see how I am connected to Christ, even in the palace and everywhere else. Whether it's in Caesar's court or anywhere else, it's clear that I'm linked to Christ."
Philippians,1,14,"And a lot of my fellow believers, getting inspired by seeing me in chains, have become even more fearless in spreading the good news."
Philippians,1,15,"There are some peeps out there preaching about Christ because they're all jelly and looking for some drama. But there are also some who are doing it out of genuine love and pure intentions, ya know."
Philippians,1,16,"There's this person out here, trying to spread the message of Christ, but they're only doing it to cause drama, not genuinely. They think they can make my situation even worse while I'm already going through a hard time in prison. How uncool is that?"
Philippians,1,17,But the other person knows I'm all about spreading love and being ready to defend the good news.
Philippians,1,18,"So, what's the deal? Regardless, whether it's just for show or for real, Jesus is being talked about, and that totally makes me happy. Like, for real. And I'm gonna stay happy about it."
Philippians,1,19,I'm confident that this situation will work out for my benefit thanks to your prayers and the support from the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
Philippians,1,20,"So, like, I'm totally stoked and hopeful that I won't be embarrassed about anything, you know? And I'm gonna have this sick confidence to show off Christ in everything I do, whether I'm livin' it up or, like, facing death."
Philippians,1,21,"For me, life is all about Jesus, and dying is actually a win."
Philippians,1,22,"But if I continue living in this physical world, this is the result of my hard work; yet I'm unsure of what I should choose."
Philippians,1,23,"I'm stuck between two things, torn between leaving and being with Christ, which is way more awesome."
Philippians,1,24,"But, like, I get that it might be important for me to stick around in this physical world for you guys."
Philippians,1,25,"And with this confidence, I know that I'll be sticking around, supporting and bringing positive vibes to all of you, helping you grow in your faith and bringing you joy."
Philippians,1,26,So that you can flex harder for Jesus Christ when I see you again.
Philippians,1,27,"Just make sure your words and actions show that you're all about spreading the good news of Jesus. Whether I'm there in person or not, I want to hear that you guys are staying strong together, united in your beliefs and working hard to promote the message of the gospel."
Philippians,1,28,"And don't let your haters scare you at all. It just shows that they're doomed, but for you, it's a sign that you're gonna be saved, all thanks to God."
Philippians,1,29,"Yo, Christ hooked you up with something special. It's not just about believing in Him, but also about going through some tough stuff for His sake. So, embrace the challenges and keep the faith, my fam!"
Philippians,1,30,"So, you know that same struggle you witnessed in me? Well, guess what? It's still going strong."
Philippians,2,1,"So, like, if you've found any kind of solace in Jesus, if love has brought you any comfort, if you've experienced this sense of togetherness with the Spirit, if you've been touched by any feelings of compassion and kindness,"
Philippians,2,2,"Yo, make me hella stoked by vibin' on the same wavelength, showin' love, and stayin' united and on the same page, ya know?"
Philippians,2,3,"Yo, don't be all about the drama and showing off. Instead, be humble and consider others as more important than yourself."
Philippians,2,4,"Don't just focus on your own stuff, but take a moment to consider what's going on with others too."
Philippians,2,5,"Yo, peeps, you should have the same mindset as my main man Jesus, ya feel me?"
Philippians,2,6,"Yo, like, fam was straight up God and was chill with the fact that He was on the same level as God and stuff."
Philippians,2,7,"But he low-key didn't care about his reputation, and totally embraced being a servant, and straight up became a human just like us:"
Philippians,2,8,"And when he took on a human form, he totally humbled himself and followed orders till the very end, even to the point of dying on a cross. {fashion: or habit}"
Philippians,2,9,"So basically, God really lifted him up and hooked him up with a name that's better than any other name out there:"
Philippians,2,10,"So basically, one day everyone, and I mean everyone, will have to show respect to Jesus. Like, even the things up in heaven, the things down here on earth, and even the things lurking under the earth. There's just no escaping it, man."
Philippians,2,11,"And like, everyone needs to admit that Jesus Christ is the ultimate boss, giving major props to God the Father."
Philippians,2,12,"Yo, fam, listen up! Dudes and dudettes, my beloved squad, just like y'all have always been obedient, not just when I'm around, but even more so when I'm not, put in the work to figure out your own salvation, but with a lil' fear and humility, you know what I'm sayin'?"
Philippians,2,13,"It's actually God who's doing all the work inside of you, helping you want to do what's right and actually do it. And He's totally stoked about it!"
Philippians,2,14,"Just do your thing without complaining or arguing, fam:"
Philippians,2,15,"So you can be pure and genuine, the children of God, without criticism, in the midst of a messed up and distorted society, where you stand out as bright lights in the world;"
Philippians,2,16,"Sharing the lit word of life, so I can flex on the day of Christ, knowing that I didn't grind for nothing, no cap."
Philippians,2,17,"Yeah, and if I give it my all for the sake of your belief and dedication, I'm stoked and hyped, celebrating with all y'all. {offered: Gr. poured forth}"
Philippians,2,18,"So, like, let's all be stoked and can't even contain our hype for the same reason, you know? It's all about spreading that positive vibe and celebrating together, just feeling all the good feels with me."
Philippians,2,19,"But I totally trust in the Lord Jesus to send my friend Timotheus your way really soon, so that I can feel much better when I find out how you're doing. Oh, and by the way, just in case you were wondering!"
Philippians,2,20,"Because I don't have anyone else who's on the same wavelength as me, someone who genuinely cares about your well-being."
Philippians,2,21,"Everyone out there just focused on their own stuff, not really caring about what belongs to Jesus Christ."
Philippians,2,22,"But you know how solid he is, like a homie working alongside his pops, grinding with me for the sake of the good news."
Philippians,2,23,"So basically, I plan to send him over ASAP once I figure out how things are gonna pan out for me."
Philippians,2,24,But I'm relying on the Lord that I'll make it there myself really soon.
Philippians,2,25,"But I felt it was important to send you Epaphroditus, my bro, and partner in the hustle, and fellow soldier, but he's your messenger, and the one who took care of my needs."
Philippians,2,26,He totally missed you all and was super bummed because he heard that you knew he was sick.
Philippians,2,27,"Dude, he was seriously on the edge of death, but thank God, He showed mad mercy on him. And not just him, but even on me, because I would've been crushed with double sorrow if not for that."
Philippians,2,28,"So I made sure to send him with extra care, so that when you see him again, you'll be stoked and I'll be less sad. {carefully: or, with more anxious care}"
Philippians,2,29,"So, like, welcome him with all the good vibes and be all stoked about it, you know? Give props and show mad respect to peeps like him, for real."
Philippians,2,30,"Yo, this dude was seriously close to death because of all the work he did for Christ. He didn't even care about his own life, just so he could make up for what y'all fell short in doing for me."
Philippians,3,1,"Yo, my peeps, listen up! As a final word, I wanna say, keep on vibing with the Lord. I know it may sound repetitive, but trust me, it's all good for both of us - gives me a good vibe, and keeps you protected, you know?"
Philippians,3,2,"Watch out for those fake friends, watch out for those toxic people, watch out for those who are always causing drama."
Philippians,3,3,"Because we, who follow God, connect with Him in our hearts, find joy in Christ Jesus, and do not rely on worldly things."
Philippians,3,4,"Okay, I gotta be real for a sec. I could totally flex on y'all if I wanted to. Like, if anyone thinks they've got something to brag about, I've got even more street cred than them, no cap."
Philippians,3,5,"I got circumcised when I was eight days old, I'm from the Israel fam, repping the Benjamin tribe. I'm a legit Hebrew among Hebrews and when it comes to following the law, I'm a boss Pharisee."
Philippians,3,6,"When it came to being passionate, I was all about going after the church. I took pride in doing everything right according to the law, without any faults or blame."
Philippians,3,7,"But all the stuff I used to think was important, I now realize it's worthless compared to following Christ."
Philippians,3,8,"No cap, I'm straight up convinced that everything else is trash compared to how lit it is to know Jesus Christ, my main homie. I've gone through some major L's for Him, and I straight up consider all of that garbage, just so I can come out on top with Christ."
Philippians,3,9,"And when people look at me, I don't want them to see me just relying on my own good deeds to be righteous, because that's not how it works. Instead, I want them to see me trusting in Jesus, putting my faith in him, because that's where true righteousness comes from ‚Äì it's a gift from God that we receive by faith."
Philippians,3,10,"So I can totally vibe with him, and experience the epicness of his comeback, and be part of his struggles, like totally relating to his death;"
Philippians,3,11,"Hoping I can achieve that awesome comeback from the afterlife, you know?"
Philippians,3,12,"It's not like I've already made it or achieved perfection, but I keep pushing forward, hoping to capture what Christ Jesus has chosen me for."
Philippians,3,13,"Yo, fam, I ain't gonna front. I haven't fully figured it all out yet, but there's this one thing I'm all about: leaving the past behind and striving for what's ahead of me."
Philippians,3,14,"I hustle hard to achieve the ultimate goal of receiving God's amazing reward through Jesus Christ, yo."
Philippians,3,15,"So, like, if you're totally on point and perfect, then you should totally think this way too, you know? But, like, if you see things differently, don't stress out, 'cause God will totally help you understand that too."
Philippians,3,16,"But like, whatever we've already achieved, let's keep following the same path and focusing on the same goals."
Philippians,3,17,"Hey fam, y'all gotta stick with me and pay attention to those who are living their lives just like us."
Philippians,3,18,"There are so many people out there, man, like seriously, who are totally against what Christ did on the cross. I've talked about this a lot, and it's actually making me tear up right now. It's heartbreaking, you know?"
Philippians,3,19,"They're heading straight for destruction, their whole world revolves around their desires, and they take pride in things they should be ashamed of because all they care about are superficial earthly stuff."
Philippians,3,20,"Yo, like, our vibe is all about heaven, you know? That's where we're at, just waiting for our hero, the legend, Jesus Christ, to show up and save the day. We're all about living that heavenly lifestyle, like citizens of heaven and all. #HeavenGoals"
Philippians,3,21,"Yo, who will upgrade our trash bods so they'll be on fleek like his lit bod? He's got the power to make everything submit to him, no doubt."
Philippians,4,1,"So, fam, my beloved and highly anticipated homies, my source of happiness and ultimate achievement, stay strong in the Lord, my beloved squad."
Philippians,4,2,"Hey Euodias and Syntyche, I really urge you to get on the same wavelength when it comes to following the teachings of the Lord."
Philippians,4,3,"Yo, my homie, I've got a favor to ask. Can you lend a hand to those awesome ladies who've been grinding with me in spreading the good news? Shoutout to Clement and the rest of my crew too, they're all legends and their names are lit in the book of life."
Philippians,4,4,"Always be stoked in the Lord, like seriously, and yo, I'm saying it again, be stoked, okay?"
Philippians,4,5,"Yo, just be chill and balanced, you know? Everyone should see it. The Lord's always close, too."
Philippians,4,6,"Don't stress about anything, but for everything, hit up God with prayer and gratitude, letting Him know what you need."
Philippians,4,7,"And God's chill vibes, which are beyond comprehension, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."
Philippians,4,8,"Yo, fam, at the end of the day, focus on what's real, what's legit, what's fair, what's pure, what's beautiful, what's getting good reviews. If there's any goodness or positivity out there, that's where your mind should be at. Stay woke! üíØ"
Philippians,4,9,"Yo fam, whatever you've peeped, picked up, learned, and witnessed from me, make moves and do your thing. And trust, the God of peace will ride with you. No cap."
Philippians,4,10,"I was totally stoked, bro, when I saw that you guys were once again lookin' out for me. You've always had my back, but sometimes life just didn't give you a chance. Keep it up, you're killin' it! üôå"
Philippians,4,11,"Not gonna lie, I'm not talking about being needy or anything. But like, I've figured out that no matter what situation I'm in, I've learned to be, like, totally chill and satisfied with it."
Philippians,4,12,"I've got the low-down on both the struggle and the success: no matter where or what the situation, I've learned to be content whether I'm ballin' or barely scraping by."
Philippians,4,13,I can totally crush any challenge with the strength given to me by Christ.
Philippians,4,14,"Yo, you guys did a solid job by supporting me when I was going through a tough time."
Philippians,4,15,"Hey Philippians, just wanna let y'all know that way back when I first started spreading the good news and left Macedonia, only you guys had my back when it came to giving and receiving. No other church was as supportive as y'all."
Philippians,4,16,"Yo, even when you were in Thessalonica, you came through for me and hooked me up multiple times when I was in need."
Philippians,4,17,"I'm not asking for a handout, but I want to see your success multiply and add to your overall growth."
Philippians,4,18,"Dude, I gotta say, I've got everything and then some. Epic shoutout to Epaphroditus for hooking me up with the stuff you sent. It's like a legit pleasant aroma, a totally rad offering that God is totally feeling. Like, seriously, I've got it all covered. Or should I say, I've scored all the cool stuff."
Philippians,4,19,"But like, trust me, my God's got your back and will totally hook you up with everything you need, like straight up, no joke. He's super rich in glory, thanks to Christ Jesus and all."
Philippians,4,20,"Now we gotta give mad props to God, our ultimate Father, for straight up being the coolest and most awesome forever and ever. Amen, y'all."
Philippians,4,21,"Yo, give a shoutout to all the lit Christians out there repping Christ Jesus. The homies that are rollin' with me send their greetings to you."
Philippians,4,22,"Yo, all the saints send you a shoutout! Especially the ones reppin' Caesar's squad."
Philippians,4,23,May the love of Jesus be with all of you. Amen. ¬´This letter to the Philippians was written from Rome by Epaphroditus.¬ª

2 Thessalonians,3,3,"But the Lord's got your back, you know? Always stayin' true and keepin' you steady, protectin' you from all that bad stuff."
2 Thessalonians,3,4,"And we totally trust in the Lord when it comes to you, that you guys are gonna do and will keep doing the things we tell you to do."
2 Thessalonians,3,5,"Yo, may the Lord guide your hearts towards fully embracing the love of God, and having mad patience while waiting for Christ to come through. And when I say patience, I mean the same level of chill that Christ Himself had."
2 Thessalonians,3,6,"Hey fam, listen up. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we're telling you to distance yourselves from any bro who's acting all chaotic and not following the way we do things around here."
2 Thessalonians,3,7,"You already know how you should imitate us, because we didn't act all chaotic when we were with you;"
2 Thessalonians,3,8,"We never freeloaded and mooched off anyone's grub. We busted our butts day and night, putting in hard work and relentless effort so we wouldn't burden any of y'all."
2 Thessalonians,3,9,"It's not because we're weak, but to set a dope example for you to follow."
2 Thessalonians,3,10,"Yo, even when we were chillin' with you, we straight up told you that if someone ain't down to work, they shouldn't be grubbin'."
2 Thessalonians,3,11,"So, we've heard that there are some people hangin' around who have no discipline, they don't even bother workin', and instead they're just busy meddling in other people's business."
2 Thessalonians,3,12,"Alright, to all those peeps out there, we're putting it out there and giving a big shoutout from our boy Jesus Christ - y'all gotta hustle in peace, minding your own business and enjoying your own grub."
2 Thessalonians,3,13,"Yo, fam, don't get tired of doing good. {faint not}"
2 Thessalonians,3,14,"And if anyone doesn't listen to what we're saying in this message, take note of that person and don't hang out with them, so they can feel embarrassed about it. {by...: or, let that person know through a message}"
2 Thessalonians,3,15,"But don't see them as an enemy, instead, give them a friendly reminder like a sibling."
2 Thessalonians,3,16,"May the OG of tranquility bless you with solid peace, no cap, in every way possible. Big ups to the Lord, chillin' with all y'all."
2 Thessalonians,3,17,"Yo, it's Paul. I'm signin' off with my own hand, like I always do in every letter. That's just how I roll, fam."
2 Thessalonians,3,18,"May Jesus Christ's grace be with all of you. Amen. This is the end of the second letter to the Thessalonians, written from Athens."
1 Timothy,1,1,"Yo, it's Paul, one of Jesus Christ's apostles, because God our Savior and Lord Jesus Christ ordered it, and He's our ultimate hope and all."
1 Timothy,1,2,"To Timothy, my homie in the faith: Sending you hella grace, mercy, and peace from our heavenly Dad and Jesus Christ, our ultimate squad leader."
1 Timothy,1,3,"So like, when I was in Macedonia, I totally asked you to stay in Ephesus and make sure people don't preach any other weird stuff, you know?"
1 Timothy,1,4,"Don't waste your time on made-up stories and never-ending family histories that spark pointless debates. Instead, focus on building each other up in a way that honors your faith. That's the way to go, for real."
1 Timothy,1,5,"So basically, the main goal of this commandment is to show love from a genuine heart, and with a clear conscience, and with real faith:"
1 Timothy,1,6,Some people have gone off track and started engaging in meaningless chatter instead;
1 Timothy,1,7,"They wanna flex as law gurus, but they got zero clue what they're talking about or even if they're right."
1 Timothy,1,8,"But, like, we're aware that the law is actually pretty cool, ya know, as long as we use it in the right way."
1 Timothy,1,9,"Yo, listen up - here's the deal: the law ain't for those who do right, but instead for those who break the rules, rebel against authority, disrespect the divine, engage in sinful behavior, show no regard for what's holy, and even go as far as taking lives."
1 Timothy,1,10,"For those who engage in promiscuous relationships, those who engage in immoral acts with the same gender, those who kidnap others, those who spread falsehoods, those who lie under oath, and anyone who goes against the teachings of truth;"
1 Timothy,1,11,"Yo, listen up! The good news about our awesome God, who's totally blessed, has been handed down to yours truly."
1 Timothy,1,12,"And yo, shoutout to Christ Jesus, our ultimate homie, who straight up empowered me, 'cause he saw me as reliable AF and hooked me up with this ministry gig;"
1 Timothy,1,13,"Before, I was out here blaspheming, persecuting, and being all toxic and stuff. But yo, I got blessed with some mercy 'cause I was straight up clueless and had no faith."
1 Timothy,1,14,"Yo, God's grace was like super overwhelming, man! It came with mad faith and love, all because of Jesus, you know?"
1 Timothy,1,15,"Yo, listen up! This is straight facts and everyone should be vibin' with it. Jesus Christ came into this world to save us sinners, and I gotta admit, I'm at the top of that list."
1 Timothy,1,16,"But yo, I gotta tell you why I got that sweet mercy - it's so Jesus Christ can flex on all the haters with His endless patience, setting an example for all the future believers who wanna live that eternal life."
1 Timothy,1,17,"To the OG King, who's eternal, unstoppable, low-key invisible, the G.O.A.T wise God, much props and clout for all eternity. Respect. Amen."
1 Timothy,1,18,"Yo, Timothy, listen up! I'm passing on this important task to you, my dude, just like the prophecies predicted. It's time for you to go out there and fight the good fight, man!"
1 Timothy,1,19,"Staying loyal and true to your beliefs, and keeping yourself morally grounded; because some people have chosen to disregard their faith, resulting in making a complete mess of things like a giant shipwreck."
1 Timothy,1,20,"So there's these two guys named Hymenaeus and Alexander, who I kinda gave over to Satan. It's not as crazy as it sounds! I did it to teach them a lesson and help them realize not to go mocking sacred things."
1 Timothy,2,1,"So here's the deal: I really want you to start by sending good vibes, saying your prayers, looking out for others, and showing gratitude for everything. It's important to do this for everyone, no exceptions. Trust me, it's gonna make a difference!"
1 Timothy,2,2,"Respect the kings and all those in charge, so we can chill and live our best lives with love and integrity. #Blessed"
1 Timothy,2,3,"Like, this is totally cool and lit in God's eyes, our ultimate homie and savior."
1 Timothy,2,4,God wants everyone to be saved and know the truth.
1 Timothy,2,5,"So like, there's only one God, and he's the only go-between like, connecting God and people, and that's Jesus, man!"
1 Timothy,2,6,"He totally sacrificed himself for everyone, and this epic story will be shared at the right moment. {to...: or, as a lit testimony}"
1 Timothy,2,7,"I'm totally called to be a preacher and an apostle, no joke! (I'm not lying when I say this, I swear in Christ.) My mission is to teach the non-Jewish peeps about faith and truth."
1 Timothy,2,8,"So, like, I want everyone to pray wherever they are, you know? Just lift up those pure hands without any anger or doubt, ya feel me?"
1 Timothy,2,9,"Similarly, it's cool if girls dress in humble and modest clothes, showing respect and self-control. Let's focus on being real, without getting caught up in fancy hairstyles, jewelry, or expensive outfits."
1 Timothy,2,10,But (which is appropriate for women who are devoted to godliness) through acts of kindness and good deeds.
1 Timothy,2,11,"Girls, it's cool to soak up knowledge without making noise and showing respect."
1 Timothy,2,12,"But, like, I'm not cool with a woman being the teacher or taking charge over the guy, you know? She should just chill and stay quiet, tbh."
1 Timothy,2,13,"So, like, Adam was totally created before Eve and stuff."
1 Timothy,2,14,"So, like, Adam wasn't tricked or anything, but the woman, she got fooled and messed up big time."
1 Timothy,2,15,"But fam, she'll be alright if they stay faithful, showing love and living a righteous life with moderation."
1 Timothy,3,1,"Yo, listen up! If someone wants to be a bishop, that shows they want to do something awesome."
1 Timothy,3,2,"So, like, a bishop has to be, like, totally on point. He's gotta be, like, super chill, faithful to one bae, always alert, not getting wasted, acting all respectable, welcoming to others, and, like, really good at sharing wisdom, ya know?"
1 Timothy,3,3,"Like, don't get wasted on wine, don't go around picking fights, and definitely don't be all about that money; but instead, be patient, avoid conflicts, and don't be obsessed with material things."
1 Timothy,3,4,"A boss who knows how to run their own crib, keepin' their kids in check with mad respect."
1 Timothy,3,5,"(Like, if a dude doesn't even know how to handle his own crib, how can he be trusted to handle God's squad?)"
1 Timothy,3,6,"Don't be a newbie, 'cause if you get all prideful, you're gonna end up in the devil's bad books. (By newbie, I mean someone who's just new to the faith, btw!)"
1 Timothy,3,7,"Also, he's gotta have a solid rep among the non-believers, 'cause otherwise he might get dragged through the mud and caught up in the devil's traps."
1 Timothy,3,8,"Deacons gotta be real chill, no gossipin', not into heavy partying, and definitely not all about that money grubbing."
1 Timothy,3,9,"Keeping it üíØ with pure vibes, embracing the deep truth of faith with a clear conscience."
1 Timothy,3,10,"And before they can be deacons, they gotta prove themselves and make sure they're totally blameless."
1 Timothy,3,11,"Like, wives should totally be chill and serious, not like, talking trash or being all wild and stuff, but calm and faithful in everything."
1 Timothy,3,12,The deacons should be committed to one partner and be responsible for taking care of their children and managing their own homes effectively.
1 Timothy,3,13,"Those who have served as deacons with excellence will earn a high status and a strong sense of confidence in their faith in Jesus Christ. {used...: or, ministered}"
1 Timothy,3,14,"Yo, just dropping you this message, hoping to link up with you real soon:"
1 Timothy,3,15,"But if I stay for a while, so you know how to act in the house of God, which is like the epic headquarters of the living God, the solid foundation and anchor of all that's true. {ground: or, stay}"
1 Timothy,3,16,"Yo, no cap, the mystery of godliness is on another level: God straight up showed up in physical form, proven legit by the Spirit, seen by angels, preached to all the non-Jews, believed in all around the world, and then taken up into glory."
1 Timothy,4,1,"Yo, listen up! The Spirit is straight up saying that in the future, there will be some people who ditch their faith and start believing in some sketchy stuff, like falling for bad influences and twisted teachings."
1 Timothy,4,2,Spewing fake truths like total posers; their moral compass totally burned out like a superheated iron.
1 Timothy,4,3,"Like, seriously, they're out here trying to say you can't get hitched and telling you to give up on eating certain foods? God totally made those foods for us to enjoy and be grateful for, especially for those who have faith and understand what's really up."
1 Timothy,4,4,"God made every living thing awesome, and nothing should be rejected, as long as you're grateful for it!"
1 Timothy,4,5,Because it's totally blessed when God's word and prayer are all up in it.
1 Timothy,4,6,"If you remind your squad about this stuff, you'll be a dope minister of Jesus Christ, fully fed on faith and solid teachings that you've leveled up on."
1 Timothy,4,7,Just ignore all those lame and superstitious stories and focus more on living a life full of positivity and spiritual growth.
1 Timothy,4,8,"Yo, working out might make you look good, but it's not gonna do much for your soul. Being godly, on the other hand, is beneficial in every way. It promises a fulfilling life now and even in the future. Trust me, it's worth it!"
1 Timothy,4,9,"This is, like, a really legit statement and totally deserves all the acknowledgement."
1 Timothy,4,10,"So basically, we work hard and catch some hate because we have faith in the real deal God, who saves everyone, but especially those who believe in Him."
1 Timothy,4,11,"Like, make sure to pass on these instructions and provide solid guidance for real."
1 Timothy,4,12,"Don't let anyone look down on you because you're young. Show others what it means to be a believer through your words, your actions, your kindness, your attitude, your trust, and your integrity."
1 Timothy,4,13,"Until I show up, focus on reading, motivating others, and learning."
1 Timothy,4,14,"Don't sleep on the special talent you have, fam. It was given to you through a prophetic word and the OG elders laying hands on you. Don't front on it."
1 Timothy,4,15,"Reflect on these things, go all in on them, so that your growth can be noticed by everyone. {or, in everything}"
1 Timothy,4,16,"Yo, make sure you stay on top of your own game and the teachings, like keep going with them, you feel? 'Cause when you do that, you're not just helping yourself, but also the people who listen to you."
1 Timothy,5,1,"Don't diss on someone older, but treat them with respect like a dad; and the younger dudes, treat them like your bros;"
1 Timothy,5,2,"Treat older ladies like your moms; treat younger ones like your sisters, keeping it totally pure."
1 Timothy,5,3,"Respect authentic widowed ladies, for real."
1 Timothy,5,4,"But if any widow has kids or siblings, they should learn to show respect and repay their parents first at home. 'Cause that's hella good and totally cool in God's eyes. {respect: also known as kindness}"
1 Timothy,5,5,The real widow who's feeling alone puts her trust in God and keeps praying and asking Him for help all day and night.
1 Timothy,5,6,"But someone who's all about living the good life is actually missing out on truly living. {in...: or, being all about the finer things in life}"
1 Timothy,5,7,"And like, just make sure you do all these things without messing up, so that no one can like, find any fault in you."
1 Timothy,5,8,"But if someone doesn't take care of their own fam, especially those in their own crib, they straight up deny the faith and are way worse than someone who doesn't believe. {house: or, fam}"
1 Timothy,5,9,"Don't include a widow who's younger than sixty, and who's only been married once, in your group."
1 Timothy,5,10,"She's known for being a total rockstar in doing good things like raising kids, hosting strangers, washing the feet of the holy peeps, helping out those who are suffering, and straight up slaying every good deed without hesitation."
1 Timothy,5,11,"But, like, younger widows? Nah, they gotta chill. 'Cause if they start getting all flirty and stuff, going against Christ and all, they're just gonna end up getting hitched again, you know?"
1 Timothy,5,12,"They're in deep trouble, because they totally ditched their original belief."
1 Timothy,5,13,"And like, they're always chilling and stuff, going from one place to another without doing anything productive. And not only that, but they're also always gossiping and getting into other people's business, saying things they really shouldn't."
1 Timothy,5,14,"So, like, I think it's best if the younger ladies get married, have kids, take charge of the home, and don't give the haters any reason to trash-talk. You know, we gotta keep those negative vibes away!"
1 Timothy,5,15,"Because there are some who've already fallen for Satan's tricks, man."
1 Timothy,5,16,"If any dude or chick who believes got some widowed homies, they gotta hook them up and not put the church on the spot. This way, the true widows can get the support they need."
1 Timothy,5,17,"Respect the experienced leaders who handle their responsibilities with skill, showing them double appreciation, especially those who work hard to convey meaningful teachings."
1 Timothy,5,18,"Like, the scripture says, don't stop the ox from enjoying the corn it's helping tread out. And, the hardworking dude totally deserves his reward. So legit."
1 Timothy,5,19,"Don't just accuse an older person without proof, but make sure there are at least two or three witnesses to support your claim."
1 Timothy,5,20,Call out those who mess up publicly so that others can learn from their mistakes and think twice.
1 Timothy,5,21,"Yo, listen up! I'm giving you a serious heads up in front of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, and all the cool angels out there. You gotta pay attention to what I'm about to say and make sure you don't show any favoritism or bias. Zip, zero, nothin'! Treat everyone equally, straight up!"
1 Timothy,5,22,"Don't go all handsy on someone out of nowhere, and don't get caught up in other people's bad deeds. Stay on your own lane and keep yourself pure."
1 Timothy,5,23,"Dude, don't just chug water all the time, but have a sip of wine for your stomach issues and frequent ailments."
1 Timothy,5,24,"So, like, some people's sins are all out in the open, like, before they even face judgment, and for others, they catch up later."
1 Timothy,5,25,"Similarly, some people's awesome deeds are obvious ahead of time, and those who do the opposite can't go unnoticed."
1 Timothy,6,1,"Yo, all you peeps who be servin' under the authority of someone else, show mad respect to your bosses. When you do that, it keeps God's name and teachings from gettin' dissed, yo."
1 Timothy,6,2,"If you've got bosses who believe in something, don't disrespect them just because you're all part of the same crew. Show them some love and help them out, because they're loyal and cherished, and we're all in this together. Spread this message and give 'em some encouragement."
1 Timothy,6,3,"If anyone teaches differently and doesn't agree with uplifting words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teachings that promote goodness,"
1 Timothy,6,4,"He's all like, super arrogant but doesn't actually know anything. He's just obsessed with pointless debates and arguing over words. And guess what? That kind of attitude brings out envy, conflicts, insulting others, and spreading false accusations. Honestly, what a fool!"
1 Timothy,6,5,"Stay away from people who constantly argue and have corrupt minds, thinking that success equals godliness. They have no understanding of the truth. Avoid them at all costs!"
1 Timothy,6,6,Being godly and satisfied is a major win.
1 Timothy,6,7,"Like, just so you know, when we were born into this world, we didn't bring anything with us, and we're totally not gonna be able to take anything with us when we dip from this place."
1 Timothy,6,8,"As long as we have grub and drip, let's be cool with it."
1 Timothy,6,9,"But if you're all about chasing after that wealth, watch out! It's a trap that leads straight into trouble. You'll be sucked into all sorts of dumb desires that just end up wrecking you and everyone else around you."
1 Timothy,6,10,"Listen up, guys! Being obsessed with cash is a major problem because it leads to all sorts of wickedness. Some people can't resist lusting after it, and as a result, they lose their way and end up causing themselves heaps of pain. Stay woke, y'all! Don't get seduced by the love of money."
1 Timothy,6,11,"Yo, dude of God, ditch this stuff and start chasing righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness."
1 Timothy,6,12,"Keep grinding for your faith, grab onto that eternal life you were meant for, the one you've already shouted out to the world about in a big way."
1 Timothy,6,13,"Yo, listen up! I'm telling you, straight from God, the one who can bring life to everything, and in front of Jesus Christ, who stood strong and made a good confession to Pontius Pilate. (I'm talking about a profession of faith here, you know?)"
1 Timothy,6,14,"So, like, make sure you stay totally cool with following this commandment, you know? No mess-ups or drama allowed, until our main man, Jesus Christ, shows up in all his glory."
1 Timothy,6,15,"When the time comes, he will reveal himself as the all-powerful boss - the ultimate King of kings and Lord of lords, yo!"
1 Timothy,6,16,"The one who never dies, chilling in the super bright place that nobody can even get close to; nobody has ever seen or can see that dude. He deserves all the honor and power forever. Amen."
1 Timothy,6,17,"Tell those rich people out there not to get all arrogant and put their trust in their fancy wealth, but instead, they should put their faith in God, the one who gives us everything we need to enjoy life to the fullest. Don't rely on that uncertain money stuff, ya know?"
1 Timothy,6,18,"It's all about doing good, stacking up those good deeds, being generous with what you've got, and being open to sharing with others; #spreadthelove"
1 Timothy,6,19,"Investing in themselves for a solid future, so they can secure eternal life."
1 Timothy,6,20,"Yo, Timothy, hold on tight to what's been entrusted to you, and stay away from all those empty and disrespectful chats that just lead nowhere. Don't get caught up in those pointless arguments that falsely claim to be all about knowledge and science knowledgee in the original Greek)."
1 Timothy,6,21,"Some people, who claim to follow the faith, have gone astray. May grace be with you. Amen. ¬´{This letter to Timothy was written from Laodicea, the most important city in Phrygia Pacatiana.}¬ª"
2 Timothy,1,1,"Yo, it's Paul, an apostle chosen by God himself, spreading the good news about the lit life promised by Jesus Christ."
2 Timothy,1,2,"Hey Timothy, my homie! I'm sending you some major blessings - grace, mercy, and peace straight from God the Father and Christ Jesus, our main dude!"
2 Timothy,1,3,"I wanna give props to God, who I've been loyal to since my peeps way back, no cap. I gotta say, I always remember to mention you in my prayers, 24/7, non-stop."
2 Timothy,1,4,"Really wanting to hang out with you, thinking about how you were crying, so that I can be super happy; {Really...: or, remembering how you were crying, I really want to hang out with you and see you}"
2 Timothy,1,5,"Yo, when I think about that real faith you got going on, shoutout to your grandma Lois and your mom Eunice for passing it down to you. And let me tell you, I'm hella convinced that you got it too."
2 Timothy,1,6,"Yo, just a reminder to get your game on and unleash the awesome gift from God that's in ya, all 'cause I blessed ya with my touch."
2 Timothy,1,7,"God didn't give us the fear vibes, but the power, love, and a chill mindset."
2 Timothy,1,8,"So, like, don't be embarrassed about spreading the word of our Lord, or about me being locked up for him. Instead, embrace the struggles that come with sharing the good news, and rely on God's power to get you through it all."
2 Timothy,1,9,"Yo, the one who's been our savior and hit us up with a holy purpose, it ain't 'cause of our own good deeds, but because of his own divine plan and grace, which he hooked us up with in Christ Jesus way before everything kicked off,"
2 Timothy,1,10,"But now it's all out in the open, thanks to our main guy Jesus Christ. He totally got rid of death and brought life and immortality into the spotlight through the gospel."
2 Timothy,1,11,"So, like, I've got this legit calling, you know? I'm here to preach, spread the word, be an apostle, and teach the non-Jews. It's my thing, man."
2 Timothy,1,12,"Because of this, I'm going through these tough times too. But I'm not embarrassed or anything, 'cause I know the person I believe in and I'm convinced that they can protect what I've entrusted to them until the very end. (Believed can also mean trusted, just so you know.)"
2 Timothy,1,13,"Keep embracing the essence of wholesome words that you've learned from me, with a solid foundation of faith and love found in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,1,14,"Hold on tight to that awesome responsibility entrusted to you, guided by the Holy Ghost who resides within us."
2 Timothy,1,15,"You're probably aware that pretty much everyone in Asia has abandoned me, including Phygellus and Hermogenes."
2 Timothy,1,16,"Yo, the Lord bless the crib of Onesiphorus; 'cause he always had my back, even when I was locked up, and never felt embarrassed about it:"
2 Timothy,1,17,"So, like, when he was in Rome, he, like, totally made a real effort to find me, and guess what? He totally found me!"
2 Timothy,1,18,"May the Lord bless him with mercy on the day of reckoning for all the countless ways he has supported and served me in Ephesus. You know it like, seriously, so well!"
2 Timothy,2,1,"So, dude, listen up. My bro, you gotta be solid in the mad love and favor that Jesus slings our way."
2 Timothy,2,2,"Pass on what you've learned from me to trustworthy people who can teach others too, with plenty of witnesses around to vouch for it."
2 Timothy,2,3,"So, like, tough it out and stay strong, fam, 'cause you're a legit soldier reppin' Jesus Christ."
2 Timothy,2,4,A soldier who's all caught up in the drama of everyday life can't fully please the one who picked them for the job.
2 Timothy,2,5,"And yo, if a dude be hustlin' for those championships, he ain't gettin' that crown unless he's playin' by the rules, fam."

2 Timothy,2,8,"Don't forget, fam, that Jesus Christ, straight up from David's bloodline, came back to life, no cap, just like how I preach it:"
2 Timothy,2,9,"Yo, I be goin' through some rough times, you feel? People treatin' me like I'm a criminal, lockin' me up and all that. But let me tell you, the word of God ain't never gonna be held back, it's always gonna be free."
2 Timothy,2,10,"So, like, I'll be real patient and power through everything for the chosen ones, so they can also score the ultimate salvation in Jesus Christ, complete with never-ending glory."
2 Timothy,2,11,"This verse is straight facts: If we're willing to go all-in and make sacrifices for {him}, we'll also experience true life alongside {him}. No cap."
2 Timothy,2,12,"If we go through tough times, we'll rise up like champs with Him. But if we turn our backs on Him, He'll do the same to us."
2 Timothy,2,13,"Even if we don't have faith, he's still loyal to himself and can't deny who he is."
2 Timothy,2,14,"Just a reminder, make sure you don't get caught up in useless arguments that don't do any good but instead mess with people's minds. And hey, put this message out there like, in front of the Lord."
2 Timothy,2,15,"Put in the effort to prove yourself worthy in God's eyes, like a pro who doesn't need to feel embarrassed, by correctly understanding and sharing the truth."
2 Timothy,2,16,"Avoid talking about irrelevant and pointless stuff, 'cause it'll only lead to more ungodly behavior."
2 Timothy,2,17,"And their words will spread like a contagious meme: Hymenaeus and Philetus are some of the culprits; dang, did they really start this mess?"
2 Timothy,2,18,"There are some people out there who got it totally wrong about the truth. They're claiming that the resurrection has already happened, like, game over. And because of that, they're really messing up the faith of some peeps."
2 Timothy,2,19,"But God's principles are rock solid, guaranteed with this proof: God recognizes those who belong to him. And so, anyone who claims to follow Christ should steer clear of wrongdoing."
2 Timothy,2,20,"Yo, in a sick crib, there's not just fancy bling made of gold and silver, but also some basic stuff made of wood and earth. And guess what? Some things are meant for flexin' and honor, while others are just straight up trash."
2 Timothy,2,21,"So, like, if a person totally gets rid of all that bad stuff, they'll become this awesome vessel of honor, all purified and ready to be used by the master, you know? And they'll be so prepared to do all kinds of good stuff!"
2 Timothy,2,22,"Ditch those desires that come with being young and restless: instead, embrace doing what's right, having faith, spreading love, and seeking peace alongside those who genuinely pray to the Lord."
2 Timothy,2,23,"Yo, skip the dumb and clueless questions, 'cause you know they only stir up unnecessary drama."
2 Timothy,2,24,"The Lord's servant shouldn't be all about arguments and drama, but should be chill with everyone, good at explaining things, and able to stay cool when things get tough."
2 Timothy,2,25,"In humility, teaching those who are against themselves; if by any chance God will grant them repentance to recognize the truth;"
2 Timothy,2,26,"So that they can escape the trap of the devil, who has captured them and keeps them under control as he pleases. (awake from their slumber) (taken alive)"
2 Timothy,3,1,"Just so you know, as we approach the end times, things are gonna get pretty intense."
2 Timothy,3,2,"In the future, people will be totally self-absorbed, always wanting more, flexing to show off, arrogant, disrespecting all things sacred, rebelling against their parents, unappreciative, and totally uncool."
2 Timothy,3,3,"They're heartless, always breaking promises, spreading lies, lacking self-control, aggressive, and disrespecting the good-hearted ones."
2 Timothy,3,4,"Those who betray, be like all wild and reckless, thinking they're superior to everyone else, and prioritize their own pleasure over their love for the one true higher power;"
2 Timothy,3,5,"They act all righteous, but don't even believe in its power. Avoid people like that."
2 Timothy,3,6,"Because there are people like this who sneak into people's houses and manipulate naive women who are burdened with sin, easily being enticed by various desires."
2 Timothy,3,7,"Always trying to gain knowledge, but never actually understanding the truth."
2 Timothy,3,8,"Like, back in the day, there were these two dudes named Jannes and Jambres who straight up opposed Moses. And in the same way, these people now be fronting against the real deal truth. They got messed up minds and zero understanding when it comes to their faith, dude. #NoJudgment"
2 Timothy,3,9,"But they won't get any further, because their stupidity will become obvious to everyone, just like it did to them."
2 Timothy,3,10,"But you already know everything about my teachings, the way I live, my goals, my faith, my ability to endure and show love, and my patience."
2 Timothy,3,11,"So, like, I faced some major hate, troubles, you know, all that drama in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, you feel me? It was rough, bro, but listen, God had my back and totally saved me from all that mess."
2 Timothy,3,12,"Yeah, like, all the peeps who wanna live a righteous life and follow Jesus, they're gonna face some tough times and haters."
2 Timothy,3,13,"But, like, these wicked dudes and smooth talkers are gonna keep getting worse and worse, totally deceiving others while being deceived themselves."
2 Timothy,3,14,"Just keep doing what you've been learning and believing in, knowing who taught you!"
2 Timothy,3,15,"And since you were just a kid, you've been exposed to the sacred texts that can help you gain wisdom and find salvation through your trust in Jesus Christ."
2 Timothy,3,16,"Yo, listen up! The whole Scripture was inspired by God, and it's like hella useful for teaching, calling out the BS, correcting mistakes, and teaching us how to do right. Trust, it's legit."

2 Timothy,4,3,"There will be a time when people won't be able to handle the truth; instead, they'll go after whatever tickles their fancy and surround themselves with teachers who tell them what they want to hear."
2 Timothy,4,4,And they'll totally tune out the truth and start obsessing over made-up stories.
2 Timothy,4,5,"Just stay on top of things, stay strong through tough times, spread the good word like an influencer, and prove yourself fully committed to your mission."
2 Timothy,4,6,"Yo, I'm all geared up to bounce, and it looks like the time has come for me to dip."
2 Timothy,4,7,"Yo, I've totally slayed the battle, completed my epic quest, and stayed faithful, no doubt:"
2 Timothy,4,8,"I'm super hyped because I know there's this epic reward waiting for me in the future‚Äîlike a lit crown of righteousness. The Lord, the totally fair judge, is gonna hook me up on that day. And get this, it's not just for me, but for all those who are legit stoked about seeing Him too."
2 Timothy,4,9,"Make sure you come chill with me real soon, okay?"
2 Timothy,4,10,"So, Demas bailed on me, totally into this world and jetted off to Thessalonica. Crescens is hitting up Galatia, and Titus is chilling in Dalmatia."
2 Timothy,4,11,"I'm here chillin' with Luke, but yo, bring Mark along too 'cause he's straight fire when it comes to helping me out in the ministry."
2 Timothy,4,12,"And BTW, I've sent Tychicus to Ephesus."
2 Timothy,4,13,"Yo, bring that jacket I left at Troas with Carpus when you come through, and also don't forget the books, but most importantly, grab those parchments too, fam."
2 Timothy,4,14,"Yo, this dude Alexander, the coppersmith? Man, he did me so dirty. But you know what? The big man upstairs, He gonna handle him. He gonna get what's coming to him for all the messed up things he's done. Karma's a real thing, my friend."
2 Timothy,4,15,"You've gotta watch out for that person too, they've seriously been opposing everything we've been saying. #Can'tLetTheHatersBringUsDown"
2 Timothy,4,16,"When I first faced trouble, no one was there to support me. Everyone deserted me. I really hope that God doesn't hold it against them."
2 Timothy,4,17,"But yo, the Lord had my back and gave me mad strength, so that I could spread the word far and wide, and all the non-Jewish homies could hear it too. No cap, I straight up got saved from some wild danger!"
2 Timothy,4,18,"And God will save me from all the bad things, and will keep me safe until I get to heaven: and we should give glory to God forever and ever. Amen."
2 Timothy,4,19,"Hey, shoutout to Prisca, Aquila, and the fam of Onesiphorus!"
2 Timothy,4,20,"Erastus stayed in Corinth, but I had to leave Trophimus in Miletum 'cause he wasn't feeling well."
2 Timothy,4,21,"Make sure you make it here before winter, alright? Eubulus sends his greetings, along with Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the squad."
2 Timothy,4,22,"May Jesus be with you and bless you. Amen. This is the second letter to Timothy, who was made the top leader of the church in Ephesus. It was written from Rome when Paul had to face Nero again."
Titus,1,1,"Yo, it's Paul, just doing my thing as a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I'm all about repping God's chosen crew and spreading the real deal, which is all about living that godly life, you know?"
Titus,1,2,"Yo, we're all about that eternal life, which God, who's totally reliable, promised way back before the world even started; like, for real though!"
Titus,1,3,"But like, God totally revealed his message at the right time through preaching, and I've totally been entrusted with spreading it according to God our Savior's commandment!"
Titus,1,4,"Hey Titus, my guy! You're like my own son in this cool faith we share. Wishing you mad grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and our Savior, Jesus Christ."
Titus,1,5,"So, like, I left you in Crete for a reason. It's up to you to organize and fix the stuff that still needs to be done. Oh, and don't forget to choose leaders in every city, just like I told you to! üôåüèº"
Titus,1,6,"If anyone wants to be accepted, they gotta be loyal to their bae, have just one ride-or-die partner, and their kids should be chill, not causing chaos or acting out."
Titus,1,7,"A bishop has to be legit righteous, like they're the boss of God's stuff. They can't be stubborn, quick-tempered, or always hitting the bottle. No fighting and definitely no being greedy for that cash."
Titus,1,8,"But someone who's all about being open and welcoming, hanging out with cool people, keeping it chill, treating everyone fairly, staying true to their values and having self-control; {people: or, stuff}"
Titus,1,9,"Keeping it real and staying true to the teachings, so that he can drop some knowledge and shut down all those haters with some solid wisdom. {as...: or, when teaching}"
Titus,1,10,"Yo, there are a bunch of people out there who are all talk and no action, always trying to deceive others, especially those who stick to tradition and strict rules:"
Titus,1,11,"Like, those people need to be silenced, seriously. They're like ruining entire communities by teaching all this messed up stuff just so they can make some quick cash, how low can you get?"
Titus,1,12,"Yo, one of their own, a straight-up prophet from their tribe, once said this about the Cretians: 'These peeps are constantly spewing lies, acting all savage, and straight-up lazy when it comes to grub.'"
Titus,1,13,"Facts, fam. So don't hesitate to call them out, straight up, so they can level up their faith game, ya know?"
Titus,1,14,Don't waste your time on those made-up stories and rules made by others that lead you away from what's real and true.
Titus,1,15,"Just so you know, to those who keep it real, everything is all good. But to those who are out of touch and skeptical, nothing is cool; in fact, even their thoughts and conscience are all messed up."
Titus,1,16,"So like, they're all about talking about how they know God, but their actions don't match up, you know? Like, they're acting all gross and disobedient, and they're like a total fail when it comes to doing anything good. No judgment skills whatsoever."
Titus,2,1,"But like, make sure what you say lines up with solid teachings, ya know?"

Titus,3,1,"Just a friendly reminder to respect authority figures, follow the rules, and be open to doing good things."
Titus,3,2,"Don't trash talk anyone, avoid being a drama queen, and always be kind and humble to everyone."
Titus,3,3,"Yo, we used to do some stupid stuff, not following the rules, getting tricked, doing whatever we wanted to fulfill our desires and seeking pleasure, living in a bad way full of hate and jealousy, being all mean and hating on each other."
Titus,3,4,"But then God, our Savior, showed us His mad kindness and love for us humans. It was like pure fire, man. {love: or, pity}"
Titus,3,5,"We didn't earn our salvation by being all righteous and stuff, but it's all thanks to God's mercy. He saved us by giving us a fresh start and renewing our spirit with the Holy Ghost."

Titus,3,7,"By his grace, we've been made legit and now we're set up to inherit the promise of eternal life."
Titus,3,8,"Yo, listen up! This be a real deal truth talk, fam. I'm straight up telling ya to keep preaching this stuff and make sure you and your crew stay committed to doing good stuff. 'Cause trust me, it's not just some basic thing - it's actually super dope and beneficial for everyone involved."
Titus,3,9,"Don't waste your time on dumb questions, family trees, arguments, or debates about the law, 'cause they're totally pointless and useless."
Titus,3,10,"If someone keeps spreading false beliefs even after being warned twice, don't give them any attention anymore."
Titus,3,11,"Like, anyone who acts like that is totally messed up, and they're sinning big time. They're just condemning themselves, you know?"
Titus,3,12,"Hey, when I send Artemas or Tychicus your way, make sure you come visit me in Nicopolis ASAP. I've planned to hang out there for winter, you know."
Titus,3,13,"Make sure to hook Zenas, the legal genius, and Apollos up with a solid ride, so they have everything they need for their trip."
Titus,3,14,"And we should all learn to do good things for important reasons, so that we don't end up being unproductive. (or, be skilled in honest jobs)"
Titus,3,15,"Yo, everyone rollin' with me sends their regards. Say what up to those homies who show us love and faith. May grace be with all y'all. Amen. 'This letter was written to Titus, who was chosen as the top dog bishop of the Cretians, yo. It's from Nicopolis of Macedonia, in case you were wonderin'.'"
Philemon,1,1,"Yo, it's Paul, locked up for Jesus Christ, and my bro Timothy, hittin' up Philemon, our beloved partner in crime,"

Philemon,1,3,"Yo, sending you mad grace and peace vibes from God our Father and the one and only Lord Jesus Christ."
Philemon,1,4,"Yo, shoutout to my God, I always bringin' you up in my prayers."
Philemon,1,5,"Yo, I heard about your mad love and faith for the Lord Jesus and all the homies in the faith squad;"
Philemon,1,6,"So that when you share your faith, it'll have a real impact by recognizing all the awesome things inside you because of Jesus."
Philemon,1,7,"Dude, we're totally stoked and comforted by your love, 'cause you've been showing mad love and support to the squad, bro."
Philemon,1,8,"So, even though I could totally flex in Christ and tell you what's right,"

Philemon,1,10,"Yo, listen up! I'm seriously asking you for a huge favor regarding my dude Onesimus, who's like my own son. I actually brought him up while I was locked up, so you know he's important to me."
Philemon,1,11,"Back in the day, it was worthless to you, but now it's actually beneficial for both of us:"
Philemon,1,12,"Yo, I'm sending him back, so you better welcome him like he's my fam,"
Philemon,1,13,"I wanted to keep you by my side, so that instead of you, he could've helped me spread the message of the gospel:"
Philemon,1,14,"But I wouldn't do anything without your consent; I want your help to be genuine, not forced."
Philemon,1,15,"Maybe he dipped out for a bit so you could have him for good, ya know?"
Philemon,1,16,"Right now, I don't see you as just a servant, but more like a super cool bro who I really care about. And guess what? You're even more important to me than that! We're totally tight, both in the physical world and in our spiritual connection with the Lord."
Philemon,1,17,"Yo, if you consider me as your homie, then treat my boy like you would treat me fam."
Philemon,1,18,"If he's done you dirty, or owes you anything, charge it to my account fam;"
Philemon,1,19,"Yo, it's your boy Paul writing this letter with my own hand. Just want you to know that I got you covered and I'll pay you back, no doubt. But, I'm not trying to flex or anything, but you do owe me big time. Like, you owe me your whole self, bro."
Philemon,1,20,"Hey, bro, I would be so stoked if you brought me joy in the Lord: uplift my spirit in the Lord."
Philemon,1,21,"I'm hella confident that you'll do even more than what I tell you, so I hit you up with this message."

Hebrews,1,1,"Yo, so back in the day, God used to talk to our ancestors through prophets and stuff, you know, in different ways and at different times."
Hebrews,1,2,"Basically, God has recently been speaking to us through his Son. He's like the rightful owner of everything and he's the one who created everything too."
Hebrews,1,3,"So, like, this person is basically the epic representation of God's awesomeness. They legit hold everything together with their powerful words. And get this, they wiped out all our sins all on their own, and now they're chilling in the VIP section next to the Most High."
Hebrews,1,4,"He's, like, way cooler than the angels 'cause he totally inherited a way better name than them."
Hebrews,1,5,"Yo, God never said to any of the angels like, 'Hey bro, you're my Son and I've begotten you today'. And also, He straight up said, 'I'm gonna be a Father to Him and He's gonna be my Son'."
Hebrews,1,6,"And once again, when he introduces his firstborn into the world, he says, 'Let all the angel squad show some respect and worship him.'"
Hebrews,1,7,"God be like, 'Angels, they're all about those good vibes and fiery passion. They're pure spirits, serving up heat and intensity, just like flames on fire. üî•'"
Hebrews,1,8,"But to the Son, it's like, 'Your throne, O God, is gonna be there forever and ever: a righteous rule is what's gonna go down in your kingdom. Righteousnesss means being all straight and right.)'"
Hebrews,1,9,"You totally rock righteousness and despise all the bad stuff. That's why God, your personal God, has crowned you with the happiest vibes, more than any of your crew."
Hebrews,1,10,"And yo, Lord, from the get-go, you totally set up the whole earth, and the skies are totally your masterpiece, man:"
Hebrews,1,11,"They're gonna fade away, but you're gonna stay strong. They're all gonna get old like an out-of-style outfit."
Hebrews,1,12,"You're gonna wrap those up like a cool outfit, and they're gonna go through some changes, but you, my friend, will always stay the same and never run out of time."
Hebrews,1,13,"Yo, fam, God never once said to any angel, 'Chillax on my right side until I crush all your haters under your feet.'"
Hebrews,1,14,"Bruh, like, aren't they all, like, these cool spirit angels that, you know, got sent to help out those who are gonna inherit salvation?"
Hebrews,2,1,"So, like, we really gotta pay super close attention to the stuff we've been told, you know? 'Cause otherwise, there's a chance it might just slip right through our fingers. (Think of it like those leaky water bottles, y'know?)"
Hebrews,2,2,"Like, if what the angels said was totally legit, and every act of going against that and not following their instructions got what they deserved in return;"
Hebrews,2,3,"Yo, if we straight up ignore this amazing salvation, how are we supposed to bounce back? It all started when the Lord started preaching it, and then homies who heard him confirmed it for us, ya know?"
Hebrews,2,4,"Did God like totally showed off, like with signs, miracles, and lit gifts from the Holy Ghost, because that's just how he rolls? #blessed #accordingtoHiswill #divergifts"
Hebrews,2,5,He hasn't made angels in charge of the future world we're talking about.
Hebrews,2,6,"But there was this one person who said, like, why do You even care about us humans? Like, what makes us so special that You would come visit us?"
Hebrews,2,7,"You made him slightly less powerful than the angels; you gave him honor and glory, and made him in charge of everything you created."
Hebrews,2,8,"You made everything subject to him, like totally under his control. Like, seriously, there's nothing that isn't under him. But, it's like, right now we can't see everything being under him yet."
Hebrews,2,9,"But check it, we peep Jesus, who was flexin' a bit lower than the angels to go through that pain of death, but then dude got crowned with mad glory and honor. It's like, God's grace hooked him up so he could actually experience death for every single person. {for the: or, by the}"
Hebrews,2,10,"It's just, like, totally perfect for the one who made everything and controls everything to make the ultimate leader of our salvation super flawless by going through tough times and all."
Hebrews,2,11,The one who makes things holy and the ones who are made holy are all connected as one fam. That's why he ain't embarrassed to call them his bros and sistas.
Hebrews,2,12,"I'm gonna shout out your name to my squad, and when we all hang out, I'll serenade you with mad love and props!"
Hebrews,2,13,"And once again, I'm gonna have faith in him. And again, check it out, me and the squad that God has blessed me with."
Hebrews,2,14,"So, like, since us kids are all human and stuff, Jesus, like, totally became human too, ya know? He did it so that, by dying, he could totally wreck the dude who had the power over death, AKA the devil."
Hebrews,2,15,And rescue those who were trapped in a lifetime of bondage due to the fear of death.
Hebrews,2,16,"Like, for real, he didn't become an angel or anything; instead, he became one of Abraham's descendants. It's not like he chose to stick with angels, but he actually chose to be connected with Abraham's fam."
Hebrews,2,17,"So, like, it was super important for him to be, like, just like his peeps, so he could be this compassionate and loyal high priest for all things related to God, ya know? His main gig was to make things right with the people's sins and stuff."
Hebrews,2,18,"Because he himself has gone through temptation and suffering, he's totally equipped to help out those who are going through the same."
Hebrews,3,1,"Yo, fam, listen up. So, like, you're all blessed and stuff, in on this heavenly mission, right? Well, make sure you give mad props to Jesus, the ultimate boss who's both an Apostle and a High Priest for us all. He's legit!"
Hebrews,3,2,"He stayed loyal to the one who chose him, just like Moses was also faithful in everything he did for God's people."
Hebrews,3,3,This guy deserves way more clout than Moses because the one who built the house is always more important than the house itself.
Hebrews,3,4,"Like, every crib is made by someone, but the one who built everything is God, you know."
Hebrews,3,5,"And Moses was totally loyal in everything he did, like a servant, as a proof of the stuff that was gonna be said later;"
Hebrews,3,6,"So, like Christ is totally in charge of his own crib, and we're a part of his crew if we stay solid in our confidence and stay hyped about that hope until the very end."
Hebrews,3,7,"Yo, listen up! The Holy Ghost be like, if you're down to hear His voice today,"
Hebrews,3,8,"Don't be closed-minded, like those who acted defiantly, when faced with challenges in the wilderness:"
Hebrews,3,9,"When your parents tested me, challenged me, and witnessed my miracles for a whole forty years."
Hebrews,3,10,"I was so bummed out by that generation, like seriously, they were always messing up and not getting what I'm all about."
Hebrews,3,11,"So I promise, in my anger, they won't be able to chill with me in my peaceful place. (If they try, they won't make it)"
Hebrews,3,12,"Yo, listen up, fam. Don't let it go unnoticed, my squad. None of y'all should let a wicked mind of disbelief creep in and separate you from the almighty God."
Hebrews,3,13,"Yo, like, make sure you're always encouraging each other, ya know? Don't wait 'til tomorrow, do it today! 'Cause sin can totally mess you up if you're not careful."
Hebrews,3,14,"Like, if we stay totally loyal to Jesus from the start to the finish, we'll totally be part of His crew, too!"
Hebrews,3,15,"So like, people say, if you hear his voice today, don't be all closed off and stubborn like back in the day when everyone was rebelling."
Hebrews,3,16,"Like, there were some people who straight up got triggered when they heard it, you know? But not everyone who left Egypt with Moses."
Hebrews,3,17,But who was he really mad at for forty years? Wasn't it those dudes who messed up and ended up biting the dust in the middle of nowhere?
Hebrews,3,18,"And who did he promise that they wouldn't enter his chill zone, except those who didn't have faith?"
Hebrews,3,19,"So basically, they couldn't get in because they just didn't believe enough."
Hebrews,4,1,"So, like, we better be careful not to miss out on this promised rest opportunity, ya know? We don't wanna be the ones who fall short, you feel me?"
Hebrews,4,2,"So, like, the good news was shared with us, just like it was with them. But, the thing is, it didn't really benefit them because they didn't have faith in what they heard, you know? It's like they couldn't connect with it on a deeper level because they weren't believing in it."
Hebrews,4,3,"Yo, us who have believed, we get to chill and find peace, just like he said, you know, when he was all like, 'I swear, if they try to enter my chill zone, they ain't gonna make it!' But hey, let's not forget, the works were done way back since the beginning of time."
Hebrews,4,4,"So, like, there's this part in the Bible where it talks about how God took a break on the seventh day after doing everything, you know? He just needed some chill time, man. No more work for Him."
Hebrews,4,5,"And, like, once again in this, it's like if they try to enter my chill zone."
Hebrews,4,6,"So, like, there are still some peeps who gotta go in there, but the OG peeps who first heard about it didn't go in 'cause they didn't believe, ya know? Like, the gospel and stuff."
Hebrews,4,7,"Once again, he's like, setting a specific day and everything. And he's all like, quoting David and stuff, saying, 'Yo, today is the day! After such a long time, you guys gotta listen up and not let your hearts get all cold and closed off.'"
Hebrews,4,8,"Like, if Jesus had already given them a break, then he wouldn't have been like 'yo, there's another day coming up, guys'. (btw, Jesus means Joshua, just so you know)"
Hebrews,4,9,"So, like, God still has this awesome chill time planned for His squad, ya know? It's all about taking a break and vibing with Him. #SabbathGoals"
Hebrews,4,10,"Once you're in chill mode, you're totally done with your own hustle, just like God took a break from his grind."
Hebrews,4,11,"So, like, we should totally hustle to get into that chill zone, or else we might end up like those dudes who didn't believe. {unbelief: or, disobedience}"
Hebrews,4,12,"Yo, the word of God is straight fire! It's got that power and cuts through anything like a double-edged sword. It can even split apart your soul and spirit, and your bones and marrow. Plus, it knows what's up in your thoughts and heart. No joke!"
Hebrews,4,13,"There's literally no being that can hide from him, like, seriously! He sees everything, and I mean everything. It's like everything's laid out with zero filter for him to see. And like, he's the one we gotta deal with, you feel me?"
Hebrews,4,14,"So, like, we've got this totally awesome high priest, Jesus, who's like, already up in the heavens and everything since he's the Son of God. So, let's, like, hold onto our faith and keep professing it, you know what I mean?"
Hebrews,4,15,"We've got a super relatable high priest who totally gets us and our struggles, because he's been through it all too - like seriously, every single temptation - but he never ever sinned."
Hebrews,4,16,"So, like, let's totally approach the throne of grace with confidence, you know? That's where we can score some serious mercy and find grace to help us out when we're in a tough spot."
Hebrews,5,1,"Like, every high priest that's chosen from the peeps is there for the people, ya know? They're all about doing their thing for God and all, offering gifts and sacrifices to make up for sins and stuff, you feel me?"
Hebrews,5,2,"Who can understand and empathize with those who lack knowledge and wander astray, because they too have their own struggles and flaws."
Hebrews,5,3,"And because of this, he should offer sacrifices not only for the people but also for himself, to atone for sins."
Hebrews,5,4,"No one just decides they're worthy of this honor on their own, it's only for those chosen by God, like Aaron was."
Hebrews,5,5,"Yo, Christ didn't flex to become a high priest on His own. It was the one who said to Him, 'You're my Son, I've brought you into this world today.'"
Hebrews,5,6,"Like, he also says in another passage, You're like a forever priest, just like Melchisedec, you know?"
Hebrews,5,7,"Back in the day when Jesus was a human, he was all about that prayer and supplication game. He cried out real loud and shed some legit tears to God, the ultimate savior, who actually heard him because he had deep respect and fear. Like, for real."
Hebrews,5,8,"Even though he was totally the Son, he actually learned how to obey by going through some really tough stuff;"
Hebrews,5,9,"And once he achieved peak awesomeness, he totally became the ultimate boss of eternal salvation for all those who totally follow him;"
Hebrews,5,10,"Like, chosen by God to be a super legit high priest, just like Melchisedec and stuff."
Hebrews,5,11,"There's a lot we could say about this, but it's kinda hard to explain 'cause y'all seem to have trouble paying attention."
Hebrews,5,12,"So, like, yeah, at this point you should already be experts, but you still need someone to re-teach you the basics of God's teachings. It's like you're still babies in the faith, only able to handle milk and not solid food."
Hebrews,5,13,"If you're still on that milk, you're like a total newbie when it comes to understanding righteousness. You're basically a baby, lacking experience and all that. #NoobLife"
Hebrews,5,14,"But, like, the deep stuff is for those who are mature enough to handle it, ya know? It's for those who have practiced and honed their senses to distinguish what's right and what's wrong."
Hebrews,6,1,"So, like, let's level up and move on from the basic teachings of Jesus, without going back and repeating stuff like repenting from useless actions and having faith in God."
Hebrews,6,2,"Regarding the teachings about baptisms, the power of touch, the revival of the deceased, and the never-ending evaluation."
Hebrews,6,3,"And we'll totally go for it, if God gives us the green light."
Hebrews,6,4,"Like, you know, it's totally impossible for those who were once all like, super enlightened and have gotten a taste of that divine gift and like, experienced the Holy Ghost, ya know?"
Hebrews,6,5,"And we've actually experienced the dope message of God and the super cool things that are gonna happen in the future,"
Hebrews,6,6,"If they mess up and turn away, it's hard to bring them back to change their ways again because it's like they're crucifying Jesus all over again and making a big embarrassment out of it."
Hebrews,6,7,"Like, the earth totally soaks up all the rain that falls on it, you know, all the time, and as a result, it produces like, the dopest plants that are totally useful for the peeps who take care of it. And because of this, it totally receives blessings from God, ya know? #blessed"
Hebrews,6,8,"But anything that's full of negativity and toxic vibes gets left behind and is basically toast; it's just asking for trouble, destined to be burned."
Hebrews,6,9,"Yo fam, listen up! We truly believe in you and expect great things that come with salvation, even though we're talking like this."
Hebrews,6,10,"God isn't unfair or anything, He doesn't forget the hard work and love you've shown in His name by helping out the saints, both now and in the past."
Hebrews,6,11,And we want each and every one of you to put in the same effort to be totally confident in your hopes until the very end:
Hebrews,6,12,"Don't be lazy, but be like the squad who, by having faith and staying patient, cash in on those promises."
Hebrews,6,13,"So, like, when God made a promise to Abraham, there wasn't anyone or anything greater for Him to swear by, so He was like, 'I swear, man, I'm staking everything I got on this promise!'"
Hebrews,6,14,"Like, I promise you, you're gonna be blessed AF and your blessings are gonna multiply like crazy. No cap, fam."
Hebrews,6,15,"And like, after he, like, totally kept his chill and didn't give up or anything, he, like, totally got what he was promised, you know?"
Hebrews,6,16,"Dude, like seriously, when guys swear on something super important, it's like the ultimate way to settle any argument."
Hebrews,6,17,"So basically, God really wanted to make it crystal clear to the future inheritors of His promises that His plans are unchanging and reliable. And He went above and beyond by sealing the deal with an oath, just to make sure everyone got the memo. #Trustworthy"
Hebrews,6,18,"So, like, God made some promises that can't change, and, like, He's totally incapable of lying. This brings us so much comfort and hope, especially those of us who have run to Him for safety and grabbed onto the awesome hope He's given us."
Hebrews,6,19,"This hope we've got is like a solid anchor for the soul, totally reliable and unwavering, and it reaches deep into the core of things."
Hebrews,6,20,"Yo, Jesus already went ahead of us and became a forever high priest, just like Melchisedec."
Hebrews,7,1,"So like, this guy Melchisedec, he was the king of Salem and also a priest of the most high God, right? And he totally met Abraham after he had defeated all those kings in battle and gave him his blessings, no cap!"
Hebrews,7,2,"So like, Abraham was all generous, and he gave, like, a tenth of everything he had to this dude, who was, like, known as the King of righteousness. And then later, he was also called the King of Salem, which means the King of peace, you know? Like, this guy was all about being righteous and spreading peace."
Hebrews,7,3,"So like, this priest dude is pretty unique, you know? He's got no parents, no family tree, and no record of his birth or death. But get this: he's totally on the same level as the Son of God. And he's gonna be a priest forever, no breaks."
Hebrews,7,4,"Just think about how awesome this dude was, bro. Even the legendary Abraham himself gave this guy a tenth of the loot, like major respect."
Hebrews,7,5,"And like, those who are from the sons of Levi, who are chosen to be priests, they totally have a job to collect a portion of the people's belongings as tithes, following the law and stuff. It's like, their fellow peeps who are part of Abraham's bloodline and all."
Hebrews,7,6,"But the person who doesn't come from that line received tithes from Abraham and gave him blessings, even though Abraham was the one with the promises. [descent: or, family background]"
Hebrews,7,7,"Like, no cap, the person who's less legit gets the mad blessings from the top-tier one."
Hebrews,7,8,"In this world, people who pass away are given tithes, but in the spiritual realm, there's someone who's known to be alive and accepts them."
Hebrews,7,9,"And like, I gotta mention that Levi, who like gets all the tithes, totally gave tithes to Abraham, you know?"
Hebrews,7,10,Because he was still in his dad's genes when he crossed paths with Melchisedec.
Hebrews,7,11,"So, like, if the whole idea of being perfect relied solely on the Levitical priesthood (you know, the ones who received the law and all), then why would there even be a need for another priest to come along, following the footsteps of Melchisedec instead of Aaron? It's kinda mind-boggling, tbh."
Hebrews,7,12,"So, like, when the whole priest thing gets a major upgrade, it's, like, obvious that there's gotta be some changes in the law and stuff too."
Hebrews,7,13,"This dude they're talking about belongs to a different crew, no one from that gang ever showed up at the altar."
Hebrews,7,14,"It's pretty clear that our Lord came from the tribe of Juda, and when it comes to the priesthood, Moses didn't mention anything about it."
Hebrews,7,15,"And it's even more obvious, 'cause there's another priest who's like Melchisedec, you know?"
Hebrews,7,16,"Someone wasn't made based on a boring set of rules, but on the epic power of a never-ending existence."
Hebrews,7,17,"Because, like, God himself said, 'Yo, you are gonna be a forever priest, you know, in the same cool way that Melchisedec was.'"
Hebrews,7,18,"Like, the previous commandment was legit cancelled because it was weak and useless, no cap."
Hebrews,7,19,"The rules didn't make everything flawless, but this new and improved hope sure did. It's what lets us get closer to God, you know?"
Hebrews,7,20,"And like, totally, he became a priest, but not without a hardcore oath, you know."
Hebrews,7,21,"Like, those priests didn't take an oath, but this one did, and God was like, 'I swear, you're gonna be a priest forever, just like Melchisedec!'"
Hebrews,7,22,"Jesus totally guaranteed a way cooler covenant, like no doubt."
Hebrews,7,23,"Dude, there were like so many priests back then, but only cuz they couldn't keep doing their thing forever 'cause of death, ya know?"
Hebrews,7,24,"But this dude, because he keeps going strong, has a totally steady priesthood. Like, it's not passing from one person to another or anything."
Hebrews,7,25,"So, like, he can totally save all those who go to God through him, because he's always there to make things right for them, you know? He's always there, making requests on their behalf and stuff. {to the...: or, evermore}"
Hebrews,7,26,"This high priest is, like, totally perfect for us. He's all pure, innocent, totally clean, and totally not involved with sinners. He's even like, on a whole other level than the heavens!"
Hebrews,7,27,"Unlike those high priests who had to offer sacrifices every day for their own sins and for the people's, Jesus only had to do it once, when he offered himself."
Hebrews,7,28,"So, like, the law makes these high priests who are, like, total humans with their imperfections and stuff. But the word of the promise, which was, like, made after the law, makes the Son, who's like, forever perfect and consecrated and all that. (consecrated: from Greek meaning perfected)"
Hebrews,8,1,"So basically, to sum up everything we've been talking about, we've got this awesome high priest, chilling on the right side of the throne of the Almighty up in the heavens."
Hebrews,8,2,"A TikToker of the holy vibes, and of the legit hangout spot, which God set up, not us. {of holy things: or, of sacred stuff}"
Hebrews,8,3,"Every high priest has been chosen to give gifts and make sacrifices. So, it's only logical that this guy has something to offer too."
Hebrews,8,4,"Like, if he was on earth, he wouldn't even be a priest, because there are already priests who follow the law by offering gifts and stuff, you know? Like, they got it covered."
Hebrews,8,5,"Those who act as a representation and symbol of heavenly things, like Moses was instructed by God when he was about to construct the tabernacle, saying, 'Make sure you follow the design that was shown to you on the mountain.'"
Hebrews,8,6,"But yo, he's got this like super dope ministry now, cuz he's the one who mediates this way better covenant, which is based on way better promises yo. {covenant: or, testament}"
Hebrews,8,7,"Like, if that first covenant was flawless, then there would be no need for a second one, ya know?"
Hebrews,8,8,"So, like, God wasn't really happy with them, you know. But He's all like, 'Yo, peeps, listen up! There's gonna be some changes around here,' says the Lord. 'I'm gonna hook up a new deal, a fresh new covenant, with the fam of Israel and Judah, so get ready!'"
Hebrews,8,9,"Not gonna lie, the deal I made with their ancestors back in the day when I helped them escape from Egypt didn't really pan out. They totally failed at keeping their end of the bargain, and tbh, I kinda stopped caring about 'em, says the Lord."
Hebrews,8,10,"Yo, check this out. This is the 411 on the covenant I'm making with the fam of Israel in the days to come, says the Lord. I'm gonna drop my laws straight into their minds and etch 'em on their hearts. I'll be their One and Only, and they'll be my squad. And just to clarify, when I say 'put', I really mean 'give' or even like, 'slap on'."
Hebrews,8,11,"And no one will have to teach their neighbor or their bro, saying, 'Get to know the Lord,' 'cause everyone will already know me, from the smallest to the biggest."
Hebrews,8,12,I'm totally gonna show mercy for their wrongdoings and completely forget about their sins and wickedness.
Hebrews,8,13,"When it says there's a new {deal}, it means the old one is ancient history. The old stuff is falling apart and fading away."
Hebrews,9,1,"So like, the OG covenant had rules for doing holy stuff and, like, a place for chilling with God. #ceremonies"
Hebrews,9,2,"So like, there was this cool tent thingy made, you know? It was the first one, and it had a candlestick, a table, and some shewbread, which they called the sanctuary. It was totally sacred, yo."
Hebrews,9,3,"And behind the second super exclusive curtain, there's this sick tabernacle known as the ultimate holiest place ever;"
Hebrews,9,4,"They had this sick golden censer thing and the super lit ark of the covenant, all decked out in gold. Inside, there was this dope golden pot filled with manna, Aaron's rod that totally sprouted, and the tables of the covenant."
Hebrews,9,5,"And like, there were these super cool cherubims of glory chilling out and spreading their wings over the mercyseat, you know? But, like, we can't really go into all the deets about it right now."
Hebrews,9,6,"So, like, once everything was set up, the priests would always go into the first tabernacle and do all the God-related stuff."
Hebrews,9,7,"So, like, the high priest would, ya know, go into the second part of the place, all by himself, once a year. And he wouldn't go empty-handed, man! He'd bring some blood to offer for his own stuff and also for any mistakes the people made. No pressure or anything!"
Hebrews,9,8,"Yo, the Holy Ghost was basically saying that the entrance to the most holy place wasn't fully revealed while the original shrine was still standing, you know?"
Hebrews,9,9,"This was like a symbol from back in the day, when people used to give gifts and make sacrifices. But those acts couldn't really make the ones offering them perfect in their own conscience."
Hebrews,9,10,"Back in the day, all they cared about was what food and drinks they could have, along with different kinds of washings and physical rituals. It was something that was strictly enforced until everything got changed up and improved."
Hebrews,9,11,"But, like, Jesus came and became this super high priest of awesome things that are gonna happen, and His place of worship is, like, way better than any human-made structure, you know? It's like not even made with hands, man. It's, like, on a whole different level."
Hebrews,9,12,"Not with goat and cow blood, but with his own blood, he went into the holy place once, getting eternal redemption {for us}."
Hebrews,9,13,"So like, if sacrificing bulls and goats, and using the ashes of a cow to sprinkle on the unclean, can make your body all clean and stuff:"
Hebrews,9,14,"Yo, the blood of Christ is next-level, fam. Like, for real, He offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, no flaws or anything. And guess what? It straight-up cleanses your conscience from doing dead works so you can serve the living God, y'know? Oh, by the way, 'spot' could also mean 'fault'."
Hebrews,9,15,"So, like, he's the middleman for the new agreement, ya know? He died and stuff to save us from all the bad stuff we did under the old rules. Those who are chosen get the promise of, like, everlasting inheritance, man. It's real cool."
Hebrews,9,16,"Like, when there's, like, a will, there totally has to be, like, the death of the person making the will. Like, it's a total requirement and stuff."
Hebrews,9,17,"Like, a will only has power after someone dies, ya know? Otherwise, it's totally meaningless while the person who made the will is still alive."
Hebrews,9,18,"Back then, even the first {covenant} couldn't be set apart without some blood being involved. {set apart: or, made clean}"
Hebrews,9,19,"So, like, when Moses dropped all the rules to the people as per the law, he got some cow and goat blood, mixed it with water, and threw in some fancy scarlet wool and hyssop. Then he sprinkled that mixture on the book and everyone present, ya know, sorta like a spray of purple or whatever."
Hebrews,9,20,"Like, God's like, 'Yo, this is the legit blood of the covenant that I'm totally giving you guys.'"
Hebrews,9,21,"And he, like, totally showered blood all over the tent and all the cool stuff used for serving."
Hebrews,9,22,"Like, pretty much everything is made clean by following the rules and making a sacrifice, you know? And there's no way to be forgiven without like someone shedding their blood for it."
Hebrews,9,23,"So, like, it was totally necessary to purify the heavenly things with even better sacrifices than the patterns of things in the heavens."
Hebrews,9,24,"Yo, Christ didn't just stroll into those man-made holy places, ya know, the ones that are like a representation of the real deal. Nah, He straight up entered into heaven itself, to kick it with God on our behalf, ya feel me?"
Hebrews,9,25,"And it's not like he has to keep offering himself over and over again, like how the high priest goes into the sacred place every year with the blood of others."
Hebrews,9,26,"Like, it totally makes sense that he would have had to suffer a bunch of times since the world began, right? But check this out, at the very end of the world, he showed up just once and totally got rid of sin by sacrificing himself. Crazy, right?"
Hebrews,9,27,"Yo, just a heads up, every person gotta face death once, and then, boom, it's time for the ultimate judgment:"
Hebrews,9,28,"So ya know, Christ was totally sacrificed that one time to carry the sins of like, so many people; and for those who are like eagerly waiting for him, he's gonna come back a second time all pure and sinless, ready to bring salvation and all that."
Hebrews,10,1,"Like, the law kinda had a preview of all the awesome things that were gonna happen, but it wasn't the actual real deal. Plus, all those sacrifices they did every freaking year couldn't make people totally perfect, you know?"
Hebrews,10,2,"Like, if that was the case, they wouldn't need to keep offering sacrifices anymore, because, you know, the people who have already been forgiven would no longer feel guilty about their past mistakes. #NoMoreSinGuilt"
Hebrews,10,3,"But like, in those sacrifices, it's like a yearly reminder of sins, you know?"
Hebrews,10,4,"Like, there's no way that sacrificing bulls and goats can actually fix all our mistakes, you know."
Hebrews,10,5,"So like, when he enters the world, he's all like, 'Dude, you're not into sacrifices and offerings, but you totally hooked me up with a sick body."
Hebrews,10,6,You never really vibed with burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.
Hebrews,10,7,"So I was like, yo, I'm fully down to do what you want, God. It's all written in the game plan, you know?"
Hebrews,10,8,"Back then, when he was like, 'Yo, I ain't into all these sacrifices, burnt offerings, and offerings for sin that y'all been doing according to the law,'"
Hebrews,10,9,"So, like, he was all like, 'Yo, I'm here to do what you want, God.' And he got rid of the old stuff to make way for the new stuff, ya know?"
Hebrews,10,10,"Through Jesus Christ's sacrifice, we are made holy once and for all, according to His divine plan."
Hebrews,10,11,"So like, the priests always keep doing their thing, serving and making sacrifices over and over, but it's like those sacrifices can never really erase the sins, you know?"
Hebrews,10,12,"But this dude, like, once he made this one sacrifice that's gonna forgive sins forever, he's just chillin' on God's right hand, you know?"
Hebrews,10,13,"Just chillax and wait, 'cause soon his enemies gonna be under his feet."
Hebrews,10,14,"Just by one offering, he has totally perfected those who are set apart forever."
Hebrews,10,15,"And yo, even the Holy Ghost is straight up backing us up on this, 'cause he said it first, ya know?"
Hebrews,10,16,"This is the deal I'll make with them once those days are over, says the Lord. I'll embed my rules deep within their hearts, and inscribe them in their minds."
Hebrews,10,17,And I won't remember their sins and wrongdoings anymore.
Hebrews,10,18,"Once your sins are forgiven, there's no need for more sacrifices."
Hebrews,10,19,"So, like, bros, thanks to Jesus's blood, we have the confidence to go into the most sacred place, you know? #NoFilter #Blessed"
Hebrews,10,20,"Through a fresh and lit pathway, which he has made sacred for us, veiled by his flesh; {new made: or, renewed}"
Hebrews,10,21,"And like, we got this awesome high priest in charge of the house of God, you know?"
Hebrews,10,22,"Hey, let's come close with real sincerity and complete confidence in what we believe, making sure our hearts are cleansed from guilt and our bodies refreshed with pure vibes."
Hebrews,10,23,"Yo, let's stay solid in representing our faith, no doubt; 'cause the one who made those promises is totally trustworthy;"
Hebrews,10,24,"And like, let's totally think about each other and, like, inspire each other to show love and do good things, you know?"
Hebrews,10,25,"Don't bail on hanging out with each other like some people do, but instead encourage one another, especially as the day gets closer."
Hebrews,10,26,"If we intentionally mess up after we've learned the real deal, there's no more way to fix our mistakes."
Hebrews,10,27,"But like, there's this intense anticipation for judgment and like, this burning anger, you know? It's gonna totally consume those who are against it, like no joke."
Hebrews,10,28,"Anyone who dissed Moses' law got wrecked without mercy, with at least two or three witnesses flexin'."
Hebrews,10,29,"Like, imagine how much worse of a punishment someone will totally deserve if they straight up disrespect the Son of God and like, treat the blood of the covenant that made them pure as, like, insignificant, and just totally diss the Spirit of grace. Like, not cool at all, man."
Hebrews,10,30,"You feel me, right? God's got this whole vengeance thing covered. He said, 'I'll handle it, don't you worry.' Trust me, The Lord's gonna judge His peeps, straight up."
Hebrews,10,31,"Yo, it's legit scary to mess with the hands of the almighty God, fam."
Hebrews,10,32,"Yo, remember back in the day when you first started following the faith? It was rough AF, you went through some real tough times and faced a ton of challenges."
Hebrews,10,33,"Like, sometimes you were totally being talked about and made fun of, and other times you were just hanging out with people who were going through the same stuff."
Hebrews,10,34,"You guys really showed some empathy when I was locked up, and you even embraced the loss of your belongings with a positive attitude. You knew deep down that you have something way better and everlasting waiting for you in heaven. {or, that you have in or, for} yourselves}"
Hebrews,10,35,"Don't ditch your confidence, it comes with awesome rewards."
Hebrews,10,36,"Y'all gotta have mad patience, so that once you've done what God wants you to do, you'll score the promise."
Hebrews,10,37,"Just wait a sec, and the dude who's coming will totally arrive, and he won't be all slow about it."
Hebrews,10,38,"Like, those who do the right thing will thrive by having faith and all, but if someone decides to bail, my soul won't be stoked about it."
Hebrews,10,39,"But we're not about those who give up and head towards destruction; we're all about those who believe and save their souls, you know?"
Hebrews,11,1,"Bruh, faith be like the real deal, ya know? It's what keeps us holdin' on to our dreams, even when we can't see 'em yet. It's like that solid, undeniable proof that those unseen things are gonna happen for real. Trust, fam. Trust."
Hebrews,11,2,"Because of it, the OGs got major respect vibes."
Hebrews,11,3,"By having faith, we know that the universe was created by the power of God's words, meaning that what we see around us isn't made from visible stuff."
Hebrews,11,4,"Abel totally flexed his faith game by offering God a mad superior sacrifice compared to Cain. God was all like, 'Respect, bro. You righteous af.' God straight up acknowledged Abel's gifts and even though he's long gone, his legacy still speaks volumes."
Hebrews,11,5,"Enoch was totally vibing in his faith, so God was like, 'Nah, you ain't gonna die,' and just yeeted him outta here. Nobody could even find him, coz God straight up teleported him. And let me tell ya, before that happened, Enoch was already getting mad props from God, like, 'Yo, this dude knows how to make me happy.'"
Hebrews,11,6,"Dude, listen up. If you wanna get on God's good side, faith is the key. Like, you gotta truly believe in Him and trust that He'll come through. And hey, bonus points if you're constantly seeking Him and putting in the effort. He always rewards those who are all about that hustle."
Hebrews,11,7,"Noah was a total believer! God gave him a heads up about some crazy stuff that hadn't happened yet. He took it seriously and started building a massive boat to make sure his fam would be safe. In doing so, he showed that the rest of the world was just not on the same level. His faith was so strong that he earned the ultimate title of being righteous."
Hebrews,11,8,"So, like, Abraham totally had faith, right? And then, out of nowhere, he gets this call to leave everything behind and go to this place that's gonna be his inheritance. And get this, guys, he actually obeys! He's like, 'Sure, why not? Let's do it!' And get this, he didn't even know where he was going! Can you believe that?"
Hebrews,11,9,"By having faith, he stayed in the promised land, which was like being in a foreign place. He lived in temporary shelters with Isaac and Jacob, who were also heirs of the same promise."
Hebrews,11,10,"He was searching for a city that's totally legit, built by God himself and with a solid foundation."
Hebrews,11,11,"By believing, Sara gained the strength to have a baby even though she was old, because she trusted that the person who made the promise would keep it."
Hebrews,11,12,"So many descendants came from just one person, even though he was considered as good as dead. They were as numerous as the stars in the sky and the sand on the sea shore."
Hebrews,11,13,"They all died believing, even though they never saw the promises come true. They could only catch a glimpse of them from a distance. But that was enough for them to be fully convinced and wholeheartedly embrace their hope. They openly admitted that they were just passing through this world, like aliens and travelers."
Hebrews,11,14,Those who say stuff like that are basically saying they're on the hunt for a new place to belong.
Hebrews,11,15,"And like, if they had like, remembered where they came from, they could have like, totally had a chance to go back."
Hebrews,11,16,"But now they want a lit celestial {place}, ya know? God ain't even embarrassed to be called their God, 'cause he's all set with a dope city just for them."
Hebrews,11,17,"Abraham, a total legend in faith, had a crazy test thrown his way. He straight up offered his boy Isaac, his one and only, just like that. And this dude was all about those promises, so he went for it like a boss."
Hebrews,11,18,They said that your descendants would be called through Isaac.
Hebrews,11,19,"Thinking that God could totally bring him back to life, like, no problem; and that's exactly what happened, like, figuratively and all that."
Hebrews,11,20,"Isaac totally had faith and blessed Jacob and Esau, giving them all the deets about what was gonna go down in the future."
Hebrews,11,21,"So like, Jacob, right before he passed away, gave a blessing to both of Joseph's sons and showed his devotion by leaning on the top of his staff."
Hebrews,11,22,"Yo, Joseph, when he died and all, he totally mentioned how the Israelite children were gonna peace out from Egypt. And he straight-up ordered them to take his bones with them. Like, he wanted to be part of the journey, you know? #faith"
Hebrews,11,23,"Yo, check out Moses! Right from the get-go, his parents knew he was special. They hid him for three months, no fear in their hearts even when the king ordered otherwise. That's faith for you!"

Hebrews,11,33,"These peeps totally conquered kingdoms with their mad faith skills, did some righteous stuff, got all the promises coming their way, and straight up shut up some lions with their boss moves."

Hebrews,11,36,"And some people had to deal with really harsh insults and beatings, and they even ended up being locked up in prison:"
Hebrews,11,37,"They got totally wrecked, they were literally cut in half, constantly faced super tempting situations, got brutally killed with swords: they roamed around in sheepskins and goatskins; having nothing, going through rough times, tortured like crazy;"

Hebrews,12,1,"Yo, fam! Since we're surrounded by a whole bunch of people cheering us on, let's drop all the extra baggage and leave behind the sins that trip us up so easily. Then, with some serious patience, let's crush this race that's set before us."
Hebrews,12,2,"Keep your eyes on Jesus, the one who started and will complete our faith. He went through all that suffering on the cross because he knew the end result would bring him great joy. He didn't let shame hold him back. Now, he's sitting at God's right hand on his throne."

Hebrews,12,6,"The Lord disciplines and corrects those he loves, giving a reality check to every child he embraces."
Hebrews,12,7,"If you can handle getting corrected, God treats you like one of His own kids. I mean, all parents discipline their children, right?"
Hebrews,12,8,"But yo, if you ain't get no correction, and everyone gets some, then you straight up losers, not true fam."

Hebrews,12,10,"Like, they totally disciplined us based on what they thought was best, but God disciplines us for our own good, so that we can be part of His holy squad. Ya know, they disciplined us just for a short time, but God's discipline is all about that long-term gain, you feel me?"
Hebrews,12,11,"Just gonna be real with you, being corrected or disciplined totally doesn't feel good in the moment. It kinda sucks, actually. But here's the thing, afterwards, it actually produces good results and brings a sense of inner peace and goodness to those who go through it."

Hebrews,12,25,"Make sure you don't ignore the one who's talking to you. 'Cause if those folks who dissed the one speaking on earth didn't get away with it, how much less will we get away with it if we turn our back on the one speaking from heaven?"

Hebrews,13,8,"Jesus Christ, he hasn't changed a bit - yesterday, today, and will be forever."
Hebrews,13,9,Don't get caught up in all these different and weird teachings. It's better to have a heart that's truly grounded in grace rather than obsessing over pointless rules and rituals that won't actually benefit you.
Hebrews,13,10,"Yo, we got this altar, and those who work at the tabernacle ain't allowed to chow down on it."
Hebrews,13,11,The high priest takes the blood of those animals with sinful bodies and burns them outside the camp.
Hebrews,13,12,"So, Jesus was like, 'I'm gonna make the people feel all holy and stuff by shedding his own blood,' and he went through some tough times outside the city walls."

Hebrews,13,23,"Yo, just FYI, our boy Timothy has been released, and if he pulls up soon, I'll link up with y'all."

James,1,1,"Yo, it's James, a total servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ. Just dropping a shoutout to all the tribes out there, spreadin' love and peace."
James,1,2,"Yo fam, embrace that positivity when you face all kinds of tough situations; it‚Äôs all about growth, you feel me? {temptations: or, trials}"
James,1,3,"You gotta know that when you face challenges that test your faith, it actually builds up your patience, you know."
James,1,4,"But, like, let patience do its thing and work its magic, so that you can be, like, totally flawless and whole, with absolutely nothing missing or lacking."
James,1,5,"If any of y'all need some wisdom, just hit up God. He's always giving it out without any judgment or shade. And trust, He'll definitely hook you up with what you need."
James,1,6,"But, like, if you're gonna ask for something, you gotta believe in it, no doubts, ya know? 'Cause if you're all wishy-washy and unsure, it's like being a wave in the sea, going wherever the wind blows you."
James,1,7,"So, like, don't even expect to get anything from the Lord, dude."
James,1,8,Someone who can't make up their mind is completely unstable in everything they do.
James,1,9,"Yo, for real, if you a bro who's been slept on, it's time to celebrate 'cause now you're finally gettin' recognized and lifted up. #humblebrag #celebrateyourwins"
James,1,10,"But like, bro, the wealthy peeps gotta realize that they're not all that, 'cause just like a temporary flower, they ain't gonna last forever, ya know?"
James,1,11,"Yo, when the sun comes up blazing hot, it sucks the life outta the grass and flowers. They droop and lose their stylishness. Same goes for the rich dude who's all bougie - eventually, that fade away in his own fancy lifestyle."
James,1,12,"Dude, you'll be totally blessed if you stay strong during all the challenges. Trust me, once you pass the test, you'll score the raddest crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love Him."
James,1,13,"Don't go around saying that when you're tempted, it's because God tempted you. God can't be tempted by evil, and He doesn't tempt anyone either. {evil: or, evils}"
James,1,14,"But like, everyone gets tempted, you know? It's like when your desires start pulling you in, and you're totally enticed."
James,1,15,"So, like, when temptation takes over and you give in, it leads to sinning, ya know? And then, once sin is all done and stuff, it leads to, like, um, death. Just like that."
James,1,16,"Don't mess up, fam! Love you all."
James,1,17,"Yo, check it out, every sick present and flawless gift comes straight from the big man upstairs, the OG Father of lights. He's always consistent and don't do no shady stuff."
James,1,18,"He chose to bring us into existence by speaking the truth, so that we could be like the OGs among all of his creations."
James,1,19,"Yo, my awesome fam, listen up: we should all be quick to listen, take our time before we speak, and chill when it comes to getting angry."
James,1,20,"Dude, getting all angry and worked up doesn't bring about the goodness of God, you know?"
James,1,21,"So, like, get rid of all that gross stuff and unnecessary naughtiness. Instead, be open to accepting the awesome power of the Word, which can totally save your souls, ya know?"
James,1,22,"Don't just talk the talk, walk the walk fam, otherwise you're just fooling yourselves."
James,1,23,"Like, if someone just hears the stuff being said, but doesn't actually do anything about it, they're basically like a person who looks in the mirror and then forgets what they even look like."
James,1,24,"Because he looks at himself, does his thing, and immediately forgets who he used to be."
James,1,25,"But whoever really checks out the awesome freedom rule book and sticks with it, not just listening and forgetting, but actually putting it into action, this person is gonna be super blessed in everything they do. Yeah, like really blessed, you know? No cap."
James,1,26,"If someone in your squad claims to be religious but can't control their words and is being fake deep, their faith is pointless."
James,1,27,"True religion that is respected by God is this: To support and comfort those who don't have parents or spouses when they're going through tough times, and to stay away from negative influences in the world."
James,2,1,"Yo, fam, don't be showing favoritism or putting certain peeps on a pedestal when it comes to the faith we have in our main man Jesus Christ, who's all about that glory."
James,2,2,"Yo, listen up! Picture this: a dude walks into your gathering rocking a fancy gold ring, looking all dapper and stylish. And right beside him, there's another guy, poor and wearing worn-out clothes. (BTW, assembly here means synagogue, in case you didn't know)."
James,2,3,"And you treat the person wearing trendy clothes with favor, saying to them, 'You can sit in this awesome spot,' while saying to the poor, 'You can stand over there, or sit here on the floor.'"
James,2,4,"So, like, are you guys being biased and making yourselves into judges of evil thoughts?"
James,2,5,"Yo, listen up my fam, don't you know that God has picked those who ain't got much in this world, but are basically flexing in faith? They're gonna inherit the kingdom God promised to those who straight up love Him, you know what I'm saying? {of the: or, of that}"
James,2,6,But y'all be disrespecting the poor. Don't the rich folks bully you and drag you to court?
James,2,7,"Like, seriously, don't even think about dissin' that awesome name you've been called by, okay? #Respect"
James,2,8,"If you're all about that royal law, doin' it right according to the scripture, showin' love to your neighbor like you love yourself, then you're totally killin' it! üôå"
James,2,9,"But like, if you're all biased and play favorites, that's a sin and you're like totally breaking the rules, man."
James,2,10,"If you're all about following every rule, but slip up on just one, you're still in the wrong for breaking them all."
James,2,11,"Okay, listen up fam. This verse is all about the rules, y'know? The one who was like, 'Yo, don't cheat on your boo' was also like, 'Yo, don't take someone's life.' So, even though you might not be cheating, if you go and kill somebody, you're breaking the law. It's pretty straightforward, so let's play it safe and keep it legit."
James,2,12,"Like, make sure you talk and act in a way that shows you know you'll be held accountable by the law of freedom."
James,2,13,"If you refuse to show mercy, you're gonna face some harsh judgment. But hey, mercy totally wins over judgment, so choose wisely and spread that love!"
James,2,14,"Yo, my fam, what's the point if someone talks big about having faith but doesn't back it up with actions? Can that kind of faith really save them?"
James,2,15,"If your bro or sis don't have clothes or food every day,"
James,2,16,"And if one of you tells them, 'Go in peace, stay warm and fed,' but you don't actually give them what they need for their body, then what's the point?"
James,2,17,"Yo, listen up! Just having faith ain't enough if you don't back it up with actions, y'know? Faith without works is like dead, straight up. It's all alone and ain't doin' nothin'. #TrueStory"
James,2,18,"Yeah, like, you could say, 'Oh, you have faith, but I have actions.' Prove to me that you have real faith without any actions, and I'll prove my faith by the things I do. {without: some copies read, by}"
James,2,19,"So like, you believe in one God? That's cool, man. But check it, even the devils believe too, and they're like, totally freaked out about it."
James,2,20,"Yo, dude, check it out: faith minus action equals RIP."
James,2,21,"Yo, didn't Abraham, our OG father, straight up prove himself when he was about to sacrifice his own son Isaac on that altar?"
James,2,22,"Yo, did you see how faith and actions were a killer combo? Like, actions completed faith and took it to the next level."
James,2,23,"So, like, the prophecy was totally fulfilled, you know? It said that Abraham had mad faith in God, and that's why he was considered as righteous, bro. They even started calling him God's BFF, dude."
James,2,24,"So, like, you see how a person is legit righteous by their actions and not just by belief alone, you know?"
James,2,25,"And let's not forget how Rahab, the hustler, totally proved herself by taking in those messengers and helping them escape through a different route. It was all about her actions, you know?"
James,2,26,"Like, if your body has no spirit, it's like totally dead. Same thing goes for faith - it's dead without actions backing it up. {spirit: or, breath}"
James,3,1,"Hey fam, don't be too eager to become leaders, 'cause you know we'll face some heavy judgment for that. Stay humble and keep it real. #Word"
James,3,2,"Cuz let's be real, we all mess up sometimes. But if you can keep your words in check and not offend anyone, you're on another level. It means you've got complete control over your whole self, dude."
James,3,3,"Check it out, we use bridles on horses so they'll listen to us and we can control their whole body."
James,3,4,"Check out those massive ships, they get tossed around by crazy winds, but they can still change direction with just a tiny rudder, wherever the captain wants them to go."
James,3,5,"Yo, the tongue may be small, but it talks a big game. Check it, that little spark can start a huge fire! üí•"
James,3,6,"The tongue can be like fire, full of mischief and wickedness. It has the power to corrupt the entire body and cause chaos in our lives. It's like the flame that ignites the wheel of destruction, fueled by the darkest of forces."
James,3,7,"Dudes, listen up! Humans have totally mastered the art of taming all sorts of animals, from fuzzy beasts to majestic birds, slithery snakes, and even crazy sea creatures. It's like, we've got this incredible power to control nature, you know? #MindBlown"
James,3,8,"Yo, like, nobody can control the tongue, it's like a wild beast, causing chaos and spreading negativity everywhere."
James,3,9,"We use our words to praise God, our Father, and sadly, we also use our words to insult or curse fellow humans, who are created in God's image."
James,3,10,"Dude, it's pretty wack when you talk all nice one moment and then start spewing hate the next. Seriously, fam, we shouldn't be about that kind of stuff."
James,3,11,"Yo, can a fountain just blast out both sweet AF water and a sour vibe in the same spot? Like, can it go from straight up refreshing to straight up bitter in a sec?"
James,3,12,"Yo, fam, like can a fig tree produce olives? Or a vine, yield figs? For real, a fountain can't be spitting out saltwater and fresh water at the same time."
James,3,13,Who among you is truly wise and knowledgeable? Let them demonstrate their wisdom through their actions and humble demeanor.
James,3,14,"But, like, if you're all caught up in being super jealous and constantly arguing and stuff, don't even act all proud and deny the real deal, yo."
James,3,15,"This wisdom ain't from up there, fam, it's all about this earthly, basic, straight-up devilish stuff. (And when I say 'basic,' I don't mean it in a good way)"
James,3,16,"When there's jealousy and conflict, things get messy and all sorts of bad things start happening. (By the way, 'confusion' in Greek means like a big noisy chaotic situation, just so you know.)"
James,3,17,"But like, real wisdom that comes from a higher level is all about being pure, chill, kind, super approachable, hella compassionate and producing good vibes, with no favoritism or fake vibes. No drama, y'know what I'm sayin?"
James,3,18,"And when you spread positivity and strive for harmony, you'll reap the rewards of righteousness."
James,4,1,"Where do all these conflicts and arguments come from, fam? They don't stem from deep within, like all those intense desires that battle inside you? It's like constant drama and craving for something, you know?"
James,4,2,"You're always craving but never satisfied, you're ready to take lives and possess things you can't get, you're constantly in conflict and battling, but you're lacking because you never bother to ask for it."
James,4,3,"You're always asking for stuff, but never getting it, because you're asking for the wrong things. You just wanna satisfy your own selfish desires."
James,4,4,"Yo, cheaters and cheaterettes, don't you realize that trying to be all buddy-buddy with the world is like straight-up being enemies with God? So basically, if you wanna go around being all cozy with the world, you're literally becoming an enemy of God."
James,4,5,Do you really think the scriptures are talking for no reason when they say that the spirit inside of us craves to be jealous or envious?
James,4,6,"But he's all about that extra grace. That's why he's like, nah to the proud, but all about that grace for the humble."
James,4,7,"Yo, like, surrender to God, fam. Straight up, resist the devil and watch him ghost on outta here."
James,4,8,"Get close to God, and He'll get close to you. Time to clean up your act, sinners, and get your minds in check."
James,4,9,"Feel down, be sad, and shed some tears: let your laughter become sorrow, and your joy turn into heaviness."
James,4,10,"Yo, chillax and show some humility in front of the Almighty, and trust me, He'll totally boost you up like no other."
James,4,11,"Yo, don't be out here dissing each other, fam. When you trash talk your brother and pass judgment on him, you're basically dissing the rules and judging the whole system. But if you're busy judging the system, you ain't even following the rules yourself, you just acting like a judge and all."
James,4,12,"There's only one boss when it comes to the rules, and they have the power to rescue or wreck everything. So who do you think you are to pass judgment on someone else?"
James,4,13,"Listen up, y'all who be like, 'Hey, today or tomorrow we gonna head to this city, stay there for a whole year, hustle, and make mad cash:'"
James,4,14,"Yo, you don't even know what's gonna go down tomorrow. Like, seriously, think about it - what even is your life? It's just like a brief moment, here one second and then gone the next. Like, poof! Vanished into thin air. Can't even believe it, man."
James,4,15,"Like, you should totally say, 'If it's in God's plan, we'll def be alive and do this thing or that thing.'"
James,4,16,"But like, y'all be stoked on all your bragging: but honestly, that kind of flexing is just plain wrong vibes."
James,4,17,"So, if you know what's right but don't actually do it, then that's what we call a major sin, my fam."
James,5,1,"Listen up, wealthy peeps, prepare for some major weeping and dramatic howling because your upcoming hardships are no joke."
James,5,2,"Dude, your stacks of cash are all messed up, and your threads have got moth damage."
James,5,3,"Bruh, your money is straight up messed up with corrosion, and that corrosion is gonna be a living receipt against you. It's gonna eat through your flesh like fire, no cap. Y'all been stacking up all this wealth, thinking it's gonna last forever, but it's only gonna last until the end of the world, fam."
James,5,4,"Yo, peep this: the money the workers who harvested your crops are owed is being withheld from them by shady means. And let me tell you, their cries of injustice have reached the ears of the big boss, the Lord of hosts."
James,5,5,"You've been all about that good life on earth, living it up and indulging yourselves; you've been pampering your hearts like it's a feast day or something."
James,5,6,"You totally cancelled and murdered the righteous dude, like he didn't even clap back."
James,5,7,"Yo, fam, be chill and patient till the Lord comes through. Check it out, like a farmer waiting for that prime harvest, he's got mad patience for it, even waiting for that early and late rain to come in. {Be...: or, Be long patient, or, Suffer with long patience}"
James,5,8,"Just chill, okay? Keep your cool and stay strong because the Lord's arrival is almost here."
James,5,9,"Don't hold grudges against each other, my fam, 'cause that'll only bring you trouble. Just remember, the judge is right around the corner, ready to drop the final verdict. {Grudge not: or, Groan, or, Grieve not}"
James,5,10,"Yo, fam, check out the prophets who straight up preached in the Lord's name. They're like prime examples of dealing with all these struggles and staying patient, you feel me?"
James,5,11,"Yo, check this out, we totally admire those who stay strong during tough times. Like, y'all have probably heard about how patient Job was, and how everything worked out in the end because of the Lord's kindness and compassion."
James,5,12,"Yo, fam, hear me out. Don't be out here dropping any swear words, whether it's about heaven, earth, or anything else. Keep it simple - just say yes when you mean yes, and no when you mean no. Trust me, you don't want to end up in a bad situation, so keep it real and straightforward."
James,5,13,Feeling down? Just hit up the big man upstairs with a prayer. Having a blast? Bust out the tunes and rock it with some sick psalms.
James,5,14,"Yo, if someone's feeling sick, they should reach out to the OGs of the church fam. They'll come through and pray for them, yo, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord."
James,5,15,"And if you pray with faith, it's gonna help heal the sick peeps and God's gonna make 'em feel better, and if they've done anything wrong, their sins will be forgiven."
James,5,16,"Let's be real with each other and lift each other up in prayer, so we can find healing. When a righteous person prays passionately, it makes a big difference."
James,5,17,"Elias was just a regular dude like us, dealing with all the same feelings and stuff. He prayed super hard for it to not rain, and guess what? It didn't rain for a whole three and a half years! Crazy, right?"
James,5,18,"Then he prayed again, and the sky started pouring, and the earth started popping out its fruit."
James,5,19,"Hey fam, if any of y'all start slippin' and veer away from what's real, and someone helps bring you back;"
James,5,20,"Just so you know, if you help someone turn away from their wrong path, you're actually saving their soul from destruction and covering up a bunch of their mistakes."
1 Peter,1,1,"Yo, it's Peter, one of Jesus' main followers, hollering at all you peeps chillin' in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"
1 Peter,1,2,"Yo, chosen ones by God the Father, through the all-knowing vibe, and the Spirit giving you that pure energy, get ready to obey and get a sprinkle of Jesus Christ's life-saving love: May grace and peace flow abundantly to you."
1 Peter,1,3,"Praise God, our OG Lord Jesus Christ's dad, who, out of mad love and mercy, gave us a fresh start and a lit sense of hope through Jesus coming back from the dead, flexing that resurrection game. (Abundant: like, so much)"
1 Peter,1,4,"You've got an everlasting, untainted, never-fading inheritance waiting for you up in heaven."
1 Peter,1,5,Those who stay faithful are protected by God's power until salvation is revealed at the end of time.
1 Peter,1,6,"Like, for real, y'all should be stoked about this, even though you might be feeling down for a hot minute due to some major challenges coming your way:"
1 Peter,1,7,"The test of your faith is like way more valuable than any basic gold that fades away. It's gonna go through some intense fire, but in the end, it's all worth it 'cause it'll bring mad praise, honor, and glory when Jesus Christ shows up on the scene, yo!"
1 Peter,1,8,"You guys are totally crushing on someone you've never met in person, like seriously! Even though you can't see them right now, you've got faith and it's giving you the most amazing and glorious happiness ever, I can't even put it into words! üòçüåü"
1 Peter,1,9,"When you finally see the result of your faith - that sweet, sweet salvation for your souls."
1 Peter,1,10,The prophets who spoke of the grace that would come to you eagerly sought and searched for the salvation they were talking about.
1 Peter,1,11,"Like, they were totally trying to figure out what exactly the Spirit of Christ, you know, the one that was in them, was trying to say when it was all prophesying about Jesus' sufferings and the epic glory that was gonna come after."
1 Peter,1,12,"It was revealed to them that they weren't doing it just for themselves, but for us too. Now, those who spread the good news to you, with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, have told you about it. Even the angels are curious about these things."
1 Peter,1,13,"So, like, get your thoughts in gear, stay focused, and keep hoping until the very end for the totally amazing grace that you're gonna receive when Jesus Christ reveals himself. Trust me, it's gonna be lit! {to the end: Gr. perfectly}"
1 Peter,1,14,"Yo, listen up! As obedient fam, don't try to flex and be like you used to when you were dumb and clueless:"
1 Peter,1,15,"Yo, the one who called you is all about being straight up holy, so you gotta be holy too in every aspect of your life, fam."
1 Peter,1,16,"Yo, it's like written and stuff - you gotta be all holy 'cause I'm totally holy, fam."
1 Peter,1,17,"And, like, if you reach out to God, who doesn't play favorites and judges everyone based on their actions, just make the most of the time you're spending here on Earth, yo, and live with a healthy dose of respect and awe:"
1 Peter,1,18,You already know that you weren't bought with fancy stuff like silver and gold to escape your pointless way of living that was passed down from your dads.
1 Peter,1,19,"But, like, Jesus totally sacrificed himself for us, yo. He was pure and perfect, just like a flawless, spotless lamb, ya feel me?"
1 Peter,1,20,"Yo, this dude was totally planned ahead of time, even before the world started. But he became visible to all of us in these recent times, just for you, y'know?"
1 Peter,1,21,"Those who trust in him believe in the one who brought him back to life and bestowed upon him great honor. This way, your trust and optimism will be rooted in God."
1 Peter,1,22,"Since you've cleansed your souls by living in truth and being guided by the Spirit, make sure to genuinely love your fellow brothers and sisters, and do it with a heart full of purity and passion."
1 Peter,1,23,"Like, when you totally hit that refresh button on your life, it's not like starting fresh with a sketchy foundation that can easily go bad. It's more like upgrading to this indestructible foundation that never gets messed up, thanks to God's eternal and unchanging truth."
1 Peter,1,24,"Listen up, fam! Like, all of us humans are just like grass, you know? And all that swag and success we chase after? Yeah, it's as temporary as a flower that blooms on the grass. Trust me, the grass dries up, and the flower just falls off eventually. So, like, you feel me? We gotta remember that, okay?"
1 Peter,1,25,"But God's word is eternal, fam. And this is the lit message that we preach to y'all through the gospel."
1 Peter,2,1,"So, like, get rid of all the hate, deception, fakeness, jealousy, and gossiping,"
1 Peter,2,2,"Like, yo, as newborns, be all about that authentic milk of the word, so you can level up and grow, you know?"
1 Peter,2,3,"If you've experienced how awesome the Lord is, then you know what's up."
1 Peter,2,4,"When you approach someone, like approaching a super cool vibe, know that they might not be popular among everyone, but they're special and highly valued by God."
1 Peter,2,5,"You guys, like, as cool stones, are being put together to create a spiritual community, a sacred group, to offer up spiritual acts of worship, that God totally digs through Jesus Christ. {are: or, you know, be you}"
1 Peter,2,6,"So, like, in the scripture, it's written that, yo, check it out, I'm placing this super important cornerstone in Sion. He's chosen and super valuable, and anyone who believes in him won't be embarrassed or disappointed."
1 Peter,2,7,"So, if you're all about believing, then you know how awesome this is: but for those who don't listen and follow, it's like they overlooked something big. Turns out, that very thing they ignored became the most important piece of the whole thing, like a total game-changer! It's like they missed out on something really special, or a major flex, if you will."
1 Peter,2,8,"And like, there's this stone that can totally trip people up and a rock that, like, offends them. It's, like, for those who, you know, stumble over the word and, like, refuse to follow it. It's, like, their thing to, you know, rebel against it and stuff."
1 Peter,2,9,"You guys are the chosen crew, like a squad of ultimate awesomeness, representing the highest level of spiritual royalty. Together, we're a holy tribe, kind of like a unique and extraordinary squad, set apart from the rest. Our mission? To flaunt and celebrate the incredible greatness of the one who rescued us from a dark and gloomy existence, and brought us into an insanely mind-blowing, super awesome way of living. It's all about acknowledging and sharing the incredible qualities and goodness of our God."
1 Peter,2,10,"Back then, we weren't really a squad, but now we're totally part of God's crew. We used to be straight up out of luck, but now we're all about that mercy life."
1 Peter,2,11,"Hey fam, listen up! I'm like, begging you all as fellow travelers in this crazy world, stay away from those hedonistic desires that totally mess with your soul."
1 Peter,2,12,"Make sure your words and actions are on point when interacting with non-believers, so that even if they might talk smack about you, they'll still be blown away by the awesome things you do, and eventually give props to God when He shows up."
1 Peter,2,13,"Yo, make sure you're following all the rules and laws set by humans, 'cause it's all for God's sake, ya know? Even if it means obeying the king, who's like the top boss or something."
1 Peter,2,14,"And respect the authorities, those who are appointed to enforce laws and punish wrongdoers, and also recognize those who deserve praise for doing what is right."
1 Peter,2,15,God wants you to do good so that you can shut down the clueless haters.
1 Peter,2,16,"Don't abuse your freedom to hide behind malicious intent, but embrace your role as servants of God. (using: Gr. having)"
1 Peter,2,17,"Respect everyone, yo. Show love to your crew. Be in awe of God, fam. Give props to the ruler, ya feel me? (Respect everyone: or, Value everyone)"
1 Peter,2,18,"Yo, peeps, listen up! If you're serving someone, respect them big time - not just when they're nice and chill, but even when they act all difficult and annoying."
1 Peter,2,19,"It's really awesome if someone has the guts to go through tough times and face unfair treatment all because they wanna do right by God. (And by awesome, I mean like, super cool and respectable!)"
1 Peter,2,20,"Like, seriously, where's the credit if you get hate for doing something wrong but handle it without freaking out? But if you get hate for doing something right and still remain calm, that's actually pretty impressive in God's book. And by 'impressive,' I mean He totally approves!"
1 Peter,2,21,"So basically, being called to this is part of the deal: because even Christ went through some tough times for us, showing us how it's done. He left us a sick example to follow, so you can totally take cues from his vibe. Just saying, some people swap out that 'us' for 'you' but you get the idea."
1 Peter,2,22,"Bruh, this dude never did any wrong, and he never spoke a lie or anything shady."
1 Peter,2,23,"Like, when people talked trash about him, he didn't talk trash back; when he went through hard stuff, he didn't go all threatening and stuff. He trusted the one who judges fairly instead of taking matters into his own hands."
1 Peter,2,24,"He, like totally took on all our sins himself, like in his own body, on that big tree, so that we, like totally dead to sins, can live our lives doing what's right: 'cause of those scars, healing was totally given to you, yo. {on: or, to}"
1 Peter,2,25,"Like y'all were lost and wandering sheep, but now you've found your way back to the ultimate shepherd and caretaker of your souls."
1 Peter,3,1,"Hey ladies, make sure you respect your husbands and stay in their zone. Show them your awesomeness, and if they're not really into faith, your actions and words don't even need to convince them - they'll be won over just by how rad you are."
1 Peter,3,2,When they see how pure and respectful you are in your actions.
1 Peter,3,3,"Don't focus on outward appearances like fancy hairstyles, excessive jewelry, or designer clothes."
1 Peter,3,4,"But like, your inner self should be all about that pureness and goodness, ya know? Like, it's all about having a chill and humble vibe, a spirit that's not about being all loud and obnoxious. And trust me, God totally values that and thinks it's all precious and stuff."
1 Peter,3,5,"Back in the day, these awesome holy ladies, who had mad faith in God, knew how to style themselves to perfection and respected their husbands without losing their own identity:"
1 Peter,3,6,"Just like how Sara respected and obeyed Abraham, referring to him as lordd': you guys are like her daughters as long as you also do what's right and don't let fear stop you. {daughters: Gr. children}"
1 Peter,3,7,"Yo, husbands, listen up: Treat your spouse with understanding and respect. Show them honor, knowing that they're not as strong as you physically, but we're equal partners in God's grace. Don't let anything mess with your prayers, bro."
1 Peter,3,8,"Okay fam, listen up. It's time to get on the same wavelength, show empathy for each other, treat each other like family, have that soft heart, and be respectful. Spread that love, ya feel me?"
1 Peter,3,9,"Instead of getting back at someone for doing you wrong or insulting you, respond with kindness and positivity. Remember, you're meant to spread blessings to others and be a recipient of blessings yourself."
1 Peter,3,10,"If you wanna live your best life and experience positive vibes, make sure to keep it real and speak with integrity. No room for negativity or deceitful talk, fam."
1 Peter,3,11,Avoid bad stuff and do good things; strive for peace and make it happen.
1 Peter,3,12,"God keeps tabs on the good guys, always listening to their prayers. But He's not too fond of those who choose to be evil."
1 Peter,3,13,"And like, who even dares to mess with you if you're all about positivity vibes and doing what's right?"
1 Peter,3,14,"But, like, if you go through tough times because you're doing what's right, you're totally blessed, you know? Don't let their fear get to you, and don't stress about their drama."
1 Peter,3,15,"Yo, make the Lord God a big deal in your heart. And always be prepared to, like, explain to anyone who asks why you have hope, but do it with humility and respect."
1 Peter,3,16,"Keep a clear conscience, so that when people talk smack about you and call you out for doing wrong, they'll feel super embarrassed when they realize they were totally wrong about your awesome way of life in Christ."
1 Peter,3,17,"Yo, like, it's actually way better if, by God's will, you go through some tough times for doing the right thing than for being a total jerk."
1 Peter,3,18,"Yo, Jesus went through some serious stuff for our sins. He, being totally righteous, took the hit for us messed up folks, just so we could be reconnected with God. He died in the flesh, but came back to life with the Spirit!"
1 Peter,3,19,And then he went and preached to the homies locked up in the spiritual slammer.
1 Peter,3,20,"There were some peeps back in the day who were hella disobedient, when God was super patient, waiting during Noah's time while he was building the ark. Only a small crew of eight homies got saved through the water, you feel me?"
1 Peter,3,21,"Baptism is, like, the ultimate game-changer that saves us now, ya know? It's not just about cleaning your physical body or anything, but it's more about having a legit connection with God and feeling at peace with ourselves, all thanks to Jesus Christ's resurrection, dude!"
1 Peter,3,22,"Who's up in heaven, chillin' on God's right side? Even the angels, rulers, and total powerhouses bow down to them."
1 Peter,4,1,"So, since Christ went through suffering for us in human form, equip yourselves with the same mentality. Because anyone who has experienced suffering in their own life has stopped giving in to sin."
1 Peter,4,2,"So that they don't waste any more of their time chasing worldly desires, but instead live according to God's plan."
1 Peter,4,3,"Okay, so like, we've had enough of wasting our time living like the non-believers do, you know? Back in the day, we used to indulge in all those inappropriate things: partying, excessive drinking, wild gatherings, fancy feasts, and even worshiping false gods. But enough of that, it's time for a change!"
1 Peter,4,4,"They find it weird that you don't go along with them when they go all out in wild parties, and they even talk bad about you:"
1 Peter,4,5,"Yo, we all gotta answer to the one who's about to pass judgment on everyone, whether they're living or already gone."
1 Peter,4,6,"Like, the good news was shared with those who have passed away so that they could be assessed like everyone else in their human bodies, but live according to God in their inner being."
1 Peter,4,7,"Yo, it's like, the end of everything is about to go down: so, you better stay focused and keep it real with prayer."
1 Peter,4,8,"Yo, make sure you show mad love to one another, like big time. 'Cause love is gonna cover up a whole bunch of mistakes, for real."
1 Peter,4,9,"Be open and welcoming to each other, without any negativity or resentment."
1 Peter,4,10,"Just like when you get a dope present, share that same awesomeness with others, like being responsible homies looking after God's mad blessings."
1 Peter,4,11,"When you're talking, speak like you're sharing God's word. And when you're serving, do it with the skills and strength that God has given you. This way, God can shine through everything you do because of Jesus Christ. He deserves all the praise and power forever. Amen."
1 Peter,4,12,"Yo fam, don't be shook when you go through tough times. No need to act like it's some out-of-the-blue madness hitting you:"
1 Peter,4,13,"But like, seriously, get hype because you're totally experiencing the same stuff that Christ went through. And when His awesomeness is totally unveiled, you'll be stoked AF and filled with so much joy, like, beyond words."
1 Peter,4,14,"If you get hated on for repping Christ, you're actually blessed! 'Cause the swaggy spirit of glory and God is all up in you, while they out here trash talking. But you? You straight flexin' and getting praised!"
1 Peter,4,15,"But yo fam, don't be out here suffering for doing some mad dirt like murder or straight up stealing, or being a straight up troublemaker, or being all nosy in other people's business."
1 Peter,4,16,"If someone goes through tough times because of being a Christian, they shouldn't be embarrassed about it. Instead, they should praise God for it."
1 Peter,4,17,"Yo, it's about time that judgement starts with those who claim to be part of God's crew. If it starts with us, what's gonna happen to those who don't follow God's gospel, you know?"
1 Peter,4,18,"Bruh, if it's a struggle for the righteous to be saved, then where on earth will the ungodly and sinners even show up? Like, seriously, think about it."
1 Peter,4,19,"So, like, if you're going through tough times because it's God's plan and all, just trust Him and keep doing good, man. He's always got your back 'cause He's a loyal Creator, ya know?"
1 Peter,5,1,"Yo, fellow elders, listen up. As one of you, I gotta urge you to take note. I've been through it too, witnessed the pain and suffering of Christ. But guess what? I've also experienced the glorious revelation that's yet to come. So, heed my words, fam."
1 Peter,5,2,"Take care of God's crew that's with you, not because you have to, but because you want to. Don't do it for the money, but with a genuine desire. Do as much as you can, fam."
1 Peter,5,3,"Don't go all power-hungry over God's crew, but set a good example for them instead."
1 Peter,5,4,"And when the ultimate Squad Leader shows up, you'll be rewarded with an everlasting flex that never loses its shine."
1 Peter,5,5,"Yo, listen up, you younger ones! Show respect to your elders, no doubt. And hey, everybody, remember to respect each other and stay humble. 'Cause lemme tell you, God isn't a fan of the prideful, but those who stay humble get blessed with grace."
1 Peter,5,6,"So, like, be humble and stuff under God's powerful hand, y'know? Then, at the right time, He'll totally lift you up! üôå"
1 Peter,5,7,"Just give all your worries to him, like seriously, he actually cares about you, bro."
1 Peter,5,8,"Stay focused, stay aware; 'cause the devil, acting like a fierce lion, is out there, looking for someone to mess up with:"
1 Peter,5,9,"Stay strong in your faith and stand up against the challenges, knowing that your brothers and sisters all around the world are going through similar struggles."
1 Peter,5,10,"But the God who's full of grace, the ultimate homie, he's the one who called us to experience that heavenly glory through Christ Jesus. Just hold on tight, ride out this temporary suffering, and he'll help you reach your full potential, keep you strong, stable, and unshakeable."
1 Peter,5,11,Let's give mad props and absolute power to him forever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter,5,12,"Yo, Silvanus here, your loyal bro, just dropping a quick message to hype you up and testify that this is God's legit grace that you're rocking with."
1 Peter,5,13,"Yo, sending love from the Babylon church, we're all in this together ‚úåÔ∏è Also, shoutout to my homie Marcus, he's like a son to me üëä"
1 Peter,5,14,Give each other a friendly kiss. May all of you in Christ Jesus have peace. Amen.
2 Peter,1,1,"Yo, it's Simon Peter, just your average servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, writing this super important message to all y'all who have scored that top-tier faith along with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ. (P.S. Simon can also be called Symeon! Oh, and by the way, when we say 'our God and Savior,' we're talking about the one and only!)"
2 Peter,1,2,"Yo, may grace and peace be totally multiplied in your life as you know more about God and Jesus, our main homie."
2 Peter,1,3,"God's infinite power has given us everything we need for a lit life and being godly, by knowing Him who called us to live our best life with honor and excellence."
2 Peter,1,4,"Here's the deal, fam: we've been blessed with some seriously awesome promises. Like, they're beyond amazing and super valuable. These promises are meant to help us tap into our godly side, and we can break free from the messed-up stuff in this world caused by our desires. No cap."
2 Peter,1,5,"Yo, listen up! Besides all that, make sure you put in the effort to level up your faith, add some virtue to the mix, and gain more knowledge."
2 Peter,1,6,"And like, be all about gaining knowledge and having self-control, and like, with that self-control comes patience, yo. And with that patience, strive to be godly and stuff, y'know?"
2 Peter,1,7,"And as part of living a godly life, be kind to one another like true brothers and show love and compassion towards others."
2 Peter,1,8,"If you've got these qualities on lock and they're overflowing in you, they'll make sure you don't stay basic and unproductive in your understanding of our Lord Jesus Christ. Stay woke, fam!"
2 Peter,1,9,"But if you don't have these things, you're like, clueless and can't see what's up ahead. You totally forgot that you got rid of all your past mistakes."
2 Peter,1,10,"Hey fam, listen up! Make sure you put in effort and work hard to solidify your purpose and destiny. 'Cause if you stay on top of things and handle your business, you won't ever stumble or fail, y'know?"
2 Peter,1,11,"Yo, if you stay on this path, you'll be hooked up with a major VIP entrance into the epic kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. It's gonna be lit, trust me."
2 Peter,1,12,"So, I won't slack off in reminding you about all these things, even though you already know them and are grounded in the truth that's happening right now."
2 Peter,1,13,"Yeah, I feel like it's important, while I'm still chillin' in this temporary place, to hype you up by reminding you of some things;"
2 Peter,1,14,"Like, I totally know that soon I'm gonna like, put off this temporary body of mine, just as our main man Jesus Christ has made it clear to me."
2 Peter,1,15,"And like, I'm totally gonna make sure that even after I'm gone, you'll never forget about all this stuff, you know?"
2 Peter,1,16,"Yo, just so you know, when we told y'all about the powerful presence of our main man Jesus Christ, it wasn't some made-up story or fairy tale. We actually saw it go down with our own eyes, no cap, and it was truly mind-blowing."
2 Peter,1,17,"Yo, God totally showed love and respect to Jesus, yo! I mean, when this epic voice came from the ultimate glory, it was like, 'This is my super beloved Son, the one who I'm totally stoked about!'"
2 Peter,1,18,And we totally heard this voice from heaven when we were chilling with him on the holy mount.
2 Peter,1,19,"We've got, like, a super reliable prophecy going on here. It's legit important for you to pay attention to it, kind of like a beam of light breaking through the darkness. Keep holding onto it until the day comes and your hearts get lit up by the day star."
2 Peter,1,20,"First things first, you gotta understand that no scripture prophecy is meant for just one person to decode."
2 Peter,1,21,"Back in the day, prophecies weren't just made up by people, but rather holy people who were inspired by the Holy Spirit. Like, not just in ancient times, but legit anytime."
2 Peter,2,1,"Yo, there were fake prophets back in the day, just like there'll be fake teachers among y'all. They gonna sneak in with some messed up beliefs, straight up denying the Lord who died for 'em, and it's gonna end in their own quick downfall."
2 Peter,2,2,"And, like, a lot of people will totally start following these really bad and harmful ways, which will, like, totally make people talk trash about the path of truth. {lascivious ways: or, like, you know, sexually immoral ways, as some versions say}"
2 Peter,2,3,"And these people, driven by greed, will use deceitful words to exploit and profit off of you. But their punishment, which has been looming for quite some time, cannot be delayed any longer, and their condemnation will not be put to rest."
2 Peter,2,4,"Yo, if you think God let angels slide when they messed up, you're dead wrong. He straight up sent them to hell, and locked them up in some dark chains, waiting for judgment day."
2 Peter,2,5,"And like, God totally didn't hold back and didn't spare the old world, but He totally saved Noah, the eighth bro, who was all about spreading righteousness vibes, and He brought down the whole flood thing on the world full of the ungodly dudes and dudettes."
2 Peter,2,6,"And, like, totally obliterating the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha, because of their wickedness and stuff, as a warning to all those who choose to live in a totally godless way."
2 Peter,2,7,And God saved Lot from being disturbed by the gross behavior of the wicked people:
2 Peter,2,8,"(So like, for that totally righteous dude who lived with them, ya know, he was constantly bugged by all the messed up stuff they did, like seeing it and hearing about it all the time. It seriously messed with his totally righteous soul, man, 'cause they were just doing all these wrong and illegal things, you feel me?)"
2 Peter,2,9,God knows how to protect the righteous from temptations and will save the wicked for judgment day when they will face punishment.
2 Peter,2,10,"But especially those who live according to their worldly desires, pursuing impure passions, and showing disrespect towards authority. They are arrogant and stubborn, unafraid to slander those in power."
2 Peter,2,11,"Unlike angels, who are powerful and strong, they don't go around trash-talking people to the Lord. {some people say, trash-talking themselves}"
2 Peter,2,12,"But like, these people, they're like clueless animals, designed for destruction, go around talking smack about stuff they have no clue about; and they're totally gonna self-destruct due to their own messed up ways."
2 Peter,2,13,"They will get what they deserve for their wickedness, like those who enjoy causing chaos during the day. They're like stains and flaws, having fun deceiving others while they party with you."
2 Peter,2,14,"Their gaze is constantly drawn towards infidelity, and they can't resist the temptation to sin. They deceive those who are easily swayed, and their hearts are consumed by greedy desires. They are like cursed individuals, skilled in coveting what belongs to others. (adultery: Greek term for an adulteress)"
2 Peter,2,15,"They've totally ditched the right path and gotten hella lost, going after the same messed up ways as Balaam, who was all about that love for shady money!"
2 Peter,2,16,But he got called out for his wrongdoing: the idiotic donkey straight up talked and put a stop to the prophet's crazy guff.
2 Peter,2,17,"These things are like empty wells, floating clouds caught in a storm; destined to be covered in eternal darkness."
2 Peter,2,18,"When they use flashy and empty words, they attract and tempt those who have managed to break free from the wrong beliefs, all by appealing to their desires and indulging in excessive pleasures. (Some read it as 'just for a little while')"
2 Peter,2,19,"They be like, 'Yo, we'll give you all the freedom!' But fam, truth is they're just slaves to all the messed up stuff. 'Cause whoever you let control you, that's who ends up owning you, straight up."
2 Peter,2,20,"Like, if someone has like totally escaped all the messed up stuff in the world and found the truth and salvation in Jesus Christ, but then goes and gets all caught up in that same junk again and gets totally beat down, well, let me tell ya, things are gonna be way worse for them than when they started."
2 Peter,2,21,"Like, it would've been way better for them to not even know what righteousness is, instead of knowing it and then totally bailing on the holy commandment they were given."
2 Peter,2,22,"Well, it's like this saying came true for them: the dog goes back to its own vomit, and the pig that got cleaned up just can't resist getting dirty all over again."
2 Peter,3,1,"Hey fam, this is my second letter to all you beloved peeps. I'm hitting you up to get those pure minds of yours lit with some old school memories."
2 Peter,3,2,"Be like, remember what the holy prophets said back in the day, and also the commandment from us, the apostles of the Lord and Saviour, you feel me?"
2 Peter,3,3,"Yo, pay attention to this, fam. In the future, there will be haters who straight up clown on what's good, just doing whatever they please."
2 Peter,3,4,"And like, people are totally doubting when this guy is gonna come back, you know? It's been a while since our ancestors passed away and everything still seems the same since the world started."
2 Peter,3,5,"Yo, peeps be straight up clueless 'bout how back in the day, God spoke and made the heavens exist, and how the earth was formed with water all around it and in it. (Just so you know, 'standing' here means 'consisting', ya dig?)"
2 Peter,3,6,"So, like, the world back then got totally flooded and like, evaporated or something, ya know?"
2 Peter,3,7,"Yo, the sky and the earth we got right now, they're being held in check by that same power, waiting for the day when everything will go up in flames during judgment time, taking out all those who straight up reject God."
2 Peter,3,8,"Yo, fam, listen up! Don't be clueless about this one thing: time is different for the Lord. Like, a single day to Him is like a thousand years to us, and vice versa. Mind-blown, right? üôå"
2 Peter,3,9,"God doesn't procrastinate on His promises like some people think; He's just patient with us, not wanting anyone to be lost, but wanting everyone to change their ways and find forgiveness."
2 Peter,3,10,"But yo, the day of the Lord gonna sneak in like a total stealth-mode ninja; skies gonna go BOOM with a crazy noise, and everything in nature gonna straight up melt from blazing heat. The whole earth and all the stuff on it gonna get burned up, fam."
2 Peter,3,11,"So, since everything is gonna get wiped out, how should you peeps really act - talkin' about being all holy and godly and stuff, ya know?"
2 Peter,3,12,"Eagerly awaiting and speeding up for the day when God shows up, and the skies burst into flames and the elements start melting like crazy heat?"
2 Peter,3,13,"But hey, like, we're totally counting on what God promised, ya know? We're stoked for a whole fresh vibe - new heavens, new earth - where everything is righteous and chill."
2 Peter,3,14,"Yo, fam, since y'all expecting that kinda stuff, make sure to hustle hard so you can be chill with Him, all peaceful and clean, free from any fault."
2 Peter,3,15,"Yo, just remember that our Lord's patience leads to salvation, like how our homie Paul dropped some wisdom he got from above and wrote to y'all, ya feel?"
2 Peter,3,16,"In like, all his letters, he talks about these things. Some of it can be pretty confusing, and those who don't know much or are all over the place twist it up, just like they do with other scriptures, only to bring themselves down."
2 Peter,3,17,"Yo fam, listen up. You guys, who I love so much, already know what's up. But watch out, yo, 'cause you could end up getting caught up in some shady stuff and lose your own stability, for real."
2 Peter,3,18,"Keep leveling up in grace and gaining mad knowledge about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. He's the real deal and deserves all the glory for all time. Amen, fam."
1 John,1,1,"Ok, so like, from the very start, we totally heard it, saw it with our own eyes, checked it out real close, and even touched the Word of life, you know?"
1 John,1,2,"Yo, listen up! The ultimate flex is that life was totally revealed, and we were there to witness it firsthand. We're here to testify and let you in on the secret: eternal life is real and it's been hanging out with the Father all along, and now it's been revealed to us too."
1 John,1,3,"OMG, we're totally spilling the tea about what we've witnessed and heard to you, so you can be part of our squad. And kudos, our squad is all about hanging out with the OG, the Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ."
1 John,1,4,We're writing this to you so that you can experience ultimate joy.
1 John,1,5,"So, here's the deal: We've heard straight from the source and now we're letting you in on it. God? Total ray of light. Darkness? Doesn't even stand a chance in His presence. No shady stuff going on here, folks."
1 John,1,6,"If we claim to be tight with God, but still live a messed up life, we frontin' and not being real with ourselves."
1 John,1,7,"But if we stay true to ourselves, just like He does, we'll have a strong bond with each other, and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ will wipe away all our mistakes."
1 John,1,8,"If we act like we're perfect and have no flaws, we're just fooling ourselves, and we're far from being real."
1 John,1,9,"If we own up to our mistakes, he's totally got our back and is down to forgive us our wrongdoings and wipe out all the bad vibes."
1 John,1,10,"If we act like we've never messed up, we're basically calling Him a liar and rejecting His truth."
1 John,2,1,"Hey fam, listen up! I'm writing this to y'all, my little fam, so you don't go doing any sinful stuff. But if anyone does mess up, don't sweat it, 'cause we got Jesus Christ on our side. He's always got our backs, keeping us in line with the big guy upstairs, our heavenly Father."
1 John,2,2,"And he like totally took on our sins and made things right: not just for us, but for the entire world, fam."
1 John,2,3,"And this is how we know that we actually know him, if we stay true to his commandments."
1 John,2,4,"If someone claims they know him but doesn't follow his rules, they're straight up lying and definitely not about that truth life."
1 John,2,5,"But whoever stays true to their word, truly embodies God's love: this is how we know we are connected with Him."
1 John,2,6,"If someone claims they're in Him, then they need to make sure they live their life just like He did."
1 John,2,7,"Yo, fam, I ain't droppin' some fresh instructions on ya. It's all about an OG commandment that's been with you since day one. This commandment is like the truth bomb you've been hearing since the start."
1 John,2,8,"Yo, here's the deal: I got a fresh commandment for y'all. It's legit, true for both Him and all of you. Why? 'Cause the darkness is gone, and now the real light is shining bright."
1 John,2,9,"If someone claims to be all enlightened and stuff, but still has mad hate for their own bro, they straight up stuck in the dark, like, forever."
1 John,2,10,"If you love your bro, you're living in the light, and there's no reason to trip up. #NoDrama #SolidAsARock üí™"
1 John,2,11,"If you hate your bro, you're living in the dark, wandering aimlessly without a clue, 'cause that darkness has totally blinded you."
1 John,2,12,"Yo, listen up, fam! Just droppin' some words to all y'all young ones out there. Your sins? Totally wiped clean, thanks to Him. No need to stress, He's got your back!"
1 John,2,13,"Yo, listen up fam. I'm writing to all you dads out there 'cause you've known Him since day one. And to all you young fellas, keepin' it real 'cause you've smashed the wicked one. And to all you kiddos, holdin' it down 'cause you've known the Father, aight?"
1 John,2,14,"Yo, listen up, dads! I'm reaching out to y'all because you've known this dude from the very start. And hey, young bloods! I'm hittin' you up because you've got that inner strength, the word of God stayin' with you, and you've totally defeated the evil one. Keep it up! üôå"
1 John,2,15,"Don't be all obsessed with this world or the stuff in it, ya know? If anyone is too caught up in the ways of the world, they ain't really feelin' the love from the Big Guy upstairs."
1 John,2,16,"Like, everything that's all hyped up in this world - you know, the cravings for physical pleasure, the desire for fancy things that catch our eye, and the need to show off - is totally not cool with the big guy upstairs. It's all part of this worldly scene, man."
1 John,2,17,"Like, everything in this world will eventually fade away, along with all its desires and stuff. But yo, anyone who does what God wants them to do will last forever, no cap."
1 John,2,18,"Hey fam, listen up! It's the end of the line, no cap: just like you've heard that the antichrist is gonna show up, there are already loads of 'em around. That's how we know we're living in the last days, like for real."
1 John,2,19,"They left our crew, but they were never really one of us; if they truly belonged, they would still be riding with us. They dipped so it would be obvious that they weren't part of our squad."
1 John,2,20,"But y'all have this lit spiritual power from the Holy One, and y'all know all the things."
1 John,2,21,"I didn't hit you up 'cause you're clueless, but 'cause you already got the 411, and for real, no cap, lies ain't part of the truth."
1 John,2,22,"Like, seriously, who can even be considered a total liar except for the one who straight-up denies that Jesus is the ultimate Savior? That person is like, the epitome of being against everything good, since they reject both God the Father and His Son, Jesus."
1 John,2,23,"If anyone doesn't recognize the Son, then they're not recognizing the Father either. But if you acknowledge the Son, you're also acknowledging the Father."
1 John,2,24,"So, like, keep holding on to what you've heard since the very beginning. If you keep holding on to what you've heard since the very beginning, then you'll totally be connected to the Son and the Father."
1 John,2,25,"And this is the sick promise that he's totally given us, like, eternal life. Dope, right?"
1 John,2,26,"So, like, I've written this for you about those who try to lead you astray."
1 John,2,27,"But the divine power that you've acquired from him stays within you, and you don't even need anyone else to teach you because that same power within you will guide you and reveal the truth about everything. It's not deceiving you or leading you astray, and just like it has already taught you, you will continue to stay connected to it."
1 John,2,28,"Yo, fam, stay connected with Him, so when He shows up, we can be all chill and confident, not embarrassed in front of Him."
1 John,2,29,"If y'all know that he's righteous, then y'all know that anyone who does what's right has been born of him. {know that everyone who: or, do y'all know everyone who} {has been born: in the funky Gr. version, it's like, has already been born. So yeah.}"
1 John,3,1,"Yo, listen up, peeps! Just check out the insane amount of love our Father has given us by calling us His own children. That's right, we're legit the sons and daughters of God. But here's the deal: the world might not get us or understand us, 'cause it didn't even know or recognize Him in the first place."
1 John,3,2,"Hey fam, listen up! Right now, we're the homies of God, and we can't fully grasp yet what we're gonna become. But here's what we do know - when God shows up, we're gonna be just like Him. We'll see Him as He really is, no cap."
1 John,3,3,"And every person who has this hope within them makes an effort to cleanse themselves, just as they are already pure."
1 John,3,4,"Yo, listen up! If you're out there doing sin, it means you're breaking the law, 'cause sin is basically going against what the law says."
1 John,3,5,"And you know that he came to reveal himself to cleanse us from our wrongdoings; and in him, there is no wrongdoing."
1 John,3,6,"If you stay connected with him, you won't be all about sinning. If you're into sinning, then you haven't really gotten to know him or seen what he's about."
1 John,3,7,"Yo, listen up, fam! Don't let anyone fool you: if you live righteously, you're just as righteous as they are, no cap."
1 John,3,8,"Anyone who does bad stuff is basically on the devil's team, 'cause the devil has been messing up right from the start. But the Son of God came into the world to wreck the devil's plans and undo all the messed up things he's been doing."
1 John,3,9,"If you're truly a child of God, you won't be out there committing sin. God's legacy stays with you, making it impossible for you to mess up because you're born of God. {has been born: or, has already been born}"
1 John,3,10,"This shows who's part of God's squad and who's on the devil's team: anyone who doesn't do good things isn't with God, and if you don't show love to your homies, you're not on God's level either."
1 John,3,11,"Yo fam, this is the lit truth that you've been hearing since day one - we need to show mad love to one another. It's straight up a commandment, fam. üôå"
1 John,3,12,"Not like Cain, who was, like, pure evil vibes and straight up killed his own brother. And like, why did he do that? 'Cause his own actions were wicked, while his brother was all about that righteousness."
1 John,3,13,"Don't be shocked, fam, if the world be hatin' on you."
1 John,3,14,"We all know that we've leveled up from the darkness to the light, 'cause we're all about that love for our crew. Anyone who's not showing love to their fam is stuck in the dark side."
1 John,3,15,"If you hate your bro, it's like being a straight-up killer. And you gotta know that eternal life doesn't vibe with murderers, no cap."
1 John,3,16,"We can totally see how much God loves us because he straight up sacrificed his life for us, and yo, we should be ready to sacrifice our own lives for our peeps."
1 John,3,17,"If someone has all the cool stuff in this world and sees their bro in need but refuses to show any empathy, how can they claim to have God's love in them?"
1 John,3,18,"Yo fam, my homies, let's not be all talk when it comes to love, just sayin'. It's about showin' love through our actions, keepin' it real and genuine."
1 John,3,19,"And this is how we know that we are on the right path, and how we can be confident in our hearts before Him. {assure: Gr. persuade}"
1 John,3,20,"If our heart tells us we messed up, God is even bigger than our heart, and knows everything."
1 John,3,21,"Hey fam, if our hearts don't guilt trip us, then we're confident in our relationship with God."
1 John,3,22,"And whatever we ask for, we get from God because we follow His rules and do things that make Him happy."
1 John,3,23,"Yo, listen up! This is what God wants from us: believe in his Son Jesus Christ and show mad love to each other, just like he told us to do."
1 John,3,24,"If you're down to follow his rules, you're chillin' in his presence and he's chillin' in you too. And that's how we know he's vibin' with us, 'cause he blessed us with his Spirit."
1 John,4,1,"Yo, fam, don't just trust any vibe you feel, but legit check if it's coming from God. So many fake spiritual influencers out there, spreading lies and messing with peeps' minds."
1 John,4,2,"So like, here's how you can figure out if someone is all about God: if they're all like, 'Yo, Jesus Christ totally came in the flesh,' then you know they're on the godly path for real."
1 John,4,3,"If a spirit doesn't acknowledge that Jesus Christ has arrived in human form, then it's definitely not from God. That's basically the spirit of the antichrist that we've heard about, and guess what? It's already here, in our world right now."
1 John,4,4,"Hey fam, you're straight up from God, like His squad of little children, and you straight up crushed those haters. 'Cause the power within you is way bigger than the negativity in the world."
1 John,4,5,"They're all about that worldly life, so they talk about worldly things and the worldly crowd actually pays attention to them."
1 John,4,6,We belong to God: those who know God listen to us; those who do not belong to God do not listen to us. This is how we can identify the true spirit from the false spirit.
1 John,4,7,"Hey fam, we gotta show mad love to each other, 'cause love comes straight from God. Anyone who's all about that love is totally born of God and knows Him like no other. üôåüèº"
1 John,4,8,"If you don't love, you don't really know God, 'cause God is all about the love vibes."
1 John,4,9,"God showed us His love by sending His one and only Son to the world, so that we can live through Him."
1 John,4,10,"Yo, check this out - this is what love is all about: it's not about us loving God, but it's about God loving us, so much that He sent His Son to make things right for us and take away all our sins."
1 John,4,11,"Hey fam, if God showed mad love for us, we gotta show love to each other too."
1 John,4,12,"No one has ever actually seen God. But if we show love and care towards each other, it means that God is living within us and his love shines through us."
1 John,4,13,"This is how we know that we're connected to him, and he's connected to us, because he's blessed us with his Spirit."
1 John,4,14,"And let me tell you, we've totally witnessed it and we're here to confirm that the Dad sent the Son to save the whole world, no doubt about it."
1 John,4,15,"Anyone who openly acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God vibes with them and they vibe with God."
1 John,4,16,"And like, we totally get it and believe in the love that God has for us. God is all about love, you know? Whoever lives in love like, lives in God, and God lives in them too. It's all about that love vibe, man."
1 John,4,17,"This is how our love becomes top-notch, so that we can be super confident when judgement day comes: because we're totally rocking it just like He does in this world."
1 John,4,18,"Love is free from fear; it's like the ultimate fear-buster: because fear seriously messes with your head. If you're all about fear, then you've got some work to do on the love front."
1 John,4,19,"We stan him, cause he showed us love first."
1 John,4,20,"If someone says they're all about God but straight up hates on their bro, they're straight up trippin'. Like, how can they claim to love a higher power they've never even seen when they can't even show love to a person they actually have seen?"
1 John,4,21,"So, like, here's the deal: God straight up told us that if you love Him, you gotta show love to your fellow human beings too. It's, like, a whole package deal, you know?"
1 John,5,1,"If you have faith that Jesus is the real deal, you're totally connected with God, and if you love God, you automatically love everyone who's born from Him too. {has been born: Gr. has been born}"
1 John,5,2,"Bro, here's how we know we're all about loving God's peeps: when we love God and stay true to his rules."
1 John,5,3,"Because, like, that's how much God loves us, you know? He's all about us following His rules, and trust me, His rules are not even a big deal or anything."
1 John,5,4,"Like, anyone who's legit born of God can totally slay the world, man! And that's, like, the ultimate win, dude. Our faith is what gives us that mad victory over the world, yo. Like, it's already happened, you know? It's not just some future thing. Our faith is lit!"
1 John,5,5,"Like, who actually conquers the world? Only the ones who truly believe that Jesus is God's Son, you know?"
1 John,5,6,"Yo, this is the one who came through water and blood, ya feel me? Jesus Christ, not just through water, but through water and blood. And let me tell you, it's the Spirit that's givin' us the facts 'cause the Spirit is all about that truth."
1 John,5,7,"Yo, up in heaven, there's three total legends: the big man himself, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And get this, here's the coolest part‚Äîthey're all one squad, inseparable and unstoppable."
1 John,5,8,"Yo, listen up fam, here's the deal: There are three things that straight up testify on earth - the Spirit, the water, and the blood - and they all be on the same page, no cap."
1 John,5,9,"Dude, listen up! If we trust what people say, we gotta remember that God's testimony is way stronger. He's vouched for His Son and it's legit!"
1 John,5,10,"If you really vibe with the Son of God, you'll have this incredible self-assurance. But if you don't trust in God, you're basically calling Him a liar because you're not acknowledging the amazing proof He provided about His Son."
1 John,5,11,"Yo, listen up! Here's the deal: God has hooked us up with eternal life, and we can only find it through His Son."
1 John,5,12,"If you got Jesus, you got the good life vibes; but if you don't got Jesus, sorry but life's not gonna be popping."
1 John,5,13,"I wrote these things for all you believers in the Son of God, so that you can be sure that you have eternal life and continue to have faith in the Son of God's name."
1 John,5,14,"And here's the cool thing: we can totally trust Him. If we ask for anything that lines up with His plan, He listens to us, you know?"
1 John,5,15,"And like, if we know that he's totally listening to us, whatever we ask for, we can be totally confident that we'll get what we've been wanting from him."
1 John,5,16,"If one person sees their friend doing something wrong but it's not a really serious mistake, they should talk to them and help them get back on track. Like, be there for them and support them. But there are some mistakes that are really bad and lead to spiritual death. I'm not saying we shouldn't care about those people, but, you know, it may not be the same kind of help we can offer, like praying for them."
1 John,5,17,"Sin is doing anything that goes against what's right, and there are some sins that aren't deadly."
1 John,5,18,"We know that whoever is on God's squad doesn't mess up, but the one who's part of God's family keeps themselves in check, and that evil dude can't even lay a finger on them. {has been born: Gr. has been born}"
1 John,5,19,"And we're aware that we belong to God, while the entire world rests in wickedness."
1 John,5,20,"And we all know that the Son of God has arrived and blessed us with knowledge, so we can really know the true one. We're connected to the actual truth through his Son, Jesus Christ. This is the real deal, the genuine God, and everlasting life."
1 John,5,21,"Hey fam, make sure you stay away from idols, aight? Amen."
2 John,1,1,"Yo, shoutout to the chosen queen and her squad, y'all know I'm tight with y'all and I ain't the only one. We all about that realness and truth up in here."
2 John,1,2,"For real, the truth lives in us and will be with us forever."
2 John,1,3,"Wishing you all the good stuff like grace, mercy, and peace from the OG, God the Father, and Jesus Christ, the OG's son. Keep it real and spread love, fam. Peace out. (Note: Gr. means 'shall be'.)"
2 John,1,4,"I was so stoked when I saw that your kids were totally keeping it real and staying on the right path, just like we've been told to by the Big Guy."
2 John,1,5,"Hey, I just wanted to ask, girl, not like I'm giving you some brand new rule or anything, but just a reminder of what we've known all along, that we should spread love to each other."
2 John,1,6,"And dude, this is what love is all about - following his rules. His commandments are like the ultimate guidance. Since day one, we've been told to stick with it and keep walking in that path."
2 John,1,7,"Bruh, there are so many fakers out there, straight up deceivers, who front like Jesus Christ never even came in human form. That's some next-level deception right there, basically making them anti-Jesus."
2 John,1,8,"Yo, check yourselves before you wreck yourselves, so we don't lose all the dope stuff we've accomplished and instead, we can secure a major come-up. Just sayin', make sure you keep what you've gained, aight?"
2 John,1,9,"If anyone disobeys or rejects the teachings of Christ, they don't have God. But if someone stays true to the teachings of Christ, they have a connection with both the Father and the Son."
2 John,1,10,"If someone comes to you and doesn't adhere to this teaching, don't let them into your crib and don't even give them a shout-out from the big man upstairs."
2 John,1,11,"Because if someone supports and encourages someone who is doing wrong, they also become responsible for their bad actions."
2 John,1,12,"Yo, I got a lot to say to you, but I ain't tryna write it all down on paper and ink. Nah, I'm hoping I can come see you in person, chat face to face, you know? That way, our happiness will be off the charts. For real!"
2 John,1,13,The fam of your chosen sis says hey. Amen.
3 John,1,1,"Yo, this message is for my homie Gaius, who I truly love. Word."
3 John,1,2,"Hey fam, I really hope that you thrive in everything and take good care of your mind, body, and soul. Keep shining! ‚ú®"
3 John,1,3,"I was so stoked when the squad came through and confirmed how real you are, staying true to yourself and the truth."
3 John,1,4,There's legit nothing that brings me more happiness than finding out my squad is keeping it real and staying true to themselves.
3 John,1,5,"Yo, my homie, you're always stayin' true to the fam and even lend a hand to those you don't know like a boss;"
3 John,1,6,"They have totally vouched for your generosity in front of the whole church fam. So if you hook them up with what they need to keep their journey going, in a way that's lit and honoring to God, you'll be doing something awesome. (Translation note: 'worthy of God' means totally deserving and super dope)."
3 John,1,7,"They left for the sake of his name, without taking anything from the non-believers."
3 John,1,8,"So, like, we should totally accept those peeps, ya know? That's how we become homies who help spread the truth. {joint-labourers: or, people who work together}"
3 John,1,9,"I sent a message to the church, but Diotrephes, who's all about being in charge, doesn't accept us."
3 John,1,10,"So, if I show up, I'll definitely remember all the stuff he's pulling ‚Äì talking trash about us with mean words. And it's not just that, he's also not cool with hanging out with the homies, and even tries to stop others who want to, kicking them out of the crew."
3 John,1,11,"Yo fam, don't be about that evil life, but be all about that good life. Anyone who does good stuff is straight up from God, but anyone who does evil hasn't even seen God, you feel me?"
3 John,1,12,"Yo, Demetrius is like, widely respected by everyone, even by the truth itself, no cap. And we're vouching for him too, and y'all know our word is legit."
3 John,1,13,"Yo, I got a lot to say, but I ain't gonna type it all out with ink and pen for you:"
3 John,1,14,"But I'm confident I'll see you soon, and we can talk in person."
3 John,1,15,"Hey, what's up? Sending you good vibes and peace. Our squad says hi too. Make sure to give individual shoutouts to our peeps. Like, connect with them on a personal level, you know? (By the way, 'face to face' in Greek means like direct and real conversations, as opposed to like online chatting or phone calls)."
Jude,1,1,"Yo, it's Jude, just your boy James' brother, servin' it up for Jesus Christ. This one goes out to all you homies rockin' that holy vibe, handpicked by God the Father, and stayin' tight with Jesus Christ. You know who you are, and you know you're called for greatness."
Jude,1,2,"May you have heaps of mercy, peace, and love coming your way."
Jude,1,3,"Yo fam, listen up. When I was putting in mad effort to write to y'all about our shared salvation, it was real important for me to reach out and encourage you to straight up fight for the faith that was passed down to the holy peeps."
Jude,1,4,"Yo, peep this: there are these sneaky dudes who snuck in without anyone noticing, and get this‚Äîthey were predestined way back in the day for this punishment. They're downright ungodly, ya know, they're all about twisting God's grace into something sleazy and straight up denying our one and only Lord God, as well as our boy Jesus Christ."
Jude,1,5,"So, just a quick reminder, even though you probably already knew this, but the deal is that the Lord totally rescued the people from Egypt back in the day. But here's the kicker: He ended up taking down those who didn't have faith in Him."
Jude,1,6,"And those angels who didn't stick to their original gig, but dipped from their own crib, are now locked up with eternal chains in darkness, waiting for the big judgment day to hit."
Jude,1,7,"Like, remember how Sodom and Gomorrha, and the other cities around them were just all about fornication and getting it on with some unusual folks? Well, consider them a serious example, because they totally faced the consequences and got burned by eternal fire. Woah, the Greek word for 'strange' actually means 'other'! Cool fact, bro."
Jude,1,8,"And these dudes who always have wild dreams, totally mess up their bodies, think they're better than everyone else, and trash talk people in power."
Jude,1,9,"But, like, Michael the archangel, when he was totally like arguing with the devil about the body of Moses, he didn't even dare to like throw shade at him with, like, insults or anything. He was just like, 'Yo, the Lord will handle you.'"
Jude,1,10,"But these haters just be talkin' smack about stuff they ain't got a clue about. They be actin' all wild and dumb, messin' things up with their natural instincts."
Jude,1,11,"They're in big trouble! They've followed the same messed up path as Cain, chasing after their own desires like Balaam did for some cash, and ended up destroyed because of their stubbornness like Core."
Jude,1,12,"Yo, these people be straight up buzzkills at your lit charity parties. They just there to stuff their faces without a care, like some dry clouds just floating around with no water. And them trees? Total duds. They ain't producing no fruit, they're like dead twice and got their roots ripped out."
Jude,1,13,"Like, these waves in the ocean, they're, like, so wild and out of control, showing off their own shame, It's just like when you see those stars that seem to be lost, like, wandering without a purpose. They're totally gonna end up in, like, eternal darkness, you know? No way out!"
Jude,1,14,"Yo, Enoch, he was like the seventh dude from Adam, right? Well, he totally predicted this, saying, 'Yo, check it out, the Lord's gonna roll up with, like, a massive crew of his saints.'"
Jude,1,15,"To call out and expose all the ungodly people, making them aware of their ungodly actions and the disrespectful words that sinners have spoken against Him."
Jude,1,16,"These peeps be all about complaining and whining, doin' whatever the heck they want and spouting off fancy words to impress others and get ahead."
Jude,1,17,"Yo, fam, don't forget the words our homies, the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, dropped before."
Jude,1,18,"So, like, there were these people who totally said that in the end times there would be haters, ya know? They would just do whatever they wanted without any regard for God or anything."
Jude,1,19,"These people are the ones who isolate themselves, all about their own desires, and they don't have that spiritual vibe."
Jude,1,20,"But yo, fam, like, workin' on yourselves, straight up buildin' up that super holy faith of yours, keepin' it 100 and prayin' in the Holy Ghost."
Jude,1,21,"Stay connected with God's love and eagerly anticipate the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, leading to everlasting life."
Jude,1,22,"And like, with a little more empathy, we can totally make a positive impact, you know?"
Jude,1,23,And some save others by being cautious and rescuing them from danger; despising even the clothes stained by unwholesome activities.
Jude,1,24,"To the one who's got your back and can totally prevent you from tripping, and to show you off all perfect and flawless in the epicness of his amazingness, with like, crazy happiness!"
Jude,1,25,"Shoutout to the all-knowing God, our ultimate Saviour! Let's give Him props for being straight-up amazing with all His glory, majesty, dominion, and power, both right now and forever. Amen, fam!"
