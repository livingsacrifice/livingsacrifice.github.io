1 Chronicles,29,25,"So the LORD exalted Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel."
1 Chronicles,29,26,Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
1 Chronicles,29,27,"And the period that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,29,28,"So he died in a good old age, full of days and riches and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place."
1 Chronicles,29,29,"Now the acts of King David, first and last, indeed they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,"
1 Chronicles,29,30,"with all his reign and his might, and the events that happened to him, to Israel, and to all the kingdoms of the lands."
2 Chronicles,1,1,"Now Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him and exalted him exceedingly."
2 Chronicles,1,2,"And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ houses."
2 Chronicles,1,3,"Then Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for the tabernacle of meeting with God was there, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness."
2 Chronicles,1,4,"But David had brought up the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim to the place David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,1,5,"Now the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD; Solomon and the assembly sought Him there."
2 Chronicles,1,6,"And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it."
2 Chronicles,1,7,"On that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, “Ask! What shall I give you?”"
2 Chronicles,1,8,"And Solomon said to God: “You have shown great mercy to David my father, and have made me king in his place."
2 Chronicles,1,9,"Now, O LORD God, let Your promise to David my father be established, for You have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude."
2 Chronicles,1,10,"Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of Yours?”"
2 Chronicles,1,11,"Then God said to Solomon: “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches or wealth or honor or the life of your enemies, nor have you asked long life—but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge My people over whom I have made you king—"
2 Chronicles,1,12,"wisdom and knowledge are granted to you; and I will give you riches and wealth and honor, such as none of the kings have had who were before you, nor shall any after you have the like.”"
2 Chronicles,1,13,"So Solomon came to Jerusalem from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tabernacle of meeting, and reigned over Israel."
2 Chronicles,1,14,"And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,1,15,"Also the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland."
2 Chronicles,1,16,And Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh; the king’s merchants bought them in Keveh at the current price.
2 Chronicles,1,17,"They also acquired and imported from Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred and fifty; thus, through their agents, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria."
2 Chronicles,2,1,"Then Solomon determined to build a temple for the name of the LORD, and a royal house for himself."
2 Chronicles,2,2,"Solomon selected seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand to quarry stone in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them."
2 Chronicles,2,3,"Then Solomon sent to Hiram king of Tyre, saying: As you have dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build himself a house to dwell in, so deal with me."
2 Chronicles,2,4,"Behold, I am building a temple for the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to Him, to burn before Him sweet incense, for the continual showbread, for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the New Moons, and on the set feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance forever to Israel."
2 Chronicles,2,5,"And the temple which I build will be great, for our God is greater than all gods."
2 Chronicles,2,6,"But who is able to build Him a temple, since heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Him? Who am I then, that I should build Him a temple, except to burn sacrifice before Him?"
2 Chronicles,2,7,"Therefore send me at once a man skillful to work in gold and silver, in bronze and iron, in purple and crimson and blue, who has skill to engrave with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided."
2 Chronicles,2,8,"Also send me cedar and cypress and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and indeed my servants will be with your servants,"
2 Chronicles,2,9,"to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the temple which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful."
2 Chronicles,2,10,"And indeed I will give to your servants, the woodsmen who cut timber, twenty thousand kors of ground wheat, twenty thousand kors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil."
2 Chronicles,2,11,"Then Hiram king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon: Because the LORD loves His people, He has made you king over them."
2 Chronicles,2,12,"Hiram also said: Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, for He has given King David a wise son, endowed with prudence and understanding, who will build a temple for the LORD and a royal house for himself!"
2 Chronicles,2,13,"And now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, Huram my master craftsman"
2 Chronicles,2,14,"(the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre), skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, purple and blue, fine linen and crimson, and to make any engraving and to accomplish any plan which may be given to him, with your skillful men and with the skillful men of my lord David your father."
2 Chronicles,2,15,"Now therefore, the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants."
2 Chronicles,2,16,"And we will cut wood from Lebanon, as much as you need; we will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, and you will carry it up to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,2,17,"Then Solomon numbered all the aliens who were in the land of Israel, after the census in which David his father had numbered them; and there were found to be one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred."
2 Chronicles,2,18,"And he made seventy thousand of them bearers of burdens, eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred overseers to make the people work."
2 Chronicles,3,1,"Now Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
2 Chronicles,3,2,And he began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.
2 Chronicles,3,3,This is the foundation which Solomon laid for building the house of God: The length was sixty cubits (by cubits according to the former measure) and the width twenty cubits.
2 Chronicles,3,4,"And the vestibule that was in front of the sanctuary was twenty cubits long across the width of the house, and the height was one hundred and twenty. He overlaid the inside with pure gold."
2 Chronicles,3,5,"The larger room he paneled with cypress which he overlaid with fine gold, and he carved palm trees and chainwork on it."
2 Chronicles,3,6,"And he decorated the house with precious stones for beauty, and the gold was gold from Parvaim."
2 Chronicles,3,7,"He also overlaid the house—the beams and doorposts, its walls and doors—with gold; and he carved cherubim on the walls."
2 Chronicles,3,8,"And he made the Most Holy Place. Its length was according to the width of the house, twenty cubits, and its width twenty cubits. He overlaid it with six hundred talents of fine gold."
2 Chronicles,3,9,The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold; and he overlaid the upper area with gold.
2 Chronicles,3,10,"In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim, fashioned by carving, and overlaid them with gold."
2 Chronicles,3,11,"The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits in overall length: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing was five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub;"
2 Chronicles,3,12,"one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing also was five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub."
2 Chronicles,3,13,"The wings of these cherubim spanned twenty cubits overall. They stood on their feet, and they faced inward."
2 Chronicles,3,14,"And he made the veil of blue, purple, crimson, and fine linen, and wove cherubim into it."
2 Chronicles,3,15,"Also he made in front of the temple two pillars thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits."
2 Chronicles,3,16,"He made wreaths of chainwork, as in the inner sanctuary, and put them on top of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the wreaths of chainwork."
2 Chronicles,3,17,"Then he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left; he called the name of the one on the right hand Jachin, and the name of the one on the left Boaz."
2 Chronicles,4,1,"Moreover he made a bronze altar: twenty cubits was its length, twenty cubits its width, and ten cubits its height."
2 Chronicles,4,2,"Then he made the Sea of cast bronze, ten cubits from one brim to the other; it was completely round. Its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference."
2 Chronicles,4,3,"And under it was the likeness of oxen encircling it all around, ten to a cubit, all the way around the Sea. The oxen were cast in two rows, when it was cast."
2 Chronicles,4,4,"It stood on twelve oxen: three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; the Sea was set upon them, and all their back parts pointed inward."
2 Chronicles,4,5,"It was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It contained three thousand baths."
2 Chronicles,4,6,"He also made ten lavers, and put five on the right side and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as they offered for the burnt offering they would wash in them, but the Sea was for the priests to wash in."
2 Chronicles,4,7,"And he made ten lampstands of gold according to their design, and set them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left."
2 Chronicles,4,8,"He also made ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred bowls of gold."
2 Chronicles,4,9,"Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court and doors for the court; and he overlaid these doors with bronze."
2 Chronicles,4,10,"He set the Sea on the right side, toward the southeast."
2 Chronicles,4,11,Then Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls. So Huram finished doing the work that he was to do for King Solomon for the house of God:
2 Chronicles,4,12,the two pillars and the bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the two pillars; the two networks covering the two bowl-shaped capitals which were on top of the pillars;
2 Chronicles,4,13,"four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on the pillars);"
2 Chronicles,4,14,he also made carts and the lavers on the carts;
2 Chronicles,4,15,one Sea and twelve oxen under it;
2 Chronicles,4,16,"also the pots, the shovels, the forks—and all their articles Huram his master craftsman made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,4,17,"In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in clay molds, between Succoth and Zeredah."
2 Chronicles,4,18,And Solomon had all these articles made in such great abundance that the weight of the bronze was not determined.
2 Chronicles,4,19,Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of God: the altar of gold and the tables on which was the showbread;
2 Chronicles,4,20,"the lampstands with their lamps of pure gold, to burn in the prescribed manner in front of the inner sanctuary,"
2 Chronicles,4,21,"with the flowers and the lamps and the wick-trimmers of gold, of purest gold;"
2 Chronicles,4,22,"the trimmers, the bowls, the ladles, and the censers of pure gold. As for the entry of the sanctuary, its inner doors to the Most Holy Place, and the doors of the main hall of the temple, were gold."
2 Chronicles,5,1,So all the work that Solomon had done for the house of the LORD was finished; and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had dedicated: the silver and the gold and all the furnishings. And he put them in the treasuries of the house of God.
2 Chronicles,5,2,"Now Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel, in Jerusalem, that they might bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD up from the City of David, which is Zion."
2 Chronicles,5,3,"Therefore all the men of Israel assembled with the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month."
2 Chronicles,5,4,"So all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark."
2 Chronicles,5,5,"Then they brought up the ark, the tabernacle of meeting, and all the holy furnishings that were in the tabernacle. The priests and the Levites brought them up."
2 Chronicles,5,6,"Also King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him before the ark, were sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude."
2 Chronicles,5,7,"Then the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the temple, to the Most Holy Place, under the wings of the cherubim."
2 Chronicles,5,8,"For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles."
2 Chronicles,5,9,"The poles extended so that the ends of the poles of the ark could be seen from the holy place, in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day."
2 Chronicles,5,10,"Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they had come out of Egypt."
2 Chronicles,5,11,"And it came to pass when the priests came out of the Most Holy Place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, without keeping to their divisions),"
2 Chronicles,5,12,"and the Levites who were the singers, all those of Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, stood at the east end of the altar, clothed in white linen, having cymbals, stringed instruments and harps, and with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets—"
2 Chronicles,5,13,"indeed it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD, and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying: “For He is good, For His mercy endures forever,” that the house, the house of the LORD, was filled with a cloud,"
2 Chronicles,5,14,so that the priests could not continue ministering because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God.
2 Chronicles,6,1,Then Solomon spoke: “The LORD said He would dwell in the dark cloud.
2 Chronicles,6,2,"I have surely built You an exalted house, And a place for You to dwell in forever.”"
2 Chronicles,6,3,"Then the king turned around and blessed the whole assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing."
2 Chronicles,6,4,"And he said: “Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who has fulfilled with His hands what He spoke with His mouth to my father David, saying,"
2 Chronicles,6,5,"‘Since the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt, I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house, that My name might be there, nor did I choose any man to be a ruler over My people Israel."
2 Chronicles,6,6,"Yet I have chosen Jerusalem, that My name may be there, and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.’"
2 Chronicles,6,7,Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a temple for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,6,8,"But the LORD said to my father David, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build a temple for My name, you did well in that it was in your heart."
2 Chronicles,6,9,"Nevertheless you shall not build the temple, but your son who will come from your body, he shall build the temple for My name.’"
2 Chronicles,6,10,"So the LORD has fulfilled His word which He spoke, and I have filled the position of my father David, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised; and I have built the temple for the name of the LORD God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,6,11,"And there I have put the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD which He made with the children of Israel.”"
2 Chronicles,6,12,"Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands"
2 Chronicles,6,13,"(for Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and he stood on it, knelt down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven);"
2 Chronicles,6,14,"and he said: “LORD God of Israel, there is no God in heaven or on earth like You, who keep Your covenant and mercy with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts."
2 Chronicles,6,15,"You have kept what You promised Your servant David my father; You have both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day."
2 Chronicles,6,16,"Therefore, LORD God of Israel, now keep what You promised Your servant David my father, saying, ‘You shall not fail to have a man sit before Me on the throne of Israel, only if your sons take heed to their way, that they walk in My law as you have walked before Me.’"
2 Chronicles,6,17,"And now, O LORD God of Israel, let Your word come true, which You have spoken to Your servant David."
2 Chronicles,6,18,"“But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You. How much less this temple which I have built!"
2 Chronicles,6,19,"Yet regard the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O LORD my God, and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before You:"
2 Chronicles,6,20,"that Your eyes may be open toward this temple day and night, toward the place where You said You would put Your name, that You may hear the prayer which Your servant makes toward this place."
2 Chronicles,6,21,"And may You hear the supplications of Your servant and of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven Your dwelling place, and when You hear, forgive."
2 Chronicles,6,22,"“If anyone sins against his neighbor, and is forced to take an oath, and comes and takes an oath before Your altar in this temple,"
2 Chronicles,6,23,"then hear from heaven, and act, and judge Your servants, bringing retribution on the wicked by bringing his way on his own head, and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness."
2 Chronicles,6,24,"“Or if Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and return and confess Your name, and pray and make supplication before You in this temple,"
2 Chronicles,6,25,"then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You gave to them and their fathers."
2 Chronicles,6,26,"“When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, when they pray toward this place and confess Your name, and turn from their sin because You afflict them,"
2 Chronicles,6,27,"then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance."
2 Chronicles,6,28,"“When there is famine in the land, pestilence or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers; when their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is;"
2 Chronicles,6,29,"whatever prayer, whatever supplication is made by anyone, or by all Your people Israel, when each one knows his own burden and his own grief, and spreads out his hands to this temple:"
2 Chronicles,6,30,"then hear from heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive, and give to everyone according to all his ways, whose heart You know (for You alone know the hearts of the sons of men),"
2 Chronicles,6,31,"that they may fear You, to walk in Your ways as long as they live in the land which You gave to our fathers."
2 Chronicles,6,32,"“Moreover, concerning a foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel, but has come from a far country for the sake of Your great name and Your mighty hand and Your outstretched arm, when they come and pray in this temple;"
2 Chronicles,6,33,"then hear from heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, that all peoples of the earth may know Your name and fear You, as do Your people Israel, and that they may know that this temple which I have built is called by Your name."
2 Chronicles,6,34,"“When Your people go out to battle against their enemies, wherever You send them, and when they pray to You toward this city which You have chosen and the temple which I have built for Your name,"
2 Chronicles,6,35,"then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause."
2 Chronicles,6,36,"“When they sin against You (for there is no one who does not sin), and You become angry with them and deliver them to the enemy, and they take them captive to a land far or near;"
2 Chronicles,6,37,"yet when they come to themselves in the land where they were carried captive, and repent, and make supplication to You in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned, we have done wrong, and have committed wickedness’;"
2 Chronicles,6,38,"and when they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have been carried captive, and pray toward their land which You gave to their fathers, the city which You have chosen, and toward the temple which I have built for Your name:"
2 Chronicles,6,39,"then hear from heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive Your people who have sinned against You."
2 Chronicles,6,40,"Now, my God, I pray, let Your eyes be open and let Your ears be attentive to the prayer made in this place."
2 Chronicles,6,41,"“Now therefore, Arise, O LORD God, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength. Let Your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, And let Your saints rejoice in goodness."
2 Chronicles,6,42,"“O LORD God, do not turn away the face of Your Anointed; Remember the mercies of Your servant David.”"
2 Chronicles,7,1,"When Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the temple."
2 Chronicles,7,2,"And the priests could not enter the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD’s house."
2 Chronicles,7,3,"When all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD on the temple, they bowed their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshiped and praised the LORD, saying: “For He is good, For His mercy endures forever.”"
2 Chronicles,7,4,Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
2 Chronicles,7,5,King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
2 Chronicles,7,6,"And the priests attended to their services; the Levites also with instruments of the music of the LORD, which King David had made to praise the LORD, saying, “For His mercy endures forever,” whenever David offered praise by their ministry. The priests sounded trumpets opposite them, while all Israel stood."
2 Chronicles,7,7,"Furthermore Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of the LORD; for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat."
2 Chronicles,7,8,"At that time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt."
2 Chronicles,7,9,"And on the eighth day they held a sacred assembly, for they observed the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days."
2 Chronicles,7,10,"On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the good that the LORD had done for David, for Solomon, and for His people Israel."
2 Chronicles,7,11,Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the king’s house; and Solomon successfully accomplished all that came into his heart to make in the house of the LORD and in his own house.
2 Chronicles,7,12,"Then the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him: “I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice."
2 Chronicles,7,13,"When I shut up heaven and there is no rain, or command the locusts to devour the land, or send pestilence among My people,"
2 Chronicles,7,14,"if My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land."
2 Chronicles,7,15,Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to prayer made in this place.
2 Chronicles,7,16,"For now I have chosen and sanctified this house, that My name may be there forever; and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually."
2 Chronicles,7,17,"As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and My judgments,"
2 Chronicles,7,18,"then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, ‘You shall not fail to have a man as ruler in Israel.’"
2 Chronicles,7,19,"“But if you turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them,"
2 Chronicles,7,20,"then I will uproot them from My land which I have given them; and this house which I have sanctified for My name I will cast out of My sight, and will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples."
2 Chronicles,7,21,"“And as for this house, which is exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and say, ‘Why has the LORD done thus to this land and this house?’"
2 Chronicles,7,22,"Then they will answer, ‘Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and embraced other gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore He has brought all this calamity on them.’”"
2 Chronicles,8,1,"It came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own house,"
2 Chronicles,8,2,"that the cities which Hiram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them; and he settled the children of Israel there."
2 Chronicles,8,3,And Solomon went to Hamath Zobah and seized it.
2 Chronicles,8,4,"He also built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities which he built in Hamath."
2 Chronicles,8,5,"He built Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars,"
2 Chronicles,8,6,"also Baalath and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities and the cities of the cavalry, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion."
2 Chronicles,8,7,"All the people who were left of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of Israel—"
2 Chronicles,8,8,"that is, their descendants who were left in the land after them, whom the children of Israel did not destroy—from these Solomon raised forced labor, as it is to this day."
2 Chronicles,8,9,"But Solomon did not make the children of Israel servants for his work. Some were men of war, captains of his officers, captains of his chariots, and his cavalry."
2 Chronicles,8,10,"And others were chiefs of the officials of King Solomon: two hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people."
2 Chronicles,8,11,"Now Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David to the house he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places to which the ark of the LORD has come are holy.”"
2 Chronicles,8,12,"Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD which he had built before the vestibule,"
2 Chronicles,8,13,"according to the daily rate, offering according to the commandment of Moses, for the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the three appointed yearly feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles."
2 Chronicles,8,14,"And, according to the order of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, the Levites for their duties (to praise and serve before the priests) as the duty of each day required, and the gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate; for so David the man of God had commanded."
2 Chronicles,8,15,They did not depart from the command of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasuries.
2 Chronicles,8,16,Now all the work of Solomon was well-ordered from the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed.
2 Chronicles,8,17,"Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the seacoast, in the land of Edom."
2 Chronicles,8,18,"And Hiram sent him ships by the hand of his servants, and servants who knew the sea. They went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and acquired four hundred and fifty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon."
2 Chronicles,9,1,"Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with hard questions, having a very great retinue, camels that bore spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart."
2 Chronicles,9,2,So Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing so difficult for Solomon that he could not explain it to her.
2 Chronicles,9,3,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,"
2 Chronicles,9,4,"the food on his table, the seating of his servants, the service of his waiters and their apparel, his cupbearers and their apparel, and his entryway by which he went up to the house of the LORD, there was no more spirit in her."
2 Chronicles,9,5,Then she said to the king: “It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom.
2 Chronicles,9,6,However I did not believe their words until I came and saw with my own eyes; and indeed the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me. You exceed the fame of which I heard.
2 Chronicles,9,7,"Happy are your men and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom!"
2 Chronicles,9,8,"Blessed be the LORD your God, who delighted in you, setting you on His throne to be king for the LORD your God! Because your God has loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore He made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.”"
2 Chronicles,9,9,"And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great abundance, and precious stones; there never were any spices such as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon."
2 Chronicles,9,10,"Also, the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones."
2 Chronicles,9,11,"And the king made walkways of the algum wood for the house of the LORD and for the king’s house, also harps and stringed instruments for singers; and there were none such as these seen before in the land of Judah."
2 Chronicles,9,12,"Now King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, much more than she had brought to the king. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants."
2 Chronicles,9,13,"The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,"
2 Chronicles,9,14,besides what the traveling merchants and traders brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2 Chronicles,9,15,And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of hammered gold went into each shield.
2 Chronicles,9,16,He also made three hundred shields of hammered gold; three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
2 Chronicles,9,17,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold."
2 Chronicles,9,18,"The throne had six steps, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne; there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the armrests."
2 Chronicles,9,19,"Twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom."
2 Chronicles,9,20,"All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Not one was silver, for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon."
2 Chronicles,9,21,"For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram. Once every three years the merchant ships came, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys."
2 Chronicles,9,22,So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
2 Chronicles,9,23,"And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart."
2 Chronicles,9,24,"Each man brought his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, armor, spices, horses, and mules, at a set rate year by year."
2 Chronicles,9,25,"Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,9,26,"So he reigned over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt."
2 Chronicles,9,27,"The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland."
2 Chronicles,9,28,And they brought horses to Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.
2 Chronicles,9,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?"
2 Chronicles,9,30,Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
2 Chronicles,9,31,"Then Solomon rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place."
2 Chronicles,10,1,"And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king."
2 Chronicles,10,2,"So it happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it (he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon), that Jeroboam returned from Egypt."
2 Chronicles,10,3,"Then they sent for him and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,"
2 Chronicles,10,4,"“Your father made our yoke heavy; now therefore, lighten the burdensome service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you.”"
2 Chronicles,10,5,"So he said to them, “Come back to me after three days.” And the people departed."
2 Chronicles,10,6,"Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived, saying, “How do you advise me to answer these people?”"
2 Chronicles,10,7,"And they spoke to him, saying, “If you are kind to these people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever.”"
2 Chronicles,10,8,"But he rejected the advice which the elders had given him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him."
2 Chronicles,10,9,"And he said to them, “What advice do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke which your father put on us’?”"
2 Chronicles,10,10,"Then the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you should speak to the people who have spoken to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter on us’—thus you shall say to them: ‘My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s waist!"
2 Chronicles,10,11,"And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scourges!’”"
2 Chronicles,10,12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had directed, saying, “Come back to me the third day.”"
2 Chronicles,10,13,"Then the king answered them roughly. King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders,"
2 Chronicles,10,14,"and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scourges!”"
2 Chronicles,10,15,"So the king did not listen to the people; for the turn of events was from God, that the LORD might fulfill His word, which He had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat."
2 Chronicles,10,16,"Now when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying: “What share have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to your tents, O Israel! Now see to your own house, O David!” So all Israel departed to their tents."
2 Chronicles,10,17,But Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah.
2 Chronicles,10,18,"Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of revenue; but the children of Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. Therefore King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,10,19,So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
2 Chronicles,11,1,"Now when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled from the house of Judah and Benjamin one hundred and eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might restore the kingdom to Rehoboam."
2 Chronicles,11,2,"But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,"
2 Chronicles,11,3,"“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,"
2 Chronicles,11,4,"‘Thus says the LORD: “You shall not go up or fight against your brethren! Let every man return to his house, for this thing is from Me.”’” Therefore they obeyed the words of the LORD, and turned back from attacking Jeroboam."
2 Chronicles,11,5,"So Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah."
2 Chronicles,11,6,"And he built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,"
2 Chronicles,11,7,"Beth Zur, Sochoh, Adullam,"
2 Chronicles,11,8,"Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,"
2 Chronicles,11,9,"Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,"
2 Chronicles,11,10,"Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and Benjamin, fortified cities."
2 Chronicles,11,11,"And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine."
2 Chronicles,11,12,"Also in every city he put shields and spears, and made them very strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side."
2 Chronicles,11,13,And from all their territories the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel took their stand with him.
2 Chronicles,11,14,"For the Levites left their common-lands and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them from serving as priests to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,11,15,"Then he appointed for himself priests for the high places, for the demons, and the calf idols which he had made."
2 Chronicles,11,16,"And after the Levites left, those from all the tribes of Israel, such as set their heart to seek the LORD God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,11,17,"So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong for three years, because they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years."
2 Chronicles,11,18,"Then Rehoboam took for himself as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliah the son of Jesse."
2 Chronicles,11,19,"And she bore him children: Jeush, Shamariah, and Zaham."
2 Chronicles,11,20,"After her he took Maachah the granddaughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith."
2 Chronicles,11,21,"Now Rehoboam loved Maachah the granddaughter of Absalom more than all his wives and his concubines; for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and begot twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters."
2 Chronicles,11,22,"And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maachah as chief, to be leader among his brothers; for he intended to make him king."
2 Chronicles,11,23,"He dealt wisely, and dispersed some of his sons throughout all the territories of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city; and he gave them provisions in abundance. He also sought many wives for them."
2 Chronicles,12,1,"Now it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself, that he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel along with him."
2 Chronicles,12,2,"And it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,"
2 Chronicles,12,3,"with twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand horsemen, and people without number who came with him out of Egypt—the Lubim and the Sukkiim and the Ethiopians."
2 Chronicles,12,4,And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,12,5,"Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah, who were gathered together in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Thus says the LORD: ‘You have forsaken Me, and therefore I also have left you in the hand of Shishak.’”"
2 Chronicles,12,6,"So the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, “The LORD is righteous.”"
2 Chronicles,12,7,"Now when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance. My wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak."
2 Chronicles,12,8,"Nevertheless they will be his servants, that they may distinguish My service from the service of the kingdoms of the nations.”"
2 Chronicles,12,9,"So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king’s house; he took everything. He also carried away the gold shields which Solomon had made."
2 Chronicles,12,10,"Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who guarded the doorway of the king’s house."
2 Chronicles,12,11,"And whenever the king entered the house of the LORD, the guard would go and bring them out; then they would take them back into the guardroom."
2 Chronicles,12,12,"When he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, so as not to destroy him completely; and things also went well in Judah."
2 Chronicles,12,13,"Thus King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mother’s name was Naamah, an Ammonitess."
2 Chronicles,12,14,"And he did evil, because he did not prepare his heart to seek the LORD."
2 Chronicles,12,15,"The acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days."
2 Chronicles,12,16,"So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David. Then Abijah his son reigned in his place."
2 Chronicles,13,1,"In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah."
2 Chronicles,13,2,He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles,13,3,"Abijah set the battle in order with an army of valiant warriors, four hundred thousand choice men. Jeroboam also drew up in battle formation against him with eight hundred thousand choice men, mighty men of valor."
2 Chronicles,13,4,"Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the mountains of Ephraim, and said, “Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel:"
2 Chronicles,13,5,"Should you not know that the LORD God of Israel gave the dominion over Israel to David forever, to him and his sons, by a covenant of salt?"
2 Chronicles,13,6,"Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord."
2 Chronicles,13,7,"Then worthless rogues gathered to him, and strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and inexperienced and could not withstand them."
2 Chronicles,13,8,"And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD, which is in the hand of the sons of David; and you are a great multitude, and with you are the gold calves which Jeroboam made for you as gods."
2 Chronicles,13,9,"Have you not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made for yourselves priests, like the peoples of other lands, so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of things that are not gods?"
2 Chronicles,13,10,"But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; and the priests who minister to the LORD are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites attend to their duties."
2 Chronicles,13,11,"And they burn to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense; they also set the showbread in order on the pure gold table, and the lampstand of gold with its lamps to burn every evening; for we keep the command of the LORD our God, but you have forsaken Him."
2 Chronicles,13,12,"Now look, God Himself is with us as our head, and His priests with sounding trumpets to sound the alarm against you. O children of Israel, do not fight against the LORD God of your fathers, for you shall not prosper!”"
2 Chronicles,13,13,"But Jeroboam caused an ambush to go around behind them; so they were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them."
2 Chronicles,13,14,"And when Judah looked around, to their surprise the battle line was at both front and rear; and they cried out to the LORD, and the priests sounded the trumpets."
2 Chronicles,13,15,"Then the men of Judah gave a shout; and as the men of Judah shouted, it happened that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah."
2 Chronicles,13,16,"And the children of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand."
2 Chronicles,13,17,Then Abijah and his people struck them with a great slaughter; so five hundred thousand choice men of Israel fell slain.
2 Chronicles,13,18,"Thus the children of Israel were subdued at that time; and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the LORD God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,13,19,"And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him: Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephrain with its villages."
2 Chronicles,13,20,"So Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah; and the LORD struck him, and he died."
2 Chronicles,13,21,"But Abijah grew mighty, married fourteen wives, and begot twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters."
2 Chronicles,13,22,"Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his sayings are written in the annals of the prophet Iddo."
2 Chronicles,14,1,"So Abijah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. Then Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet for ten years."
2 Chronicles,14,2,"Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God,"
2 Chronicles,14,3,"for he removed the altars of the foreign gods and the high places, and broke down the sacred pillars and cut down the wooden images."
2 Chronicles,14,4,"He commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to observe the law and the commandment."
2 Chronicles,14,5,"He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom was quiet under him."
2 Chronicles,14,6,"And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest; he had no war in those years, because the LORD had given him rest."
2 Chronicles,14,7,"Therefore he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities and make walls around them, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us, because we have sought the LORD our God; we have sought Him, and He has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered."
2 Chronicles,14,8,"And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah who carried shields and spears, and from Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand men who carried shields and drew bows; all these were mighty men of valor."
2 Chronicles,14,9,"Then Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah."
2 Chronicles,14,10,"So Asa went out against him, and they set the troops in battle array in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah."
2 Chronicles,14,11,"And Asa cried out to the LORD his God, and said, “LORD, it is nothing for You to help, whether with many or with those who have no power; help us, O LORD our God, for we rest on You, and in Your name we go against this multitude. O LORD, You are our God; do not let man prevail against You!”"
2 Chronicles,14,12,"So the LORD struck the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians fled."
2 Chronicles,14,13,"And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar. So the Ethiopians were overthrown, and they could not recover, for they were broken before the LORD and His army. And they carried away very much spoil."
2 Chronicles,14,14,"Then they defeated all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of the LORD came upon them; and they plundered all the cities, for there was exceedingly much spoil in them."
2 Chronicles,14,15,"They also attacked the livestock enclosures, and carried off sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,15,1,Now the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded.
2 Chronicles,15,2,"And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him: “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin. The LORD is with you while you are with Him. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you."
2 Chronicles,15,3,"For a long time Israel has been without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law;"
2 Chronicles,15,4,"but when in their trouble they turned to the LORD God of Israel, and sought Him, He was found by them."
2 Chronicles,15,5,"And in those times there was no peace to the one who went out, nor to the one who came in, but great turmoil was on all the inhabitants of the lands."
2 Chronicles,15,6,"So nation was destroyed by nation, and city by city, for God troubled them with every adversity."
2 Chronicles,15,7,"But you, be strong and do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded!”"
2 Chronicles,15,8,"And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities which he had taken in the mountains of Ephraim; and he restored the altar of the LORD that was before the vestibule of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,15,9,"Then he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who dwelt with them from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, for they came over to him in great numbers from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him."
2 Chronicles,15,10,"So they gathered together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa."
2 Chronicles,15,11,And they offered to the LORD at that time seven hundred bulls and seven thousand sheep from the spoil they had brought.
2 Chronicles,15,12,Then they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
2 Chronicles,15,13,"and whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman."
2 Chronicles,15,14,"Then they took an oath before the LORD with a loud voice, with shouting and trumpets and rams’ horns."
2 Chronicles,15,15,"And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him with all their soul; and He was found by them, and the LORD gave them rest all around."
2 Chronicles,15,16,"Also he removed Maachah, the mother of Asa the king, from being queen mother, because she had made an obscene image of Asherah; and Asa cut down her obscene image, then crushed and burned it by the Brook Kidron."
2 Chronicles,15,17,But the high places were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was loyal all his days.
2 Chronicles,15,18,He also brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated: silver and gold and utensils.
2 Chronicles,15,19,And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.
2 Chronicles,16,1,"In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah."
2 Chronicles,16,2,"Then Asa brought silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the LORD and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-Hadad king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,"
2 Chronicles,16,3,"“Let there be a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. See, I have sent you silver and gold; come, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.”"
2 Chronicles,16,4,"So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali."
2 Chronicles,16,5,"Now it happened, when Baasha heard it, that he stopped building Ramah and ceased his work."
2 Chronicles,16,6,"Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them he built Geba and Mizpah."
2 Chronicles,16,7,"And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him: “Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on the LORD your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand."
2 Chronicles,16,8,"Were the Ethiopians and the Lubim not a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because you relied on the LORD, He delivered them into your hand."
2 Chronicles,16,9,"For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him. In this you have done foolishly; therefore from now on you shall have wars.”"
2 Chronicles,16,10,"Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in prison, for he was enraged at him because of this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at that time."
2 Chronicles,16,11,"Note that the acts of Asa, first and last, are indeed written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
2 Chronicles,16,12,"And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet, and his malady was severe; yet in his disease he did not seek the LORD, but the physicians."
2 Chronicles,16,13,So Asa rested with his fathers; he died in the forty-first year of his reign.
2 Chronicles,16,14,"They buried him in his own tomb, which he had made for himself in the City of David; and they laid him in the bed which was filled with spices and various ingredients prepared in a mixture of ointments. They made a very great burning for him."
2 Chronicles,17,1,"Then Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel."
2 Chronicles,17,2,"And he placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had taken."
2 Chronicles,17,3,"Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the former ways of his father David; he did not seek the Baals,"
2 Chronicles,17,4,"but sought the God of his father, and walked in His commandments and not according to the acts of Israel."
2 Chronicles,17,5,"Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah gave presents to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance."
2 Chronicles,17,6,And his heart took delight in the ways of the LORD; moreover he removed the high places and wooden images from Judah.
2 Chronicles,17,7,"Also in the third year of his reign he sent his leaders, Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah."
2 Chronicles,17,8,"And with them he sent Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah—the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests."
2 Chronicles,17,9,"So they taught in Judah, and had the Book of the Law of the LORD with them; they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the people."
2 Chronicles,17,10,"And the fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat."
2 Chronicles,17,11,"Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver as tribute; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred male goats."
2 Chronicles,17,12,"So Jehoshaphat became increasingly powerful, and he built fortresses and storage cities in Judah."
2 Chronicles,17,13,"He had much property in the cities of Judah; and the men of war, mighty men of valor, were in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,17,14,"These are their numbers, according to their fathers’ houses. Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor;"
2 Chronicles,17,15,"and next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand;"
2 Chronicles,17,16,"and next to him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to the LORD, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor."
2 Chronicles,17,17,"Of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand men armed with bow and shield;"
2 Chronicles,17,18,"and next to him was Jehozabad, and with him one hundred and eighty thousand prepared for war."
2 Chronicles,17,19,"These served the king, besides those the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah."
2 Chronicles,18,1,Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and by marriage he allied himself with Ahab.
2 Chronicles,18,2,"After some years he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria; and Ahab killed sheep and oxen in abundance for him and the people who were with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead."
2 Chronicles,18,3,"So Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead?” And he answered him, “I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will be with you in the war.”"
2 Chronicles,18,4,"Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire for the word of the LORD today.”"
2 Chronicles,18,5,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?” So they said, “Go up, for God will deliver it into the king’s hand.”"
2 Chronicles,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not still a prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of Him?”"
2 Chronicles,18,7,"So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD; but I hate him, because he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil. He is Micaiah the son of Imla.” And Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say such things!”"
2 Chronicles,18,8,"Then the king of Israel called one of his officers and said, “Bring Micaiah the son of Imla quickly!”"
2 Chronicles,18,9,"The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, clothed in their robes, sat each on his throne; and they sat at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them."
2 Chronicles,18,10,"Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made horns of iron for himself; and he said, “Thus says the LORD: ‘With these you shall gore the Syrians until they are destroyed.’”"
2 Chronicles,18,11,"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for the LORD will deliver it into the king’s hand.”"
2 Chronicles,18,12,"Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “Now listen, the words of the prophets with one accord encourage the king. Therefore please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak encouragement.”"
2 Chronicles,18,13,"And Micaiah said, “As the LORD lives, whatever my God says, that I will speak.”"
2 Chronicles,18,14,"Then he came to the king; and the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?” And he said, “Go and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand!”"
2 Chronicles,18,15,"So the king said to him, “How many times shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?”"
2 Chronicles,18,16,"Then he said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And the LORD said, ‘These have no master. Let each return to his house in peace.’”"
2 Chronicles,18,17,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”"
2 Chronicles,18,18,"Then Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand and His left."
2 Chronicles,18,19,"And the LORD said, ‘Who will persuade Ahab king of Israel to go up, that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ So one spoke in this manner, and another spoke in that manner."
2 Chronicles,18,20,"Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, and said, ‘I will persuade him.’ The LORD said to him, ‘In what way?’"
2 Chronicles,18,21,"So he said, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And the LORD said, ‘You shall persuade him and also prevail; go out and do so.’"
2 Chronicles,18,22,"Therefore look! The LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours, and the LORD has declared disaster against you.”"
2 Chronicles,18,23,"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did the spirit from the LORD go from me to speak to you?”"
2 Chronicles,18,24,"And Micaiah said, “Indeed you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide!”"
2 Chronicles,18,25,"Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son;"
2 Chronicles,18,26,"and say, ‘Thus says the king: “Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction, until I return in peace.”’”"
2 Chronicles,18,27,"But Micaiah said, “If you ever return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me.” And he said, “Take heed, all you people!”"
2 Chronicles,18,28,So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.
2 Chronicles,18,29,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle; but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle."
2 Chronicles,18,30,"Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots who were with him, saying, “Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel.”"
2 Chronicles,18,31,"So it was, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, “It is the king of Israel!” Therefore they surrounded him to attack; but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him, and God diverted them from him."
2 Chronicles,18,32,"For so it was, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him."
2 Chronicles,18,33,"Now a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am wounded.”"
2 Chronicles,18,34,"The battle increased that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Syrians until evening; and about the time of sunset he died."
2 Chronicles,19,1,Then Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned safely to his house in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,19,2,"And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Therefore the wrath of the LORD is upon you."
2 Chronicles,19,3,"Nevertheless good things are found in you, in that you have removed the wooden images from the land, and have prepared your heart to seek God.”"
2 Chronicles,19,4,"So Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the mountains of Ephraim, and brought them back to the LORD God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,19,5,"Then he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,"
2 Chronicles,19,6,"and said to the judges, “Take heed to what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment."
2 Chronicles,19,7,"Now therefore, let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take care and do it, for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, no partiality, nor taking of bribes.”"
2 Chronicles,19,8,"Moreover in Jerusalem, for the judgment of the LORD and for controversies, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites and priests, and some of the chief fathers of Israel, when they returned to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,19,9,"And he commanded them, saying, “Thus you shall act in the fear of the LORD, faithfully and with a loyal heart:"
2 Chronicles,19,10,"Whatever case comes to you from your brethren who dwell in their cities, whether of bloodshed or offenses against law or commandment, against statutes or ordinances, you shall warn them, lest they trespass against the LORD and wrath come upon you and your brethren. Do this, and you will not be guilty."
2 Chronicles,19,11,"And take notice: Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king’s matters; also the Levites will be officials before you. Behave courageously, and the LORD will be with the good.”"
2 Chronicles,20,1,"It happened after this that the people of Moab with the people of Ammon, and others with them besides the Ammonites, came to battle against Jehoshaphat."
2 Chronicles,20,2,"Then some came and told Jehoshaphat, saying, “A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, from Syria; and they are in Hazazon Tamar” (which is En Gedi)."
2 Chronicles,20,3,"And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah."
2 Chronicles,20,4,So Judah gathered together to ask help from the LORD; and from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.
2 Chronicles,20,5,"Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,"
2 Chronicles,20,6,"and said: “O LORD God of our fathers, are You not God in heaven, and do You not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations, and in Your hand is there not power and might, so that no one is able to withstand You?"
2 Chronicles,20,7,"Are You not our God, who drove out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel, and gave it to the descendants of Abraham Your friend forever?"
2 Chronicles,20,8,"And they dwell in it, and have built You a sanctuary in it for Your name, saying,"
2 Chronicles,20,9,"‘If disaster comes upon us—sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine—we will stand before this temple and in Your presence (for Your name is in this temple), and cry out to You in our affliction, and You will hear and save.’"
2 Chronicles,20,10,"And now, here are the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir—whom You would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them and did not destroy them—"
2 Chronicles,20,11,"here they are, rewarding us by coming to throw us out of Your possession which You have given us to inherit."
2 Chronicles,20,12,"O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.”"
2 Chronicles,20,13,"Now all Judah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children, stood before the LORD."
2 Chronicles,20,14,"Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly."
2 Chronicles,20,15,"And he said, “Listen, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the LORD to you: ‘Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God’s."
2 Chronicles,20,16,"Tomorrow go down against them. They will surely come up by the Ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of Jeruel."
2 Chronicles,20,17,"You will not need to fight in this battle. Position yourselves, stand still and see the salvation of the LORD, who is with you, O Judah and Jerusalem!’ Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them, for the LORD is with you.”"
2 Chronicles,20,18,"And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem bowed before the LORD, worshiping the LORD."
2 Chronicles,20,19,Then the Levites of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with voices loud and high.
2 Chronicles,20,20,"So they rose early in the morning and went out into the Wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Hear me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: Believe in the LORD your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.”"
2 Chronicles,20,21,"And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who should sing to the LORD, and who should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army and were saying: “Praise the LORD, For His mercy endures forever.”"
2 Chronicles,20,22,"Now when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were defeated."
2 Chronicles,20,23,"For the people of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy them. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another."
2 Chronicles,20,24,"So when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and there were their dead bodies, fallen on the earth. No one had escaped."
2 Chronicles,20,25,"When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil, they found among them an abundance of valuables on the dead bodies, and precious jewelry, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days gathering the spoil because there was so much."
2 Chronicles,20,26,"And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, for there they blessed the LORD; therefore the name of that place was called The Valley of Berachah until this day."
2 Chronicles,20,27,"Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat in front of them, to go back to Jerusalem with joy, for the LORD had made them rejoice over their enemies."
2 Chronicles,20,28,"So they came to Jerusalem, with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets, to the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,20,29,And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.
2 Chronicles,20,30,"Then the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all around."
2 Chronicles,20,31,"So Jehoshaphat was king over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi."
2 Chronicles,20,32,"And he walked in the way of his father Asa, and did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,20,33,"Nevertheless the high places were not taken away, for as yet the people had not directed their hearts to the God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,20,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, indeed they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel."
2 Chronicles,20,35,"After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah allied himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who acted very wickedly."
2 Chronicles,20,36,"And he allied himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion Geber."
2 Chronicles,20,37,"But Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has destroyed your works.” Then the ships were wrecked, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish."
2 Chronicles,21,1,"And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. Then Jehoram his son reigned in his place."
2 Chronicles,21,2,"He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel."
2 Chronicles,21,3,"Their father gave them great gifts of silver and gold and precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn."
2 Chronicles,21,4,"Now when Jehoram was established over the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself and killed all his brothers with the sword, and also others of the princes of Israel."
2 Chronicles,21,5,"Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,21,6,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for he had the daughter of Ahab as a wife; and he did evil in the sight of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,21,7,"Yet the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that He had made with David, and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever."
2 Chronicles,21,8,"In his days Edom revolted against Judah’s authority, and made a king over themselves."
2 Chronicles,21,9,"So Jehoram went out with his officers, and all his chariots with him. And he rose by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots."
2 Chronicles,21,10,"Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah’s authority to this day. At that time Libnah revolted against his rule, because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers."
2 Chronicles,21,11,"Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit harlotry, and led Judah astray."
2 Chronicles,21,12,"And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus says the LORD God of your father David: Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, or in the ways of Asa king of Judah,"
2 Chronicles,21,13,"but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot like the harlotry of the house of Ahab, and also have killed your brothers, those of your father’s household, who were better than yourself,"
2 Chronicles,21,14,"behold, the LORD will strike your people with a serious affliction—your children, your wives, and all your possessions;"
2 Chronicles,21,15,"and you will become very sick with a disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out by reason of the sickness, day by day."
2 Chronicles,21,16,Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabians who were near the Ethiopians.
2 Chronicles,21,17,"And they came up into Judah and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the king’s house, and also his sons and his wives, so that there was not a son left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons."
2 Chronicles,21,18,After all this the LORD struck him in his intestines with an incurable disease.
2 Chronicles,21,19,"Then it happened in the course of time, after the end of two years, that his intestines came out because of his sickness; so he died in severe pain. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning for his fathers."
2 Chronicles,21,20,"He was thirty-two years old when he became king. He reigned in Jerusalem eight years and, to no one’s sorrow, departed. However they buried him in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings."
2 Chronicles,22,1,"Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place, for the raiders who came with the Arabians into the camp had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, reigned."
2 Chronicles,22,2,"Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri."
2 Chronicles,22,3,"He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother advised him to do wickedly."
2 Chronicles,22,4,"Therefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD, like the house of Ahab; for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction."
2 Chronicles,22,5,"He also followed their advice, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram."
2 Chronicles,22,6,"Then he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which he had received at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick."
2 Chronicles,22,7,"His going to Joram was God’s occasion for Ahaziah’s downfall; for when he arrived, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab."
2 Chronicles,22,8,"And it happened, when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers who served Ahaziah, that he killed them."
2 Chronicles,22,9,"Then he searched for Ahaziah; and they caught him (he was hiding in Samaria), and brought him to Jehu. When they had killed him, they buried him, “because,” they said, “he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart.” So the house of Ahaziah had no one to assume power over the kingdom."
2 Chronicles,22,10,"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal heirs of the house of Judah."
2 Chronicles,22,11,"But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were being murdered, and put him and his nurse in a bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah so that she did not kill him."
2 Chronicles,22,12,"And he was hidden with them in the house of God for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land."
2 Chronicles,23,1,"In the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and made a covenant with the captains of hundreds: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri."
2 Chronicles,23,2,"And they went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the chief fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,23,3,"Then all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, “Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as the LORD has said of the sons of David."
2 Chronicles,23,4,"This is what you shall do: One-third of you entering on the Sabbath, of the priests and the Levites, shall be keeping watch over the doors;"
2 Chronicles,23,5,one-third shall be at the king’s house; and one-third at the Gate of the Foundation. All the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,23,6,"But let no one come into the house of the LORD except the priests and those of the Levites who serve. They may go in, for they are holy; but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,23,7,"And the Levites shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes into the house, let him be put to death. You are to be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.”"
2 Chronicles,23,8,"So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each man took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath, with those who were going off duty on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest had not dismissed the divisions."
2 Chronicles,23,9,"And Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields which had belonged to King David, that were in the temple of God."
2 Chronicles,23,10,"Then he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and by the temple, all around the king."
2 Chronicles,23,11,"And they brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, gave him the Testimony, and made him king. Then Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, “Long live the king!”"
2 Chronicles,23,12,"Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people in the temple of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,23,13,"When she looked, there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance; and the leaders and the trumpeters were by the king. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, also the singers with musical instruments, and those who led in praise. So Athaliah tore her clothes and said, “Treason! Treason!”"
2 Chronicles,23,14,"And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, “Take her outside under guard, and slay with the sword whoever follows her.” For the priest had said, “Do not kill her in the house of the LORD.”"
2 Chronicles,23,15,"So they seized her; and she went by way of the entrance of the Horse Gate into the king’s house, and they killed her there."
2 Chronicles,23,16,"Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, the people, and the king, that they should be the LORD’s people."
2 Chronicles,23,17,"And all the people went to the temple of Baal, and tore it down. They broke in pieces its altars and images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars."
2 Chronicles,23,18,"Also Jehoiada appointed the oversight of the house of the LORD to the hand of the priests, the Levites, whom David had assigned in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was established by David."
2 Chronicles,23,19,"And he set the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the LORD, so that no one who was in any way unclean should enter."
2 Chronicles,23,20,"Then he took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of the LORD; and they went through the Upper Gate to the king’s house, and set the king on the throne of the kingdom."
2 Chronicles,23,21,"So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet, for they had slain Athaliah with the sword."
2 Chronicles,24,1,"Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba."
2 Chronicles,24,2,Joash did what was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
2 Chronicles,24,3,"And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters."
2 Chronicles,24,4,Now it happened after this that Joash set his heart on repairing the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,24,5,"Then he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you do it quickly.” However the Levites did not do it quickly."
2 Chronicles,24,6,"So the king called Jehoiada the chief priest, and said to him, “Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD and of the assembly of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?”"
2 Chronicles,24,7,"For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God, and had also presented all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD to the Baals."
2 Chronicles,24,8,"Then at the king’s command they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,24,9,And they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God had imposed on Israel in the wilderness.
2 Chronicles,24,10,"Then all the leaders and all the people rejoiced, brought their contributions, and put them into the chest until all had given."
2 Chronicles,24,11,"So it was, at that time, when the chest was brought to the king’s official by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, that the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it and returned it to its place. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance."
2 Chronicles,24,12,"The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the LORD; and they hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also those who worked in iron and bronze to restore the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,24,13,"So the workmen labored, and the work was completed by them; they restored the house of God to its original condition and reinforced it."
2 Chronicles,24,14,"When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; they made from it articles for the house of the LORD, articles for serving and offering, spoons and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada."
2 Chronicles,24,15,"But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died; he was one hundred and thirty years old when he died."
2 Chronicles,24,16,"And they buried him in the City of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and His house."
2 Chronicles,24,17,Now after the death of Jehoiada the leaders of Judah came and bowed down to the king. And the king listened to them.
2 Chronicles,24,18,"Therefore they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served wooden images and idols; and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of their trespass."
2 Chronicles,24,19,"Yet He sent prophets to them, to bring them back to the LORD; and they testified against them, but they would not listen."
2 Chronicles,24,20,"Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood above the people, and said to them, “Thus says God: ‘Why do you transgress the commandments of the LORD, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the LORD, He also has forsaken you.’”"
2 Chronicles,24,21,"So they conspired against him, and at the command of the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,24,22,"Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son; and as he died, he said, “The LORD look on it, and repay!”"
2 Chronicles,24,23,"So it happened in the spring of the year that the army of Syria came up against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the leaders of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus."
2 Chronicles,24,24,"For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; but the LORD delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash."
2 Chronicles,24,25,"And when they had withdrawn from him (for they left him severely wounded), his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed. So he died. And they buried him in the City of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings."
2 Chronicles,24,26,"These are the ones who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess."
2 Chronicles,24,27,"Now concerning his sons, and the many oracles about him, and the repairing of the house of God, indeed they are written in the annals of the book of the kings. Then Amaziah his son reigned in his place."
2 Chronicles,25,1,"Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,25,2,"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a loyal heart."
2 Chronicles,25,3,"Now it happened, as soon as the kingdom was established for him, that he executed his servants who had murdered his father the king."
2 Chronicles,25,4,"However he did not execute their children, but did as it is written in the Law in the Book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, “The fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall the children be put to death for their fathers; but a person shall die for his own sin.”"
2 Chronicles,25,5,"Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, according to their fathers’ houses, throughout all Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them to be three hundred thousand choice men, able to go to war, who could handle spear and shield."
2 Chronicles,25,6,He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for one hundred talents of silver.
2 Chronicles,25,7,"But a man of God came to him, saying, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel—not with any of the children of Ephraim."
2 Chronicles,25,8,"But if you go, be gone! Be strong in battle! Even so, God shall make you fall before the enemy; for God has power to help and to overthrow.”"
2 Chronicles,25,9,"Then Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what shall we do about the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel?” And the man of God answered, “The LORD is able to give you much more than this.”"
2 Chronicles,25,10,"So Amaziah discharged the troops that had come to him from Ephraim, to go back home. Therefore their anger was greatly aroused against Judah, and they returned home in great anger."
2 Chronicles,25,11,"Then Amaziah strengthened himself, and leading his people, he went to the Valley of Salt and killed ten thousand of the people of Seir."
2 Chronicles,25,12,"Also the children of Judah took captive ten thousand alive, brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were dashed in pieces."
2 Chronicles,25,13,"But as for the soldiers of the army which Amaziah had discharged, so that they would not go with him to battle, they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon, killed three thousand in them, and took much spoil."
2 Chronicles,25,14,"Now it was so, after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the people of Seir, set them up to be his gods, and bowed down before them and burned incense to them."
2 Chronicles,25,15,"Therefore the anger of the LORD was aroused against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, “Why have you sought the gods of the people, which could not rescue their own people from your hand?”"
2 Chronicles,25,16,"So it was, as he talked with him, that the king said to him, “Have we made you the king’s counselor? Cease! Why should you be killed?” Then the prophet ceased, and said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not heeded my advice.”"
2 Chronicles,25,17,"Now Amaziah king of Judah asked advice and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us face one another in battle.”"
2 Chronicles,25,18,"And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife’; and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle."
2 Chronicles,25,19,"Indeed you say that you have defeated the Edomites, and your heart is lifted up to boast. Stay at home now; why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall—you and Judah with you?”"
2 Chronicles,25,20,"But Amaziah would not heed, for it came from God, that He might give them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought the gods of Edom."
2 Chronicles,25,21,"So Joash king of Israel went out; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah."
2 Chronicles,25,22,"And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his tent."
2 Chronicles,25,23,"Then Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh; and he brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate—four hundred cubits."
2 Chronicles,25,24,"And he took all the gold and silver, all the articles that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, the treasures of the king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,25,25,"Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel."
2 Chronicles,25,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, indeed are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?"
2 Chronicles,25,27,"After the time that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there."
2 Chronicles,25,28,Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the City of Judah.
2 Chronicles,26,1,"Now all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah."
2 Chronicles,26,2,"He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king rested with his fathers."
2 Chronicles,26,3,"Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,26,4,"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done."
2 Chronicles,26,5,"He sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God; and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him prosper."
2 Chronicles,26,6,"Now he went out and made war against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities around Ashdod and among the Philistines."
2 Chronicles,26,7,"God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal, and against the Meunites."
2 Chronicles,26,8,"Also the Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah. His fame spread as far as the entrance of Egypt, for he became exceedingly strong."
2 Chronicles,26,9,"And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the corner buttress of the wall; then he fortified them."
2 Chronicles,26,10,"Also he built towers in the desert. He dug many wells, for he had much livestock, both in the lowlands and in the plains; he also had farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in Carmel, for he loved the soil."
2 Chronicles,26,11,"Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men who went out to war by companies, according to the number on their roll as prepared by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains."
2 Chronicles,26,12,The total number of chief officers of the mighty men of valor was two thousand six hundred.
2 Chronicles,26,13,"And under their authority was an army of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy."
2 Chronicles,26,14,"Then Uzziah prepared for them, for the entire army, shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and slings to cast stones."
2 Chronicles,26,15,"And he made devices in Jerusalem, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and large stones. So his fame spread far and wide, for he was marvelously helped till he became strong."
2 Chronicles,26,16,"But when he was strong his heart was lifted up, to his destruction, for he transgressed against the LORD his God by entering the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense."
2 Chronicles,26,17,"So Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him were eighty priests of the LORD—valiant men."
2 Chronicles,26,18,"And they withstood King Uzziah, and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed! You shall have no honor from the LORD God.”"
2 Chronicles,26,19,"Then Uzziah became furious; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense. And while he was angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead, before the priests in the house of the LORD, beside the incense altar."
2 Chronicles,26,20,"And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and there, on his forehead, he was leprous; so they thrust him out of that place. Indeed he also hurried to get out, because the LORD had struck him."
2 Chronicles,26,21,"King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death. He dwelt in an isolated house, because he was a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD. Then Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land."
2 Chronicles,26,22,"Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz wrote."
2 Chronicles,26,23,"So Uzziah rested with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings, for they said, “He is a leper.” Then Jotham his son reigned in his place."
2 Chronicles,27,1,"Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok."
2 Chronicles,27,2,"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah had done (although he did not enter the temple of the LORD). But still the people acted corruptly."
2 Chronicles,27,3,"He built the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD, and he built extensively on the wall of Ophel."
2 Chronicles,27,4,"Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers."
2 Chronicles,27,5,"He also fought with the king of the Ammonites and defeated them. And the people of Ammon gave him in that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. The people of Ammon paid this to him in the second and third years also."
2 Chronicles,27,6,"So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God."
2 Chronicles,27,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, indeed they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah."
2 Chronicles,27,8,"He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,27,9,"So Jotham rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. Then Ahaz his son reigned in his place."
2 Chronicles,28,1,"Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD, as his father David had done."
2 Chronicles,28,2,"For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made molded images for the Baals."
2 Chronicles,28,3,"He burned incense in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, and burned his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,4,"And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree."
2 Chronicles,28,5,"Therefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria. They defeated him, and carried away a great multitude of them as captives, and brought them to Damascus. Then he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who defeated him with a great slaughter."
2 Chronicles,28,6,"For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed one hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day, all valiant men, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,28,7,"Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam the officer over the house, and Elkanah who was second to the king."
2 Chronicles,28,8,"And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters; and they also took away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,28,9,"But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out before the army that came to Samaria, and said to them: “Look, because the LORD God of your fathers was angry with Judah, He has delivered them into your hand; but you have killed them in a rage that reaches up to heaven."
2 Chronicles,28,10,And now you propose to force the children of Judah and Jerusalem to be your male and female slaves; but are you not also guilty before the LORD your God?
2 Chronicles,28,11,"Now hear me, therefore, and return the captives, whom you have taken captive from your brethren, for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.”"
2 Chronicles,28,12,"Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,"
2 Chronicles,28,13,"and said to them, “You shall not bring the captives here, for we already have offended the LORD. You intend to add to our sins and to our guilt; for our guilt is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.”"
2 Chronicles,28,14,So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the leaders and all the assembly.
2 Chronicles,28,15,"Then the men who were designated by name rose up and took the captives, and from the spoil they clothed all who were naked among them, dressed them and gave them sandals, gave them food and drink, and anointed them; and they let all the feeble ones ride on donkeys. So they brought them to their brethren at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,28,16,At the same time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him.
2 Chronicles,28,17,"For again the Edomites had come, attacked Judah, and carried away captives."
2 Chronicles,28,18,"The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Sochoh with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages; and they dwelt there."
2 Chronicles,28,19,"For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had encouraged moral decline in Judah and had been continually unfaithful to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,28,20,"Also Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came to him and distressed him, and did not assist him."
2 Chronicles,28,21,"For Ahaz took part of the treasures from the house of the LORD, from the house of the king, and from the leaders, and he gave it to the king of Assyria; but he did not help him."
2 Chronicles,28,22,Now in the time of his distress King Ahaz became increasingly unfaithful to the LORD. This is that King Ahaz.
2 Chronicles,28,23,"For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him, saying, “Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me.” But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,24,"So Ahaz gathered the articles of the house of God, cut in pieces the articles of the house of God, shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,28,25,"And in every single city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers."
2 Chronicles,28,26,"Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, indeed they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,27,"So Ahaz rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem; but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. Then Hezekiah his son reigned in his place."
2 Chronicles,29,1,"Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah."
2 Chronicles,29,2,"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father David had done."
2 Chronicles,29,3,"In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them."
2 Chronicles,29,4,"Then he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them in the East Square,"
2 Chronicles,29,5,"and said to them: “Hear me, Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry out the rubbish from the holy place."
2 Chronicles,29,6,"For our fathers have trespassed and done evil in the eyes of the LORD our God; they have forsaken Him, have turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the LORD, and turned their backs on Him."
2 Chronicles,29,7,"They have also shut up the doors of the vestibule, put out the lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,29,8,"Therefore the wrath of the LORD fell upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He has given them up to trouble, to desolation, and to jeering, as you see with your eyes."
2 Chronicles,29,9,"For indeed, because of this our fathers have fallen by the sword; and our sons, our daughters, and our wives are in captivity."
2 Chronicles,29,10,"“Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that His fierce wrath may turn away from us."
2 Chronicles,29,11,"My sons, do not be negligent now, for the LORD has chosen you to stand before Him, to serve Him, and that you should minister to Him and burn incense.”"
2 Chronicles,29,12,"Then these Levites arose: Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah;"
2 Chronicles,29,13,"of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;"
2 Chronicles,29,14,"of the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel."
2 Chronicles,29,15,"And they gathered their brethren, sanctified themselves, and went according to the commandment of the king, at the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,16,"Then the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it, and brought out all the debris that they found in the temple of the LORD to the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it out and carried it to the Brook Kidron."
2 Chronicles,29,17,"Now they began to sanctify on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the LORD. So they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished."
2 Chronicles,29,18,"Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, “We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, the altar of burnt offerings with all its articles, and the table of the showbread with all its articles."
2 Chronicles,29,19,"Moreover all the articles which King Ahaz in his reign had cast aside in his transgression we have prepared and sanctified; and there they are, before the altar of the LORD.”"
2 Chronicles,29,20,"Then King Hezekiah rose early, gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,21,"And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. Then he commanded the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,22,"So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. Likewise they killed the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. They also killed the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar."
2 Chronicles,29,23,"Then they brought out the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them."
2 Chronicles,29,24,"And the priests killed them; and they presented their blood on the altar as a sin offering to make an atonement for all Israel, for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering be made for all Israel."
2 Chronicles,29,25,"And he stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with stringed instruments, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, of Gad the king’s seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for thus was the commandment of the LORD by His prophets."
2 Chronicles,29,26,"The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets."
2 Chronicles,29,27,"Then Hezekiah commanded them to offer the burnt offering on the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD also began, with the trumpets and with the instruments of David king of Israel."
2 Chronicles,29,28,"So all the assembly worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished."
2 Chronicles,29,29,"And when they had finished offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed and worshiped."
2 Chronicles,29,30,"Moreover King Hezekiah and the leaders commanded the Levites to sing praise to the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped."
2 Chronicles,29,31,"Then Hezekiah answered and said, “Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come near, and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD.” So the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings, and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings."
2 Chronicles,29,32,"And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,33,The consecrated things were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.
2 Chronicles,29,34,"But the priests were too few, so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings; therefore their brethren the Levites helped them until the work was ended and until the other priests had sanctified themselves, for the Levites were more diligent in sanctifying themselves than the priests."
2 Chronicles,29,35,"Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order."
2 Chronicles,29,36,"Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced that God had prepared the people, since the events took place so suddenly."
2 Chronicles,30,1,"And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to the LORD God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,30,2,For the king and his leaders and all the assembly in Jerusalem had agreed to keep the Passover in the second month.
2 Chronicles,30,3,"For they could not keep it at the regular time, because a sufficient number of priests had not consecrated themselves, nor had the people gathered together at Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,30,4,And the matter pleased the king and all the assembly.
2 Chronicles,30,5,"So they resolved to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem, since they had not done it for a long time in the prescribed manner."
2 Chronicles,30,6,"Then the runners went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from the king and his leaders, and spoke according to the command of the king: “Children of Israel, return to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel; then He will return to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria."
2 Chronicles,30,7,"And do not be like your fathers and your brethren, who trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, so that He gave them up to desolation, as you see."
2 Chronicles,30,8,"Now do not be stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the LORD; and enter His sanctuary, which He has sanctified forever, and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you."
2 Chronicles,30,9,"For if you return to the LORD, your brethren and your children will be treated with compassion by those who lead them captive, so that they may come back to this land; for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn His face from you if you return to Him.”"
2 Chronicles,30,10,"So the runners passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun; but they laughed at them and mocked them."
2 Chronicles,30,11,"Nevertheless some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,30,12,"Also the hand of God was on Judah to give them singleness of heart to obey the command of the king and the leaders, at the word of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,30,13,"Now many people, a very great assembly, gathered at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month."
2 Chronicles,30,14,"They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and they took away all the incense altars and cast them into the Brook Kidron."
2 Chronicles,30,15,"Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought the burnt offerings to the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,30,16,"They stood in their place according to their custom, according to the Law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood received from the hand of the Levites."
2 Chronicles,30,17,"For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had charge of the slaughter of the Passover lambs for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,30,18,"For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “May the good LORD provide atonement for everyone"
2 Chronicles,30,19,"who prepares his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he is not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.”"
2 Chronicles,30,20,And the LORD listened to Hezekiah and healed the people.
2 Chronicles,30,21,"So the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing to the LORD, accompanied by loud instruments."
2 Chronicles,30,22,"And Hezekiah gave encouragement to all the Levites who taught the good knowledge of the LORD; and they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,30,23,"Then the whole assembly agreed to keep the feast another seven days, and they kept it another seven days with gladness."
2 Chronicles,30,24,"For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, and the leaders gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests sanctified themselves."
2 Chronicles,30,25,"The whole assembly of Judah rejoiced, also the priests and Levites, all the assembly that came from Israel, the sojourners who came from the land of Israel, and those who dwelt in Judah."
2 Chronicles,30,26,"So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,30,27,"Then the priests, the Levites, arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard; and their prayer came up to His holy dwelling place, to heaven."
2 Chronicles,31,1,"Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and broke the sacred pillars in pieces, cut down the wooden images, and threw down the high places and the altars—from all Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh—until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned to their own cities, every man to his possession."
2 Chronicles,31,2,"And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites according to their divisions, each man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to serve, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,31,3,"The king also appointed a portion of his possessions for the burnt offerings: for the morning and evening burnt offerings, the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths and the New Moons and the set feasts, as it is written in the Law of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,31,4,"Moreover he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to contribute support for the priests and the Levites, that they might devote themselves to the Law of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,31,5,"As soon as the commandment was circulated, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of grain and wine, oil and honey, and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything."
2 Chronicles,31,6,"And the children of Israel and Judah, who dwelt in the cities of Judah, brought the tithe of oxen and sheep; also the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to the LORD their God they laid in heaps."
2 Chronicles,31,7,"In the third month they began laying them in heaps, and they finished in the seventh month."
2 Chronicles,31,8,"And when Hezekiah and the leaders came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD and His people Israel."
2 Chronicles,31,9,Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
2 Chronicles,31,10,"And Azariah the chief priest, from the house of Zadok, answered him and said, “Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat and have plenty left, for the LORD has blessed His people; and what is left is this great abundance.”"
2 Chronicles,31,11,"Now Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in the house of the LORD, and they prepared them."

2 Chronicles,31,16,"Besides those males from three years old and up who were written in the genealogy, they distributed to everyone who entered the house of the LORD his daily portion for the work of his service, by his division,"

2 Chronicles,31,18,"and to all who were written in the genealogy—their little ones and their wives, their sons and daughters, the whole company of them—for in their faithfulness they sanctified themselves in holiness."
2 Chronicles,31,19,"Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the common-lands of their cities, in every single city, there were men who were designated by name to distribute portions to all the males among the priests and to all who were listed by genealogies among the Levites."
2 Chronicles,31,20,"Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he did what was good and right and true before the LORD his God."
2 Chronicles,31,21,"And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, in the law and in the commandment, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart. So he prospered."
2 Chronicles,32,1,"After these deeds of faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and entered Judah; he encamped against the fortified cities, thinking to win them over to himself."
2 Chronicles,32,2,"And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that his purpose was to make war against Jerusalem,"
2 Chronicles,32,3,he consulted with his leaders and commanders to stop the water from the springs which were outside the city; and they helped him.
2 Chronicles,32,4,"Thus many people gathered together who stopped all the springs and the brook that ran through the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?”"
2 Chronicles,32,5,"And he strengthened himself, built up all the wall that was broken, raised it up to the towers, and built another wall outside; also he repaired the Millo in the City of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance."
2 Chronicles,32,6,"Then he set military captains over the people, gathered them together to him in the open square of the city gate, and gave them encouragement, saying,"
2 Chronicles,32,7,"“Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid nor dismayed before the king of Assyria, nor before all the multitude that is with him; for there are more with us than with him."
2 Chronicles,32,8,"With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God, to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people were strengthened by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah."
2 Chronicles,32,9,"After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (but he and all the forces with him laid siege against Lachish), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying,"
2 Chronicles,32,10,"“Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria: ‘In what do you trust, that you remain under siege in Jerusalem?"

2 Chronicles,32,12,"Has not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, “You shall worship before one altar and burn incense on it”?"
2 Chronicles,32,13,Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands in any way able to deliver their lands out of my hand?
2 Chronicles,32,14,"Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people from my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand?"
2 Chronicles,32,15,"Now therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or persuade you like this, and do not believe him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you from my hand?’”"
2 Chronicles,32,16,"Furthermore, his servants spoke against the LORD God and against His servant Hezekiah."
2 Chronicles,32,17,"He also wrote letters to revile the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, “As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my hand.”"

2 Chronicles,32,21,"Then the LORD sent an angel who cut down every mighty man of valor, leader, and captain in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned shamefaced to his own land. And when he had gone into the temple of his god, some of his own offspring struck him down with the sword there."
2 Chronicles,32,22,"Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side."
2 Chronicles,32,23,"And many brought gifts to the LORD at Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations thereafter."
2 Chronicles,32,24,"In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death, and he prayed to the LORD; and He spoke to him and gave him a sign."
2 Chronicles,32,25,"But Hezekiah did not repay according to the favor shown him, for his heart was lifted up; therefore wrath was looming over him and over Judah and Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,32,26,"Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah."
2 Chronicles,32,27,"Hezekiah had very great riches and honor. And he made himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of desirable items;"
2 Chronicles,32,28,"storehouses for the harvest of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of livestock, and folds for flocks."
2 Chronicles,32,29,"Moreover he provided cities for himself, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much property."
2 Chronicles,32,30,"This same Hezekiah also stopped the water outlet of Upper Gihon, and brought the water by tunnel to the west side of the City of David. Hezekiah prospered in all his works."
2 Chronicles,32,31,"However, regarding the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, whom they sent to him to inquire about the wonder that was done in the land, God withdrew from him, in order to test him, that He might know all that was in his heart."
2 Chronicles,32,32,"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, indeed they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
2 Chronicles,32,33,"So Hezekiah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. Then Manasseh his son reigned in his place."
2 Chronicles,33,1,"Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,33,2,"But he did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel."
2 Chronicles,33,3,"For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; he raised up altars for the Baals, and made wooden images; and he worshiped all the host of heaven and served them."
2 Chronicles,33,4,"He also built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, “In Jerusalem shall My name be forever.”"
2 Chronicles,33,5,And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,33,6,"Also he caused his sons to pass through the fire in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom; he practiced soothsaying, used witchcraft and sorcery, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him to anger."
2 Chronicles,33,7,"He even set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever;"
2 Chronicles,33,8,"and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers—only if they are careful to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.”"
2 Chronicles,33,9,So Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles,33,10,"And the LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they would not listen."
2 Chronicles,33,11,"Therefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze fetters, and carried him off to Babylon."
2 Chronicles,33,12,"Now when he was in affliction, he implored the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,"
2 Chronicles,33,13,"and prayed to Him; and He received his entreaty, heard his supplication, and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD was God."
2 Chronicles,33,14,"After this he built a wall outside the City of David on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate; and it enclosed Ophel, and he raised it to a very great height. Then he put military captains in all the fortified cities of Judah."
2 Chronicles,33,15,"He took away the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD and in Jerusalem; and he cast them out of the city."
2 Chronicles,33,16,"He also repaired the altar of the LORD, sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings on it, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,33,17,"Nevertheless the people still sacrificed on the high places, but only to the LORD their God."
2 Chronicles,33,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, indeed they are written in the book of the kings of Israel."
2 Chronicles,33,19,"Also his prayer and how God received his entreaty, and all his sin and trespass, and the sites where he built high places and set up wooden images and carved images, before he was humbled, indeed they are written among the sayings of Hozai."
2 Chronicles,33,20,"So Manasseh rested with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. Then his son Amon reigned in his place."
2 Chronicles,33,21,"Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,33,22,"But he did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done; for Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which his father Manasseh had made, and served them."
2 Chronicles,33,23,"And he did not humble himself before the LORD, as his father Manasseh had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more."
2 Chronicles,33,24,"Then his servants conspired against him, and killed him in his own house."
2 Chronicles,33,25,But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon. Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.
2 Chronicles,34,1,"Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,34,2,"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left."
2 Chronicles,34,3,"For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his father David; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the wooden images, the carved images, and the molded images."
2 Chronicles,34,4,"They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence, and the incense altars which were above them he cut down; and the wooden images, the carved images, and the molded images he broke in pieces, and made dust of them and scattered it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them."
2 Chronicles,34,5,"He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,34,6,"And so he did in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, as far as Naphtali and all around, with axes."
2 Chronicles,34,7,"When he had broken down the altars and the wooden images, had beaten the carved images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,34,8,"In the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the temple, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God."
2 Chronicles,34,9,"When they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites who kept the doors had gathered from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, from all the remnant of Israel, from all Judah and Benjamin, and which they had brought back to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,34,10,"Then they put it in the hand of the foremen who had the oversight of the house of the LORD; and they gave it to the workmen who worked in the house of the LORD, to repair and restore the house."
2 Chronicles,34,11,"They gave it to the craftsmen and builders to buy hewn stone and timber for beams, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed."
2 Chronicles,34,12,"And the men did the work faithfully. Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to supervise. Others of the Levites, all of whom were skillful with instruments of music,"
2 Chronicles,34,13,"were over the burden bearers and were overseers of all who did work in any kind of service. And some of the Levites were scribes, officers, and gatekeepers."
2 Chronicles,34,14,"Now when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the LORD given by Moses."
2 Chronicles,34,15,"Then Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD.” And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan."
2 Chronicles,34,16,"So Shaphan carried the book to the king, bringing the king word, saying, “All that was committed to your servants they are doing."
2 Chronicles,34,17,"And they have gathered the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen.”"
2 Chronicles,34,18,"Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it before the king."
2 Chronicles,34,19,"Thus it happened, when the king heard the words of the Law, that he tore his clothes."
2 Chronicles,34,20,"Then the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,"
2 Chronicles,34,21,"“Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for those who are left in Israel and Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according to all that is written in this book.”"
2 Chronicles,34,22,"So Hilkiah and those the king had appointed went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe. (She dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter.) And they spoke to her to that effect."
2 Chronicles,34,23,"Then she answered them, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘Tell the man who sent you to Me,"
2 Chronicles,34,24,"“Thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will bring calamity on this place and on its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah,"
2 Chronicles,34,25,"because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore My wrath will be poured out on this place, and not be quenched.’”’"
2 Chronicles,34,26,"But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, in this manner you shall speak to him, ‘Thus says the LORD God of Israel: “Concerning the words which you have heard—"
2 Chronicles,34,27,"because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and against its inhabitants, and you humbled yourself before Me, and you tore your clothes and wept before Me, I also have heard you,” says the LORD."
2 Chronicles,34,28,"“Surely I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the calamity which I will bring on this place and its inhabitants.”’” So they brought back word to the king."
2 Chronicles,34,29,Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,34,30,"The king went up to the house of the LORD, with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem—the priests and the Levites, and all the people, great and small. And he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant which had been found in the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,34,31,"Then the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book."
2 Chronicles,34,32,"And he made all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin take a stand. So the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,34,33,"Thus Josiah removed all the abominations from all the country that belonged to the children of Israel, and made all who were present in Israel diligently serve the LORD their God. All his days they did not depart from following the LORD God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,35,1,"Now Josiah kept a Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem, and they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the first month."
2 Chronicles,35,2,And he set the priests in their duties and encouraged them for the service of the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,35,3,"Then he said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to the LORD: “Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built. It shall no longer be a burden on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and His people Israel."
2 Chronicles,35,4,"Prepare yourselves according to your fathers’ houses, according to your divisions, following the written instruction of David king of Israel and the written instruction of Solomon his son."
2 Chronicles,35,5,"And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of your brethren the lay people, and according to the division of the father’s house of the Levites."
2 Chronicles,35,6,"So slaughter the Passover offerings, consecrate yourselves, and prepare them for your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.”"
2 Chronicles,35,7,"Then Josiah gave the lay people lambs and young goats from the flock, all for Passover offerings for all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, as well as three thousand cattle; these were from the king’s possessions."
2 Chronicles,35,8,"And his leaders gave willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand six hundred from the flock, and three hundred cattle."
2 Chronicles,35,9,"Also Conaniah, his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave to the Levites for Passover offerings five thousand from the flock and five hundred cattle."
2 Chronicles,35,10,"So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their places, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the king’s command."
2 Chronicles,35,11,"And they slaughtered the Passover offerings; and the priests sprinkled the blood with their hands, while the Levites skinned the animals."
2 Chronicles,35,12,"Then they removed the burnt offerings that they might give them to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of the lay people, to offer to the LORD, as it is written in the Book of Moses. And so they did with the cattle."
2 Chronicles,35,13,"Also they roasted the Passover offerings with fire according to the ordinance; but the other holy offerings they boiled in pots, in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them quickly among all the lay people."
2 Chronicles,35,14,"Then afterward they prepared portions for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were busy in offering burnt offerings and fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared portions for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron."
2 Chronicles,35,15,"And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their places, according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer. Also the gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not have to leave their position, because their brethren the Levites prepared portions for them."

2 Chronicles,35,19,In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.
2 Chronicles,35,20,"After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him."
2 Chronicles,35,21,"But he sent messengers to him, saying, “What have I to do with you, king of Judah? I have not come against you this day, but against the house with which I have war; for God commanded me to make haste. Refrain from meddling with God, who is with me, lest He destroy you.”"
2 Chronicles,35,22,"Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself so that he might fight with him, and did not heed the words of Necho from the mouth of God. So he came to fight in the Valley of Megiddo."

2 Chronicles,35,25,Jeremiah also lamented for Josiah. And to this day all the singing men and the singing women speak of Josiah in their lamentations. They made it a custom in Israel; and indeed they are written in the Laments.
2 Chronicles,35,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his goodness, according to what was written in the Law of the LORD,"

Ezra,1,5,"Then the heads of the fathers’ houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, with all whose spirits God had moved, arose to go up and build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem."
Ezra,1,6,"And all those who were around them encouraged them with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered."
Ezra,1,7,"King Cyrus also brought out the articles of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and put in the temple of his gods;"
Ezra,1,8,"and Cyrus king of Persia brought them out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah."
Ezra,1,9,"This is the number of them: thirty gold platters, one thousand silver platters, twenty-nine knives,"
Ezra,1,10,"thirty gold basins, four hundred and ten silver basins of a similar kind, and one thousand other articles."
Ezra,1,11,All the articles of gold and silver were five thousand four hundred. All these Sheshbazzar took with the captives who were brought from Babylon to Jerusalem.

Ezra,2,59,"And these were the ones who came up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer; but they could not identify their father’s house or their genealogy, whether they were of Israel:"
Ezra,2,60,"the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, and the sons of Nekoda, six hundred and fifty-two;"
Ezra,2,61,"and of the sons of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Koz, and the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called by their name."
Ezra,2,62,"These sought their listing among those who were registered by genealogy, but they were not found; therefore they were excluded from the priesthood as defiled."
Ezra,2,63,And the governor said to them that they should not eat of the most holy things till a priest could consult with the Urim and Thummim.
Ezra,2,64,"The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,"
Ezra,2,65,"besides their male and female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven; and they had two hundred men and women singers."
Ezra,2,66,"Their horses were seven hundred and thirty-six, their mules two hundred and forty-five,"

Ezra,2,68,"Some of the heads of the fathers’ houses, when they came to the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God, to erect it in its place:"
Ezra,2,69,"According to their ability, they gave to the treasury for the work sixty-one thousand gold drachmas, five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestly garments."
Ezra,2,70,"So the priests and the Levites, some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the Nethinim, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities."
Ezra,3,1,"And when the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem."
Ezra,3,2,"Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brethren, arose and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the Law of Moses the man of God."
Ezra,3,3,"Though fear had come upon them because of the people of those countries, they set the altar on its bases; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, both the morning and evening burnt offerings."
Ezra,3,4,"They also kept the Feast of Tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings in the number required by ordinance for each day."
Ezra,3,5,"Afterwards they offered the regular burnt offering, and those for New Moons and for all the appointed feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and those of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to the LORD."
Ezra,3,6,"From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, although the foundation of the temple of the LORD had not been laid."
Ezra,3,7,"They also gave money to the masons and the carpenters, and food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre to bring cedar logs from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the permission which they had from Cyrus king of Persia."
Ezra,3,8,"Now in the second month of the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, began work and appointed the Levites from twenty years old and above to oversee the work of the house of the LORD."
Ezra,3,9,"Then Jeshua with his sons and brothers, Kadmiel with his sons, and the sons of Judah, arose as one to oversee those working on the house of God: the sons of Henadad with their sons and their brethren the Levites."
Ezra,3,10,"When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD, according to the ordinance of David king of Israel."
Ezra,3,11,"And they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the LORD: “For He is good, For His mercy endures forever toward Israel.” Then all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid."
Ezra,3,12,"But many of the priests and Levites and heads of the fathers’ houses, old men who had seen the first temple, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this temple was laid before their eyes. Yet many shouted aloud for joy,"
Ezra,3,13,"so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the sound was heard afar off."
Ezra,4,1,"Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the descendants of the captivity were building the temple of the LORD God of Israel,"
Ezra,4,2,"they came to Zerubbabel and the heads of the fathers’ houses, and said to them, “Let us build with you, for we seek your God as you do; and we have sacrificed to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here.”"
Ezra,4,3,"But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the fathers’ houses of Israel said to them, “You may do nothing with us to build a house for our God; but we alone will build to the LORD God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.”"
Ezra,4,4,"Then the people of the land tried to discourage the people of Judah. They troubled them in building,"
Ezra,4,5,"and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia."
Ezra,4,6,"In the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,4,7,"In the days of Artaxerxes also, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabel, and the rest of their companions wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the letter was written in Aramaic script, and translated into the Aramaic language."
Ezra,4,8,Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes in this fashion:
Ezra,4,9,"From Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions—representatives of the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the people of Persia and Erech and Babylon and Shushan, the Dehavites, the Elamites,"
Ezra,4,10,and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnapper took captive and settled in the cities of Samaria and the remainder beyond the River —and so forth.
Ezra,4,11,"(This is a copy of the letter that they sent him) To King Artaxerxes from your servants, the men of the region beyond the River, and so forth:"
Ezra,4,12,"Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem, and are building the rebellious and evil city, and are finishing its walls and repairing the foundations."
Ezra,4,13,"Let it now be known to the king that, if this city is built and the walls completed, they will not pay tax, tribute, or custom, and the king’s treasury will be diminished."
Ezra,4,14,"Now because we receive support from the palace, it was not proper for us to see the king’s dishonor; therefore we have sent and informed the king,"
Ezra,4,15,"that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. And you will find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious city, harmful to kings and provinces, and that they have incited sedition within the city in former times, for which cause this city was destroyed."
Ezra,4,16,"We inform the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, the result will be that you will have no dominion beyond the River."
Ezra,4,17,"The king sent an answer: To Rehum the commander, to Shimshai the scribe, to the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria, and to the remainder beyond the River: Peace, and so forth."
Ezra,4,18,The letter which you sent to us has been clearly read before me.
Ezra,4,19,"And I gave the command, and a search has been made, and it was found that this city in former times has revolted against kings, and rebellion and sedition have been fostered in it."
Ezra,4,20,"There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the region beyond the River; and tax, tribute, and custom were paid to them."
Ezra,4,21,"Now give the command to make these men cease, that this city may not be built until the command is given by me."
Ezra,4,22,Take heed now that you do not fail to do this. Why should damage increase to the hurt of the kings?
Ezra,4,23,"Now when the copy of King Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem against the Jews, and by force of arms made them cease."
Ezra,4,24,"Thus the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem ceased, and it was discontinued until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia."
Ezra,5,1,"Then the prophet Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophets, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them."
Ezra,5,2,"So Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up and began to build the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and the prophets of God were with them, helping them."
Ezra,5,3,At the same time Tattenai the governor of the region beyond the River and Shethar-Boznai and their companions came to them and spoke thus to them: “Who has commanded you to build this temple and finish this wall?”
Ezra,5,4,"Then, accordingly, we told them the names of the men who were constructing this building."
Ezra,5,5,"But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, so that they could not make them cease till a report could go to Darius. Then a written answer was returned concerning this matter."
Ezra,5,6,"This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai sent: The governor of the region beyond the River, and Shethar-Boznai, and his companions, the Persians who were in the region beyond the River, to Darius the king."
Ezra,5,7,"(They sent a letter to him, in which was written thus) To Darius the king: All peace."
Ezra,5,8,"Let it be known to the king that we went into the province of Judea, to the temple of the great God, which is being built with heavy stones, and timber is being laid in the walls; and this work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands."
Ezra,5,9,"Then we asked those elders, and spoke thus to them: “Who commanded you to build this temple and to finish these walls?”"
Ezra,5,10,"We also asked them their names to inform you, that we might write the names of the men who were chief among them."
Ezra,5,11,"And thus they returned us an answer, saying: “We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and completed."
Ezra,5,12,"But because our fathers provoked the God of heaven to wrath, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this temple and carried the people away to Babylon."
Ezra,5,13,"However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to build this house of God."
Ezra,5,14,"Also, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple that was in Jerusalem and carried into the temple of Babylon—those King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon, and they were given to one named Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor."
Ezra,5,15,"And he said to him, ‘Take these articles; go, carry them to the temple site that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its former site.’"
Ezra,5,16,"Then the same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem; but from that time even until now it has been under construction, and it is not finished.”"
Ezra,5,17,"Now therefore, if it seems good to the king, let a search be made in the king’s treasure house, which is there in Babylon, whether it is so that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send us his pleasure concerning this matter."
Ezra,6,1,"Then King Darius issued a decree, and a search was made in the archives, where the treasures were stored in Babylon."
Ezra,6,2,"And at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a scroll was found, and in it a record was written thus:"
Ezra,6,3,"In the first year of King Cyrus, King Cyrus issued a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem: “Let the house be rebuilt, the place where they offered sacrifices; and let the foundations of it be firmly laid, its height sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits,"
Ezra,6,4,with three rows of heavy stones and one row of new timber. Let the expenses be paid from the king’s treasury.
Ezra,6,5,"Also let the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple which is in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and taken back to the temple which is in Jerusalem, each to its place; and deposit them in the house of God”—"
Ezra,6,6,"Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the region beyond the River, and Shethar-Boznai, and your companions the Persians who are beyond the River, keep yourselves far from there."
Ezra,6,7,Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its site.
Ezra,6,8,"Moreover I issue a decree as to what you shall do for the elders of these Jews, for the building of this house of God: Let the cost be paid at the king’s expense from taxes on the region beyond the River; this is to be given immediately to these men, so that they are not hindered."
Ezra,6,9,"And whatever they need—young bulls, rams, and lambs for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the request of the priests who are in Jerusalem—let it be given them day by day without fail,"
Ezra,6,10,"that they may offer sacrifices of sweet aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and his sons."
Ezra,6,11,"Also I issue a decree that whoever alters this edict, let a timber be pulled from his house and erected, and let him be hanged on it; and let his house be made a refuse heap because of this."
Ezra,6,12,"And may the God who causes His name to dwell there destroy any king or people who put their hand to alter it, or to destroy this house of God which is in Jerusalem. I Darius issue a decree; let it be done diligently."
Ezra,6,13,"Then Tattenai, governor of the region beyond the River, Shethar-Boznai, and their companions diligently did according to what King Darius had sent."
Ezra,6,14,"So the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the command of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia."
Ezra,6,15,"Now the temple was finished on the third day of the month of Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius."
Ezra,6,16,"Then the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites and the rest of the descendants of the captivity, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy."
Ezra,6,17,"And they offered sacrifices at the dedication of this house of God, one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel."
Ezra,6,18,"They assigned the priests to their divisions and the Levites to their divisions, over the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the Book of Moses."
Ezra,6,19,And the descendants of the captivity kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
Ezra,6,20,"For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves; all of them were ritually clean. And they slaughtered the Passover lambs for all the descendants of the captivity, for their brethren the priests, and for themselves."
Ezra,6,21,Then the children of Israel who had returned from the captivity ate together with all who had separated themselves from the filth of the nations of the land in order to seek the LORD God of Israel.
Ezra,6,22,"And they kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy; for the LORD made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel."
Ezra,7,1,"Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,"
Ezra,7,2,"the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,"
Ezra,7,3,"the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,"
Ezra,7,4,"the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,"
Ezra,7,5,"the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest—"
Ezra,7,6,"this Ezra came up from Babylon; and he was a skilled scribe in the Law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given. The king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him."
Ezra,7,7,"Some of the children of Israel, the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the Nethinim came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes."
Ezra,7,8,"And Ezra came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king."
Ezra,7,9,"On the first day of the first month he began his journey from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him."
Ezra,7,10,"For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the Law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel."
Ezra,7,11,"This is a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave Ezra the priest, the scribe, expert in the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of His statutes to Israel:"
Ezra,7,12,"Artaxerxes, king of kings, To Ezra the priest, a scribe of the Law of the God of heaven: Perfect peace, and so forth."
Ezra,7,13,"I issue a decree that all those of the people of Israel and the priests and Levites in my realm, who volunteer to go up to Jerusalem, may go with you."
Ezra,7,14,"And whereas you are being sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, with regard to the Law of your God which is in your hand;"
Ezra,7,15,"and whereas you are to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem;"
Ezra,7,16,"and whereas all the silver and gold that you may find in all the province of Babylon, along with the freewill offering of the people and the priests, are to be freely offered for the house of their God in Jerusalem—"
Ezra,7,17,"now therefore, be careful to buy with this money bulls, rams, and lambs, with their grain offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them on the altar of the house of your God in Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,18,"And whatever seems good to you and your brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, do it according to the will of your God."
Ezra,7,19,"Also the articles that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,20,"And whatever more may be needed for the house of your God, which you may have occasion to provide, pay for it from the king’s treasury."
Ezra,7,21,"And I, even I, Artaxerxes the king, issue a decree to all the treasurers who are in the region beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, may require of you, let it be done diligently,"
Ezra,7,22,"up to one hundred talents of silver, one hundred kors of wheat, one hundred baths of wine, one hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribed limit."
Ezra,7,23,"Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it diligently be done for the house of the God of heaven. For why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?"
Ezra,7,24,"Also we inform you that it shall not be lawful to impose tax, tribute, or custom on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God."
Ezra,7,25,"And you, Ezra, according to your God-given wisdom, set magistrates and judges who may judge all the people who are in the region beyond the River, all such as know the laws of your God; and teach those who do not know them."
Ezra,7,26,"Whoever will not observe the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily on him, whether it be death, or banishment, or confiscation of goods, or imprisonment."
Ezra,7,27,"Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, who has put such a thing as this in the king’s heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem,"
Ezra,7,28,"and has extended mercy to me before the king and his counselors, and before all the king’s mighty princes. So I was encouraged, as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me; and I gathered leading men of Israel to go up with me."
Ezra,8,1,"These are the heads of their fathers’ houses, and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of King Artaxerxes:"
Ezra,8,2,"of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, Hattush;"
Ezra,8,3,"of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah; and registered with him were one hundred and fifty males;"
Ezra,8,4,"of the sons of Pahath-Moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males;"
Ezra,8,5,"of the sons of Shechaniah, Ben-Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males;"
Ezra,8,6,"of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males;"
Ezra,8,7,"of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males;"
Ezra,8,8,"of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him eighty males;"
Ezra,8,9,"of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males;"
Ezra,8,10,"of the sons of Shelomith, Ben-Josiphiah, and with him one hundred and sixty males;"
Ezra,8,11,"of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males;"
Ezra,8,12,"of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him one hundred and ten males;"
Ezra,8,13,"of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these—Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah—and with them sixty males;"
Ezra,8,14,"also of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud, and with them seventy males."
Ezra,8,15,"Now I gathered them by the river that flows to Ahava, and we camped there three days. And I looked among the people and the priests, and found none of the sons of Levi there."
Ezra,8,16,"Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, leaders; also for Joiarib and Elnathan, men of understanding."
Ezra,8,17,"And I gave them a command for Iddo the chief man at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say to Iddo and his brethren the Nethinim at the place Casiphia—that they should bring us servants for the house of our God."
Ezra,8,18,"Then, by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, the son of Israel, namely Sherebiah, with his sons and brothers, eighteen men;"
Ezra,8,19,"and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty men;"
Ezra,8,20,"also of the Nethinim, whom David and the leaders had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim. All of them were designated by name."
Ezra,8,21,"Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek from Him the right way for us and our little ones and all our possessions."
Ezra,8,22,"For I was ashamed to request of the king an escort of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy on the road, because we had spoken to the king, saying, “The hand of our God is upon all those for good who seek Him, but His power and His wrath are against all those who forsake Him.”"
Ezra,8,23,"So we fasted and entreated our God for this, and He answered our prayer."
Ezra,8,24,"And I separated twelve of the leaders of the priests—Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them—"
Ezra,8,25,"and weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the articles, the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his princes, and all Israel who were present, had offered."
Ezra,8,26,"I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, silver articles weighing one hundred talents, one hundred talents of gold,"
Ezra,8,27,"twenty gold basins worth a thousand drachmas, and two vessels of fine polished bronze, precious as gold."
Ezra,8,28,"And I said to them, “You are holy to the LORD; the articles are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your fathers."
Ezra,8,29,"Watch and keep them until you weigh them before the leaders of the priests and the Levites and heads of the fathers’ houses of Israel in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.”"
Ezra,8,30,"So the priests and the Levites received the silver and the gold and the articles by weight, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God."
Ezra,8,31,"Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. And the hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambush along the road."
Ezra,8,32,"So we came to Jerusalem, and stayed there three days."
Ezra,8,33,"Now on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the articles were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; with them were the Levites, Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui,"
Ezra,8,34,with the number and weight of everything. All the weight was written down at that time.
Ezra,8,35,"The children of those who had been carried away captive, who had come from the captivity, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD."
Ezra,8,36,And they delivered the king’s orders to the king’s satraps and the governors in the region beyond the River. So they gave support to the people and the house of God.
Ezra,9,1,"When these things were done, the leaders came to me, saying, “The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, with respect to the abominations of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites."
Ezra,9,2,"For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, so that the holy seed is mixed with the peoples of those lands. Indeed, the hand of the leaders and rulers has been foremost in this trespass.”"
Ezra,9,3,"So when I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my robe, and plucked out some of the hair of my head and beard, and sat down astonished."
Ezra,9,4,"Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel assembled to me, because of the transgression of those who had been carried away captive, and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice."
Ezra,9,5,"At the evening sacrifice I arose from my fasting; and having torn my garment and my robe, I fell on my knees and spread out my hands to the LORD my God."
Ezra,9,6,"And I said: “O my God, I am too ashamed and humiliated to lift up my face to You, my God; for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens."
Ezra,9,7,"Since the days of our fathers to this day we have been very guilty, and for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to humiliation, as it is this day."
Ezra,9,8,"And now for a little while grace has been shown from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and give us a measure of revival in our bondage."
Ezra,9,9,"For we were slaves. Yet our God did not forsake us in our bondage; but He extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to revive us, to repair the house of our God, to rebuild its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,9,10,"And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments,"
Ezra,9,11,"which You commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land, with the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from one end to another with their impurity."
Ezra,9,12,"Now therefore, do not give your daughters as wives for their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons; and never seek their peace or prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good of the land, and leave it as an inheritance to your children forever.’"
Ezra,9,13,"And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, since You our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us such deliverance as this,"
Ezra,9,14,"should we again break Your commandments, and join in marriage with the people committing these abominations? Would You not be angry with us until You had consumed us, so that there would be no remnant or survivor?"
Ezra,9,15,"O LORD God of Israel, You are righteous, for we are left as a remnant, as it is this day. Here we are before You, in our guilt, though no one can stand before You because of this!”"
Ezra,10,1,"Now while Ezra was praying, and while he was confessing, weeping, and bowing down before the house of God, a very large assembly of men, women, and children gathered to him from Israel; for the people wept very bitterly."
Ezra,10,2,"And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, spoke up and said to Ezra, “We have trespassed against our God, and have taken pagan wives from the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope in Israel in spite of this."
Ezra,10,3,"Now therefore, let us make a covenant with our God to put away all these wives and those who have been born to them, according to the advice of my master and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law."
Ezra,10,4,"Arise, for this matter is your responsibility. We also are with you. Be of good courage, and do it.”"
Ezra,10,5,"Then Ezra arose, and made the leaders of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel swear an oath that they would do according to this word. So they swore an oath."
Ezra,10,6,"Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib; and when he came there, he ate no bread and drank no water, for he mourned because of the guilt of those from the captivity."
Ezra,10,7,"And they issued a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the descendants of the captivity, that they must gather at Jerusalem,"
Ezra,10,8,"and that whoever would not come within three days, according to the instructions of the leaders and elders, all his property would be confiscated, and he himself would be separated from the assembly of those from the captivity."
Ezra,10,9,"So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered at Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth of the month; and all the people sat in the open square of the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of heavy rain."
Ezra,10,10,"Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have transgressed and have taken pagan wives, adding to the guilt of Israel."
Ezra,10,11,"Now therefore, make confession to the LORD God of your fathers, and do His will; separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the pagan wives.”"
Ezra,10,12,"Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, “Yes! As you have said, so we must do."
Ezra,10,13,"But there are many people; it is the season for heavy rain, and we are not able to stand outside. Nor is this the work of one or two days, for there are many of us who have transgressed in this matter."
Ezra,10,14,"Please, let the leaders of our entire assembly stand; and let all those in our cities who have taken pagan wives come at appointed times, together with the elders and judges of their cities, until the fierce wrath of our God is turned away from us in this matter.”"
Ezra,10,15,"Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah opposed this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite gave them support."
Ezra,10,16,"Then the descendants of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain heads of the fathers’ households, were set apart by the fathers’ households, each of them by name; and they sat down on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter."
Ezra,10,17,By the first day of the first month they finished questioning all the men who had taken pagan wives.
Ezra,10,18,"And among the sons of the priests who had taken pagan wives the following were found of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah."
Ezra,10,19,"And they gave their promise that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they presented a ram of the flock as their trespass offering."
Ezra,10,20,Also of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah;
Ezra,10,21,"of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah;"
Ezra,10,22,"of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah."
Ezra,10,23,"Also of the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (the same is Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer."
Ezra,10,24,"Also of the singers: Eliashib; and of the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri."
Ezra,10,25,"And others of Israel: of the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, Jeziah, Malchiah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah;"
Ezra,10,26,"of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Eliah;"
Ezra,10,27,"of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza;"
Ezra,10,28,"of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai;"
Ezra,10,29,"of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Ramoth;"
Ezra,10,30,"of the sons of Pahath-Moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh;"
Ezra,10,31,"of the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,"
Ezra,10,32,"Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah;"
Ezra,10,33,"of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei;"
Ezra,10,34,"of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel,"
Ezra,10,35,"Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluh,"
Ezra,10,36,"Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,"
Ezra,10,37,"Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasai,"
Ezra,10,38,"Bani, Binnui, Shimei,"
Ezra,10,39,"Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah,"
Ezra,10,40,"Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,"
Ezra,10,41,"Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,"
Ezra,10,42,"Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph;"
Ezra,10,43,"of the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah."
Ezra,10,44,"All these had taken pagan wives, and some of them had wives by whom they had children."
Nehemiah,1,1,"The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. It came to pass in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the citadel,"
Nehemiah,1,2,"that Hanani one of my brethren came with men from Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who had survived the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,1,3,"And they said to me, “The survivors who are left from the captivity in the province are there in great distress and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem is also broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.”"
Nehemiah,1,4,"So it was, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned for many days; I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven."
Nehemiah,1,5,"And I said: “I pray, LORD God of heaven, O great and awesome God, You who keep Your covenant and mercy with those who love You and observe Your commandments,"
Nehemiah,1,6,"please let Your ear be attentive and Your eyes open, that You may hear the prayer of Your servant which I pray before You now, day and night, for the children of Israel Your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against You. Both my father’s house and I have sinned."
Nehemiah,1,7,"We have acted very corruptly against You, and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses."
Nehemiah,1,8,"Remember, I pray, the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations;"
Nehemiah,1,9,"but if you return to Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though some of you were cast out to the farthest part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and bring them to the place which I have chosen as a dwelling for My name.’"
Nehemiah,1,10,"Now these are Your servants and Your people, whom You have redeemed by Your great power, and by Your strong hand."
Nehemiah,1,11,"O Lord, I pray, please let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who desire to fear Your name; and let Your servant prosper this day, I pray, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.” For I was the king’s cupbearer."
Nehemiah,2,1,"And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, that I took the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never been sad in his presence before."
Nehemiah,2,2,"Therefore the king said to me, “Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing but sorrow of heart.” So I became dreadfully afraid,"
Nehemiah,2,3,"and said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire?”"
Nehemiah,2,4,"Then the king said to me, “What do you request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven."
Nehemiah,2,5,"And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may rebuild it.”"
Nehemiah,2,6,"Then the king said to me (the queen also sitting beside him), “How long will your journey be? And when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time."
Nehemiah,2,7,"Furthermore I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given to me for the governors of the region beyond the River, that they must permit me to pass through till I come to Judah,"
Nehemiah,2,8,"and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he must give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel which pertains to the temple, for the city wall, and for the house that I will occupy.” And the king granted them to me according to the good hand of my God upon me."
Nehemiah,2,9,"Then I went to the governors in the region beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me."
Nehemiah,2,10,"When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard of it, they were deeply disturbed that a man had come to seek the well-being of the children of Israel."
Nehemiah,2,11,So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.
Nehemiah,2,12,"Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me; I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem; nor was there any animal with me, except the one on which I rode."
Nehemiah,2,13,"And I went out by night through the Valley Gate to the Serpent Well and the Refuse Gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were burned with fire."
Nehemiah,2,14,"Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but there was no room for the animal under me to pass."
Nehemiah,2,15,"So I went up in the night by the valley, and viewed the wall; then I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned."
Nehemiah,2,16,"And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the others who did the work."
Nehemiah,2,17,"Then I said to them, “You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer be a reproach.”"
Nehemiah,2,18,"And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me, and also of the king’s words that he had spoken to me. So they said, “Let us rise up and build.” Then they set their hands to this good work."
Nehemiah,2,19,"But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard of it, they laughed at us and despised us, and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?”"
Nehemiah,2,20,"So I answered them, and said to them, “The God of heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no heritage or right or memorial in Jerusalem.”"
Nehemiah,3,1,"Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests and built the Sheep Gate; they consecrated it and hung its doors. They built as far as the Tower of the Hundred, and consecrated it, then as far as the Tower of Hananel."
Nehemiah,3,2,Next to Eliashib the men of Jericho built. And next to them Zaccur the son of Imri built.
Nehemiah,3,3,Also the sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate; they laid its beams and hung its doors with its bolts and bars.
Nehemiah,3,4,"And next to them Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz, made repairs. Next to them Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel, made repairs. Next to them Zadok the son of Baana made repairs."
Nehemiah,3,5,Next to them the Tekoites made repairs; but their nobles did not put their shoulders to the work of their Lord.
Nehemiah,3,6,"Moreover Jehoiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired the Old Gate; they laid its beams and hung its doors, with its bolts and bars."
Nehemiah,3,7,"And next to them Melatiah the Gibeonite, Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and Mizpah, repaired the residence of the governor of the region beyond the River."
Nehemiah,3,8,"Next to him Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs. Also next to him Hananiah, one of the perfumers, made repairs; and they fortified Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall."
Nehemiah,3,9,"And next to them Rephaiah the son of Hur, leader of half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs."
Nehemiah,3,10,Next to them Jedaiah the son of Harumaph made repairs in front of his house. And next to him Hattush the son of Hashabniah made repairs.

Nehemiah,3,15,"Shallun the son of Col-Hozeh, leader of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate; he built it, covered it, hung its doors with its bolts and bars, and repaired the wall of the Pool of Shelah by the King’s Garden, as far as the stairs that go down from the City of David."
Nehemiah,3,16,"After him Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, leader of half the district of Beth Zur, made repairs as far as the place in front of the tombs of David, to the man-made pool, and as far as the House of the Mighty."
Nehemiah,3,17,"After him the Levites, under Rehum the son of Bani, made repairs. Next to him Hashabiah, leader of half the district of Keilah, made repairs for his district."
Nehemiah,3,18,"After him their brethren, under Bavai the son of Henadad, leader of the other half of the district of Keilah, made repairs."
Nehemiah,3,19,"And next to him Ezer the son of Jeshua, the leader of Mizpah, repaired another section in front of the Ascent to the Armory at the buttress."
Nehemiah,3,20,"After him Baruch the son of Zabbai carefully repaired the other section, from the buttress to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest."
Nehemiah,3,21,"After him Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz, repaired another section, from the door of the house of Eliashib to the end of the house of Eliashib."
Nehemiah,3,22,"And after him the priests, the men of the plain, made repairs."
Nehemiah,3,23,"After him Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs opposite their house. After them Azariah the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, made repairs by his house."
Nehemiah,3,24,"After him Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another section, from the house of Azariah to the buttress, even as far as the corner."

Nehemiah,3,29,"After them Zadok the son of Immer made repairs in front of his own house. After him Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the East Gate, made repairs."

Nehemiah,3,31,"After him Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the house of the Nethinim and of the merchants, in front of the Miphkad Gate, and as far as the upper room at the corner."
Nehemiah,3,32,"And between the upper room at the corner, as far as the Sheep Gate, the goldsmiths and the merchants made repairs."
Nehemiah,4,1,"But it so happened, when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, that he was furious and very indignant, and mocked the Jews."
Nehemiah,4,2,"And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they complete it in a day? Will they revive the stones from the heaps of rubbish—stones that are burned?”"
Nehemiah,4,3,"Now Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, “Whatever they build, if even a fox goes up on it, he will break down their stone wall.”"
Nehemiah,4,4,"Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their reproach on their own heads, and give them as plunder to a land of captivity!"
Nehemiah,4,5,"Do not cover their iniquity, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before You; for they have provoked You to anger before the builders."
Nehemiah,4,6,"So we built the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half its height, for the people had a mind to work."
Nehemiah,4,7,"Now it happened, when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being restored and the gaps were beginning to be closed, that they became very angry,"
Nehemiah,4,8,and all of them conspired together to come and attack Jerusalem and create confusion.
Nehemiah,4,9,"Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and because of them we set a watch against them day and night."
Nehemiah,4,10,"Then Judah said, “The strength of the laborers is failing, and there is so much rubbish that we are not able to build the wall.”"
Nehemiah,4,11,"And our adversaries said, “They will neither know nor see anything, till we come into their midst and kill them and cause the work to cease.”"
Nehemiah,4,12,"So it was, when the Jews who dwelt near them came, that they told us ten times, “From whatever place you turn, they will be upon us.”"
Nehemiah,4,13,"Therefore I positioned men behind the lower parts of the wall, at the openings; and I set the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows."
Nehemiah,4,14,"And I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the leaders, and to the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”"
Nehemiah,4,15,"And it happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had brought their plot to nothing, that all of us returned to the wall, everyone to his work."
Nehemiah,4,16,"So it was, from that time on, that half of my servants worked at construction, while the other half held the spears, the shields, the bows, and wore armor; and the leaders were behind all the house of Judah."
Nehemiah,4,17,"Those who built on the wall, and those who carried burdens, loaded themselves so that with one hand they worked at construction, and with the other held a weapon."
Nehemiah,4,18,Every one of the builders had his sword girded at his side as he built. And the one who sounded the trumpet was beside me.
Nehemiah,4,19,"Then I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, “The work is great and extensive, and we are separated far from one another on the wall."
Nehemiah,4,20,"Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.”"
Nehemiah,4,21,"So we labored in the work, and half of the men held the spears from daybreak until the stars appeared."
Nehemiah,4,22,"At the same time I also said to the people, “Let each man and his servant stay at night in Jerusalem, that they may be our guard by night and a working party by day.”"
Nehemiah,4,23,"So neither I, my brethren, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes, except that everyone took them off for washing."
Nehemiah,5,1,And there was a great outcry of the people and their wives against their Jewish brethren.
Nehemiah,5,2,"For there were those who said, “We, our sons, and our daughters are many; therefore let us get grain, that we may eat and live.”"
Nehemiah,5,3,"There were also some who said, “We have mortgaged our lands and vineyards and houses, that we might buy grain because of the famine.”"
Nehemiah,5,4,"There were also those who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tax on our lands and vineyards."
Nehemiah,5,5,"Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and indeed we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters have been brought into slavery. It is not in our power to redeem them, for other men have our lands and vineyards.”"
Nehemiah,5,6,And I became very angry when I heard their outcry and these words.
Nehemiah,5,7,"After serious thought, I rebuked the nobles and rulers, and said to them, “Each of you is exacting usury from his brother.” So I called a great assembly against them."
Nehemiah,5,8,"And I said to them, “According to our ability we have redeemed our Jewish brethren who were sold to the nations. Now indeed, will you even sell your brethren? Or should they be sold to us?” Then they were silenced and found nothing to say."
Nehemiah,5,9,"Then I said, “What you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?"
Nehemiah,5,10,"I also, with my brethren and my servants, am lending them money and grain. Please, let us stop this usury!"
Nehemiah,5,11,"Restore now to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also a hundredth of the money and the grain, the new wine and the oil, that you have charged them.”"
Nehemiah,5,12,"So they said, “We will restore it, and will require nothing from them; we will do as you say.” Then I called the priests, and required an oath from them that they would do according to this promise."
Nehemiah,5,13,"Then I shook out the fold of my garment and said, “So may God shake out each man from his house, and from his property, who does not perform this promise. Even thus may he be shaken out and emptied.” And all the assembly said, “Amen!” and praised the LORD. Then the people did according to this promise."
Nehemiah,5,14,"Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the governor’s provisions."
Nehemiah,5,15,"But the former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people, and took from them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people, but I did not do so, because of the fear of God."
Nehemiah,5,16,"Indeed, I also continued the work on this wall, and we did not buy any land. All my servants were gathered there for the work."
Nehemiah,5,17,"And at my table were one hundred and fifty Jews and rulers, besides those who came to us from the nations around us."
Nehemiah,5,18,"Now that which was prepared daily was one ox and six choice sheep. Also fowl were prepared for me, and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine. Yet in spite of this I did not demand the governor’s provisions, because the bondage was heavy on this people."
Nehemiah,5,19,"Remember me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people."
Nehemiah,6,1,"Now it happened when Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall, and that there were no breaks left in it (though at that time I had not hung the doors in the gates),"
Nehemiah,6,2,"that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come, let us meet together among the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they thought to do me harm."
Nehemiah,6,3,"So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?”"
Nehemiah,6,4,"But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner."
Nehemiah,6,5,"Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before, the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand."
Nehemiah,6,6,"In it was written: It is reported among the nations, and Geshem says, that you and the Jews plan to rebel; therefore, according to these rumors, you are rebuilding the wall, that you may be their king."
Nehemiah,6,7,"And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem, saying, “There is a king in Judah!” Now these matters will be reported to the king. So come, therefore, and let us consult together."
Nehemiah,6,8,"Then I sent to him, saying, “No such things as you say are being done, but you invent them in your own heart.”"
Nehemiah,6,9,"For they all were trying to make us afraid, saying, “Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will not be done.” Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands."
Nehemiah,6,10,"Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was a secret informer; and he said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you; indeed, at night they will come to kill you.”"
Nehemiah,6,11,"And I said, “Should such a man as I flee? And who is there such as I who would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in!”"
Nehemiah,6,12,"Then I perceived that God had not sent him at all, but that he pronounced this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him."
Nehemiah,6,13,"For this reason he was hired, that I should be afraid and act that way and sin, so that they might have cause for an evil report, that they might reproach me."
Nehemiah,6,14,"My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat, according to these their works, and the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have made me afraid."
Nehemiah,6,15,"So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days."
Nehemiah,6,16,"And it happened, when all our enemies heard of it, and all the nations around us saw these things, that they were very disheartened in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was done by our God."
Nehemiah,6,17,"Also in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came to them."
Nehemiah,6,18,"For many in Judah were pledged to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah."
Nehemiah,6,19,"Also they reported his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to frighten me."
Nehemiah,7,1,"Then it was, when the wall was built and I had hung the doors, when the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed,"
Nehemiah,7,2,"that I gave the charge of Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the leader of the citadel, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many."
Nehemiah,7,3,"And I said to them, “Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut and bar the doors; and appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, one at his watch station and another in front of his own house.”"
Nehemiah,7,4,"Now the city was large and spacious, but the people in it were few, and the houses were not rebuilt."
Nehemiah,7,5,"Then my God put it into my heart to gather the nobles, the rulers, and the people, that they might be registered by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of those who had come up in the first return, and found written in it:"
Nehemiah,7,6,"These are the people of the province who came back from the captivity, of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, everyone to his city."
Nehemiah,7,7,"Those who came with Zerubbabel were Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:"

Nehemiah,7,61,"And these were the ones who came up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not identify their father’s house nor their lineage, whether they were of Israel:"
Nehemiah,7,62,"the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, six hundred and forty-two;"
Nehemiah,7,63,"and of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Koz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called by their name."
Nehemiah,7,64,"These sought their listing among those who were registered by genealogy, but it was not found; therefore they were excluded from the priesthood as defiled."
Nehemiah,7,65,And the governor said to them that they should not eat of the most holy things till a priest could consult with the Urim and Thummim.
Nehemiah,7,66,"Altogether the whole assembly was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,"

Nehemiah,7,73,"When the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities."
Nehemiah,8,1,"Now all the people gathered together as one man in the open square that was in front of the Water Gate; and they told Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded Israel."
Nehemiah,8,2,So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly of men and women and all who could hear with understanding on the first day of the seventh month.
Nehemiah,8,3,"Then he read from it in the open square that was in front of the Water Gate from morning until midday, before the men and women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the Book of the Law."
Nehemiah,8,4,"So Ezra the scribe stood on a platform of wood which they had made for the purpose; and beside him, at his right hand, stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Urijah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah; and at his left hand Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam."
Nehemiah,8,5,"And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up."
Nehemiah,8,6,"And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. Then all the people answered, “Amen, Amen!” while lifting up their hands. And they bowed their heads and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground."
Nehemiah,8,7,"Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, helped the people to understand the Law; and the people stood in their place."
Nehemiah,8,8,"So they read distinctly from the book, in the Law of God; and they gave the sense, and helped them to understand the reading."
Nehemiah,8,9,"And Nehemiah, who was the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn nor weep.” For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law."
Nehemiah,8,10,"Then he said to them, “Go your way, eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Do not sorrow, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.”"
Nehemiah,8,11,"So the Levites quieted all the people, saying, “Be still, for the day is holy; do not be grieved.”"
Nehemiah,8,12,"And all the people went their way to eat and drink, to send portions and rejoice greatly, because they understood the words that were declared to them."
Nehemiah,8,13,"Now on the second day the heads of the fathers’ houses of all the people, with the priests and Levites, were gathered to Ezra the scribe, in order to understand the words of the Law."
Nehemiah,8,14,"And they found written in the Law, which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths during the feast of the seventh month,"
Nehemiah,8,15,"and that they should announce and proclaim in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the mountain, and bring olive branches, branches of oil trees, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of leafy trees, to make booths, as it is written.”"
Nehemiah,8,16,"Then the people went out and brought them and made themselves booths, each one on the roof of his house, or in their courtyards or the courts of the house of God, and in the open square of the Water Gate and in the open square of the Gate of Ephraim."
Nehemiah,8,17,So the whole assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and sat under the booths; for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day the children of Israel had not done so. And there was very great gladness.
Nehemiah,8,18,"Also day by day, from the first day until the last day, he read from the Book of the Law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day there was a sacred assembly, according to the prescribed manner."
Nehemiah,9,1,"Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, in sackcloth, and with dust on their heads."
Nehemiah,9,2,Then those of Israelite lineage separated themselves from all foreigners; and they stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.
Nehemiah,9,3,And they stood up in their place and read from the Book of the Law of the LORD their God for one–fourth of the day; and for another fourth they confessed and worshiped the LORD their God.
Nehemiah,9,4,"Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the stairs of the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to the LORD their God."
Nehemiah,9,5,"And the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said: “Stand up and bless the LORD your God Forever and ever! “Blessed be Your glorious name, Which is exalted above all blessing and praise!"
Nehemiah,9,6,"You alone are the LORD; You have made heaven, The heaven of heavens, with all their host, The earth and everything on it, The seas and all that is in them, And You preserve them all. The host of heaven worships You."
Nehemiah,9,7,"“You are the LORD God, Who chose Abram, And brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans, And gave him the name Abraham;"
Nehemiah,9,8,"You found his heart faithful before You, And made a covenant with him To give the land of the Canaanites, The Hittites, the Amorites, The Perizzites, the Jebusites, And the Girgashites— To give it to his descendants. You have performed Your words, For You are righteous."
Nehemiah,9,9,"“You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, And heard their cry by the Red Sea."
Nehemiah,9,10,"You showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, Against all his servants, And against all the people of his land. For You knew that they acted proudly against them. So You made a name for Yourself, as it is this day."
Nehemiah,9,11,"And You divided the sea before them, So that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; And their persecutors You threw into the deep, As a stone into the mighty waters."
Nehemiah,9,12,"Moreover You led them by day with a cloudy pillar, And by night with a pillar of fire, To give them light on the road Which they should travel."
Nehemiah,9,13,"“You came down also on Mount Sinai, And spoke with them from heaven, And gave them just ordinances and true laws, Good statutes and commandments."
Nehemiah,9,14,"You made known to them Your holy Sabbath, And commanded them precepts, statutes and laws, By the hand of Moses Your servant."
Nehemiah,9,15,"You gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, And brought them water out of the rock for their thirst, And told them to go in to possess the land Which You had sworn to give them."
Nehemiah,9,16,"“But they and our fathers acted proudly, Hardened their necks, And did not heed Your commandments."
Nehemiah,9,17,"They refused to obey, And they were not mindful of Your wonders That You did among them. But they hardened their necks, And in their rebellion They appointed a leader To return to their bondage. But You are God, Ready to pardon, Gracious and merciful, Slow to anger, Abundant in kindness, And did not forsake them."
Nehemiah,9,18,"“Even when they made a molded calf for themselves, And said, ‘This is your god That brought you up out of Egypt,’ And worked great provocations,"
Nehemiah,9,19,"Yet in Your manifold mercies You did not forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of the cloud did not depart from them by day, To lead them on the road; Nor the pillar of fire by night, To show them light, And the way they should go."
Nehemiah,9,20,"You also gave Your good Spirit to instruct them, And did not withhold Your manna from their mouth, And gave them water for their thirst."
Nehemiah,9,21,Forty years You sustained them in the wilderness; They lacked nothing; Their clothes did not wear out And their feet did not swell.
Nehemiah,9,22,"“Moreover You gave them kingdoms and nations, And divided them into districts. So they took possession of the land of Sihon, The land of the king of Heshbon, And the land of Og king of Bashan."
Nehemiah,9,23,"You also multiplied their children as the stars of heaven, And brought them into the land Which You had told their fathers To go in and possess."
Nehemiah,9,24,"So the people went in And possessed the land; You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, The Canaanites, And gave them into their hands, With their kings And the people of the land, That they might do with them as they wished."
Nehemiah,9,25,"And they took strong cities and a rich land, And possessed houses full of all goods, Cisterns already dug, vineyards, olive groves, And fruit trees in abundance. So they ate and were filled and grew fat, And delighted themselves in Your great goodness."
Nehemiah,9,26,"“Nevertheless they were disobedient And rebelled against You, Cast Your law behind their backs And killed Your prophets, who testified against them To turn them to Yourself; And they worked great provocations."
Nehemiah,9,27,"Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their enemies, Who oppressed them; And in the time of their trouble, When they cried to You, You heard from heaven; And according to Your abundant mercies You gave them deliverers who saved them From the hand of their enemies."
Nehemiah,9,28,"“But after they had rest, They again did evil before You. Therefore You left them in the hand of their enemies, So that they had dominion over them; Yet when they returned and cried out to You, You heard from heaven; And many times You delivered them according to Your mercies,"
Nehemiah,9,29,"And testified against them, That You might bring them back to Your law. Yet they acted proudly, And did not heed Your commandments, But sinned against Your judgments, ‘Which if a man does, he shall live by them.’ And they shrugged their shoulders, Stiffened their necks, And would not hear."
Nehemiah,9,30,"Yet for many years You had patience with them, And testified against them by Your Spirit in Your prophets. Yet they would not listen; Therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands."
Nehemiah,9,31,"Nevertheless in Your great mercy You did not utterly consume them nor forsake them; For You are God, gracious and merciful."
Nehemiah,9,32,"“Now therefore, our God, The great, the mighty, and awesome God, Who keeps covenant and mercy: Do not let all the trouble seem small before You That has come upon us, Our kings and our princes, Our priests and our prophets, Our fathers and on all Your people, From the days of the kings of Assyria until this day."
Nehemiah,9,33,"However You are just in all that has befallen us; For You have dealt faithfully, But we have done wickedly."
Nehemiah,9,34,"Neither our kings nor our princes, Our priests nor our fathers, Have kept Your law, Nor heeded Your commandments and Your testimonies, With which You testified against them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"For they have not served You in their kingdom, Or in the many good things that You gave them, Or in the large and rich land which You set before them; Nor did they turn from their wicked works."
Nehemiah,9,36,"“Here we are, servants today! And the land that You gave to our fathers, To eat its fruit and its bounty, Here we are, servants in it!"
Nehemiah,9,37,"And it yields much increase to the kings You have set over us, Because of our sins; Also they have dominion over our bodies and our cattle At their pleasure; And we are in great distress."
Nehemiah,9,38,"“And because of all this, We make a sure covenant and write it; Our leaders, our Levites, and our priests seal it.”"
Nehemiah,10,1,"Now those who placed their seal on the document were: Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah,"

Nehemiah,10,29,"these joined with their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse and an oath to walk in God’s Law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord, and His ordinances and His statutes:"
Nehemiah,10,30,"We would not give our daughters as wives to the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons;"
Nehemiah,10,31,"if the peoples of the land brought wares or any grain to sell on the Sabbath day, we would not buy it from them on the Sabbath, or on a holy day; and we would forego the seventh year’s produce and the exacting of every debt."
Nehemiah,10,32,"Also we made ordinances for ourselves, to exact from ourselves yearly one-third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God:"
Nehemiah,10,33,"for the showbread, for the regular grain offering, for the regular burnt offering of the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the set feasts; for the holy things, for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and all the work of the house of our God."
Nehemiah,10,34,"We cast lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for bringing the wood offering into the house of our God, according to our fathers’ houses, at the appointed times year by year, to burn on the altar of the LORD our God as it is written in the Law."
Nehemiah,10,35,"And we made ordinances to bring the firstfruits of our ground and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, to the house of the LORD;"
Nehemiah,10,36,"to bring the firstborn of our sons and our cattle, as it is written in the Law, and the firstborn of our herds and our flocks, to the house of our God, to the priests who minister in the house of our God;"
Nehemiah,10,37,"to bring the firstfruits of our dough, our offerings, the fruit from all kinds of trees, the new wine and oil, to the priests, to the storerooms of the house of our God; and to bring the tithes of our land to the Levites, for the Levites should receive the tithes in all our farming communities."
Nehemiah,10,38,"And the priest, the descendant of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes; and the Levites shall bring up a tenth of the tithes to the house of our God, to the rooms of the storehouse."
Nehemiah,10,39,"For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the grain, of the new wine and the oil, to the storerooms where the articles of the sanctuary are, where the priests who minister and the gatekeepers and the singers are; and we will not neglect the house of our God."
Nehemiah,11,1,"Now the leaders of the people dwelt at Jerusalem; the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city, and nine-tenths were to dwell in other cities."
Nehemiah,11,2,And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,11,3,"These are the heads of the province who dwelt in Jerusalem. (But in the cities of Judah everyone dwelt in his own possession in their cities—Israelites, priests, Levites, Nethinim, and descendants of Solomon’s servants.)"
Nehemiah,11,4,"Also in Jerusalem dwelt some of the children of Judah and of the children of Benjamin. The children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of Perez;"
Nehemiah,11,5,"and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-Hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of Shiloni."
Nehemiah,11,6,All the sons of Perez who dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred and sixty-eight valiant men.
Nehemiah,11,7,"And these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah;"
Nehemiah,11,8,"and after him Gabbai and Sallai, nine hundred and twenty-eight."
Nehemiah,11,9,"Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer, and Judah the son of Senuah was second over the city."

Nehemiah,11,11,"Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the leader of the house of God."
Nehemiah,11,12,"Their brethren who did the work of the house were eight hundred and twenty-two; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah,"
Nehemiah,11,13,"and his brethren, heads of the fathers’ houses, were two hundred and forty-two; and Amashai the son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,"
Nehemiah,11,14,"and their brethren, mighty men of valor, were one hundred and twenty-eight. Their overseer was Zabdiel the son of one of the great men."
Nehemiah,11,15,"Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;"
Nehemiah,11,16,"Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the heads of the Levites, had the oversight of the business outside of the house of God;"
Nehemiah,11,17,"Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, the leader who began the thanksgiving with prayer; Bakbukiah, the second among his brethren; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun."
Nehemiah,11,18,All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred and eighty-four.
Nehemiah,11,19,"Moreover the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren who kept the gates, were one hundred and seventy-two."
Nehemiah,11,20,"And the rest of Israel, of the priests and Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, everyone in his inheritance."
Nehemiah,11,21,But the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel. And Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim.
Nehemiah,11,22,"Also the overseer of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha, of the sons of Asaph, the singers in charge of the service of the house of God."
Nehemiah,11,23,"For it was the king’s command concerning them that a certain portion should be for the singers, a quota day by day."
Nehemiah,11,24,"Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was the king’s deputy in all matters concerning the people."
Nehemiah,11,25,"And as for the villages with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt in Kirjath Arba and its villages, Dibon and its villages, Jekabzeel and its villages;"
Nehemiah,11,26,"in Jeshua, Moladah, Beth Pelet,"
Nehemiah,11,27,"Hazar Shual, and Beersheba and its villages;"
Nehemiah,11,28,in Ziklag and Meconah and its villages;
Nehemiah,11,29,"in En Rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth,"
Nehemiah,11,30,"Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages; in Lachish and its fields; in Azekah and its villages. They dwelt from Beersheba to the Valley of Hinnom."

Nehemiah,11,34,"in Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat;"
Nehemiah,11,35,"in Lod, Ono, and the Valley of Craftsmen."
Nehemiah,11,36,Some of the Judean divisions of Levites were in Benjamin.
Nehemiah,12,1,"Now these are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,"
Nehemiah,12,2,"Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,"
Nehemiah,12,3,"Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,"
Nehemiah,12,4,"Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,"
Nehemiah,12,5,"Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,"
Nehemiah,12,6,"Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,"
Nehemiah,12,7,"Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the heads of the priests and their brethren in the days of Jeshua."
Nehemiah,12,8,"Moreover the Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah who led the thanksgiving psalms, he and his brethren."
Nehemiah,12,9,"Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, stood across from them in their duties."
Nehemiah,12,10,"Jeshua begot Joiakim, Joiakim begot Eliashib, Eliashib begot Joiada,"
Nehemiah,12,11,"Joiada begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jaddua."
Nehemiah,12,12,"Now in the days of Joiakim, the priests, the heads of the fathers’ houses were: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;"
Nehemiah,12,13,"of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;"
Nehemiah,12,14,"of Melichu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;"

Nehemiah,12,20,"of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;"
Nehemiah,12,21,"of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; and of Jedaiah, Nethanel."
Nehemiah,12,22,"During the reign of Darius the Persian, a record was also kept of the Levites and priests who had been heads of their fathers’ houses in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua."
Nehemiah,12,23,"The sons of Levi, the heads of the fathers’ houses until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib, were written in the book of the chronicles."
Nehemiah,12,24,"And the heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers across from them, to praise and give thanks, group alternating with group, according to the command of David the man of God."
Nehemiah,12,25,"Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers keeping the watch at the storerooms of the gates."
Nehemiah,12,26,"These lived in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe."
Nehemiah,12,27,"Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites in all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings and singing, with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps."
Nehemiah,12,28,"And the sons of the singers gathered together from the countryside around Jerusalem, from the villages of the Netophathites,"
Nehemiah,12,29,"from the house of Gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built themselves villages all around Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,12,30,"Then the priests and Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, the gates, and the wall."
Nehemiah,12,31,"So I brought the leaders of Judah up on the wall, and appointed two large thanksgiving choirs. One went to the right hand on the wall toward the Refuse Gate."
Nehemiah,12,32,"After them went Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah,"
Nehemiah,12,33,"and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,"
Nehemiah,12,34,"Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,"
Nehemiah,12,35,"and some of the priests’ sons with trumpets—Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,"
Nehemiah,12,36,"and his brethren, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. Ezra the scribe went before them."
Nehemiah,12,37,"By the Fountain Gate, in front of them, they went up the stairs of the City of David, on the stairway of the wall, beyond the house of David, as far as the Water Gate eastward."
Nehemiah,12,38,"The other thanksgiving choir went the opposite way, and I was behind them with half of the people on the wall, going past the Tower of the Ovens as far as the Broad Wall,"
Nehemiah,12,39,"and above the Gate of Ephraim, above the Old Gate, above the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate; and they stopped by the Gate of the Prison."
Nehemiah,12,40,"So the two thanksgiving choirs stood in the house of God, likewise I and the half of the rulers with me;"
Nehemiah,12,41,"and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Minjamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;"
Nehemiah,12,42,"also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loudly with Jezrahiah the director."
Nehemiah,12,43,"Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women and the children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off."
Nehemiah,12,44,"And at the same time some were appointed over the rooms of the storehouse for the offerings, the firstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions specified by the Law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who ministered."
Nehemiah,12,45,"Both the singers and the gatekeepers kept the charge of their God and the charge of the purification, according to the command of David and Solomon his son."
Nehemiah,12,46,"For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chiefs of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God."
Nehemiah,12,47,"In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the portions for the singers and the gatekeepers, a portion for each day. They also consecrated holy things for the Levites, and the Levites consecrated them for the children of Aaron."
Nehemiah,13,1,"On that day they read from the Book of Moses in the hearing of the people, and in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever come into the assembly of God,"
Nehemiah,13,2,"because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing."
Nehemiah,13,3,"So it was, when they had heard the Law, that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel."
Nehemiah,13,4,"Now before this, Eliashib the priest, having authority over the storerooms of the house of our God, was allied with Tobiah."
Nehemiah,13,5,"And he had prepared for him a large room, where previously they had stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the articles, the tithes of grain, the new wine and oil, which were commanded to be given to the Levites and singers and gatekeepers, and the offerings for the priests."
Nehemiah,13,6,"But during all this I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Then after certain days I obtained leave from the king,"
Nehemiah,13,7,"and I came to Jerusalem and discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God."
Nehemiah,13,8,And it grieved me bitterly; therefore I threw all the household goods of Tobiah out of the room.
Nehemiah,13,9,"Then I commanded them to cleanse the rooms; and I brought back into them the articles of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense."
Nehemiah,13,10,I also realized that the portions for the Levites had not been given them; for each of the Levites and the singers who did the work had gone back to his field.
Nehemiah,13,11,"So I contended with the rulers, and said, “Why is the house of God forsaken?” And I gathered them together and set them in their place."
Nehemiah,13,12,Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the storehouse.
Nehemiah,13,13,"And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouse Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered faithful, and their task was to distribute to their brethren."
Nehemiah,13,14,"Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its services!"
Nehemiah,13,15,"In those days I saw people in Judah treading wine presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I warned them about the day on which they were selling provisions."
Nehemiah,13,16,"Men of Tyre dwelt there also, who brought in fish and all kinds of goods, and sold them on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,13,17,"Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, “What evil thing is this that you do, by which you profane the Sabbath day?"
Nehemiah,13,18,"Did not your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city? Yet you bring added wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”"
Nehemiah,13,19,"So it was, at the gates of Jerusalem, as it began to be dark before the Sabbath, that I commanded the gates to be shut, and charged that they must not be opened till after the Sabbath. Then I posted some of my servants at the gates, so that no burdens would be brought in on the Sabbath day."
Nehemiah,13,20,Now the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.
Nehemiah,13,21,"Then I warned them, and said to them, “Why do you spend the night around the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you!” From that time on they came no more on the Sabbath."
Nehemiah,13,22,"And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should go and guard the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of Your mercy!"
Nehemiah,13,23,"In those days I also saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab."
Nehemiah,13,24,"And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and could not speak the language of Judah, but spoke according to the language of one or the other people."
Nehemiah,13,25,"So I contended with them and cursed them, struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, “You shall not give your daughters as wives to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or yourselves."
Nehemiah,13,26,"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him, who was beloved of his God; and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless pagan women caused even him to sin."
Nehemiah,13,27,"Should we then hear of your doing all this great evil, transgressing against our God by marrying pagan women?”"
Nehemiah,13,28,"And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I drove him from me."
Nehemiah,13,29,"Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites."
Nehemiah,13,30,"Thus I cleansed them of everything pagan. I also assigned duties to the priests and the Levites, each to his service,"
Nehemiah,13,31,"and to bringing the wood offering and the firstfruits at appointed times. Remember me, O my God, for good!"
Esther,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this was the Ahasuerus who reigned over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India to Ethiopia),"
Esther,1,2,"in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the citadel,"
Esther,1,3,"that in the third year of his reign he made a feast for all his officials and servants—the powers of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the princes of the provinces being before him—"
Esther,1,4,"when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendor of his excellent majesty for many days, one hundred and eighty days in all."
Esther,1,5,"And when these days were completed, the king made a feast lasting seven days for all the people who were present in Shushan the citadel, from great to small, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace."
Esther,1,6,"There were white and blue linen curtains fastened with cords of fine linen and purple on silver rods and marble pillars; and the couches were of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of alabaster, turquoise, and white and black marble."
Esther,1,7,"And they served drinks in golden vessels, each vessel being different from the other, with royal wine in abundance, according to the generosity of the king."
Esther,1,8,"In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had ordered all the officers of his household, that they should do according to each man’s pleasure."
Esther,1,9,Queen Vashti also made a feast for the women in the royal palace which belonged to King Ahasuerus.
Esther,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus,"
Esther,1,11,"to bring Queen Vashti before the king, wearing her royal crown, in order to show her beauty to the people and the officials, for she was beautiful to behold."
Esther,1,12,"But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command brought by his eunuchs; therefore the king was furious, and his anger burned within him."
Esther,1,13,"Then the king said to the wise men who understood the times (for this was the king’s manner toward all who knew law and justice,"
Esther,1,14,"those closest to him being Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who had access to the king’s presence, and who ranked highest in the kingdom):"
Esther,1,15,"“What shall we do to Queen Vashti, according to law, because she did not obey the command of King Ahasuerus brought to her by the eunuchs?”"
Esther,1,16,"And Memucan answered before the king and the princes: “Queen Vashti has not only wronged the king, but also all the princes, and all the people who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus."
Esther,1,17,"For the queen’s behavior will become known to all women, so that they will despise their husbands in their eyes, when they report, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him, but she did not come.’"
Esther,1,18,This very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media will say to all the king’s officials that they have heard of the behavior of the queen. Thus there will be excessive contempt and wrath.
Esther,1,19,"If it pleases the king, let a royal decree go out from him, and let it be recorded in the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it will not be altered, that Vashti shall come no more before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she."
Esther,1,20,"When the king’s decree which he will make is proclaimed throughout all his empire (for it is great), all wives will honor their husbands, both great and small.”"
Esther,1,21,"And the reply pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan."
Esther,1,22,"Then he sent letters to all the king’s provinces, to each province in its own script, and to every people in their own language, that each man should be master in his own house, and speak in the language of his own people."
Esther,2,1,"After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus subsided, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and what had been decreed against her."
Esther,2,2,Then the king’s servants who attended him said: “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king;
Esther,2,3,"and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather all the beautiful young virgins to Shushan the citadel, into the women’s quarters, under the custody of Hegai the king’s eunuch, custodian of the women. And let beauty preparations be given them."
Esther,2,4,"Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” This thing pleased the king, and he did so."
Esther,2,5,"In Shushan the citadel there was a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite."
Esther,2,6,"Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been captured with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away."
Esther,2,7,"And Mordecai had brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter, for she had neither father nor mother. The young woman was lovely and beautiful. When her father and mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter."
Esther,2,8,"So it was, when the king’s command and decree were heard, and when many young women were gathered at Shushan the citadel, under the custody of Hegai, that Esther also was taken to the king’s palace, into the care of Hegai the custodian of the women."
Esther,2,9,"Now the young woman pleased him, and she obtained his favor; so he readily gave beauty preparations to her, besides her allowance. Then seven choice maidservants were provided for her from the king’s palace, and he moved her and her maidservants to the best place in the house of the women."
Esther,2,10,"Esther had not revealed her people or family, for Mordecai had charged her not to reveal it."
Esther,2,11,"And every day Mordecai paced in front of the court of the women’s quarters, to learn of Esther’s welfare and what was happening to her."
Esther,2,12,"Each young woman’s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after she had completed twelve months’ preparation, according to the regulations for the women, for thus were the days of their preparation apportioned: six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfumes and preparations for beautifying women."
Esther,2,13,"Thus prepared, each young woman went to the king, and she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the women’s quarters to the king’s palace."
Esther,2,14,"In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned to the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who kept the concubines. She would not go in to the king again unless the king delighted in her and called for her by name."
Esther,2,15,"Now when the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his daughter, to go in to the king, she requested nothing but what Hegai the king’s eunuch, the custodian of the women, advised. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all who saw her."
Esther,2,16,"So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, into his royal palace, in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign."
Esther,2,17,"The king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of Vashti."
Esther,2,18,"Then the king made a great feast, the Feast of Esther, for all his officials and servants; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces and gave gifts according to the generosity of a king."
Esther,2,19,"When virgins were gathered together a second time, Mordecai sat within the king’s gate."
Esther,2,20,"Now Esther had not revealed her family and her people, just as Mordecai had charged her, for Esther obeyed the command of Mordecai as when she was brought up by him."
Esther,2,21,"In those days, while Mordecai sat within the king’s gate, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, doorkeepers, became furious and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus."
Esther,2,22,"So the matter became known to Mordecai, who told Queen Esther, and Esther informed the king in Mordecai’s name."
Esther,2,23,"And when an inquiry was made into the matter, it was confirmed, and both were hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king."
Esther,3,1,"After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who were with him."
Esther,3,2,"And all the king’s servants who were within the king’s gate bowed and paid homage to Haman, for so the king had commanded concerning him. But Mordecai would not bow or pay homage."
Esther,3,3,"Then the king’s servants who were within the king’s gate said to Mordecai, “Why do you transgress the king’s command?”"
Esther,3,4,"Now it happened, when they spoke to him daily and he would not listen to them, that they told it to Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s words would stand; for Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew."
Esther,3,5,"When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow or pay him homage, Haman was filled with wrath."
Esther,3,6,"But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him of the people of Mordecai. Instead, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus—the people of Mordecai."
Esther,3,7,"In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, the lot), before Haman to determine the day and the month, until it fell on the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar."
Esther,3,8,"Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from all other people’s, and they do not keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not fitting for the king to let them remain."
Esther,3,9,"If it pleases the king, let a decree be written that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who do the work, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.”"
Esther,3,10,"So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews."
Esther,3,11,"And the king said to Haman, “The money and the people are given to you, to do with them as seems good to you.”"
Esther,3,12,"Then the king’s scribes were called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and a decree was written according to all that Haman commanded—to the king’s satraps, to the governors who were over each province, to the officials of all people, to every province according to its script, and to every people in their language. In the name of King Ahasuerus it was written, and sealed with the king’s signet ring."
Esther,3,13,"And the letters were sent by couriers into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their possessions."
Esther,3,14,"A copy of the document was to be issued as law in every province, being published for all people, that they should be ready for that day."
Esther,3,15,"The couriers went out, hastened by the king’s command; and the decree was proclaimed in Shushan the citadel. So the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Shushan was perplexed."
Esther,4,1,"When Mordecai learned all that had happened, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city. He cried out with a loud and bitter cry."
Esther,4,2,"He went as far as the front of the king’s gate, for no one might enter the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth."
Esther,4,3,"And in every province where the king’s command and decree arrived, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
Esther,4,4,"So Esther’s maids and eunuchs came and told her, and the queen was deeply distressed. Then she sent garments to clothe Mordecai and take his sackcloth away from him, but he would not accept them."
Esther,4,5,"Then Esther called Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and she gave him a command concerning Mordecai, to learn what and why this was."
Esther,4,6,So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square that was in front of the king’s gate.
Esther,4,7,"And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasuries to destroy the Jews."
Esther,4,8,"He also gave him a copy of the written decree for their destruction, which was given at Shushan, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her, and that he might command her to go in to the king to make supplication to him and plead before him for her people."
Esther,4,9,So Hathach returned and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Esther,4,10,"Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a command for Mordecai:"
Esther,4,11,"“All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that any man or woman who goes into the inner court to the king, who has not been called, he has but one law: put all to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter, that he may live. Yet I myself have not been called to go in to the king these thirty days.”"
Esther,4,12,So they told Mordecai Esther’s words.
Esther,4,13,And Mordecai told them to answer Esther: “Do not think in your heart that you will escape in the king’s palace any more than all the other Jews.
Esther,4,14,"For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”"
Esther,4,15,Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai:
Esther,4,16,"“Go, gather all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me; neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. My maids and I will fast likewise. And so I will go to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish!”"
Esther,4,17,So Mordecai went his way and did according to all that Esther commanded him.
Esther,5,1,"Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king’s palace, across from the king’s house, while the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, facing the entrance of the house."
Esther,5,2,"So it was, when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, that she found favor in his sight, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther went near and touched the top of the scepter."
Esther,5,3,"And the king said to her, “What do you wish, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given to you—up to half the kingdom!”"
Esther,5,4,"So Esther answered, “If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”"
Esther,5,5,"Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly, that he may do as Esther has said.” So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared."
Esther,5,6,"At the banquet of wine the king said to Esther, “What is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!”"
Esther,5,7,"Then Esther answered and said, “My petition and request is this:"
Esther,5,8,"If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, then let the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said.”"
Esther,5,9,"So Haman went out that day joyful and with a glad heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, and that he did not stand or tremble before him, he was filled with indignation against Mordecai."
Esther,5,10,"Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home, and he sent and called for his friends and his wife Zeresh."
Esther,5,11,"Then Haman told them of his great riches, the multitude of his children, everything in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the officials and servants of the king."
Esther,5,12,"Moreover Haman said, “Besides, Queen Esther invited no one but me to come in with the king to the banquet that she prepared; and tomorrow I am again invited by her, along with the king."
Esther,5,13,"Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”"
Esther,5,14,"Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows be made, fifty cubits high, and in the morning suggest to the king that Mordecai be hanged on it; then go merrily with the king to the banquet.” And the thing pleased Haman; so he had the gallows made."
Esther,6,1,That night the king could not sleep. So one was commanded to bring the book of the records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.
Esther,6,2,"And it was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs, the doorkeepers who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus."
Esther,6,3,"Then the king said, “What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?” And the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.”"
Esther,6,4,"So the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him."
Esther,6,5,"The king’s servants said to him, “Haman is there, standing in the court.” And the king said, “Let him come in.”"
Esther,6,6,"So Haman came in, and the king asked him, “What shall be done for the man whom the king delights to honor?” Now Haman thought in his heart, “Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?”"
Esther,6,7,"And Haman answered the king, “For the man whom the king delights to honor,"
Esther,6,8,"let a royal robe be brought which the king has worn, and a horse on which the king has ridden, which has a royal crest placed on its head."
Esther,6,9,"Then let this robe and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that he may array the man whom the king delights to honor. Then parade him on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him: ‘Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!’”"
Esther,6,10,"Then the king said to Haman, “Hurry, take the robe and the horse, as you have suggested, and do so for Mordecai the Jew who sits within the king’s gate! Leave nothing undone of all that you have spoken.”"
Esther,6,11,"So Haman took the robe and the horse, arrayed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the city square, and proclaimed before him, “Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!”"
Esther,6,12,"Afterward Mordecai went back to the king’s gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered."
Esther,6,13,"When Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him, his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him but will surely fall before him.”"
Esther,6,14,"While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs came, and hastened to bring Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared."
Esther,7,1,So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther.
Esther,7,2,"And on the second day, at the banquet of wine, the king again said to Esther, “What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!”"
Esther,7,3,"Then Queen Esther answered and said, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request."
Esther,7,4,"For we have been sold, my people and I, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. Had we been sold as male and female slaves, I would have held my tongue, although the enemy could never compensate for the king’s loss.”"
Esther,7,5,"So King Ahasuerus answered and said to Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, who would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing?”"
Esther,7,6,"And Esther said, “The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman!” So Haman was terrified before the king and queen."
Esther,7,7,"Then the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden; but Haman stood before Queen Esther, pleading for his life, for he saw that evil was determined against him by the king."
Esther,7,8,"When the king returned from the palace garden to the place of the banquet of wine, Haman had fallen across the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, “Will he also assault the queen while I am in the house?” As the word left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face."
Esther,7,9,"Now Harbonah, one of the eunuchs, said to the king, “Look! The gallows, fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke good on the king’s behalf, is standing at the house of Haman.” Then the king said, “Hang him on it!”"
Esther,7,10,So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s wrath subsided.
Esther,8,1,"On that day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told how he was related to her."
Esther,8,2,"So the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai; and Esther appointed Mordecai over the house of Haman."
Esther,8,3,"Now Esther spoke again to the king, fell down at his feet, and implored him with tears to counteract the evil of Haman the Agagite, and the scheme which he had devised against the Jews."
Esther,8,4,"And the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king,"
Esther,8,5,"and said, “If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight and the thing seems right to the king and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to annihilate the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces."
Esther,8,6,For how can I endure to see the evil that will come to my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my countrymen?”
Esther,8,7,"Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, “Indeed, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he tried to lay his hand on the Jews."
Esther,8,8,"You yourselves write a decree concerning the Jews, as you please, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s signet ring; for whatever is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring no one can revoke.”"
Esther,8,9,"So the king’s scribes were called at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day; and it was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, the satraps, the governors, and the princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces in all, to every province in its own script, to every people in their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language."
Esther,8,10,"And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed it with the king’s signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horseback, riding on royal horses bred from swift steeds."
Esther,8,11,"By these letters the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to gather together and protect their lives—to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the forces of any people or province that would assault them, both little children and women, and to plunder their possessions,"
Esther,8,12,"on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar."
Esther,8,13,"A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province and published for all people, so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies."
Esther,8,14,"The couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king’s command. And the decree was issued in Shushan the citadel."
Esther,8,15,"So Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, with a great crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple; and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad."
Esther,8,16,"The Jews had light and gladness, joy and honor."
Esther,8,17,"And in every province and city, wherever the king’s command and decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a holiday. Then many of the people of the land became Jews, because fear of the Jews fell upon them."
Esther,9,1,"Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day, the time came for the king’s command and his decree to be executed. On the day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, the opposite occurred, in that the Jews themselves overpowered those who hated them."
Esther,9,2,"The Jews gathered together in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm. And no one could withstand them, because fear of them fell upon all people."
Esther,9,3,"And all the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and all those doing the king’s work, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them."
Esther,9,4,"For Mordecai was great in the king’s palace, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for this man Mordecai became increasingly prominent."
Esther,9,5,"Thus the Jews defeated all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, with slaughter and destruction, and did what they pleased with those who hated them."
Esther,9,6,And in Shushan the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.
Esther,9,7,"Also Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,"
Esther,9,8,"Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,"
Esther,9,9,"Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha—"
Esther,9,10,"the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews—they killed; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder."
Esther,9,11,On that day the number of those who were killed in Shushan the citadel was brought to the king.
Esther,9,12,"And the king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the citadel, and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? Now what is your petition? It shall be granted to you. Or what is your further request? It shall be done.”"
Esther,9,13,"Then Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do again tomorrow according to today’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”"
Esther,9,14,"So the king commanded this to be done; the decree was issued in Shushan, and they hanged Haman’s ten sons."
Esther,9,15,And the Jews who were in Shushan gathered together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred men at Shushan; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder.
Esther,9,16,"The remainder of the Jews in the king’s provinces gathered together and protected their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of their enemies; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder."
Esther,9,17,This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. And on the fourteenth of the month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
Esther,9,18,"But the Jews who were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day, as well as on the fourteenth; and on the fifteenth of the month they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness."
Esther,9,19,"Therefore the Jews of the villages who dwelt in the unwalled towns celebrated the fourteenth day of the month of Adar with gladness and feasting, as a holiday, and for sending presents to one another."
Esther,9,20,"And Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters to all the Jews, near and far, who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus,"
Esther,9,21,"to establish among them that they should celebrate yearly the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar,"
Esther,9,22,"as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, as the month which was turned from sorrow to joy for them, and from mourning to a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and joy, of sending presents to one another and gifts to the poor."
Esther,9,23,"So the Jews accepted the custom which they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them,"
Esther,9,24,"because Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to annihilate them, and had cast Pur (that is, the lot), to consume them and destroy them;"
Esther,9,25,"but when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letter that this wicked plot which Haman had devised against the Jews should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows."
Esther,9,26,"So they called these days Purim, after the name Pur. Therefore, because of all the words of this letter, what they had seen concerning this matter, and what had happened to them,"
Esther,9,27,"the Jews established and imposed it upon themselves and their descendants and all who would join them, that without fail they should celebrate these two days every year, according to the written instructions and according to the prescribed time,"
Esther,9,28,"that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city, that these days of Purim should not fail to be observed among the Jews, and that the memory of them should not perish among their descendants."
Esther,9,29,"Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim."
Esther,9,30,"And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews, to the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,"
Esther,9,31,"to confirm these days of Purim at their appointed time, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had prescribed for them, and as they had decreed for themselves and their descendants concerning matters of their fasting and lamenting."
Esther,9,32,"So the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim, and it was written in the book."
Esther,10,1,And King Ahasuerus imposed tribute on the land and on the islands of the sea.
Esther,10,2,"Now all the acts of his power and his might, and the account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?"
Esther,10,3,"For Mordecai the Jew was second to King Ahasuerus, and was great among the Jews and well received by the multitude of his brethren, seeking the good of his people and speaking peace to all his countrymen."

Proverbs,30,18,"There are three things which are too wonderful for me, Yes, four which I do not understand:"
Proverbs,30,19,"The way of an eagle in the air, The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the midst of the sea, And the way of a man with a virgin."

Proverbs,30,32,"If you have been foolish in exalting yourself, Or if you have devised evil, put your hand on your mouth."

Proverbs,31,1,"The words of King Lemuel, the utterance which his mother taught him:"
Proverbs,31,2,"What, my son? And what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows?"
Proverbs,31,3,"Do not give your strength to women, Nor your ways to that which destroys kings."

Proverbs,31,10,Who can find a virtuous wife? For her worth is far above rubies.

Proverbs,31,12,She does him good and not evil All the days of her life.
Proverbs,31,13,"She seeks wool and flax, And willingly works with her hands."

Ecclesiastes,1,1,"The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem."
Ecclesiastes,1,2,"“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher; “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.”"
Ecclesiastes,1,3,What profit has a man from all his labor In which he toils under the sun?
Ecclesiastes,1,4,"One generation passes away, and another generation comes; But the earth abides forever."
Ecclesiastes,1,5,"The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, And hastens to the place where it arose."
Ecclesiastes,1,6,"The wind goes toward the south, And turns around to the north; The wind whirls about continually, And comes again on its circuit."
Ecclesiastes,1,7,"All the rivers run into the sea, Yet the sea is not full; To the place from which the rivers come, There they return again."
Ecclesiastes,1,8,"All things are full of labor; Man cannot express it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, Nor the ear filled with hearing."
Ecclesiastes,1,9,"That which has been is what will be, That which is done is what will be done, And there is nothing new under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,1,10,"Is there anything of which it may be said, “See, this is new”? It has already been in ancient times before us."
Ecclesiastes,1,11,"There is no remembrance of former things, Nor will there be any remembrance of things that are to come By those who will come after."
Ecclesiastes,1,12,"I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem."
Ecclesiastes,1,13,"And I set my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven; this burdensome task God has given to the sons of man, by which they may be exercised."
Ecclesiastes,1,14,"I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and indeed, all is vanity and grasping for the wind."
Ecclesiastes,1,15,"What is crooked cannot be made straight, And what is lacking cannot be numbered."
Ecclesiastes,1,16,"I communed with my heart, saying, “Look, I have attained greatness, and have gained more wisdom than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My heart has understood great wisdom and knowledge.”"
Ecclesiastes,1,17,And I set my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is grasping for the wind.
Ecclesiastes,1,18,"For in much wisdom is much grief, And he who increases knowledge increases sorrow."
Ecclesiastes,2,1,"I said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure”; but surely, this also was vanity."
Ecclesiastes,2,2,"I said of laughter—“Madness!”; and of mirth, “What does it accomplish?”"
Ecclesiastes,2,3,"I searched in my heart how to gratify my flesh with wine, while guiding my heart with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was good for the sons of men to do under heaven all the days of their lives."
Ecclesiastes,2,4,"I made my works great, I built myself houses, and planted myself vineyards."
Ecclesiastes,2,5,"I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them."
Ecclesiastes,2,6,I made myself water pools from which to water the growing trees of the grove.
Ecclesiastes,2,7,"I acquired male and female servants, and had servants born in my house. Yes, I had greater possessions of herds and flocks than all who were in Jerusalem before me."
Ecclesiastes,2,8,"I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the special treasures of kings and of the provinces. I acquired male and female singers, the delights of the sons of men, and musical instruments of all kinds."
Ecclesiastes,2,9,So I became great and excelled more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me.
Ecclesiastes,2,10,"Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, For my heart rejoiced in all my labor; And this was my reward from all my labor."
Ecclesiastes,2,11,Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done And on the labor in which I had toiled; And indeed all was vanity and grasping for the wind. There was no profit under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,2,12,Then I turned myself to consider wisdom and madness and folly; For what can the man do who succeeds the king?— Only what he has already done.
Ecclesiastes,2,13,Then I saw that wisdom excels folly As light excels darkness.
Ecclesiastes,2,14,"The wise man’s eyes are in his head, But the fool walks in darkness. Yet I myself perceived That the same event happens to them all."
Ecclesiastes,2,15,"So I said in my heart, “As it happens to the fool, It also happens to me, And why was I then more wise?” Then I said in my heart, “This also is vanity.”"
Ecclesiastes,2,16,"For there is no more remembrance of the wise than of the fool forever, Since all that now is will be forgotten in the days to come. And how does a wise man die? As the fool!"
Ecclesiastes,2,17,"Therefore I hated life because the work that was done under the sun was distressing to me, for all is vanity and grasping for the wind."
Ecclesiastes,2,18,"Then I hated all my labor in which I had toiled under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who will come after me."
Ecclesiastes,2,19,And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will rule over all my labor in which I toiled and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes,2,20,Therefore I turned my heart and despaired of all the labor in which I had toiled under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,2,21,"For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, knowledge, and skill; yet he must leave his heritage to a man who has not labored for it. This also is vanity and a great evil."
Ecclesiastes,2,22,"For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun?"
Ecclesiastes,2,23,"For all his days are sorrowful, and his work burdensome; even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,2,24,"Nothing is better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand of God."
Ecclesiastes,2,25,"For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?"
Ecclesiastes,2,26,"For God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy to a man who is good in His sight; but to the sinner He gives the work of gathering and collecting, that he may give to him who is good before God. This also is vanity and grasping for the wind."
Ecclesiastes,3,1,"To everything there is a season, A time for every purpose under heaven:"
Ecclesiastes,3,2,"A time to be born, And a time to die; A time to plant, And a time to pluck what is planted;"
Ecclesiastes,3,3,"A time to kill, And a time to heal; A time to break down, And a time to build up;"
Ecclesiastes,3,4,"A time to weep, And a time to laugh; A time to mourn, And a time to dance;"
Ecclesiastes,3,5,"A time to cast away stones, And a time to gather stones; A time to embrace, And a time to refrain from embracing;"
Ecclesiastes,3,6,"A time to gain, And a time to lose; A time to keep, And a time to throw away;"
Ecclesiastes,3,7,"A time to tear, And a time to sew; A time to keep silence, And a time to speak;"
Ecclesiastes,3,8,"A time to love, And a time to hate; A time of war, And a time of peace."
Ecclesiastes,3,9,What profit has the worker from that in which he labors?
Ecclesiastes,3,10,I have seen the God-given task with which the sons of men are to be occupied.
Ecclesiastes,3,11,"He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also He has put eternity in their hearts, except that no one can find out the work that God does from beginning to end."
Ecclesiastes,3,12,"I know that nothing is better for them than to rejoice, and to do good in their lives,"
Ecclesiastes,3,13,and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor—it is the gift of God.
Ecclesiastes,3,14,"I know that whatever God does, It shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, And nothing taken from it. God does it, that men should fear before Him."
Ecclesiastes,3,15,"That which is has already been, And what is to be has already been; And God requires an account of what is past."
Ecclesiastes,3,16,"Moreover I saw under the sun: In the place of judgment, Wickedness was there; And in the place of righteousness, Iniquity was there."
Ecclesiastes,3,17,"I said in my heart, “God shall judge the righteous and the wicked, For there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.”"
Ecclesiastes,3,18,"I said in my heart, “Concerning the condition of the sons of men, God tests them, that they may see that they themselves are like animals.”"
Ecclesiastes,3,19,"For what happens to the sons of men also happens to animals; one thing befalls them: as one dies, so dies the other. Surely, they all have one breath; man has no advantage over animals, for all is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,3,20,"All go to one place: all are from the dust, and all return to dust."
Ecclesiastes,3,21,"Who knows the spirit of the sons of men, which goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, which goes down to the earth?"
Ecclesiastes,3,22,"So I perceived that nothing is better than that a man should rejoice in his own works, for that is his heritage. For who can bring him to see what will happen after him?"
Ecclesiastes,4,1,"Then I returned and considered all the oppression that is done under the sun: And look! The tears of the oppressed, But they have no comforter— On the side of their oppressors there is power, But they have no comforter."
Ecclesiastes,4,2,"Therefore I praised the dead who were already dead, More than the living who are still alive."
Ecclesiastes,4,3,"Yet, better than both is he who has never existed, Who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,4,4,"Again, I saw that for all toil and every skillful work a man is envied by his neighbor. This also is vanity and grasping for the wind."
Ecclesiastes,4,5,The fool folds his hands And consumes his own flesh.
Ecclesiastes,4,6,"Better a handful with quietness Than both hands full, together with toil and grasping for the wind."
Ecclesiastes,4,7,"Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun:"
Ecclesiastes,4,8,"There is one alone, without companion: He has neither son nor brother. Yet there is no end to all his labors, Nor is his eye satisfied with riches. But he never asks, “For whom do I toil and deprive myself of good?” This also is vanity and a grave misfortune."
Ecclesiastes,4,9,"Two are better than one, Because they have a good reward for their labor."
Ecclesiastes,4,10,"For if they fall, one will lift up his companion. But woe to him who is alone when he falls, For he has no one to help him up."
Ecclesiastes,4,11,"Again, if two lie down together, they will keep warm; But how can one be warm alone?"
Ecclesiastes,4,12,"Though one may be overpowered by another, two can withstand him. And a threefold cord is not quickly broken."
Ecclesiastes,4,13,Better a poor and wise youth Than an old and foolish king who will be admonished no more.
Ecclesiastes,4,14,"For he comes out of prison to be king, Although he was born poor in his kingdom."
Ecclesiastes,4,15,I saw all the living who walk under the sun; They were with the second youth who stands in his place.
Ecclesiastes,4,16,There was no end of all the people over whom he was made king; Yet those who come afterward will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and grasping for the wind.
Ecclesiastes,5,1,"Walk prudently when you go to the house of God; and draw near to hear rather than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they do evil."
Ecclesiastes,5,2,"Do not be rash with your mouth, And let not your heart utter anything hastily before God. For God is in heaven, and you on earth; Therefore let your words be few."
Ecclesiastes,5,3,"For a dream comes through much activity, And a fool’s voice is known by his many words."
Ecclesiastes,5,4,"When you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it; For He has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you have vowed—"
Ecclesiastes,5,5,Better not to vow than to vow and not pay.
Ecclesiastes,5,6,"Do not let your mouth cause your flesh to sin, nor say before the messenger of God that it was an error. Why should God be angry at your excuse and destroy the work of your hands?"
Ecclesiastes,5,7,For in the multitude of dreams and many words there is also vanity. But fear God.
Ecclesiastes,5,8,"If you see the oppression of the poor, and the violent perversion of justice and righteousness in a province, do not marvel at the matter; for high official watches over high official, and higher officials are over them."
Ecclesiastes,5,9,Moreover the profit of the land is for all; even the king is served from the field.
Ecclesiastes,5,10,"He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver; Nor he who loves abundance, with increase. This also is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,5,11,"When goods increase, They increase who eat them; So what profit have the owners Except to see them with their eyes?"
Ecclesiastes,5,12,"The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, Whether he eats little or much; But the abundance of the rich will not permit him to sleep."
Ecclesiastes,5,13,There is a severe evil which I have seen under the sun: Riches kept for their owner to his hurt.
Ecclesiastes,5,14,"But those riches perish through misfortune; When he begets a son, there is nothing in his hand."
Ecclesiastes,5,15,"As he came from his mother’s womb, naked shall he return, To go as he came; And he shall take nothing from his labor Which he may carry away in his hand."
Ecclesiastes,5,16,"And this also is a severe evil— Just exactly as he came, so shall he go. And what profit has he who has labored for the wind?"
Ecclesiastes,5,17,"All his days he also eats in darkness, And he has much sorrow and sickness and anger."
Ecclesiastes,5,18,"Here is what I have seen: It is good and fitting for one to eat and drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labor in which he toils under the sun all the days of his life which God gives him; for it is his heritage."
Ecclesiastes,5,19,"As for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, and given him power to eat of it, to receive his heritage and rejoice in his labor—this is the gift of God."
Ecclesiastes,5,20,"For he will not dwell unduly on the days of his life, because God keeps him busy with the joy of his heart."
Ecclesiastes,6,1,"There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men:"
Ecclesiastes,6,2,"A man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor, so that he lacks nothing for himself of all he desires; yet God does not give him power to eat of it, but a foreigner consumes it. This is vanity, and it is an evil affliction."
Ecclesiastes,6,3,"If a man begets a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with goodness, or indeed he has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better than he—"
Ecclesiastes,6,4,"for it comes in vanity and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness."
Ecclesiastes,6,5,"Though it has not seen the sun or known anything, this has more rest than that man,"
Ecclesiastes,6,6,even if he lives a thousand years twice—but has not seen goodness. Do not all go to one place?
Ecclesiastes,6,7,"All the labor of man is for his mouth, And yet the soul is not satisfied."
Ecclesiastes,6,8,"For what more has the wise man than the fool? What does the poor man have, Who knows how to walk before the living?"
Ecclesiastes,6,9,Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of desire. This also is vanity and grasping for the wind.
Ecclesiastes,6,10,"Whatever one is, he has been named already, For it is known that he is man; And he cannot contend with Him who is mightier than he."
Ecclesiastes,6,11,"Since there are many things that increase vanity, How is man the better?"
Ecclesiastes,6,12,"For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he passes like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will happen after him under the sun?"
Ecclesiastes,7,1,"A good name is better than precious ointment, And the day of death than the day of one’s birth;"
Ecclesiastes,7,2,"Better to go to the house of mourning Than to go to the house of feasting, For that is the end of all men; And the living will take it to heart."
Ecclesiastes,7,3,"Sorrow is better than laughter, For by a sad countenance the heart is made better."
Ecclesiastes,7,4,"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, But the heart of fools is in the house of mirth."
Ecclesiastes,7,5,It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise Than for a man to hear the song of fools.
Ecclesiastes,7,6,"For like the crackling of thorns under a pot, So is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,7,7,"Surely oppression destroys a wise man’s reason, And a bribe debases the heart."
Ecclesiastes,7,8,The end of a thing is better than its beginning; The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
Ecclesiastes,7,9,"Do not hasten in your spirit to be angry, For anger rests in the bosom of fools."
Ecclesiastes,7,10,"Do not say, “Why were the former days better than these?” For you do not inquire wisely concerning this."
Ecclesiastes,7,11,"Wisdom is good with an inheritance, And profitable to those who see the sun."
Ecclesiastes,7,12,"For wisdom is a defense as money is a defense, But the excellence of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to those who have it."
Ecclesiastes,7,13,Consider the work of God; For who can make straight what He has made crooked?
Ecclesiastes,7,14,"In the day of prosperity be joyful, But in the day of adversity consider: Surely God has appointed the one as well as the other, So that man can find out nothing that will come after him."
Ecclesiastes,7,15,"I have seen everything in my days of vanity: There is a just man who perishes in his righteousness, And there is a wicked man who prolongs life in his wickedness."
Ecclesiastes,7,16,"Do not be overly righteous, Nor be overly wise: Why should you destroy yourself?"
Ecclesiastes,7,17,"Do not be overly wicked, Nor be foolish: Why should you die before your time?"
Ecclesiastes,7,18,"It is good that you grasp this, And also not remove your hand from the other; For he who fears God will escape them all."
Ecclesiastes,7,19,Wisdom strengthens the wise More than ten rulers of the city.
Ecclesiastes,7,20,For there is not a just man on earth who does good And does not sin.
Ecclesiastes,7,21,"Also do not take to heart everything people say, Lest you hear your servant cursing you."
Ecclesiastes,7,22,"For many times, also, your own heart has known That even you have cursed others."
Ecclesiastes,7,23,"All this I have proved by wisdom. I said, “I will be wise”; But it was far from me."
Ecclesiastes,7,24,"As for that which is far off and exceedingly deep, Who can find it out?"
Ecclesiastes,7,25,"I applied my heart to know, To search and seek out wisdom and the reason of things, To know the wickedness of folly, Even of foolishness and madness."
Ecclesiastes,7,26,"And I find more bitter than death The woman whose heart is snares and nets, Whose hands are fetters. He who pleases God shall escape from her, But the sinner shall be trapped by her."
Ecclesiastes,7,27,"Here is what I have found,” says the Preacher, “Adding one thing to the other to find out the reason,"
Ecclesiastes,7,28,"Which my soul still seeks but I cannot find: One man among a thousand I have found, But a woman among all these I have not found."
Ecclesiastes,7,29,"Truly, this only I have found: That God made man upright, But they have sought out many schemes.”"
Ecclesiastes,8,1,"Who is like a wise man? And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man’s wisdom makes his face shine, And the sternness of his face is changed."
Ecclesiastes,8,2,"I say, “Keep the king’s commandment for the sake of your oath to God."
Ecclesiastes,8,3,"Do not be hasty to go from his presence. Do not take your stand for an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him.”"
Ecclesiastes,8,4,"Where the word of a king is, there is power; And who may say to him, “What are you doing?”"
Ecclesiastes,8,5,"He who keeps his command will experience nothing harmful; And a wise man’s heart discerns both time and judgment,"
Ecclesiastes,8,6,"Because for every matter there is a time and judgment, Though the misery of man increases greatly."
Ecclesiastes,8,7,For he does not know what will happen; So who can tell him when it will occur?
Ecclesiastes,8,8,"No one has power over the spirit to retain the spirit, And no one has power in the day of death. There is no release from that war, And wickedness will not deliver those who are given to it."
Ecclesiastes,8,9,"All this I have seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun: There is a time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt."
Ecclesiastes,8,10,"Then I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of holiness, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done. This also is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,8,11,"Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil."
Ecclesiastes,8,12,"Though a sinner does evil a hundred times, and his days are prolonged, yet I surely know that it will be well with those who fear God, who fear before Him."
Ecclesiastes,8,13,"But it will not be well with the wicked; nor will he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he does not fear before God."
Ecclesiastes,8,14,"There is a vanity which occurs on earth, that there are just men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,8,15,"So I commended enjoyment, because a man has nothing better under the sun than to eat, drink, and be merry; for this will remain with him in his labor all the days of his life which God gives him under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,8,16,"When I applied my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done on earth, even though one sees no sleep day or night,"
Ecclesiastes,8,17,"then I saw all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. For though a man labors to discover it, yet he will not find it; moreover, though a wise man attempts to know it, he will not be able to find it."
Ecclesiastes,9,1,"For I considered all this in my heart, so that I could declare it all: that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God. People know neither love nor hatred by anything they see before them."
Ecclesiastes,9,2,"All things come alike to all: One event happens to the righteous and the wicked; To the good, the clean, and the unclean; To him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As is the good, so is the sinner; He who takes an oath as he who fears an oath."
Ecclesiastes,9,3,"This is an evil in all that is done under the sun: that one thing happens to all. Truly the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil; madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead."
Ecclesiastes,9,4,"But for him who is joined to all the living there is hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion."
Ecclesiastes,9,5,"For the living know that they will die; But the dead know nothing, And they have no more reward, For the memory of them is forgotten."
Ecclesiastes,9,6,"Also their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished; Nevermore will they have a share In anything done under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,9,7,"Go, eat your bread with joy, And drink your wine with a merry heart; For God has already accepted your works."
Ecclesiastes,9,8,"Let your garments always be white, And let your head lack no oil."
Ecclesiastes,9,9,"Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life which He has given you under the sun, all your days of vanity; for that is your portion in life, and in the labor which you perform under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,9,10,"Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going."
Ecclesiastes,9,11,"I returned and saw under the sun that— The race is not to the swift, Nor the battle to the strong, Nor bread to the wise, Nor riches to men of understanding, Nor favor to men of skill; But time and chance happen to them all."
Ecclesiastes,9,12,"For man also does not know his time: Like fish taken in a cruel net, Like birds caught in a snare, So the sons of men are snared in an evil time, When it falls suddenly upon them."
Ecclesiastes,9,13,"This wisdom I have also seen under the sun, and it seemed great to me:"
Ecclesiastes,9,14,"There was a little city with few men in it; and a great king came against it, besieged it, and built great snares around it."
Ecclesiastes,9,15,"Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that same poor man."
Ecclesiastes,9,16,"Then I said: “Wisdom is better than strength. Nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom is despised, And his words are not heard."
Ecclesiastes,9,17,"Words of the wise, spoken quietly, should be heard Rather than the shout of a ruler of fools."
Ecclesiastes,9,18,Wisdom is better than weapons of war; But one sinner destroys much good.”
