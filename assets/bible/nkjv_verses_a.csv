Genesis,1,1,In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Genesis,1,2,"The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters."
Genesis,1,3,"Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light."
Genesis,1,4,"And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness."
Genesis,1,5,"God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day."
Genesis,1,6,"Then God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.”"
Genesis,1,7,"Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so."
Genesis,1,8,And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.
Genesis,1,9,"Then God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so."
Genesis,1,10,"And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,11,"Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb that yields seed, and the fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth”; and it was so."
Genesis,1,12,"And the earth brought forth grass, the herb that yields seed according to its kind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,13,So the evening and the morning were the third day.
Genesis,1,14,"Then God said, “Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years;"
Genesis,1,15,and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth”; and it was so.
Genesis,1,16,"Then God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also."
Genesis,1,17,"God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth,"
Genesis,1,18,"and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,19,So the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
Genesis,1,20,"Then God said, “Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.”"
Genesis,1,21,"So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters abounded, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,22,"And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”"
Genesis,1,23,So the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
Genesis,1,24,"Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, each according to its kind”; and it was so."
Genesis,1,25,"And God made the beast of the earth according to its kind, cattle according to its kind, and everything that creeps on the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,26,"Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”"
Genesis,1,27,So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.
Genesis,1,28,"Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”"
Genesis,1,29,"And God said, “See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food."
Genesis,1,30,"Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food”; and it was so."
Genesis,1,31,"Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day."
Genesis,2,1,"Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished."
Genesis,2,2,"And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done."
Genesis,2,3,"Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made."
Genesis,2,4,"This is the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,"
Genesis,2,5,"before any plant of the field was in the earth and before any herb of the field had grown. For the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the ground;"
Genesis,2,6,but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.
Genesis,2,7,"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being."
Genesis,2,8,"The LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed."
Genesis,2,9,"And out of the ground the LORD God made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil."
Genesis,2,10,"Now a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it parted and became four riverheads."
Genesis,2,11,"The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one which skirts the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold."
Genesis,2,12,And the gold of that land is good. Bdellium and the onyx stone are there.
Genesis,2,13,The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one which goes around the whole land of Cush.
Genesis,2,14,The name of the third river is Hiddekel; it is the one which goes toward the east of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
Genesis,2,15,Then the LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it.
Genesis,2,16,"And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat;"
Genesis,2,17,"but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.”"
Genesis,2,18,"And the LORD God said, “It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.”"
Genesis,2,19,"Out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name."
Genesis,2,20,"So Adam gave names to all cattle, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him."
Genesis,2,21,"And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place."
Genesis,2,22,"Then the rib which the LORD God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man."
Genesis,2,23,"And Adam said: “This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.”"
Genesis,2,24,"Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh."
Genesis,2,25,"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
Genesis,3,1,"Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?”"
Genesis,3,2,"And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden;"
Genesis,3,3,"but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.’”"
Genesis,3,4,"Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die."
Genesis,3,5,"For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”"
Genesis,3,6,"So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate."
Genesis,3,7,"Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings."
Genesis,3,8,"And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden."
Genesis,3,9,"Then the LORD God called to Adam and said to him, “Where are you?”"
Genesis,3,10,"So he said, “I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.”"
Genesis,3,11,"And He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat?”"
Genesis,3,12,"Then the man said, “The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.”"
Genesis,3,13,"And the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”"
Genesis,3,14,"So the LORD God said to the serpent: “Because you have done this, You are cursed more than all cattle, And more than every beast of the field; On your belly you shall go, And you shall eat dust All the days of your life."
Genesis,3,15,"And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel.”"
Genesis,3,16,"To the woman He said: “I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; In pain you shall bring forth children; Your desire shall be for your husband, And he shall rule over you.”"
Genesis,3,17,"Then to Adam He said, “Because you have heeded the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it’: “Cursed is the ground for your sake; In toil you shall eat of it All the days of your life."
Genesis,3,18,"Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, And you shall eat the herb of the field."
Genesis,3,19,"In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread Till you return to the ground, For out of it you were taken; For dust you are, And to dust you shall return.”"
Genesis,3,20,"And Adam called his wife’s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living."
Genesis,3,21,"Also for Adam and his wife the LORD God made tunics of skin, and clothed them."
Genesis,3,22,"Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever”—"
Genesis,3,23,therefore the LORD God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken.
Genesis,3,24,"So He drove out the man; and He placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life."
Genesis,4,1,"Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, “I have acquired a man from the LORD.”"
Genesis,4,2,"Then she bore again, this time his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground."
Genesis,4,3,And in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to the LORD.
Genesis,4,4,"Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And the LORD respected Abel and his offering,"
Genesis,4,5,"but He did not respect Cain and his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell."
Genesis,4,6,"So the LORD said to Cain, “Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen?"
Genesis,4,7,"If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door. And its desire is for you, but you should rule over it.”"
Genesis,4,8,"Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him."
Genesis,4,9,"Then the LORD said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” He said, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”"
Genesis,4,10,"And He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground."
Genesis,4,11,"So now you are cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand."
Genesis,4,12,"When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth.”"
Genesis,4,13,"And Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is greater than I can bear!"
Genesis,4,14,"Surely You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; I shall be hidden from Your face; I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, and it will happen that anyone who finds me will kill me.”"
Genesis,4,15,"And the LORD said to him, “Therefore, whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.” And the LORD set a mark on Cain, lest anyone finding him should kill him."
Genesis,4,16,Then Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of Eden.
Genesis,4,17,"And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son—Enoch."
Genesis,4,18,"To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech."
Genesis,4,19,"Then Lamech took for himself two wives: the name of one was Adah, and the name of the second was Zillah."
Genesis,4,20,And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
Genesis,4,21,His brother’s name was Jubal. He was the father of all those who play the harp and flute.
Genesis,4,22,"And as for Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every craftsman in bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah."
Genesis,4,23,"Then Lamech said to his wives: “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of Lamech, listen to my speech! For I have killed a man for wounding me, Even a young man for hurting me."
Genesis,4,24,"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”"
Genesis,4,25,"And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, “For God has appointed another seed for me instead of Abel, whom Cain killed.”"
Genesis,4,26,"And as for Seth, to him also a son was born; and he named him Enosh. Then men began to call on the name of the LORD."
Genesis,5,1,"This is the book of the genealogy of Adam. In the day that God created man, He made him in the likeness of God."
Genesis,5,2,"He created them male and female, and blessed them and called them Mankind in the day they were created."
Genesis,5,3,"And Adam lived one hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth."
Genesis,5,4,"After he begot Seth, the days of Adam were eight hundred years; and he had sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,5,So all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died.
Genesis,5,6,"Seth lived one hundred and five years, and begot Enosh."
Genesis,5,7,"After he begot Enosh, Seth lived eight hundred and seven years, and had sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,8,So all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.
Genesis,5,9,"Enosh lived ninety years, and begot Cainan."
Genesis,5,10,"After he begot Cainan, Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and had sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,11,So all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died.
Genesis,5,12,"Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Mahalalel."
Genesis,5,13,"After he begot Mahalalel, Cainan lived eight hundred and forty years, and had sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,14,So all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
Genesis,5,15,"Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and begot Jared."
Genesis,5,16,"After he begot Jared, Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years, and had sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,17,So all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years; and he died.
Genesis,5,18,"Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Enoch."
Genesis,5,19,"After he begot Enoch, Jared lived eight hundred years, and had sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,20,So all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years; and he died.
Genesis,5,21,"Enoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Methuselah."
Genesis,5,22,"After he begot Methuselah, Enoch walked with God three hundred years, and had sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,23,So all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.
Genesis,5,24,"And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him."
Genesis,5,25,"Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech."
Genesis,5,26,"After he begot Lamech, Methuselah lived seven hundred and eighty-two years, and had sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,27,So all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years; and he died.
Genesis,5,28,"Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-two years, and had a son."
Genesis,5,29,"And he called his name Noah, saying, “This one will comfort us concerning our work and the toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD has cursed.”"
Genesis,5,30,"After he begot Noah, Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years, and had sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,31,So all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years; and he died.
Genesis,5,32,"And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
Genesis,6,1,"Now it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,"
Genesis,6,2,"that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose."
Genesis,6,3,"And the LORD said, “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for he is indeed flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.”"
Genesis,6,4,"There were giants on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown."
Genesis,6,5,"Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
Genesis,6,6,"And the LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart."
Genesis,6,7,"So the LORD said, “I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them.”"
Genesis,6,8,But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
Genesis,6,9,"This is the genealogy of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect in his generations. Noah walked with God."
Genesis,6,10,"And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
Genesis,6,11,"The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence."
Genesis,6,12,"So God looked upon the earth, and indeed it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth."
Genesis,6,13,"And God said to Noah, “The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence through them; and behold, I will destroy them with the earth."
Genesis,6,14,"Make yourself an ark of gopherwood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and outside with pitch."
Genesis,6,15,"And this is how you shall make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits."
Genesis,6,16,"You shall make a window for the ark, and you shall finish it to a cubit from above; and set the door of the ark in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third decks."
Genesis,6,17,"And behold, I Myself am bringing floodwaters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die."
Genesis,6,18,"But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall go into the ark—you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you."
Genesis,6,19,"And of every living thing of all flesh you shall bring two of every sort into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female."
Genesis,6,20,"Of the birds after their kind, of animals after their kind, and of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two of every kind will come to you to keep them alive."
Genesis,6,21,"And you shall take for yourself of all food that is eaten, and you shall gather it to yourself; and it shall be food for you and for them.”"
Genesis,6,22,"Thus Noah did; according to all that God commanded him, so he did."
Genesis,7,1,"Then the LORD said to Noah, “Come into the ark, you and all your household, because I have seen that you are righteous before Me in this generation."
Genesis,7,2,"You shall take with you seven each of every clean animal, a male and his female; two each of animals that are unclean, a male and his female;"
Genesis,7,3,"also seven each of birds of the air, male and female, to keep the species alive on the face of all the earth."
Genesis,7,4,"For after seven more days I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and I will destroy from the face of the earth all living things that I have made.”"
Genesis,7,5,And Noah did according to all that the LORD commanded him.
Genesis,7,6,Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters were on the earth.
Genesis,7,7,"So Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, went into the ark because of the waters of the flood."
Genesis,7,8,"Of clean animals, of animals that are unclean, of birds, and of everything that creeps on the earth,"
Genesis,7,9,"two by two they went into the ark to Noah, male and female, as God had commanded Noah."
Genesis,7,10,And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were on the earth.
Genesis,7,11,"In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened."
Genesis,7,12,And the rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.
Genesis,7,13,"On the very same day Noah and Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark—"
Genesis,7,14,"they and every beast after its kind, all cattle after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort."
Genesis,7,15,"And they went into the ark to Noah, two by two, of all flesh in which is the breath of life."
Genesis,7,16,"So those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the LORD shut him in."
Genesis,7,17,"Now the flood was on the earth forty days. The waters increased and lifted up the ark, and it rose high above the earth."
Genesis,7,18,"The waters prevailed and greatly increased on the earth, and the ark moved about on the surface of the waters."
Genesis,7,19,"And the waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth, and all the high hills under the whole heaven were covered."
Genesis,7,20,"The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered."
Genesis,7,21,"And all flesh died that moved on the earth: birds and cattle and beasts and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man."
Genesis,7,22,"All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, all that was on the dry land, died."
Genesis,7,23,"So He destroyed all living things which were on the face of the ground: both man and cattle, creeping thing and bird of the air. They were destroyed from the earth. Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive."
Genesis,7,24,And the waters prevailed on the earth one hundred and fifty days.
Genesis,8,1,"Then God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the animals that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided."
Genesis,8,2,"The fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were also stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained."
Genesis,8,3,And the waters receded continually from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters decreased.
Genesis,8,4,"Then the ark rested in the seventh month, the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat."
Genesis,8,5,"And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen."
Genesis,8,6,"So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made."
Genesis,8,7,"Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth."
Genesis,8,8,"He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from the face of the ground."
Genesis,8,9,"But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned into the ark to him, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her, and drew her into the ark to himself."
Genesis,8,10,"And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent the dove out from the ark."
Genesis,8,11,"Then the dove came to him in the evening, and behold, a freshly plucked olive leaf was in her mouth; and Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth."
Genesis,8,12,"So he waited yet another seven days and sent out the dove, which did not return again to him anymore."
Genesis,8,13,"And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, that the waters were dried up from the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and indeed the surface of the ground was dry."
Genesis,8,14,"And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dried."
Genesis,8,15,"Then God spoke to Noah, saying,"
Genesis,8,16,"“Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons’ wives with you."
Genesis,8,17,"Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you: birds and cattle and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, so that they may abound on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.”"
Genesis,8,18,"So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him."
Genesis,8,19,"Every animal, every creeping thing, every bird, and whatever creeps on the earth, according to their families, went out of the ark."
Genesis,8,20,"Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar."
Genesis,8,21,"And the LORD smelled a soothing aroma. Then the LORD said in His heart, “I will never again curse the ground for man’s sake, although the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; nor will I again destroy every living thing as I have done."
Genesis,8,22,"“While the earth remains, Seedtime and harvest, Cold and heat, Winter and summer, And day and night Shall not cease.”"
Genesis,9,1,"So God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them: “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth."
Genesis,9,2,"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be on every beast of the earth, on every bird of the air, on all that move on the earth, and on all the fish of the sea. They are given into your hand."
Genesis,9,3,"Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have given you all things, even as the green herbs."
Genesis,9,4,"But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood."
Genesis,9,5,"Surely for your lifeblood I will demand a reckoning; from the hand of every beast I will require it, and from the hand of man. From the hand of every man’s brother I will require the life of man."
Genesis,9,6,"“Whoever sheds man’s blood, By man his blood shall be shed; For in the image of God He made man."
Genesis,9,7,"And as for you, be fruitful and multiply; Bring forth abundantly in the earth And multiply in it.”"
Genesis,9,8,"Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying:"
Genesis,9,9,"“And as for Me, behold, I establish My covenant with you and with your descendants after you,"
Genesis,9,10,"and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ark, every beast of the earth."
Genesis,9,11,Thus I establish My covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood; never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.”
Genesis,9,12,"And God said: “This is the sign of the covenant which I make between Me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:"
Genesis,9,13,"I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth."
Genesis,9,14,"It shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud;"
Genesis,9,15,and I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.
Genesis,9,16,"The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will look on it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.”"
Genesis,9,17,"And God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is on the earth.”"
Genesis,9,18,"Now the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And Ham was the father of Canaan."
Genesis,9,19,"These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was populated."
Genesis,9,20,"And Noah began to be a farmer, and he planted a vineyard."
Genesis,9,21,"Then he drank of the wine and was drunk, and became uncovered in his tent."
Genesis,9,22,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside."
Genesis,9,23,"But Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father’s nakedness."
Genesis,9,24,"So Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him."
Genesis,9,25,Then he said: “Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants He shall be to his brethren.”
Genesis,9,26,"And he said: “Blessed be the LORD, The God of Shem, And may Canaan be his servant."
Genesis,9,27,"May God enlarge Japheth, And may he dwell in the tents of Shem; And may Canaan be his servant.”"
Genesis,9,28,And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
Genesis,9,29,So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.
Genesis,10,1,"Now this is the genealogy of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And sons were born to them after the flood."
Genesis,10,2,"The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras."
Genesis,10,3,"The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah."
Genesis,10,4,"The sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim."
Genesis,10,5,"From these the coastland peoples of the Gentiles were separated into their lands, everyone according to his language, according to their families, into their nations."
Genesis,10,6,"The sons of Ham were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan."
Genesis,10,7,"The sons of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtechah; and the sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan."
Genesis,10,8,Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one on the earth.
Genesis,10,9,"He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore it is said, “Like Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.”"
Genesis,10,10,"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
Genesis,10,11,"From that land he went to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,"
Genesis,10,12,and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (that is the principal city).
Genesis,10,13,"Mizraim begot Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,"
Genesis,10,14,"Pathrusim, and Casluhim (from whom came the Philistines and Caphtorim)."
Genesis,10,15,"Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and Heth;"
Genesis,10,16,"the Jebusite, the Amorite, and the Girgashite;"
Genesis,10,17,"the Hivite, the Arkite, and the Sinite;"
Genesis,10,18,"the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were dispersed."
Genesis,10,19,"And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; then as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha."
Genesis,10,20,"These were the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands and in their nations."
Genesis,10,21,"And children were born also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder."
Genesis,10,22,"The sons of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram."
Genesis,10,23,"The sons of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash."
Genesis,10,24,"Arphaxad begot Salah, and Salah begot Eber."
Genesis,10,25,"To Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan."
Genesis,10,26,"Joktan begot Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,"
Genesis,10,27,"Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,"
Genesis,10,28,"Obal, Abimael, Sheba,"
Genesis,10,29,"Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan."
Genesis,10,30,"And their dwelling place was from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east."
Genesis,10,31,"These were the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands, according to their nations."
Genesis,10,32,"These were the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations, in their nations; and from these the nations were divided on the earth after the flood."
Genesis,11,1,Now the whole earth had one language and one speech.
Genesis,11,2,"And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there."
Genesis,11,3,"Then they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They had brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar."
Genesis,11,4,"And they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.”"
Genesis,11,5,But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built.
Genesis,11,6,"And the LORD said, “Indeed the people are one and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do; now nothing that they propose to do will be withheld from them."
Genesis,11,7,"Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”"
Genesis,11,8,"So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they ceased building the city."
Genesis,11,9,"Therefore its name is called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth."
Genesis,11,10,"This is the genealogy of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old, and begot Arphaxad two years after the flood."
Genesis,11,11,"After he begot Arphaxad, Shem lived five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,12,"Arphaxad lived thirty-five years, and begot Salah."
Genesis,11,13,"After he begot Salah, Arphaxad lived four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,14,"Salah lived thirty years, and begot Eber."
Genesis,11,15,"After he begot Eber, Salah lived four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,16,"Eber lived thirty-four years, and begot Peleg."
Genesis,11,17,"After he begot Peleg, Eber lived four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,18,"Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu."
Genesis,11,19,"After he begot Reu, Peleg lived two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,20,"Reu lived thirty-two years, and begot Serug."
Genesis,11,21,"After he begot Serug, Reu lived two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,22,"Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor."
Genesis,11,23,"After he begot Nahor, Serug lived two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,24,"Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and begot Terah."
Genesis,11,25,"After he begot Terah, Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,26,"Now Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
Genesis,11,27,"This is the genealogy of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran begot Lot."
Genesis,11,28,"And Haran died before his father Terah in his native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans."
Genesis,11,29,"Then Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah."
Genesis,11,30,But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
Genesis,11,31,"And Terah took his son Abram and his grandson Lot, the son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram’s wife, and they went out with them from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran and dwelt there."
Genesis,11,32,"So the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran."
Genesis,12,1,"Now the LORD had said to Abram: “Get out of your country, From your family And from your father’s house, To a land that I will show you."
Genesis,12,2,I will make you a great nation; I will bless you And make your name great; And you shall be a blessing.
Genesis,12,3,"I will bless those who bless you, And I will curse him who curses you; And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”"
Genesis,12,4,"So Abram departed as the LORD had spoken to him, and Lot went with him. And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran."
Genesis,12,5,"Then Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people whom they had acquired in Haran, and they departed to go to the land of Canaan. So they came to the land of Canaan."
Genesis,12,6,"Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, as far as the terebinth tree of Moreh. And the Canaanites were then in the land."
Genesis,12,7,"Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, “To your descendants I will give this land.” And there he built an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him."
Genesis,12,8,"And he moved from there to the mountain east of Bethel, and he pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; there he built an altar to the LORD and called on the name of the LORD."
Genesis,12,9,"So Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South."
Genesis,12,10,"Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to dwell there, for the famine was severe in the land."
Genesis,12,11,"And it came to pass, when he was close to entering Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, “Indeed I know that you are a woman of beautiful countenance."
Genesis,12,12,"Therefore it will happen, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, ‘This is his wife’; and they will kill me, but they will let you live."
Genesis,12,13,"Please say you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that I may live because of you.”"
Genesis,12,14,"So it was, when Abram came into Egypt, that the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful."
Genesis,12,15,The princes of Pharaoh also saw her and commended her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken to Pharaoh’s house.
Genesis,12,16,"He treated Abram well for her sake. He had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male and female servants, female donkeys, and camels."
Genesis,12,17,"But the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife."
Genesis,12,18,"And Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?"
Genesis,12,19,"Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’? I might have taken her as my wife. Now therefore, here is your wife; take her and go your way.”"
Genesis,12,20,"So Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him; and they sent him away, with his wife and all that he had."
Genesis,13,1,"Then Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, to the South."
Genesis,13,2,"Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold."
Genesis,13,3,"And he went on his journey from the South as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,"
Genesis,13,4,to the place of the altar which he had made there at first. And there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
Genesis,13,5,"Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents."
Genesis,13,6,"Now the land was not able to support them, that they might dwell together, for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together."
Genesis,13,7,And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites then dwelt in the land.
Genesis,13,8,"So Abram said to Lot, “Please let there be no strife between you and me, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we are brethren."
Genesis,13,9,"Is not the whole land before you? Please separate from me. If you take the left, then I will go to the right; or, if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.”"
Genesis,13,10,"And Lot lifted his eyes and saw all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere (before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt as you go toward Zoar."
Genesis,13,11,"Then Lot chose for himself all the plain of Jordan, and Lot journeyed east. And they separated from each other."
Genesis,13,12,"Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent even as far as Sodom."
Genesis,13,13,But the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinful against the LORD.
Genesis,13,14,"And the LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him: “Lift your eyes now and look from the place where you are—northward, southward, eastward, and westward;"
Genesis,13,15,for all the land which you see I give to you and your descendants forever.
Genesis,13,16,"And I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth; so that if a man could number the dust of the earth, then your descendants also could be numbered."
Genesis,13,17,"Arise, walk in the land through its length and its width, for I give it to you.”"
Genesis,13,18,"Then Abram moved his tent, and went and dwelt by the terebinth trees of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to the LORD."
Genesis,14,1,"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations,"
Genesis,14,2,"that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar)."
Genesis,14,3,"All these joined together in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea)."
Genesis,14,4,"Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled."
Genesis,14,5,"In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him came and attacked the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,"
Genesis,14,6,"and the Horites in their mountain of Seir, as far as El Paran, which is by the wilderness."
Genesis,14,7,"Then they turned back and came to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and attacked all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who dwelt in Hazezon Tamar."
Genesis,14,8,"And the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out and joined together in battle in the Valley of Siddim"
Genesis,14,9,"against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of nations, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five."
Genesis,14,10,"Now the Valley of Siddim was full of asphalt pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled; some fell there, and the remainder fled to the mountains."
Genesis,14,11,"Then they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way."
Genesis,14,12,"They also took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed."
Genesis,14,13,"Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, for he dwelt by the terebinth trees of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner; and they were allies with Abram."
Genesis,14,14,"Now when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his three hundred and eighteen trained servants who were born in his own house, and went in pursuit as far as Dan."
Genesis,14,15,"He divided his forces against them by night, and he and his servants attacked them and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus."
Genesis,14,16,"So he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot and his goods, as well as the women and the people."
Genesis,14,17,"And the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley), after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him."
Genesis,14,18,Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; he was the priest of God Most High.
Genesis,14,19,"And he blessed him and said: “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth;"
Genesis,14,20,"And blessed be God Most High, Who has delivered your enemies into your hand.” And he gave him a tithe of all."
Genesis,14,21,"Now the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the persons, and take the goods for yourself.”"
Genesis,14,22,"But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have raised my hand to the LORD, God Most High, the Possessor of heaven and earth,"
Genesis,14,23,"that I will take nothing, from a thread to a sandal strap, and that I will not take anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich’—"
Genesis,14,24,"except only what the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.”"
Genesis,15,1,"After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.”"
Genesis,15,2,"But Abram said, “Lord GOD, what will You give me, seeing I go childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?”"
Genesis,15,3,"Then Abram said, “Look, You have given me no offspring; indeed one born in my house is my heir!”"
Genesis,15,4,"And behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, “This one shall not be your heir, but one who will come from your own body shall be your heir.”"
Genesis,15,5,"Then He brought him outside and said, “Look now toward heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them.” And He said to him, “So shall your descendants be.”"
Genesis,15,6,"And he believed in the LORD, and He accounted it to him for righteousness."
Genesis,15,7,"Then He said to him, “I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to inherit it.”"
Genesis,15,8,"And he said, “Lord GOD, how shall I know that I will inherit it?”"
Genesis,15,9,"So He said to him, “Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”"
Genesis,15,10,"Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, down the middle, and placed each piece opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds in two."
Genesis,15,11,"And when the vultures came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away."
Genesis,15,12,"Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, horror and great darkness fell upon him."
Genesis,15,13,"Then He said to Abram: “Know certainly that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them, and they will afflict them four hundred years."
Genesis,15,14,And also the nation whom they serve I will judge; afterward they shall come out with great possessions.
Genesis,15,15,"Now as for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried at a good old age."
Genesis,15,16,"But in the fourth generation they shall return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.”"
Genesis,15,17,"And it came to pass, when the sun went down and it was dark, that behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a burning torch that passed between those pieces."
Genesis,15,18,"On the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying: “To your descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the River Euphrates—"
Genesis,15,19,"the Kenites, the Kenezzites, the Kadmonites,"
Genesis,15,20,"the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,"
Genesis,15,21,"the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”"
Genesis,16,1,"Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. And she had an Egyptian maidservant whose name was Hagar."
Genesis,16,2,"So Sarai said to Abram, “See now, the LORD has restrained me from bearing children. Please, go in to my maid; perhaps I shall obtain children by her.” And Abram heeded the voice of Sarai."
Genesis,16,3,"Then Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,16,4,"So he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress became despised in her eyes."
Genesis,16,5,"Then Sarai said to Abram, “My wrong be upon you! I gave my maid into your embrace; and when she saw that she had conceived, I became despised in her eyes. The LORD judge between you and me.”"
Genesis,16,6,"So Abram said to Sarai, “Indeed your maid is in your hand; do to her as you please.” And when Sarai dealt harshly with her, she fled from her presence."
Genesis,16,7,"Now the Angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur."
Genesis,16,8,"And He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s maid, where have you come from, and where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.”"
Genesis,16,9,"The Angel of the LORD said to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hand.”"
Genesis,16,10,"Then the Angel of the LORD said to her, “I will multiply your descendants exceedingly, so that they shall not be counted for multitude.”"
Genesis,16,11,"And the Angel of the LORD said to her: “Behold, you are with child, And you shall bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, Because the LORD has heard your affliction."
Genesis,16,12,"He shall be a wild man; His hand shall be against every man, And every man’s hand against him. And he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.”"
Genesis,16,13,"Then she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees; for she said, “Have I also here seen Him who sees me?”"
Genesis,16,14,"Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi; observe, it is between Kadesh and Bered."
Genesis,16,15,"So Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael."
Genesis,16,16,Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
Genesis,17,1,"When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am Almighty God; walk before Me and be blameless."
Genesis,17,2,"And I will make My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.”"
Genesis,17,3,"Then Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying:"
Genesis,17,4,"“As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of many nations."
Genesis,17,5,"No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you a father of many nations."
Genesis,17,6,"I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you."
Genesis,17,7,"And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you."
Genesis,17,8,"Also I give to you and your descendants after you the land in which you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”"
Genesis,17,9,"And God said to Abraham: “As for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations."
Genesis,17,10,"This is My covenant which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: Every male child among you shall be circumcised;"
Genesis,17,11,"and you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and you."
Genesis,17,12,"He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised, every male child in your generations, he who is born in your house or bought with money from any foreigner who is not your descendant."
Genesis,17,13,"He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised, and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant."
Genesis,17,14,"And the uncircumcised male child, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”"
Genesis,17,15,"Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name."
Genesis,17,16,"And I will bless her and also give you a son by her; then I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall be from her.”"
Genesis,17,17,"Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Shall a child be born to a man who is one hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”"
Genesis,17,18,"And Abraham said to God, “Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!”"
Genesis,17,19,"Then God said: “No, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his descendants after him."
Genesis,17,20,"And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall beget twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation."
Genesis,17,21,"But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this set time next year.”"
Genesis,17,22,"Then He finished talking with him, and God went up from Abraham."
Genesis,17,23,"So Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very same day, as God had said to him."
Genesis,17,24,Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis,17,25,And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis,17,26,"That very same day Abraham was circumcised, and his son Ishmael;"
Genesis,17,27,"and all the men of his house, born in the house or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him."
Genesis,18,1,"Then the LORD appeared to him by the terebinth trees of Mamre, as he was sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day."
Genesis,18,2,"So he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing by him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed himself to the ground,"
Genesis,18,3,"and said, “My Lord, if I have now found favor in Your sight, do not pass on by Your servant."
Genesis,18,4,"Please let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree."
Genesis,18,5,"And I will bring a morsel of bread, that you may refresh your hearts. After that you may pass by, inasmuch as you have come to your servant.” They said, “Do as you have said.”"
Genesis,18,6,"So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quickly, make ready three measures of fine meal; knead it and make cakes.”"
Genesis,18,7,"And Abraham ran to the herd, took a tender and good calf, gave it to a young man, and he hastened to prepare it."
Genesis,18,8,"So he took butter and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree as they ate."
Genesis,18,9,"Then they said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” So he said, “Here, in the tent.”"
Genesis,18,10,"And He said, “I will certainly return to you according to the time of life, and behold, Sarah your wife shall have a son.” (Sarah was listening in the tent door which was behind him.)"
Genesis,18,11,"Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age; and Sarah had passed the age of childbearing."
Genesis,18,12,"Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, “After I have grown old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?”"
Genesis,18,13,"And the LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Shall I surely bear a child, since I am old?’"
Genesis,18,14,"Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.”"
Genesis,18,15,"But Sarah denied it, saying, “I did not laugh,” for she was afraid. And He said, “No, but you did laugh!”"
Genesis,18,16,"Then the men rose from there and looked toward Sodom, and Abraham went with them to send them on the way."
Genesis,18,17,"And the LORD said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing,"
Genesis,18,18,"since Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?"
Genesis,18,19,"For I have known him, in order that he may command his children and his household after him, that they keep the way of the LORD, to do righteousness and justice, that the LORD may bring to Abraham what He has spoken to him.”"
Genesis,18,20,"And the LORD said, “Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grave,"
Genesis,18,21,"I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry against it that has come to Me; and if not, I will know.”"
Genesis,18,22,"Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the LORD."
Genesis,18,23,"And Abraham came near and said, “Would You also destroy the righteous with the wicked?"
Genesis,18,24,Suppose there were fifty righteous within the city; would You also destroy the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous that were in it?
Genesis,18,25,"Far be it from You to do such a thing as this, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?”"
Genesis,18,26,"So the LORD said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.”"
Genesis,18,27,"Then Abraham answered and said, “Indeed now, I who am but dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord:"
Genesis,18,28,"Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous; would You destroy all of the city for lack of five?” So He said, “If I find there forty-five, I will not destroy it.”"
Genesis,18,29,"And he spoke to Him yet again and said, “Suppose there should be forty found there?” So He said, “I will not do it for the sake of forty.”"
Genesis,18,30,"Then he said, “Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Suppose thirty should be found there?” So He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”"
Genesis,18,31,"And he said, “Indeed now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord: Suppose twenty should be found there?” So He said, “I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty.”"
Genesis,18,32,"Then he said, “Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak but once more: Suppose ten should be found there?” And He said, “I will not destroy it for the sake of ten.”"
Genesis,18,33,So the LORD went His way as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place.
Genesis,19,1,"Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them, and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground."
Genesis,19,2,"And he said, “Here now, my lords, please turn in to your servant’s house and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way.” And they said, “No, but we will spend the night in the open square.”"
Genesis,19,3,"But he insisted strongly; so they turned in to him and entered his house. Then he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate."
Genesis,19,4,"Now before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both old and young, all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house."
Genesis,19,5,"And they called to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may know them carnally.”"
Genesis,19,6,"So Lot went out to them through the doorway, shut the door behind him,"
Genesis,19,7,"and said, “Please, my brethren, do not do so wickedly!"
Genesis,19,8,"See now, I have two daughters who have not known a man; please, let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them as you wish; only do nothing to these men, since this is the reason they have come under the shadow of my roof.”"
Genesis,19,9,"And they said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one came in to stay here, and he keeps acting as a judge; now we will deal worse with you than with them.” So they pressed hard against the man Lot, and came near to break down the door."
Genesis,19,10,"But the men reached out their hands and pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door."
Genesis,19,11,"And they struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they became weary trying to find the door."
Genesis,19,12,"Then the men said to Lot, “Have you anyone else here? Son-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city—take them out of this place!"
Genesis,19,13,"For we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown great before the face of the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it.”"
Genesis,19,14,"So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who had married his daughters, and said, “Get up, get out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city!” But to his sons-in-law he seemed to be joking."
Genesis,19,15,"When the morning dawned, the angels urged Lot to hurry, saying, “Arise, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the punishment of the city.”"
Genesis,19,16,"And while he lingered, the men took hold of his hand, his wife’s hand, and the hands of his two daughters, the LORD being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city."
Genesis,19,17,"So it came to pass, when they had brought them outside, that he said, “Escape for your life! Do not look behind you nor stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be destroyed.”"
Genesis,19,18,"Then Lot said to them, “Please, no, my lords!"
Genesis,19,19,"Indeed now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have increased your mercy which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, lest some evil overtake me and I die."
Genesis,19,20,"See now, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one; please let me escape there (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.”"
Genesis,19,21,"And he said to him, “See, I have favored you concerning this thing also, in that I will not overthrow this city for which you have spoken."
Genesis,19,22,"Hurry, escape there. For I cannot do anything until you arrive there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar."
Genesis,19,23,The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered Zoar.
Genesis,19,24,"Then the LORD rained brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah, from the LORD out of the heavens."
Genesis,19,25,"So He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground."
Genesis,19,26,"But his wife looked back behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
Genesis,19,27,And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
Genesis,19,28,"Then he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain; and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land which went up like the smoke of a furnace."
Genesis,19,29,"And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot had dwelt."
Genesis,19,30,"Then Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountains, and his two daughters were with him; for he was afraid to dwell in Zoar. And he and his two daughters dwelt in a cave."
Genesis,19,31,"Now the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man on the earth to come in to us as is the custom of all the earth."
Genesis,19,32,"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve the lineage of our father.”"
Genesis,19,33,"So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose."
Genesis,19,34,"It happened on the next day that the firstborn said to the younger, “Indeed I lay with my father last night; let us make him drink wine tonight also, and you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve the lineage of our father.”"
Genesis,19,35,"Then they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose."
Genesis,19,36,Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.
Genesis,19,37,The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day.
Genesis,19,38,"And the younger, she also bore a son and called his name Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the people of Ammon to this day."
Genesis,20,1,"And Abraham journeyed from there to the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and stayed in Gerar."
Genesis,20,2,"Now Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah."
Genesis,20,3,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, “Indeed you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man’s wife.”"
Genesis,20,4,"But Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, “Lord, will You slay a righteous nation also?"
Genesis,20,5,"Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she, even she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this.”"
Genesis,20,6,"And God said to him in a dream, “Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart. For I also withheld you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her."
Genesis,20,7,"Now therefore, restore the man’s wife; for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you shall live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.”"
Genesis,20,8,"So Abimelech rose early in the morning, called all his servants, and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were very much afraid."
Genesis,20,9,"And Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I offended you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done.”"
Genesis,20,10,"Then Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you have in view, that you have done this thing?”"
Genesis,20,11,"And Abraham said, “Because I thought, surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will kill me on account of my wife."
Genesis,20,12,"But indeed she is truly my sister. She is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife."
Genesis,20,13,"And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said to her, ‘This is your kindness that you should do for me: in every place, wherever we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”"
Genesis,20,14,"Then Abimelech took sheep, oxen, and male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham; and he restored Sarah his wife to him."
Genesis,20,15,"And Abimelech said, “See, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.”"
Genesis,20,16,"Then to Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; indeed this vindicates you before all who are with you and before everybody.” Thus she was rebuked."
Genesis,20,17,"So Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants. Then they bore children;"
Genesis,20,18,"for the LORD had closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife."
Genesis,21,1,"And the LORD visited Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had spoken."
Genesis,21,2,"For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him."
Genesis,21,3,And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him—whom Sarah bore to him—Isaac.
Genesis,21,4,"Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him."
Genesis,21,5,Now Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
Genesis,21,6,"And Sarah said, “God has made me laugh, and all who hear will laugh with me.”"
Genesis,21,7,"She also said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age.”"
Genesis,21,8,So the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the same day that Isaac was weaned.
Genesis,21,9,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, scoffing."
Genesis,21,10,"Therefore she said to Abraham, “Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, namely with Isaac.”"
Genesis,21,11,And the matter was very displeasing in Abraham’s sight because of his son.
Genesis,21,12,"But God said to Abraham, “Do not let it be displeasing in your sight because of the lad or because of your bondwoman. Whatever Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice; for in Isaac your seed shall be called."
Genesis,21,13,"Yet I will also make a nation of the son of the bondwoman, because he is your seed.”"
Genesis,21,14,"So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water; and putting it on her shoulder, he gave it and the boy to Hagar, and sent her away. Then she departed and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba."
Genesis,21,15,"And the water in the skin was used up, and she placed the boy under one of the shrubs."
Genesis,21,16,"Then she went and sat down across from him at a distance of about a bowshot; for she said to herself, “Let me not see the death of the boy.” So she sat opposite him, and lifted her voice and wept."
Genesis,21,17,"And God heard the voice of the lad. Then the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, “What ails you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is."
Genesis,21,18,"Arise, lift up the lad and hold him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.”"
Genesis,21,19,"Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the lad a drink."
Genesis,21,20,"So God was with the lad; and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer."
Genesis,21,21,He dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
Genesis,21,22,"And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phichol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all that you do."
Genesis,21,23,"Now therefore, swear to me by God that you will not deal falsely with me, with my offspring, or with my posterity; but that according to the kindness that I have done to you, you will do to me and to the land in which you have dwelt.”"
Genesis,21,24,"And Abraham said, “I will swear.”"
Genesis,21,25,Then Abraham rebuked Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelech’s servants had seized.
Genesis,21,26,"And Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor had I heard of it until today.”"
Genesis,21,27,"So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant."
Genesis,21,28,And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
Genesis,21,29,"Then Abimelech asked Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?”"
Genesis,21,30,"And he said, “You will take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that they may be my witness that I have dug this well.”"
Genesis,21,31,"Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because the two of them swore an oath there."
Genesis,21,32,"Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba. So Abimelech rose with Phichol, the commander of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines."
Genesis,21,33,"Then Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there called on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God."
Genesis,21,34,And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines many days.
Genesis,22,1,"Now it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”"
Genesis,22,2,"Then He said, “Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.”"
Genesis,22,3,"So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him."
Genesis,22,4,Then on the third day Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place afar off.
Genesis,22,5,"And Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; the lad and I will go yonder and worship, and we will come back to you.”"
Genesis,22,6,"So Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and the two of them went together."
Genesis,22,7,"But Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” Then he said, “Look, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”"
Genesis,22,8,"And Abraham said, “My son, God will provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering.” So the two of them went together."
Genesis,22,9,"Then they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood."
Genesis,22,10,And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
Genesis,22,11,"But the Angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” So he said, “Here I am.”"
Genesis,22,12,"And He said, “Do not lay your hand on the lad, or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.”"
Genesis,22,13,"Then Abraham lifted his eyes and looked, and there behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son."
Genesis,22,14,"And Abraham called the name of the place, The-LORD-Will-Provide; as it is said to this day, “In the Mount of the LORD it shall be provided.”"
Genesis,22,15,"Then the Angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time out of heaven,"
Genesis,22,16,"and said: “By Myself I have sworn, says the LORD, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son—"
Genesis,22,17,"blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies."
Genesis,22,18,"In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.”"
Genesis,22,19,"So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba."
Genesis,22,20,"Now it came to pass after these things that it was told Abraham, saying, “Indeed Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor:"
Genesis,22,21,"Huz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,"
Genesis,22,22,"Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”"
Genesis,22,23,"And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother."
Genesis,22,24,"His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah."
Genesis,23,1,Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.
Genesis,23,2,"So Sarah died in Kirjath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her."
Genesis,23,3,"Then Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,"
Genesis,23,4,"“I am a foreigner and a visitor among you. Give me property for a burial place among you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”"
Genesis,23,5,"And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,"
Genesis,23,6,"“Hear us, my lord: You are a mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places. None of us will withhold from you his burial place, that you may bury your dead.”"
Genesis,23,7,"Then Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, the sons of Heth."
Genesis,23,8,"And he spoke with them, saying, “If it is your wish that I bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and meet with Ephron the son of Zohar for me,"
Genesis,23,9,"that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he has, which is at the end of his field. Let him give it to me at the full price, as property for a burial place among you.”"
Genesis,23,10,"Now Ephron dwelt among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the presence of the sons of Heth, all who entered at the gate of his city, saying,"
Genesis,23,11,"“No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field and the cave that is in it; I give it to you in the presence of the sons of my people. I give it to you. Bury your dead!”"
Genesis,23,12,Then Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land;
Genesis,23,13,"and he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, “If you will give it, please hear me. I will give you money for the field; take it from me and I will bury my dead there.”"
Genesis,23,14,"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,"
Genesis,23,15,"“My lord, listen to me; the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver. What is that between you and me? So bury your dead.”"
Genesis,23,16,"And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed out the silver for Ephron which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, currency of the merchants."
Genesis,23,17,"So the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, which were within all the surrounding borders, were deeded"
Genesis,23,18,"to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city."
Genesis,23,19,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,23,20,So the field and the cave that is in it were deeded to Abraham by the sons of Heth as property for a burial place.
Genesis,24,1,"Now Abraham was old, well advanced in age; and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things."
Genesis,24,2,"So Abraham said to the oldest servant of his house, who ruled over all that he had, “Please, put your hand under my thigh,"
Genesis,24,3,"and I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell;"
Genesis,24,4,"but you shall go to my country and to my family, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”"
Genesis,24,5,"And the servant said to him, “Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I take your son back to the land from which you came?”"
Genesis,24,6,"But Abraham said to him, “Beware that you do not take my son back there."
Genesis,24,7,"The LORD God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my family, and who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, ‘To your descendants I give this land,’ He will send His angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there."
Genesis,24,8,"And if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be released from this oath; only do not take my son back there.”"
Genesis,24,9,"So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter."
Genesis,24,10,"Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed, for all his master’s goods were in his hand. And he arose and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor."
Genesis,24,11,"And he made his camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water at evening time, the time when women go out to draw water."
Genesis,24,12,"Then he said, “O LORD God of my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham."
Genesis,24,13,"Behold, here I stand by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water."
Genesis,24,14,"Now let it be that the young woman to whom I say, ‘Please let down your pitcher that I may drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink’—let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac. And by this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master.”"
Genesis,24,15,"And it happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, came out with her pitcher on her shoulder."
Genesis,24,16,"Now the young woman was very beautiful to behold, a virgin; no man had known her. And she went down to the well, filled her pitcher, and came up."
Genesis,24,17,"And the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me drink a little water from your pitcher.”"
Genesis,24,18,"So she said, “Drink, my lord.” Then she quickly let her pitcher down to her hand, and gave him a drink."
Genesis,24,19,"And when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.”"
Genesis,24,20,"Then she quickly emptied her pitcher into the trough, ran back to the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels."
Genesis,24,21,"And the man, wondering at her, remained silent so as to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not."
Genesis,24,22,"So it was, when the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden nose ring weighing half a shekel, and two bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels of gold,"
Genesis,24,23,"and said, “Whose daughter are you? Tell me, please, is there room in your father’s house for us to lodge?”"
Genesis,24,24,"So she said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, Milcah’s son, whom she bore to Nahor.”"
Genesis,24,25,"Moreover she said to him, “We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge.”"
Genesis,24,26,Then the man bowed down his head and worshiped the LORD.
Genesis,24,27,"And he said, “Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His mercy and His truth toward my master. As for me, being on the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master’s brethren.”"
Genesis,24,28,So the young woman ran and told her mother’s household these things.
Genesis,24,29,"Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban, and Laban ran out to the man by the well."
Genesis,24,30,"So it came to pass, when he saw the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekah, saying, “Thus the man spoke to me,” that he went to the man. And there he stood by the camels at the well."
Genesis,24,31,"And he said, “Come in, O blessed of the LORD! Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels.”"
Genesis,24,32,"Then the man came to the house. And he unloaded the camels, and provided straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him."
Genesis,24,33,"Food was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told about my errand.” And he said, “Speak on.”"
Genesis,24,34,"So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant."
Genesis,24,35,"The LORD has blessed my master greatly, and he has become great; and He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys."
Genesis,24,36,And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and to him he has given all that he has.
Genesis,24,37,"Now my master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell;"
Genesis,24,38,"but you shall go to my father’s house and to my family, and take a wife for my son.’"
Genesis,24,39,"And I said to my master, ‘Perhaps the woman will not follow me.’"
Genesis,24,40,"But he said to me, ‘The LORD, before whom I walk, will send His angel with you and prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son from my family and from my father’s house."
Genesis,24,41,"You will be clear from this oath when you arrive among my family; for if they will not give her to you, then you will be released from my oath.’"
Genesis,24,42,"“And this day I came to the well and said, ‘O LORD God of my master Abraham, if You will now prosper the way in which I go,"
Genesis,24,43,"behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass that when the virgin comes out to draw water, and I say to her, “Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,”"
Genesis,24,44,"and she says to me, “Drink, and I will draw for your camels also,”—let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master’s son.’"
Genesis,24,45,"“But before I had finished speaking in my heart, there was Rebekah, coming out with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well and drew water. And I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’"
Genesis,24,46,"And she made haste and let her pitcher down from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will give your camels a drink also.’ So I drank, and she gave the camels a drink also."
Genesis,24,47,"Then I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the nose ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists."
Genesis,24,48,"And I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the way of truth to take the daughter of my master’s brother for his son."
Genesis,24,49,"Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.”"
Genesis,24,50,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, “The thing comes from the LORD; we cannot speak to you either bad or good."
Genesis,24,51,"Here is Rebekah before you; take her and go, and let her be your master’s son’s wife, as the LORD has spoken.”"
Genesis,24,52,"And it came to pass, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, that he worshiped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth."
Genesis,24,53,"Then the servant brought out jewelry of silver, jewelry of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother."
Genesis,24,54,"And he and the men who were with him ate and drank and stayed all night. Then they arose in the morning, and he said, “Send me away to my master.”"
Genesis,24,55,"But her brother and her mother said, “Let the young woman stay with us a few days, at least ten; after that she may go.”"
Genesis,24,56,"And he said to them, “Do not hinder me, since the LORD has prospered my way; send me away so that I may go to my master.”"
Genesis,24,57,"So they said, “We will call the young woman and ask her personally.”"
Genesis,24,58,"Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”"
Genesis,24,59,"So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant and his men."
Genesis,24,60,"And they blessed Rebekah and said to her: “Our sister, may you become The mother of thousands of ten thousands; And may your descendants possess The gates of those who hate them.”"
Genesis,24,61,"Then Rebekah and her maids arose, and they rode on the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed."
Genesis,24,62,"Now Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he dwelt in the South."
Genesis,24,63,"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field in the evening; and he lifted his eyes and looked, and there, the camels were coming."
Genesis,24,64,"Then Rebekah lifted her eyes, and when she saw Isaac she dismounted from her camel;"
Genesis,24,65,"for she had said to the servant, “Who is this man walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my master.” So she took a veil and covered herself."
Genesis,24,66,And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
Genesis,24,67,"Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent; and he took Rebekah and she became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death."
Genesis,25,1,"Abraham again took a wife, and her name was Keturah."
Genesis,25,2,"And she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah."
Genesis,25,3,"Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim."
Genesis,25,4,"And the sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah."
Genesis,25,5,And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.
Genesis,25,6,"But Abraham gave gifts to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had; and while he was still living he sent them eastward, away from Isaac his son, to the country of the east."
Genesis,25,7,This is the sum of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred and seventy-five years.
Genesis,25,8,"Then Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people."
Genesis,25,9,"And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite,"
Genesis,25,10,"the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife."
Genesis,25,11,"And it came to pass, after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt at Beer Lahai Roi."
Genesis,25,12,"Now this is the genealogy of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham."
Genesis,25,13,"And these were the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,"
Genesis,25,14,"Mishma, Dumah, Massa,"
Genesis,25,15,"Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah."
Genesis,25,16,"These were the sons of Ishmael and these were their names, by their towns and their settlements, twelve princes according to their nations."
Genesis,25,17,"These were the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people."
Genesis,25,18,"(They dwelt from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt as you go toward Assyria.) He died in the presence of all his brethren."
Genesis,25,19,"This is the genealogy of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham begot Isaac."
Genesis,25,20,"Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah as wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian."
Genesis,25,21,"Now Isaac pleaded with the LORD for his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD granted his plea, and Rebekah his wife conceived."
Genesis,25,22,"But the children struggled together within her; and she said, “If all is well, why am I like this?” So she went to inquire of the LORD."
Genesis,25,23,"And the LORD said to her: “Two nations are in your womb, Two peoples shall be separated from your body; One people shall be stronger than the other, And the older shall serve the younger.”"
Genesis,25,24,"So when her days were fulfilled for her to give birth, indeed there were twins in her womb."
Genesis,25,25,And the first came out red. He was like a hairy garment all over; so they called his name Esau.
Genesis,25,26,"Afterward his brother came out, and his hand took hold of Esau’s heel; so his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them."
Genesis,25,27,"So the boys grew. And Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; but Jacob was a mild man, dwelling in tents."
Genesis,25,28,"And Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob."
Genesis,25,29,"Now Jacob cooked a stew; and Esau came in from the field, and he was weary."
Genesis,25,30,"And Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am weary.” Therefore his name was called Edom."
Genesis,25,31,"But Jacob said, “Sell me your birthright as of this day.”"
Genesis,25,32,"And Esau said, “Look, I am about to die; so what is this birthright to me?”"
Genesis,25,33,"Then Jacob said, “Swear to me as of this day.” So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob."
Genesis,25,34,"And Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils; then he ate and drank, arose, and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright."
Genesis,26,1,"There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, in Gerar."
Genesis,26,2,Then the LORD appeared to him and said: “Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land of which I shall tell you.
Genesis,26,3,"Dwell in this land, and I will be with you and bless you; for to you and your descendants I give all these lands, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham your father."
Genesis,26,4,And I will make your descendants multiply as the stars of heaven; I will give to your descendants all these lands; and in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed;
Genesis,26,5,"because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.”"
Genesis,26,6,So Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
Genesis,26,7,"And the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said, “She is my sister”; for he was afraid to say, “She is my wife,” because he thought, “lest the men of the place kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to behold.”"
Genesis,26,8,"Now it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked through a window, and saw, and there was Isaac, showing endearment to Rebekah his wife."
Genesis,26,9,"Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, “Quite obviously she is your wife; so how could you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die on account of her.’”"
Genesis,26,10,"And Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might soon have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us.”"
Genesis,26,11,"So Abimelech charged all his people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”"
Genesis,26,12,"Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year a hundredfold; and the LORD blessed him."
Genesis,26,13,"The man began to prosper, and continued prospering until he became very prosperous;"
Genesis,26,14,for he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great number of servants. So the Philistines envied him.
Genesis,26,15,"Now the Philistines had stopped up all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and they had filled them with earth."
Genesis,26,16,"And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.”"
Genesis,26,17,"Then Isaac departed from there and pitched his tent in the Valley of Gerar, and dwelt there."
Genesis,26,18,"And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham. He called them by the names which his father had called them."
Genesis,26,19,"Also Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found a well of running water there."
Genesis,26,20,"But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek, because they quarreled with him."
Genesis,26,21,"Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that one also. So he called its name Sitnah."
Genesis,26,22,"And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, because he said, “For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.”"
Genesis,26,23,Then he went up from there to Beersheba.
Genesis,26,24,"And the LORD appeared to him the same night and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham; do not fear, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for My servant Abraham’s sake.”"
Genesis,26,25,"So he built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD, and he pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well."
Genesis,26,26,"Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath, one of his friends, and Phichol the commander of his army."
Genesis,26,27,"And Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?”"
Genesis,26,28,"But they said, “We have certainly seen that the LORD is with you. So we said, ‘Let there now be an oath between us, between you and us; and let us make a covenant with you,"
Genesis,26,29,"that you will do us no harm, since we have not touched you, and since we have done nothing to you but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD.’”"
Genesis,26,30,"So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank."
Genesis,26,31,"Then they arose early in the morning and swore an oath with one another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace."
Genesis,26,32,"It came to pass the same day that Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.”"
Genesis,26,33,So he called it Shebah. Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.
Genesis,26,34,"When Esau was forty years old, he took as wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite."
Genesis,26,35,And they were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah.
Genesis,27,1,"Now it came to pass, when Isaac was old and his eyes were so dim that he could not see, that he called Esau his older son and said to him, “My son.” And he answered him, “Here I am.”"
Genesis,27,2,"Then he said, “Behold now, I am old. I do not know the day of my death."
Genesis,27,3,"Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me."
Genesis,27,4,"And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die.”"
Genesis,27,5,Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt game and to bring it.
Genesis,27,6,"So Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Indeed I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,"
Genesis,27,7,"‘Bring me game and make savory food for me, that I may eat it and bless you in the presence of the LORD before my death.’"
Genesis,27,8,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to what I command you."
Genesis,27,9,"Go now to the flock and bring me from there two choice kids of the goats, and I will make savory food from them for your father, such as he loves."
Genesis,27,10,"Then you shall take it to your father, that he may eat it, and that he may bless you before his death.”"
Genesis,27,11,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Look, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth-skinned man."
Genesis,27,12,"Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be a deceiver to him; and I shall bring a curse on myself and not a blessing.”"
Genesis,27,13,"But his mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get them for me.”"
Genesis,27,14,"And he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother made savory food, such as his father loved."
Genesis,27,15,"Then Rebekah took the choice clothes of her elder son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son."
Genesis,27,16,And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
Genesis,27,17,"Then she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob."
Genesis,27,18,"So he went to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”"
Genesis,27,19,"Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn; I have done just as you told me; please arise, sit and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.”"
Genesis,27,20,"But Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” And he said, “Because the LORD your God brought it to me.”"
Genesis,27,21,"Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.”"
Genesis,27,22,"So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”"
Genesis,27,23,"And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him."
Genesis,27,24,"Then he said, “Are you really my son Esau?” He said, “I am.”"
Genesis,27,25,"He said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s game, so that my soul may bless you.” So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank."
Genesis,27,26,"Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near now and kiss me, my son.”"
Genesis,27,27,"And he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him and said: “Surely, the smell of my son Is like the smell of a field Which the LORD has blessed."
Genesis,27,28,"Therefore may God give you Of the dew of heaven, Of the fatness of the earth, And plenty of grain and wine."
Genesis,27,29,"Let peoples serve you, And nations bow down to you. Be master over your brethren, And let your mother’s sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, And blessed be those who bless you!”"
Genesis,27,30,"Now it happened, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting."
Genesis,27,31,"He also had made savory food, and brought it to his father, and said to his father, “Let my father arise and eat of his son’s game, that your soul may bless me.”"
Genesis,27,32,"And his father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” So he said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.”"
Genesis,27,33,"Then Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, “Who? Where is the one who hunted game and brought it to me? I ate all of it before you came, and I have blessed him—and indeed he shall be blessed.”"
Genesis,27,34,"When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me—me also, O my father!”"
Genesis,27,35,"But he said, “Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing.”"
Genesis,27,36,"And Esau said, “Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright, and now look, he has taken away my blessing!” And he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”"
Genesis,27,37,"Then Isaac answered and said to Esau, “Indeed I have made him your master, and all his brethren I have given to him as servants; with grain and wine I have sustained him. What shall I do now for you, my son?”"
Genesis,27,38,"And Esau said to his father, “Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me—me also, O my father!” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept."
Genesis,27,39,"Then Isaac his father answered and said to him: “Behold, your dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth, And of the dew of heaven from above."
Genesis,27,40,"By your sword you shall live, And you shall serve your brother; And it shall come to pass, when you become restless, That you shall break his yoke from your neck.”"
Genesis,27,41,"So Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”"
Genesis,27,42,"And the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, “Surely your brother Esau comforts himself concerning you by intending to kill you."
Genesis,27,43,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice: arise, flee to my brother Laban in Haran."
Genesis,27,44,"And stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury turns away,"
Genesis,27,45,"until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him; then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereaved also of you both in one day?”"
Genesis,27,46,"And Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, like these who are the daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?”"
Genesis,28,1,"Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him: “You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan."
Genesis,28,2,"Arise, go to Padan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father; and take yourself a wife from there of the daughters of Laban your mother’s brother."
Genesis,28,3,"“May God Almighty bless you, And make you fruitful and multiply you, That you may be an assembly of peoples;"
Genesis,28,4,"And give you the blessing of Abraham, To you and your descendants with you, That you may inherit the land In which you are a stranger, Which God gave to Abraham.”"
Genesis,28,5,"So Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Padan Aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau."
Genesis,28,6,"Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Padan Aram to take himself a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, “You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,”"
Genesis,28,7,and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Padan Aram.
Genesis,28,8,Also Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan did not please his father Isaac.
Genesis,28,9,"So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife in addition to the wives he had."
Genesis,28,10,Now Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran.
Genesis,28,11,"So he came to a certain place and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. And he took one of the stones of that place and put it at his head, and he lay down in that place to sleep."
Genesis,28,12,"Then he dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it."
Genesis,28,13,"And behold, the LORD stood above it and said: “I am the LORD God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and your descendants."
Genesis,28,14,"Also your descendants shall be as the dust of the earth; you shall spread abroad to the west and the east, to the north and the south; and in you and in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
Genesis,28,15,"Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have spoken to you.”"
Genesis,28,16,"Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it.”"
Genesis,28,17,"And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven!”"
Genesis,28,18,"Then Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put at his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it."
Genesis,28,19,And he called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of that city had been Luz previously.
Genesis,28,20,"Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I am going, and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on,"
Genesis,28,21,"so that I come back to my father’s house in peace, then the LORD shall be my God."
Genesis,28,22,"And this stone which I have set as a pillar shall be God’s house, and of all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You.”"
Genesis,29,1,So Jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the people of the East.
Genesis,29,2,"And he looked, and saw a well in the field; and behold, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks. A large stone was on the well’s mouth."
Genesis,29,3,"Now all the flocks would be gathered there; and they would roll the stone from the well’s mouth, water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the well’s mouth."
Genesis,29,4,"And Jacob said to them, “My brethren, where are you from?” And they said, “We are from Haran.”"
Genesis,29,5,"Then he said to them, “Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?” And they said, “We know him.”"
Genesis,29,6,"So he said to them, “Is he well?” And they said, “He is well. And look, his daughter Rachel is coming with the sheep.”"
Genesis,29,7,"Then he said, “Look, it is still high day; it is not time for the cattle to be gathered together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.”"
Genesis,29,8,"But they said, “We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and they have rolled the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.”"
Genesis,29,9,"Now while he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess."
Genesis,29,10,"And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother."
Genesis,29,11,"Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept."
Genesis,29,12,And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s relative and that he was Rebekah’s son. So she ran and told her father.
Genesis,29,13,"Then it came to pass, when Laban heard the report about Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. So he told Laban all these things."
Genesis,29,14,"And Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” And he stayed with him for a month."
Genesis,29,15,"Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what should your wages be?”"
Genesis,29,16,"Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
Genesis,29,17,"Leah’s eyes were delicate, but Rachel was beautiful of form and appearance."
Genesis,29,18,"Now Jacob loved Rachel; so he said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.”"
Genesis,29,19,"And Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.”"
Genesis,29,20,"So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed only a few days to him because of the love he had for her."
Genesis,29,21,"Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.”"
Genesis,29,22,And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast.
Genesis,29,23,"Now it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to Jacob; and he went in to her."
Genesis,29,24,And Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah as a maid.
Genesis,29,25,"So it came to pass in the morning, that behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served you? Why then have you deceived me?”"
Genesis,29,26,"And Laban said, “It must not be done so in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn."
Genesis,29,27,"Fulfill her week, and we will give you this one also for the service which you will serve with me still another seven years.”"
Genesis,29,28,Then Jacob did so and fulfilled her week. So he gave him his daughter Rachel as wife also.
Genesis,29,29,And Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as a maid.
Genesis,29,30,"Then Jacob also went in to Rachel, and he also loved Rachel more than Leah. And he served with Laban still another seven years."
Genesis,29,31,"When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, He opened her womb; but Rachel was barren."
Genesis,29,32,"So Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, “The LORD has surely looked on my affliction. Now therefore, my husband will love me.”"
Genesis,29,33,"Then she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Because the LORD has heard that I am unloved, He has therefore given me this son also.” And she called his name Simeon."
Genesis,29,34,"She conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Now this time my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi."
Genesis,29,35,"And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Now I will praise the LORD.” Therefore she called his name Judah. Then she stopped bearing."
Genesis,30,1,"Now when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister, and said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I die!”"
Genesis,30,2,"And Jacob’s anger was aroused against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”"
Genesis,30,3,"So she said, “Here is my maid Bilhah; go in to her, and she will bear a child on my knees, that I also may have children by her.”"
Genesis,30,4,"Then she gave him Bilhah her maid as wife, and Jacob went in to her."
Genesis,30,5,And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
Genesis,30,6,"Then Rachel said, “God has judged my case; and He has also heard my voice and given me a son.” Therefore she called his name Dan."
Genesis,30,7,And Rachel’s maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
Genesis,30,8,"Then Rachel said, “With great wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and indeed I have prevailed.” So she called his name Naphtali."
Genesis,30,9,"When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took Zilpah her maid and gave her to Jacob as wife."
Genesis,30,10,And Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
Genesis,30,11,"Then Leah said, “A troop comes!” So she called his name Gad."
Genesis,30,12,And Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
Genesis,30,13,"Then Leah said, “I am happy, for the daughters will call me blessed.” So she called his name Asher."
Genesis,30,14,"Now Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”"
Genesis,30,15,"But she said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes also?” And Rachel said, “Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.”"
Genesis,30,16,"When Jacob came out of the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” And he lay with her that night."
Genesis,30,17,"And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son."
Genesis,30,18,"Leah said, “God has given me my wages, because I have given my maid to my husband.” So she called his name Issachar."
Genesis,30,19,Then Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.
Genesis,30,20,"And Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good endowment; now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons.” So she called his name Zebulun."
Genesis,30,21,"Afterward she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah."
Genesis,30,22,"Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb."
Genesis,30,23,"And she conceived and bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach.”"
Genesis,30,24,"So she called his name Joseph, and said, “The LORD shall add to me another son.”"
Genesis,30,25,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my country."
Genesis,30,26,"Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service which I have done for you.”"
Genesis,30,27,"And Laban said to him, “Please stay, if I have found favor in your eyes, for I have learned by experience that the LORD has blessed me for your sake.”"
Genesis,30,28,"Then he said, “Name me your wages, and I will give it.”"
Genesis,30,29,"So Jacob said to him, “You know how I have served you and how your livestock has been with me."
Genesis,30,30,"For what you had before I came was little, and it has increased to a great amount; the LORD has blessed you since my coming. And now, when shall I also provide for my own house?”"
Genesis,30,31,"So he said, “What shall I give you?” And Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flocks:"
Genesis,30,32,"Let me pass through all your flock today, removing from there all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and these shall be my wages."
Genesis,30,33,"So my righteousness will answer for me in time to come, when the subject of my wages comes before you: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the lambs, will be considered stolen, if it is with me.”"
Genesis,30,34,"And Laban said, “Oh, that it were according to your word!”"
Genesis,30,35,"So he removed that day the male goats that were speckled and spotted, all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had some white in it, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and gave them into the hand of his sons."
Genesis,30,36,"Then he put three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks."
Genesis,30,37,"Now Jacob took for himself rods of green poplar and of the almond and chestnut trees, peeled white strips in them, and exposed the white which was in the rods."
Genesis,30,38,"And the rods which he had peeled, he set before the flocks in the gutters, in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, so that they should conceive when they came to drink."
Genesis,30,39,"So the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted."
Genesis,30,40,"Then Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the streaked and all the brown in the flock of Laban; but he put his own flocks by themselves and did not put them with Laban’s flock."
Genesis,30,41,"And it came to pass, whenever the stronger livestock conceived, that Jacob placed the rods before the eyes of the livestock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods."
Genesis,30,42,"But when the flocks were feeble, he did not put them in; so the feebler were Laban’s and the stronger Jacob’s."
Genesis,30,43,"Thus the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks, female and male servants, and camels and donkeys."
Genesis,31,1,"Now Jacob heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s, and from what was our father’s he has acquired all this wealth.”"
Genesis,31,2,"And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and indeed it was not favorable toward him as before."
Genesis,31,3,"Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers and to your family, and I will be with you.”"
Genesis,31,4,"So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field, to his flock,"
Genesis,31,5,"and said to them, “I see your father’s countenance, that it is not favorable toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me."
Genesis,31,6,And you know that with all my might I have served your father.
Genesis,31,7,"Yet your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not allow him to hurt me."
Genesis,31,8,"If he said thus: ‘The speckled shall be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore speckled. And if he said thus: ‘The streaked shall be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore streaked."
Genesis,31,9,So God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me.
Genesis,31,10,"“And it happened, at the time when the flocks conceived, that I lifted my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which leaped upon the flocks were streaked, speckled, and gray-spotted."
Genesis,31,11,"Then the Angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, ‘Jacob.’ And I said, ‘Here I am.’"
Genesis,31,12,"And He said, ‘Lift your eyes now and see, all the rams which leap on the flocks are streaked, speckled, and gray-spotted; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you."
Genesis,31,13,"I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar and where you made a vow to Me. Now arise, get out of this land, and return to the land of your family.’”"
Genesis,31,14,"Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, “Is there still any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?"
Genesis,31,15,"Are we not considered strangers by him? For he has sold us, and also completely consumed our money."
Genesis,31,16,"For all these riches which God has taken from our father are really ours and our children’s; now then, whatever God has said to you, do it.”"
Genesis,31,17,Then Jacob rose and set his sons and his wives on camels.
Genesis,31,18,"And he carried away all his livestock and all his possessions which he had gained, his acquired livestock which he had gained in Padan Aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,31,19,"Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel had stolen the household idols that were her father’s."
Genesis,31,20,"And Jacob stole away, unknown to Laban the Syrian, in that he did not tell him that he intended to flee."
Genesis,31,21,"So he fled with all that he had. He arose and crossed the river, and headed toward the mountains of Gilead."
Genesis,31,22,And Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.
Genesis,31,23,"Then he took his brethren with him and pursued him for seven days’ journey, and he overtook him in the mountains of Gilead."
Genesis,31,24,"But God had come to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said to him, “Be careful that you speak to Jacob neither good nor bad.”"
Genesis,31,25,"So Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountains, and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountains of Gilead."
Genesis,31,26,"And Laban said to Jacob: “What have you done, that you have stolen away unknown to me, and carried away my daughters like captives taken with the sword?"
Genesis,31,27,"Why did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and not tell me; for I might have sent you away with joy and songs, with timbrel and harp?"
Genesis,31,28,And you did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters. Now you have done foolishly in so doing.
Genesis,31,29,"It is in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful that you speak to Jacob neither good nor bad.’"
Genesis,31,30,"And now you have surely gone because you greatly long for your father’s house, but why did you steal my gods?”"
Genesis,31,31,"Then Jacob answered and said to Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I said, ‘Perhaps you would take your daughters from me by force.’"
Genesis,31,32,"With whomever you find your gods, do not let him live. In the presence of our brethren, identify what I have of yours and take it with you.” For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them."
Genesis,31,33,"And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the two maids’ tents, but he did not find them. Then he went out of Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent."
Genesis,31,34,"Now Rachel had taken the household idols, put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. And Laban searched all about the tent but did not find them."
Genesis,31,35,"And she said to her father, “Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise before you, for the manner of women is with me.” And he searched but did not find the household idols."
Genesis,31,36,"Then Jacob was angry and rebuked Laban, and Jacob answered and said to Laban: “What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued me?"
Genesis,31,37,"Although you have searched all my things, what part of your household things have you found? Set it here before my brethren and your brethren, that they may judge between us both!"
Genesis,31,38,"These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried their young, and I have not eaten the rams of your flock."
Genesis,31,39,"That which was torn by beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it. You required it from my hand, whether stolen by day or stolen by night."
Genesis,31,40,"There I was! In the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep departed from my eyes."
Genesis,31,41,"Thus I have been in your house twenty years; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times."
Genesis,31,42,"Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.”"
Genesis,31,43,"And Laban answered and said to Jacob, “These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and this flock is my flock; all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?"
Genesis,31,44,"Now therefore, come, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it be a witness between you and me.”"
Genesis,31,45,So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
Genesis,31,46,"Then Jacob said to his brethren, “Gather stones.” And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there on the heap."
Genesis,31,47,"Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed."
Genesis,31,48,"And Laban said, “This heap is a witness between you and me this day.” Therefore its name was called Galeed,"
Genesis,31,49,"also Mizpah, because he said, “May the LORD watch between you and me when we are absent one from another."
Genesis,31,50,"If you afflict my daughters, or if you take other wives besides my daughters, although no man is with us—see, God is witness between you and me!”"
Genesis,31,51,"Then Laban said to Jacob, “Here is this heap and here is this pillar, which I have placed between you and me."
Genesis,31,52,"This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not pass beyond this heap to you, and you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, for harm."
Genesis,31,53,"The God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, and the God of their father judge between us.” And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac."
Genesis,31,54,"Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread. And they ate bread and stayed all night on the mountain."
Genesis,31,55,"And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned to his place."
Genesis,32,1,"So Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him."
Genesis,32,2,"When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is God’s camp.” And he called the name of that place Mahanaim."
Genesis,32,3,"Then Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the country of Edom."
Genesis,32,4,"And he commanded them, saying, “Speak thus to my lord Esau, ‘Thus your servant Jacob says: “I have dwelt with Laban and stayed there until now."
Genesis,32,5,"I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.”’”"
Genesis,32,6,"Then the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau, and he also is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”"
Genesis,32,7,"So Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two companies."
Genesis,32,8,"And he said, “If Esau comes to the one company and attacks it, then the other company which is left will escape.”"
Genesis,32,9,"Then Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the LORD who said to me, ‘Return to your country and to your family, and I will deal well with you’:"
Genesis,32,10,"I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which You have shown Your servant; for I crossed over this Jordan with my staff, and now I have become two companies."
Genesis,32,11,"Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and attack me and the mother with the children."
Genesis,32,12,"For You said, ‘I will surely treat you well, and make your descendants as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’”"
Genesis,32,13,"So he lodged there that same night, and took what came to his hand as a present for Esau his brother:"
Genesis,32,14,"two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,"
Genesis,32,15,"thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals."
Genesis,32,16,"Then he delivered them to the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put some distance between successive droves.”"
Genesis,32,17,"And he commanded the first one, saying, “When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going? Whose are these in front of you?’"
Genesis,32,18,"then you shall say, ‘They are your servant Jacob’s. It is a present sent to my lord Esau; and behold, he also is behind us.’”"
Genesis,32,19,"So he commanded the second, the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, “In this manner you shall speak to Esau when you find him;"
Genesis,32,20,"and also say, ‘Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us.’” For he said, “I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me.”"
Genesis,32,21,"So the present went on over before him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp."
Genesis,32,22,"And he arose that night and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of Jabbok."
Genesis,32,23,"He took them, sent them over the brook, and sent over what he had."
Genesis,32,24,Then Jacob was left alone; and a Man wrestled with him until the breaking of day.
Genesis,32,25,"Now when He saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob’s hip was out of joint as He wrestled with him."
Genesis,32,26,"And He said, “Let Me go, for the day breaks.” But he said, “I will not let You go unless You bless me!”"
Genesis,32,27,"So He said to him, “What is your name?” He said, “Jacob.”"
Genesis,32,28,"And He said, “Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God and with men, and have prevailed.”"
Genesis,32,29,"Then Jacob asked, saying, “Tell me Your name, I pray.” And He said, “Why is it that you ask about My name?” And He blessed him there."
Genesis,32,30,"So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: “For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.”"
Genesis,32,31,"Just as he crossed over Penuel the sun rose on him, and he limped on his hip."
Genesis,32,32,"Therefore to this day the children of Israel do not eat the muscle that shrank, which is on the hip socket, because He touched the socket of Jacob’s hip in the muscle that shrank."
Genesis,33,1,"Now Jacob lifted his eyes and looked, and there, Esau was coming, and with him were four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants."
Genesis,33,2,"And he put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last."
Genesis,33,3,"Then he crossed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother."
Genesis,33,4,"But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept."
Genesis,33,5,"And he lifted his eyes and saw the women and children, and said, “Who are these with you?” So he said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”"
Genesis,33,6,"Then the maidservants came near, they and their children, and bowed down."
Genesis,33,7,"And Leah also came near with her children, and they bowed down. Afterward Joseph and Rachel came near, and they bowed down."
Genesis,33,8,"Then Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?” And he said, “These are to find favor in the sight of my lord.”"
Genesis,33,9,"But Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.”"
Genesis,33,10,"And Jacob said, “No, please, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present from my hand, inasmuch as I have seen your face as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me."
Genesis,33,11,"Please, take my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” So he urged him, and he took it."
Genesis,33,12,"Then Esau said, “Let us take our journey; let us go, and I will go before you.”"
Genesis,33,13,"But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are weak, and the flocks and herds which are nursing are with me. And if the men should drive them hard one day, all the flock will die."
Genesis,33,14,"Please let my lord go on ahead before his servant. I will lead on slowly at a pace which the livestock that go before me, and the children, are able to endure, until I come to my lord in Seir.”"
Genesis,33,15,"And Esau said, “Now let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But he said, “What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”"
Genesis,33,16,So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
Genesis,33,17,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, built himself a house, and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth."
Genesis,33,18,"Then Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan Aram; and he pitched his tent before the city."
Genesis,33,19,"And he bought the parcel of land, where he had pitched his tent, from the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of money."
Genesis,33,20,Then he erected an altar there and called it El Elohe Israel.
Genesis,34,1,"Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land."
Genesis,34,2,"And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her and lay with her, and violated her."
Genesis,34,3,"His soul was strongly attracted to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young woman and spoke kindly to the young woman."
Genesis,34,4,"So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, “Get me this young woman as a wife.”"
Genesis,34,5,And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter. Now his sons were with his livestock in the field; so Jacob held his peace until they came.
Genesis,34,6,Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.
Genesis,34,7,"And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it; and the men were grieved and very angry, because he had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter, a thing which ought not to be done."
Genesis,34,8,"But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife."
Genesis,34,9,"And make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to yourselves."
Genesis,34,10,"So you shall dwell with us, and the land shall be before you. Dwell and trade in it, and acquire possessions for yourselves in it.”"
Genesis,34,11,"Then Shechem said to her father and her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give."
Genesis,34,12,"Ask me ever so much dowry and gift, and I will give according to what you say to me; but give me the young woman as a wife.”"
Genesis,34,13,"But the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father, and spoke deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister."
Genesis,34,14,"And they said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a reproach to us."
Genesis,34,15,"But on this condition we will consent to you: If you will become as we are, if every male of you is circumcised,"
Genesis,34,16,"then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us; and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people."
Genesis,34,17,"But if you will not heed us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and be gone.”"
Genesis,34,18,"And their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son."
Genesis,34,19,"So the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob’s daughter. He was more honorable than all the household of his father."
Genesis,34,20,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and spoke with the men of their city, saying:"
Genesis,34,21,"“These men are at peace with us. Therefore let them dwell in the land and trade in it. For indeed the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to us as wives, and let us give them our daughters."
Genesis,34,22,"Only on this condition will the men consent to dwell with us, to be one people: if every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised."
Genesis,34,23,"Will not their livestock, their property, and every animal of theirs be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.”"
Genesis,34,24,"And all who went out of the gate of his city heeded Hamor and Shechem his son; every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city."
Genesis,34,25,"Now it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword and came boldly upon the city and killed all the males."
Genesis,34,26,"And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah from Shechem’s house, and went out."
Genesis,34,27,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because their sister had been defiled."
Genesis,34,28,"They took their sheep, their oxen, and their donkeys, what was in the city and what was in the field,"
Genesis,34,29,and all their wealth. All their little ones and their wives they took captive; and they plundered even all that was in the houses.
Genesis,34,30,"Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have troubled me by making me obnoxious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and since I am few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and kill me. I shall be destroyed, my household and I.”"
Genesis,34,31,"But they said, “Should he treat our sister like a harlot?”"
Genesis,35,1,"Then God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there; and make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.”"
Genesis,35,2,"And Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, and change your garments."
Genesis,35,3,"Then let us arise and go up to Bethel; and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me in the way which I have gone.”"
Genesis,35,4,"So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree which was by Shechem."
Genesis,35,5,"And they journeyed, and the terror of God was upon the cities that were all around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob."
Genesis,35,6,"So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him."
Genesis,35,7,"And he built an altar there and called the place El Bethel, because there God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother."
Genesis,35,8,"Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the terebinth tree. So the name of it was called Allon Bachuth."
Genesis,35,9,"Then God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Padan Aram, and blessed him."
Genesis,35,10,"And God said to him, “Your name is Jacob; your name shall not be called Jacob anymore, but Israel shall be your name.” So He called his name Israel."
Genesis,35,11,"Also God said to him: “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall proceed from you, and kings shall come from your body."
Genesis,35,12,The land which I gave Abraham and Isaac I give to you; and to your descendants after you I give this land.”
Genesis,35,13,Then God went up from him in the place where He talked with him.
Genesis,35,14,"So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He talked with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it."
Genesis,35,15,"And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel."
Genesis,35,16,"Then they journeyed from Bethel. And when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel labored in childbirth, and she had hard labor."
Genesis,35,17,"Now it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, “Do not fear; you will have this son also.”"
Genesis,35,18,"And so it was, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-Oni; but his father called him Benjamin."
Genesis,35,19,"So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)."
Genesis,35,20,"And Jacob set a pillar on her grave, which is the pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day."
Genesis,35,21,Then Israel journeyed and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
Genesis,35,22,Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
Genesis,35,23,"the sons of Leah were Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun;"
Genesis,35,24,the sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin;
Genesis,35,25,"the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s maidservant, were Dan and Naphtali;"
Genesis,35,26,"and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant, were Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Padan Aram."
Genesis,35,27,"Then Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kirjath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had dwelt."
Genesis,35,28,Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years.
Genesis,35,29,"So Isaac breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
Genesis,36,1,"Now this is the genealogy of Esau, who is Edom."
Genesis,36,2,"Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite; Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;"
Genesis,36,3,"and Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebajoth."
Genesis,36,4,"Now Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel."
Genesis,36,5,"And Aholibamah bore Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,36,6,"Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the persons of his household, his cattle and all his animals, and all his goods which he had gained in the land of Canaan, and went to a country away from the presence of his brother Jacob."
Genesis,36,7,"For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together, and the land where they were strangers could not support them because of their livestock."
Genesis,36,8,So Esau dwelt in Mount Seir. Esau is Edom.
Genesis,36,9,And this is the genealogy of Esau the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir.
Genesis,36,10,"These were the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, and Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau."
Genesis,36,11,"And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz."
Genesis,36,12,"Now Timna was the concubine of Eliphaz, Esau’s son, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These were the sons of Adah, Esau’s wife."
Genesis,36,13,"These were the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife."
Genesis,36,14,"These were the sons of Aholibamah, Esau’s wife, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon. And she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah."
Genesis,36,15,"These were the chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn son of Esau, were Chief Teman, Chief Omar, Chief Zepho, Chief Kenaz,"
Genesis,36,16,"Chief Korah, Chief Gatam, and Chief Amalek. These were the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. They were the sons of Adah."
Genesis,36,17,"These were the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: Chief Nahath, Chief Zerah, Chief Shammah, and Chief Mizzah. These were the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife."
Genesis,36,18,"And these were the sons of Aholibamah, Esau’s wife: Chief Jeush, Chief Jaalam, and Chief Korah. These were the chiefs who descended from Aholibamah, Esau’s wife, the daughter of Anah."
Genesis,36,19,"These were the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these were their chiefs."
Genesis,36,20,"These were the sons of Seir the Horite who inhabited the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,"
Genesis,36,21,"Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir, in the land of Edom."
Genesis,36,22,And the sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. Lotan’s sister was Timna.
Genesis,36,23,"These were the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam."
Genesis,36,24,These were the sons of Zibeon: both Ajah and Anah. This was the Anah who found the water in the wilderness as he pastured the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
Genesis,36,25,These were the children of Anah: Dishon and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.
Genesis,36,26,"These were the sons of Dishon:Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran."
Genesis,36,27,"These were the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan."
Genesis,36,28,These were the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
Genesis,36,29,"These were the chiefs of the Horites: Chief Lotan, Chief Shobal, Chief Zibeon, Chief Anah,"
Genesis,36,30,"Chief Dishon, Chief Ezer, and Chief Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir."
Genesis,36,31,Now these were the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the children of Israel:
Genesis,36,32,"Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah."
Genesis,36,33,"And when Bela died, Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his place."
Genesis,36,34,"When Jobab died, Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place."
Genesis,36,35,"And when Husham died, Hadad the son of Bedad, who attacked Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his place. And the name of his city was Avith."
Genesis,36,36,"When Hadad died, Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place."
Genesis,36,37,"And when Samlah died, Saul of Rehoboth-by-the-River reigned in his place."
Genesis,36,38,"When Saul died, Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his place."
Genesis,36,39,"And when Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor died, Hadar reigned in his place; and the name of his city was Pau. His wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab."
Genesis,36,40,"And these were the names of the chiefs of Esau, according to their families and their places, by their names: Chief Timnah, Chief Alvah, Chief Jetheth,"
Genesis,36,41,"Chief Aholibamah, Chief Elah, Chief Pinon,"
Genesis,36,42,"Chief Kenaz, Chief Teman, Chief Mibzar,"
Genesis,36,43,"Chief Magdiel, and Chief Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their dwelling places in the land of their possession. Esau was the father of the Edomites."
Genesis,37,1,"Now Jacob dwelt in the land where his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,37,2,"This is the history of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. And the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives; and Joseph brought a bad report of them to his father."
Genesis,37,3,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age. Also he made him a tunic of many colors."
Genesis,37,4,"But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him."
Genesis,37,5,"Now Joseph had a dream, and he told it to his brothers; and they hated him even more."
Genesis,37,6,"So he said to them, “Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:"
Genesis,37,7,"There we were, binding sheaves in the field. Then behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and indeed your sheaves stood all around and bowed down to my sheaf.”"
Genesis,37,8,"And his brothers said to him, “Shall you indeed reign over us? Or shall you indeed have dominion over us?” So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words."
Genesis,37,9,"Then he dreamed still another dream and told it to his brothers, and said, “Look, I have dreamed another dream. And this time, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars bowed down to me.”"
Genesis,37,10,"So he told it to his father and his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall your mother and I and your brothers indeed come to bow down to the earth before you?”"
Genesis,37,11,"And his brothers envied him, but his father kept the matter in mind."
Genesis,37,12,Then his brothers went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.
Genesis,37,13,"And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.” So he said to him, “Here I am.”"
Genesis,37,14,"Then he said to him, “Please go and see if it is well with your brothers and well with the flocks, and bring back word to me.” So he sent him out of the Valley of Hebron, and he went to Shechem."
Genesis,37,15,"Now a certain man found him, and there he was, wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, “What are you seeking?”"
Genesis,37,16,"So he said, “I am seeking my brothers. Please tell me where they are feeding their flocks.”"
Genesis,37,17,"And the man said, “They have departed from here, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan."
Genesis,37,18,"Now when they saw him afar off, even before he came near them, they conspired against him to kill him."
Genesis,37,19,"Then they said to one another, “Look, this dreamer is coming!"
Genesis,37,20,"Come therefore, let us now kill him and cast him into some pit; and we shall say, ‘Some wild beast has devoured him.’ We shall see what will become of his dreams!”"
Genesis,37,21,"But Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands, and said, “Let us not kill him.”"
Genesis,37,22,"And Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit which is in the wilderness, and do not lay a hand on him”—that he might deliver him out of their hands, and bring him back to his father."
Genesis,37,23,"So it came to pass, when Joseph had come to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of many colors that was on him."
Genesis,37,24,Then they took him and cast him into a pit. And the pit was empty; there was no water in it.
Genesis,37,25,"And they sat down to eat a meal. Then they lifted their eyes and looked, and there was a company of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead with their camels, bearing spices, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry them down to Egypt."
Genesis,37,26,"So Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is there if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?"
Genesis,37,27,"Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother and our flesh.” And his brothers listened."
Genesis,37,28,"Then Midianite traders passed by; so the brothers pulled Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. And they took Joseph to Egypt."
Genesis,37,29,"Then Reuben returned to the pit, and indeed Joseph was not in the pit; and he tore his clothes."
Genesis,37,30,"And he returned to his brothers and said, “The lad is no more; and I, where shall I go?”"
Genesis,37,31,"So they took Joseph’s tunic, killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the tunic in the blood."
Genesis,37,32,"Then they sent the tunic of many colors, and they brought it to their father and said, “We have found this. Do you know whether it is your son’s tunic or not?”"
Genesis,37,33,"And he recognized it and said, “It is my son’s tunic. A wild beast has devoured him. Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces.”"
Genesis,37,34,"Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days."
Genesis,37,35,"And all his sons and all his daughters arose to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and he said, “For I shall go down into the grave to my son in mourning.” Thus his father wept for him."
Genesis,37,36,"Now the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard."
Genesis,38,1,"It came to pass at that time that Judah departed from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite whose name was Hirah."
Genesis,38,2,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua, and he married her and went in to her."
Genesis,38,3,"So she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er."
Genesis,38,4,"She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan."
Genesis,38,5,"And she conceived yet again and bore a son, and called his name Shelah. He was at Chezib when she bore him."
Genesis,38,6,"Then Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar."
Genesis,38,7,"But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD killed him."
Genesis,38,8,"And Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife and marry her, and raise up an heir to your brother.”"
Genesis,38,9,"But Onan knew that the heir would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother’s wife, that he emitted on the ground, lest he should give an heir to his brother."
Genesis,38,10,And the thing which he did displeased the LORD; therefore He killed him also.
Genesis,38,11,"Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house till my son Shelah is grown.” For he said, “Lest he also die like his brothers.” And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house."
Genesis,38,12,"Now in the process of time the daughter of Shua, Judah’s wife, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite."
Genesis,38,13,"And it was told Tamar, saying, “Look, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”"
Genesis,38,14,"So she took off her widow’s garments, covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place which was on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as a wife."
Genesis,38,15,"When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, because she had covered her face."
Genesis,38,16,"Then he turned to her by the way, and said, “Please let me come in to you”; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. So she said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”"
Genesis,38,17,"And he said, “I will send a young goat from the flock.” So she said, “Will you give me a pledge till you send it?”"
Genesis,38,18,"Then he said, “What pledge shall I give you?” So she said, “Your signet and cord, and your staff that is in your hand.” Then he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him."
Genesis,38,19,"So she arose and went away, and laid aside her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood."
Genesis,38,20,"And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman’s hand, but he did not find her."
Genesis,38,21,"Then he asked the men of that place, saying, “Where is the harlot who was openly by the roadside?” And they said, “There was no harlot in this place.”"
Genesis,38,22,"So he returned to Judah and said, “I cannot find her. Also, the men of the place said there was no harlot in this place.”"
Genesis,38,23,"Then Judah said, “Let her take them for herself, lest we be shamed; for I sent this young goat and you have not found her.”"
Genesis,38,24,"And it came to pass, about three months after, that Judah was told, saying, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; furthermore she is with child by harlotry.” So Judah said, “Bring her out and let her be burned!”"
Genesis,38,25,"When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man to whom these belong, I am with child.” And she said, “Please determine whose these are—the signet and cord, and staff.”"
Genesis,38,26,"So Judah acknowledged them and said, “She has been more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son.” And he never knew her again."
Genesis,38,27,"Now it came to pass, at the time for giving birth, that behold, twins were in her womb."
Genesis,38,28,"And so it was, when she was giving birth, that the one put out his hand; and the midwife took a scarlet thread and bound it on his hand, saying, “This one came out first.”"
Genesis,38,29,"Then it happened, as he drew back his hand, that his brother came out unexpectedly; and she said, “How did you break through? This breach be upon you!” Therefore his name was called Perez."
Genesis,38,30,Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet thread on his hand. And his name was called Zerah.
Genesis,39,1,"Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. And Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there."
Genesis,39,2,"The LORD was with Joseph, and he was a successful man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian."
Genesis,39,3,And his master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD made all he did to prosper in his hand.
Genesis,39,4,"So Joseph found favor in his sight, and served him. Then he made him overseer of his house, and all that he had he put under his authority."
Genesis,39,5,"So it was, from the time that he had made him overseer of his house and all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house and in the field."
Genesis,39,6,"Thus he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance."
Genesis,39,7,"And it came to pass after these things that his master’s wife cast longing eyes on Joseph, and she said, “Lie with me.”"
Genesis,39,8,"But he refused and said to his master’s wife, “Look, my master does not know what is with me in the house, and he has committed all that he has to my hand."
Genesis,39,9,"There is no one greater in this house than I, nor has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?”"
Genesis,39,10,"So it was, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he did not heed her, to lie with her or to be with her."
Genesis,39,11,"But it happened about this time, when Joseph went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the house was inside,"
Genesis,39,12,"that she caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me.” But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and ran outside."
Genesis,39,13,"And so it was, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and fled outside,"
Genesis,39,14,"that she called to the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, “See, he has brought in to us a Hebrew to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice."
Genesis,39,15,"And it happened, when he heard that I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me, and fled and went outside.”"
Genesis,39,16,So she kept his garment with her until his master came home.
Genesis,39,17,"Then she spoke to him with words like these, saying, “The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to me to mock me;"
Genesis,39,18,"so it happened, as I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me and fled outside.”"
Genesis,39,19,"So it was, when his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, saying, “Your servant did to me after this manner,” that his anger was aroused."
Genesis,39,20,"Then Joseph’s master took him and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners were confined. And he was there in the prison."
Genesis,39,21,"But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him mercy, and He gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison."
Genesis,39,22,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison; whatever they did there, it was his doing."
Genesis,39,23,"The keeper of the prison did not look into anything that was under Joseph’s authority, because the LORD was with him; and whatever he did, the LORD made it prosper."
Genesis,40,1,"It came to pass after these things that the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their lord, the king of Egypt."
Genesis,40,2,"And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief butler and the chief baker."
Genesis,40,3,"So he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison, the place where Joseph was confined."
Genesis,40,4,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them; so they were in custody for a while."
Genesis,40,5,"Then the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, had a dream, both of them, each man’s dream in one night and each man’s dream with its own interpretation."
Genesis,40,6,"And Joseph came in to them in the morning and looked at them, and saw that they were sad."
Genesis,40,7,"So he asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in the custody of his lord’s house, saying, “Why do you look so sad today?”"
Genesis,40,8,"And they said to him, “We each have had a dream, and there is no interpreter of it.” So Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, please.”"
Genesis,40,9,"Then the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “Behold, in my dream a vine was before me,"
Genesis,40,10,"and in the vine were three branches; it was as though it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes."
Genesis,40,11,"Then Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”"
Genesis,40,12,"And Joseph said to him, “This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days."
Genesis,40,13,"Now within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your place, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand according to the former manner, when you were his butler."
Genesis,40,14,"But remember me when it is well with you, and please show kindness to me; make mention of me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this house."
Genesis,40,15,For indeed I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews; and also I have done nothing here that they should put me into the dungeon.”
Genesis,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, “I also was in my dream, and there were three white baskets on my head."
Genesis,40,17,"In the uppermost basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.”"
Genesis,40,18,"So Joseph answered and said, “This is the interpretation of it: The three baskets are three days."
Genesis,40,19,Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head from you and hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from you.”
Genesis,40,20,"Now it came to pass on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants."
Genesis,40,21,"Then he restored the chief butler to his butlership again, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand."
Genesis,40,22,"But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them."
Genesis,40,23,"Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him."
Genesis,41,1,"Then it came to pass, at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh had a dream; and behold, he stood by the river."
Genesis,41,2,"Suddenly there came up out of the river seven cows, fine looking and fat; and they fed in the meadow."
Genesis,41,3,"Then behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ugly and gaunt, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the river."
Genesis,41,4,And the ugly and gaunt cows ate up the seven fine looking and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.
Genesis,41,5,"He slept and dreamed a second time; and suddenly seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, plump and good."
Genesis,41,6,"Then behold, seven thin heads, blighted by the east wind, sprang up after them."
Genesis,41,7,"And the seven thin heads devoured the seven plump and full heads. So Pharaoh awoke, and indeed, it was a dream."
Genesis,41,8,"Now it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,9,"Then the chief butler spoke to Pharaoh, saying: “I remember my faults this day."
Genesis,41,10,"When Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker,"
Genesis,41,11,"we each had a dream in one night, he and I. Each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his own dream."
Genesis,41,12,"Now there was a young Hebrew man with us there, a servant of the captain of the guard. And we told him, and he interpreted our dreams for us; to each man he interpreted according to his own dream."
Genesis,41,13,"And it came to pass, just as he interpreted for us, so it happened. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.”"
Genesis,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him quickly out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,15,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that you can understand a dream, to interpret it.”"
Genesis,41,16,"So Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.”"
Genesis,41,17,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: “Behold, in my dream I stood on the bank of the river."
Genesis,41,18,"Suddenly seven cows came up out of the river, fine looking and fat; and they fed in the meadow."
Genesis,41,19,"Then behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and gaunt, such ugliness as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,20,"And the gaunt and ugly cows ate up the first seven, the fat cows."
Genesis,41,21,"When they had eaten them up, no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were just as ugly as at the beginning. So I awoke."
Genesis,41,22,"Also I saw in my dream, and suddenly seven heads came up on one stalk, full and good."
Genesis,41,23,"Then behold, seven heads, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprang up after them."
Genesis,41,24,"And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads. So I told this to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”"
Genesis,41,25,"Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do:"
Genesis,41,26,"The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads are seven years; the dreams are one."
Genesis,41,27,"And the seven thin and ugly cows which came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty heads blighted by the east wind are seven years of famine."
Genesis,41,28,This is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.
Genesis,41,29,Indeed seven years of great plenty will come throughout all the land of Egypt;
Genesis,41,30,"but after them seven years of famine will arise, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine will deplete the land."
Genesis,41,31,"So the plenty will not be known in the land because of the famine following, for it will be very severe."
Genesis,41,32,"And the dream was repeated to Pharaoh twice because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."
Genesis,41,33,"“Now therefore, let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,34,"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, to collect one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt in the seven plentiful years."
Genesis,41,35,"And let them gather all the food of those good years that are coming, and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities."
Genesis,41,36,"Then that food shall be as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt, that the land may not perish during the famine.”"
Genesis,41,37,So the advice was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.
Genesis,41,38,"And Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?”"
Genesis,41,39,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Inasmuch as God has shown you all this, there is no one as discerning and wise as you."
Genesis,41,40,"You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be ruled according to your word; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you.”"
Genesis,41,41,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.”"
Genesis,41,42,Then Pharaoh took his signet ring off his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand; and he clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.
Genesis,41,43,"And he had him ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried out before him, “Bow the knee!” So he set him over all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,44,"Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no man may lift his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.”"
Genesis,41,45,"And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnath-Paaneah. And he gave him as a wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On. So Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,46,"Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,47,Now in the seven plentiful years the ground brought forth abundantly.
Genesis,41,48,"So he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities; he laid up in every city the food of the fields which surrounded them."
Genesis,41,49,"Joseph gathered very much grain, as the sand of the sea, until he stopped counting, for it was immeasurable."
Genesis,41,50,"And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him."
Genesis,41,51,Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: “For God has made me forget all my toil and all my father’s house.”
Genesis,41,52,And the name of the second he called Ephraim: “For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.”
Genesis,41,53,"Then the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Egypt ended,"
Genesis,41,54,"and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. The famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
Genesis,41,55,"So when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Then Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, do.”"
Genesis,41,56,"The famine was over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians. And the famine became severe in the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,57,"So all countries came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all lands."
Genesis,42,1,"When Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?”"
Genesis,42,2,"And he said, “Indeed I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down to that place and buy for us there, that we may live and not die.”"
Genesis,42,3,So Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.
Genesis,42,4,"But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, “Lest some calamity befall him.”"
Genesis,42,5,"And the sons of Israel went to buy grain among those who journeyed, for the famine was in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,42,6,Now Joseph was governor over the land; and it was he who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the earth.
Genesis,42,7,"Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted as a stranger to them and spoke roughly to them. Then he said to them, “Where do you come from?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.”"
Genesis,42,8,"So Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him."
Genesis,42,9,"Then Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them, and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land!”"
Genesis,42,10,"And they said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food."
Genesis,42,11,We are all one man’s sons; we are honest men; your servants are not spies.”
Genesis,42,12,"But he said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.”"
Genesis,42,13,"And they said, “Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and in fact, the youngest is with our father today, and one is no more.”"
Genesis,42,14,"But Joseph said to them, “It is as I spoke to you, saying, ‘You are spies!’"
Genesis,42,15,"In this manner you shall be tested: By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here."
Genesis,42,16,"Send one of you, and let him bring your brother; and you shall be kept in prison, that your words may be tested to see whether there is any truth in you; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies!”"
Genesis,42,17,So he put them all together in prison three days.
Genesis,42,18,"Then Joseph said to them the third day, “Do this and live, for I fear God:"
Genesis,42,19,"If you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined to your prison house; but you, go and carry grain for the famine of your houses."
Genesis,42,20,"And bring your youngest brother to me; so your words will be verified, and you shall not die.” And they did so."
Genesis,42,21,"Then they said to one another, “We are truly guilty concerning our brother, for we saw the anguish of his soul when he pleaded with us, and we would not hear; therefore this distress has come upon us.”"
Genesis,42,22,"And Reuben answered them, saying, “Did I not speak to you, saying, ‘Do not sin against the boy’; and you would not listen? Therefore behold, his blood is now required of us.”"
Genesis,42,23,"But they did not know that Joseph understood them, for he spoke to them through an interpreter."
Genesis,42,24,"And he turned himself away from them and wept. Then he returned to them again, and talked with them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes."
Genesis,42,25,"Then Joseph gave a command to fill their sacks with grain, to restore every man’s money to his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. Thus he did for them."
Genesis,42,26,So they loaded their donkeys with the grain and departed from there.
Genesis,42,27,"But as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey feed at the encampment, he saw his money; and there it was, in the mouth of his sack."
Genesis,42,28,"So he said to his brothers, “My money has been restored, and there it is, in my sack!” Then their hearts failed them and they were afraid, saying to one another, “What is this that God has done to us?”"
Genesis,42,29,"Then they went to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him all that had happened to them, saying:"
Genesis,42,30,"“The man who is lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country."
Genesis,42,31,"But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies."
Genesis,42,32,"We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is with our father this day in the land of Canaan.’"
Genesis,42,33,"Then the man, the lord of the country, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, take food for the famine of your households, and be gone."
Genesis,42,34,"And bring your youngest brother to me; so I shall know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. I will grant your brother to you, and you may trade in the land.’”"
Genesis,42,35,"Then it happened as they emptied their sacks, that surprisingly each man’s bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid."
Genesis,42,36,"And Jacob their father said to them, “You have bereaved me: Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin. All these things are against me.”"
Genesis,42,37,"Then Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you; put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.”"
Genesis,42,38,"But he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is left alone. If any calamity should befall him along the way in which you go, then you would bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave.”"
Genesis,43,1,Now the famine was severe in the land.
Genesis,43,2,"And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, “Go back, buy us a little food.”"
Genesis,43,3,"But Judah spoke to him, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’"
Genesis,43,4,"If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food."
Genesis,43,5,"But if you will not send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’”"
Genesis,43,6,"And Israel said, “Why did you deal so wrongfully with me as to tell the man whether you had still another brother?”"
Genesis,43,7,"But they said, “The man asked us pointedly about ourselves and our family, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ And we told him according to these words. Could we possibly have known that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”"
Genesis,43,8,"Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones."
Genesis,43,9,"I myself will be surety for him; from my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever."
Genesis,43,10,"For if we had not lingered, surely by now we would have returned this second time.”"
Genesis,43,11,"And their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Take some of the best fruits of the land in your vessels and carry down a present for the man—a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds."
Genesis,43,12,"Take double money in your hand, and take back in your hand the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was an oversight."
Genesis,43,13,"Take your brother also, and arise, go back to the man."
Genesis,43,14,"And may God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved, I am bereaved!”"
Genesis,43,15,"So the men took that present and Benjamin, and they took double money in their hand, and arose and went down to Egypt; and they stood before Joseph."
Genesis,43,16,"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Take these men to my home, and slaughter an animal and make ready; for these men will dine with me at noon.”"
Genesis,43,17,"Then the man did as Joseph ordered, and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house."
Genesis,43,18,"Now the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, “It is because of the money, which was returned in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may make a case against us and seize us, to take us as slaves with our donkeys.”"
Genesis,43,19,"When they drew near to the steward of Joseph’s house, they talked with him at the door of the house,"
Genesis,43,20,"and said, “O sir, we indeed came down the first time to buy food;"
Genesis,43,21,"but it happened, when we came to the encampment, that we opened our sacks, and there, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; so we have brought it back in our hand."
Genesis,43,22,And we have brought down other money in our hands to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.”
Genesis,43,23,"But he said, “Peace be with you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money.” Then he brought Simeon out to them."
Genesis,43,24,"So the man brought the men into Joseph’s house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys feed."
Genesis,43,25,"Then they made the present ready for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they would eat bread there."
Genesis,43,26,"And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down before him to the earth."
Genesis,43,27,"Then he asked them about their well-being, and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?”"
Genesis,43,28,"And they answered, “Your servant our father is in good health; he is still alive.” And they bowed their heads down and prostrated themselves."
Genesis,43,29,"Then he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your younger brother of whom you spoke to me?” And he said, “God be gracious to you, my son.”"
Genesis,43,30,Now his heart yearned for his brother; so Joseph made haste and sought somewhere to weep. And he went into his chamber and wept there.
Genesis,43,31,"Then he washed his face and came out; and he restrained himself, and said, “Serve the bread.”"
Genesis,43,32,"So they set him a place by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; because the Egyptians could not eat food with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians."
Genesis,43,33,"And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked in astonishment at one another."
Genesis,43,34,"Then he took servings to them from before him, but Benjamin’s serving was five times as much as any of theirs. So they drank and were merry with him."
Genesis,44,1,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in the mouth of his sack."
Genesis,44,2,"Also put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his grain money.” So he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken."
Genesis,44,3,"As soon as the morning dawned, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys."
Genesis,44,4,"When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, “Get up, follow the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good?"
Genesis,44,5,"Is not this the one from which my lord drinks, and with which he indeed practices divination? You have done evil in so doing.’”"
Genesis,44,6,"So he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words."
Genesis,44,7,"And they said to him, “Why does my lord say these words? Far be it from us that your servants should do such a thing."
Genesis,44,8,"Look, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house?"
Genesis,44,9,"With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.”"
Genesis,44,10,"And he said, “Now also let it be according to your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and you shall be blameless.”"
Genesis,44,11,"Then each man speedily let down his sack to the ground, and each opened his sack."
Genesis,44,12,So he searched. He began with the oldest and left off with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
Genesis,44,13,"Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey and returned to the city."
Genesis,44,14,"So Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there; and they fell before him on the ground."
Genesis,44,15,"And Joseph said to them, “What deed is this you have done? Did you not know that such a man as I can certainly practice divination?”"
Genesis,44,16,"Then Judah said, “What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants; here we are, my lord’s slaves, both we and he also with whom the cup was found.”"
Genesis,44,17,"But he said, “Far be it from me that I should do so; the man in whose hand the cup was found, he shall be my slave. And as for you, go up in peace to your father.”"
Genesis,44,18,"Then Judah came near to him and said: “O my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s hearing, and do not let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even like Pharaoh."
Genesis,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father or a brother?’"
Genesis,44,20,"And we said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, who is young; his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother’s children, and his father loves him.’"
Genesis,44,21,"Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.’"
Genesis,44,22,"And we said to my lord, ‘The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’"
Genesis,44,23,"But you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.’"
Genesis,44,24,"“So it was, when we went up to your servant my father, that we told him the words of my lord."
Genesis,44,25,"And our father said, ‘Go back and buy us a little food.’"
Genesis,44,26,"But we said, ‘We cannot go down; if our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down; for we may not see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’"
Genesis,44,27,"Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons;"
Genesis,44,28,"and the one went out from me, and I said, “Surely he is torn to pieces”; and I have not seen him since."
Genesis,44,29,"But if you take this one also from me, and calamity befalls him, you shall bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave.’"
Genesis,44,30,"“Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, since his life is bound up in the lad’s life,"
Genesis,44,31,"it will happen, when he sees that the lad is not with us, that he will die. So your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave."
Genesis,44,32,"For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father forever.’"
Genesis,44,33,"Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the lad as a slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brothers."
Genesis,44,34,"For how shall I go up to my father if the lad is not with me, lest perhaps I see the evil that would come upon my father?”"
Genesis,45,1,"Then Joseph could not restrain himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried out, “Make everyone go out from me!” So no one stood with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers."
Genesis,45,2,"And he wept aloud, and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it."
Genesis,45,3,"Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph; does my father still live?” But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed in his presence."
Genesis,45,4,"And Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come near to me.” So they came near. Then he said: “I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt."
Genesis,45,5,"But now, do not therefore be grieved or angry with yourselves because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life."
Genesis,45,6,"For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvesting."
Genesis,45,7,"And God sent me before you to preserve a posterity for you in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
Genesis,45,8,"So now it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,45,9,"“Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph: “God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not tarry."
Genesis,45,10,"You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you and your children, your children’s children, your flocks and your herds, and all that you have."
Genesis,45,11,"There I will provide for you, lest you and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty; for there are still five years of famine.”’"
Genesis,45,12,"“And behold, your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my mouth that speaks to you."
Genesis,45,13,"So you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen; and you shall hurry and bring my father down here.”"
Genesis,45,14,"Then he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck."
Genesis,45,15,"Moreover he kissed all his brothers and wept over them, and after that his brothers talked with him."
Genesis,45,16,"Now the report of it was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph’s brothers have come.” So it pleased Pharaoh and his servants well."
Genesis,45,17,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and depart; go to the land of Canaan."
Genesis,45,18,"Bring your father and your households and come to me; I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land."
Genesis,45,19,Now you are commanded—do this: Take carts out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives; bring your father and come.
Genesis,45,20,"Also do not be concerned about your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’”"
Genesis,45,21,"Then the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them carts, according to the command of Pharaoh, and he gave them provisions for the journey."
Genesis,45,22,"He gave to all of them, to each man, changes of garments; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of garments."
Genesis,45,23,"And he sent to his father these things: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and food for his father for the journey."
Genesis,45,24,"So he sent his brothers away, and they departed; and he said to them, “See that you do not become troubled along the way.”"
Genesis,45,25,"Then they went up out of Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father."
Genesis,45,26,"And they told him, saying, “Joseph is still alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt.” And Jacob’s heart stood still, because he did not believe them."
Genesis,45,27,"But when they told him all the words which Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived."
Genesis,45,28,"Then Israel said, “It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”"
Genesis,46,1,"So Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac."
Genesis,46,2,"Then God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, “Jacob, Jacob!” And he said, “Here I am.”"
Genesis,46,3,"So He said, “I am God, the God of your father; do not fear to go down to Egypt, for I will make of you a great nation there."
Genesis,46,4,"I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely bring you up again; and Joseph will put his hand on your eyes.”"
Genesis,46,5,"Then Jacob arose from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob, their little ones, and their wives, in the carts which Pharaoh had sent to carry him."
Genesis,46,6,"So they took their livestock and their goods, which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went to Egypt, Jacob and all his descendants with him."
Genesis,46,7,"His sons and his sons’ sons, his daughters and his sons’ daughters, and all his descendants he brought with him to Egypt."
Genesis,46,8,"Now these were the names of the children of Israel, Jacob and his sons, who went to Egypt: Reuben was Jacob’s firstborn."
Genesis,46,9,"The sons of Reuben were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi."
Genesis,46,10,"The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman."
Genesis,46,11,"The sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
Genesis,46,12,"The sons of Judah were Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul."
Genesis,46,13,"The sons of Issachar were Tola, Puvah, Job, and Shimron."
Genesis,46,14,"The sons of Zebulun were Sered, Elon, and Jahleel."
Genesis,46,15,"These were the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Padan Aram, with his daughter Dinah. All the persons, his sons and his daughters, were thirty-three."
Genesis,46,16,"The sons of Gad were Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli."
Genesis,46,17,"The sons of Asher were Jimnah, Ishuah, Isui, Beriah, and Serah, their sister. And the sons of Beriah were Heber and Malchiel."
Genesis,46,18,"These were the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bore to Jacob: sixteen persons."
Genesis,46,19,"The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife, were Joseph and Benjamin."
Genesis,46,20,"And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him."
Genesis,46,21,"The sons of Benjamin were Belah, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard."
Genesis,46,22,"These were the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: fourteen persons in all."
Genesis,46,23,The son of Dan was Hushim.
Genesis,46,24,"The sons of Naphtali were Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem."
Genesis,46,25,"These were the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob: seven persons in all."
Genesis,46,26,"All the persons who went with Jacob to Egypt, who came from his body, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, were sixty-six persons in all."
Genesis,46,27,And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt were two persons. All the persons of the house of Jacob who went to Egypt were seventy.
Genesis,46,28,"Then he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to point out before him the way to Goshen. And they came to the land of Goshen."
Genesis,46,29,"So Joseph made ready his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel; and he presented himself to him, and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while."
Genesis,46,30,"And Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are still alive.”"
Genesis,46,31,"Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘My brothers and those of my father’s house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me."
Genesis,46,32,"And the men are shepherds, for their occupation has been to feed livestock; and they have brought their flocks, their herds, and all that they have.’"
Genesis,46,33,"So it shall be, when Pharaoh calls you and says, ‘What is your occupation?’"
Genesis,46,34,"that you shall say, ‘Your servants’ occupation has been with livestock from our youth even till now, both we and also our fathers,’ that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.”"
Genesis,47,1,"Then Joseph went and told Pharaoh, and said, “My father and my brothers, their flocks and their herds and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan; and indeed they are in the land of Goshen.”"
Genesis,47,2,And he took five men from among his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh.
Genesis,47,3,"Then Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” And they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and also our fathers.”"
Genesis,47,4,"And they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to dwell in the land, because your servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.”"
Genesis,47,5,"Then Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you."
Genesis,47,6,"The land of Egypt is before you. Have your father and brothers dwell in the best of the land; let them dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know any competent men among them, then make them chief herdsmen over my livestock.”"
Genesis,47,7,Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
Genesis,47,8,"Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How old are you?”"
Genesis,47,9,"And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.”"
Genesis,47,10,"So Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh."
Genesis,47,11,"And Joseph situated his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
Genesis,47,12,"Then Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father’s household with bread, according to the number in their families."
Genesis,47,13,"Now there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine."
Genesis,47,14,"And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house."
Genesis,47,15,"So when the money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For the money has failed.”"
Genesis,47,16,"Then Joseph said, “Give your livestock, and I will give you bread for your livestock, if the money is gone.”"
Genesis,47,17,"So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the cattle of the herds, and for the donkeys. Thus he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock that year."
Genesis,47,18,"When that year had ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord that our money is gone; my lord also has our herds of livestock. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands."
Genesis,47,19,"Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants of Pharaoh; give us seed, that we may live and not die, that the land may not be desolate.”"
Genesis,47,20,"Then Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. So the land became Pharaoh’s."
Genesis,47,21,"And as for the people, he moved them into the cities, from one end of the borders of Egypt to the other end."
Genesis,47,22,"Only the land of the priests he did not buy; for the priests had rations allotted to them by Pharaoh, and they ate their rations which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their lands."
Genesis,47,23,"Then Joseph said to the people, “Indeed I have bought you and your land this day for Pharaoh. Look, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land."
Genesis,47,24,"And it shall come to pass in the harvest that you shall give one-fifth to Pharaoh. Four-fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and for your food, for those of your households and as food for your little ones.”"
Genesis,47,25,"So they said, “You have saved our lives; let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.”"
Genesis,47,26,"And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have one-fifth, except for the land of the priests only, which did not become Pharaoh’s."
Genesis,47,27,"So Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions there and grew and multiplied exceedingly."
Genesis,47,28,And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the length of Jacob’s life was one hundred and forty-seven years.
Genesis,47,29,"When the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “Now if I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please do not bury me in Egypt,"
Genesis,47,30,"but let me lie with my fathers; you shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place.” And he said, “I will do as you have said.”"
Genesis,47,31,"Then he said, “Swear to me.” And he swore to him. So Israel bowed himself on the head of the bed."
Genesis,48,1,"Now it came to pass after these things that Joseph was told, “Indeed your father is sick”; and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
Genesis,48,2,"And Jacob was told, “Look, your son Joseph is coming to you”; and Israel strengthened himself and sat up on the bed."
Genesis,48,3,"Then Jacob said to Joseph: “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,"
Genesis,48,4,"and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people, and give this land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession.’"
Genesis,48,5,"And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine."
Genesis,48,6,Your offspring whom you beget after them shall be yours; they will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.
Genesis,48,7,"But as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).”"
Genesis,48,8,"Then Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who are these?”"
Genesis,48,9,"And Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place.” And he said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.”"
Genesis,48,10,"Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. Then Joseph brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them."
Genesis,48,11,"And Israel said to Joseph, “I had not thought to see your face; but in fact, God has also shown me your offspring!”"
Genesis,48,12,"So Joseph brought them from beside his knees, and he bowed down with his face to the earth."
Genesis,48,13,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near him."
Genesis,48,14,"Then Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn."
Genesis,48,15,"And he blessed Joseph, and said: “God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, The God who has fed me all my life long to this day,"
Genesis,48,16,"The Angel who has redeemed me from all evil, Bless the lads; Let my name be named upon them, And the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; And let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.”"
Genesis,48,17,"Now when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; so he took hold of his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head."
Genesis,48,18,"And Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.”"
Genesis,48,19,"But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations.”"
Genesis,48,20,"So he blessed them that day, saying, “By you Israel will bless, saying, ‘May God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh!’” And thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh."
Genesis,48,21,"Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers."
Genesis,48,22,"Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow.”"
Genesis,49,1,"And Jacob called his sons and said, “Gather together, that I may tell you what shall befall you in the last days:"
Genesis,49,2,"“Gather together and hear, you sons of Jacob, And listen to Israel your father."
Genesis,49,3,"“Reuben, you are my firstborn, My might and the beginning of my strength, The excellency of dignity and the excellency of power."
Genesis,49,4,"Unstable as water, you shall not excel, Because you went up to your father’s bed; Then you defiled it— He went up to my couch."
Genesis,49,5,“Simeon and Levi are brothers; Instruments of cruelty are in their dwelling place.
Genesis,49,6,"Let not my soul enter their council; Let not my honor be united to their assembly; For in their anger they slew a man, And in their self-will they hamstrung an ox."
Genesis,49,7,"Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; And their wrath, for it is cruel! I will divide them in Jacob And scatter them in Israel."
Genesis,49,8,"“Judah, you are he whom your brothers shall praise; Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; Your father’s children shall bow down before you."
Genesis,49,9,"Judah is a lion’s whelp; From the prey, my son, you have gone up. He bows down, he lies down as a lion; And as a lion, who shall rouse him?"
Genesis,49,10,"The scepter shall not depart from Judah, Nor a lawgiver from between his feet, Until Shiloh comes; And to Him shall be the obedience of the people."
Genesis,49,11,"Binding his donkey to the vine, And his donkey’s colt to the choice vine, He washed his garments in wine, And his clothes in the blood of grapes."
Genesis,49,12,"His eyes are darker than wine, And his teeth whiter than milk."
Genesis,49,13,"“Zebulun shall dwell by the haven of the sea; He shall become a haven for ships, And his border shall adjoin Sidon."
Genesis,49,14,"“Issachar is a strong donkey, Lying down between two burdens;"
Genesis,49,15,"He saw that rest was good, And that the land was pleasant; He bowed his shoulder to bear a burden, And became a band of slaves."
Genesis,49,16,“Dan shall judge his people As one of the tribes of Israel.
Genesis,49,17,"Dan shall be a serpent by the way, A viper by the path, That bites the horse’s heels So that its rider shall fall backward."
Genesis,49,18,"I have waited for your salvation, O LORD!"
Genesis,49,19,"“Gad, a troop shall tramp upon him, But he shall triumph at last."
Genesis,49,20,"“Bread from Asher shall be rich, And he shall yield royal dainties."
Genesis,49,21,“Naphtali is a deer let loose; He uses beautiful words.
Genesis,49,22,"“Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a well; His branches run over the wall."
Genesis,49,23,"The archers have bitterly grieved him, Shot at him and hated him."
Genesis,49,24,"But his bow remained in strength, And the arms of his hands were made strong By the hands of the Mighty God of Jacob (From there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel),"
Genesis,49,25,"By the God of your father who will help you, And by the Almighty who will bless you With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that lies beneath, Blessings of the breasts and of the womb."
Genesis,49,26,"The blessings of your father Have excelled the blessings of my ancestors, Up to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills. They shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers."
Genesis,49,27,"“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; In the morning he shall devour the prey, And at night he shall divide the spoil.”"
Genesis,49,28,"All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them. And he blessed them; he blessed each one according to his own blessing."
Genesis,49,29,"Then he charged them and said to them: “I am to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,"
Genesis,49,30,"in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite as a possession for a burial place."
Genesis,49,31,"There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife, there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah."
Genesis,49,32,The field and the cave that is there were purchased from the sons of Heth.”
Genesis,49,33,"And when Jacob had finished commanding his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people."
Genesis,50,1,"Then Joseph fell on his father’s face, and wept over him, and kissed him."
Genesis,50,2,And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.
Genesis,50,3,"Forty days were required for him, for such are the days required for those who are embalmed; and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days."
Genesis,50,4,"Now when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the hearing of Pharaoh, saying,"
Genesis,50,5,"‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am dying; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me.” Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come back.’”"
Genesis,50,6,"And Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear.”"
Genesis,50,7,"So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,"
Genesis,50,8,"as well as all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen."
Genesis,50,9,"And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen, and it was a very great gathering."
Genesis,50,10,"Then they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and they mourned there with a great and very solemn lamentation. He observed seven days of mourning for his father."
Genesis,50,11,"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a deep mourning of the Egyptians.” Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan."
Genesis,50,12,So his sons did for him just as he had commanded them.
Genesis,50,13,"For his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as property for a burial place."
Genesis,50,14,"And after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father."
Genesis,50,15,"When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “Perhaps Joseph will hate us, and may actually repay us for all the evil which we did to him.”"
Genesis,50,16,"So they sent messengers to Joseph, saying, “Before your father died he commanded, saying,"
Genesis,50,17,"‘Thus you shall say to Joseph: “I beg you, please forgive the trespass of your brothers and their sin; for they did evil to you.”’ Now, please, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of your father.” And Joseph wept when they spoke to him."
Genesis,50,18,"Then his brothers also went and fell down before his face, and they said, “Behold, we are your servants.”"
Genesis,50,19,"Joseph said to them, “Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God?"
Genesis,50,20,"But as for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, in order to bring it about as it is this day, to save many people alive."
Genesis,50,21,"Now therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones.” And he comforted them and spoke kindly to them."
Genesis,50,22,"So Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father’s household. And Joseph lived one hundred and ten years."
Genesis,50,23,"Joseph saw Ephraim’s children to the third generation. The children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were also brought up on Joseph’s knees."
Genesis,50,24,"And Joseph said to his brethren, “I am dying; but God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land to the land of which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”"
Genesis,50,25,"Then Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.”"
Genesis,50,26,"So Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."
Exodus,1,1,Now these are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt; each man and his household came with Jacob:
Exodus,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;"
Exodus,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;"
Exodus,1,4,"Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher."
Exodus,1,5,All those who were descendants of Jacob were seventy persons (for Joseph was in Egypt already).
Exodus,1,6,"And Joseph died, all his brothers, and all that generation."
Exodus,1,7,"But the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, multiplied and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them."
Exodus,1,8,"Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph."
Exodus,1,9,"And he said to his people, “Look, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we;"
Exodus,1,10,"come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and it happen, in the event of war, that they also join our enemies and fight against us, and so go up out of the land.”"
Exodus,1,11,"Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh supply cities, Pithom and Raamses."
Exodus,1,12,"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were in dread of the children of Israel."
Exodus,1,13,So the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with rigor.
Exodus,1,14,"And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage—in mortar, in brick, and in all manner of service in the field. All their service in which they made them serve was with rigor."
Exodus,1,15,"Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of one was Shiphrah and the name of the other Puah;"
Exodus,1,16,"and he said, “When you do the duties of a midwife for the Hebrew women, and see them on the birthstools, if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.”"
Exodus,1,17,"But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive."
Exodus,1,18,"So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this thing, and saved the male children alive?”"
Exodus,1,19,"And the midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they are lively and give birth before the midwives come to them.”"
Exodus,1,20,"Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and grew very mighty."
Exodus,1,21,"And so it was, because the midwives feared God, that He provided households for them."
Exodus,1,22,"So Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “Every son who is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.”"
Exodus,2,1,And a man of the house of Levi went and took as wife a daughter of Levi.
Exodus,2,2,"So the woman conceived and bore a son. And when she saw that he was a beautiful child, she hid him three months."
Exodus,2,3,"But when she could no longer hide him, she took an ark of bulrushes for him, daubed it with asphalt and pitch, put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river’s bank."
Exodus,2,4,"And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him."
Exodus,2,5,"Then the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river. And her maidens walked along the riverside; and when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her maid to get it."
Exodus,2,6,"And when she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby wept. So she had compassion on him, and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.”"
Exodus,2,7,"Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?”"
Exodus,2,8,"And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” So the maiden went and called the child’s mother."
Exodus,2,9,"Then Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him."
Exodus,2,10,"And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. So she called his name Moses, saying, “Because I drew him out of the water.”"
Exodus,2,11,"Now it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren and looked at their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren."
Exodus,2,12,"So he looked this way and that way, and when he saw no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"And when he went out the second day, behold, two Hebrew men were fighting, and he said to the one who did the wrong, “Why are you striking your companion?”"
Exodus,2,14,"Then he said, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” So Moses feared and said, “Surely this thing is known!”"
Exodus,2,15,"When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well."
Exodus,2,16,"Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. And they came and drew water, and they filled the troughs to water their father’s flock."
Exodus,2,17,"Then the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock."
Exodus,2,18,"When they came to Reuel their father, he said, “How is it that you have come so soon today?”"
Exodus,2,19,"And they said, “An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and he also drew enough water for us and watered the flock.”"
Exodus,2,20,"So he said to his daughters, “And where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.”"
Exodus,2,21,"Then Moses was content to live with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses."
Exodus,2,22,"And she bore him a son. He called his name Gershom, for he said, “I have been a stranger in a foreign land.”"
Exodus,2,23,"Now it happened in the process of time that the king of Egypt died. Then the children of Israel groaned because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry came up to God because of the bondage."
Exodus,2,24,"So God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob."
Exodus,2,25,"And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God acknowledged them."
Exodus,3,1,"Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the desert, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God."
Exodus,3,2,"And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not consumed."
Exodus,3,3,"Then Moses said, “I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush does not burn.”"
Exodus,3,4,"So when the LORD saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.”"
Exodus,3,5,"Then He said, “Do not draw near this place. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.”"
Exodus,3,6,"Moreover He said, “I am the God of your father—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God."
Exodus,3,7,"And the LORD said: “I have surely seen the oppression of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows."
Exodus,3,8,"So I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites."
Exodus,3,9,"Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them."
Exodus,3,10,"Come now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,3,11,"But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?”"
Exodus,3,12,"So He said, “I will certainly be with you. And this shall be a sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.”"
Exodus,3,13,"Then Moses said to God, “Indeed, when I come to the children of Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they say to me, ‘What is His name?’ what shall I say to them?”"
Exodus,3,14,"And God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”"
Exodus,3,15,"Moreover God said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: ‘The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My name forever, and this is My memorial to all generations.’"
Exodus,3,16,"Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, ‘The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, “I have surely visited you and seen what is done to you in Egypt;"
Exodus,3,17,"and I have said I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’"
Exodus,3,18,"Then they will heed your voice; and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt; and you shall say to him, ‘The LORD God of the Hebrews has met with us; and now, please, let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.’"
Exodus,3,19,"But I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not even by a mighty hand."
Exodus,3,20,So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in its midst; and after that he will let you go.
Exodus,3,21,"And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and it shall be, when you go, that you shall not go empty-handed."
Exodus,3,22,"But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, namely, of her who dwells near her house, articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your sons and on your daughters. So you shall plunder the Egyptians.”"
Exodus,4,1,"Then Moses answered and said, “But suppose they will not believe me or listen to my voice; suppose they say, ‘The LORD has not appeared to you.’”"
Exodus,4,2,"So the LORD said to him, “What is that in your hand?” He said, “A rod.”"
Exodus,4,3,"And He said, “Cast it on the ground.” So he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it."
Exodus,4,4,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Reach out your hand and take it by the tail” (and he reached out his hand and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand),"
Exodus,4,5,"“that they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”"
Exodus,4,6,"Furthermore the LORD said to him, “Now put your hand in your bosom.” And he put his hand in his bosom, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, like snow."
Exodus,4,7,"And He said, “Put your hand in your bosom again.” So he put his hand in his bosom again, and drew it out of his bosom, and behold, it was restored like his other flesh."
Exodus,4,8,"“Then it will be, if they do not believe you, nor heed the message of the first sign, that they may believe the message of the latter sign."
Exodus,4,9,"And it shall be, if they do not believe even these two signs, or listen to your voice, that you shall take water from the river and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take from the river will become blood on the dry land.”"
Exodus,4,10,"Then Moses said to the LORD, “O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before nor since You have spoken to Your servant; but I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.”"
Exodus,4,11,"So the LORD said to him, “Who has made man’s mouth? Or who makes the mute, the deaf, the seeing, or the blind? Have not I, the LORD?"
Exodus,4,12,"Now therefore, go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall say.”"
Exodus,4,13,"But he said, “O my Lord, please send by the hand of whomever else You may send.”"
Exodus,4,14,"So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and He said: “Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he can speak well. And look, he is also coming out to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart."
Exodus,4,15,"Now you shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth. And I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you what you shall do."
Exodus,4,16,"So he shall be your spokesman to the people. And he himself shall be as a mouth for you, and you shall be to him as God."
Exodus,4,17,"And you shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.”"
Exodus,4,18,"So Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, “Please let me go and return to my brethren who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”"
Exodus,4,19,"Now the LORD said to Moses in Midian, “Go, return to Egypt; for all the men who sought your life are dead.”"
Exodus,4,20,"Then Moses took his wife and his sons and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand."
Exodus,4,21,"And the LORD said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you do all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in your hand. But I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go."
Exodus,4,22,"Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Israel is My son, My firstborn."
Exodus,4,23,"So I say to you, let My son go that he may serve Me. But if you refuse to let him go, indeed I will kill your son, your firstborn.”’”"
Exodus,4,24,"And it came to pass on the way, at the encampment, that the LORD met him and sought to kill him."
Exodus,4,25,"Then Zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at Moses’ feet, and said, “Surely you are a husband of blood to me!”"
Exodus,4,26,"So He let him go. Then she said, “You are a husband of blood!”—because of the circumcision."
Exodus,4,27,"And the LORD said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he went and met him on the mountain of God, and kissed him."
Exodus,4,28,"So Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which He had commanded him."
Exodus,4,29,Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.
Exodus,4,30,And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses. Then he did the signs in the sight of the people.
Exodus,4,31,"So the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel and that He had looked on their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped."
Exodus,5,1,"Afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘Let My people go, that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.’”"
Exodus,5,2,"And Pharaoh said, “Who is the LORD, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, nor will I let Israel go.”"
Exodus,5,3,"So they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go three days’ journey into the desert and sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest He fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.”"
Exodus,5,4,"Then the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people from their work? Get back to your labor.”"
Exodus,5,5,"And Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are many now, and you make them rest from their labor!”"
Exodus,5,6,"So the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,"
Exodus,5,7,“You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.
Exodus,5,8,"And you shall lay on them the quota of bricks which they made before. You shall not reduce it. For they are idle; therefore they cry out, saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’"
Exodus,5,9,"Let more work be laid on the men, that they may labor in it, and let them not regard false words.”"
Exodus,5,10,"And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out and spoke to the people, saying, “Thus says Pharaoh: ‘I will not give you straw."
Exodus,5,11,"Go, get yourselves straw where you can find it; yet none of your work will be reduced.’”"
Exodus,5,12,So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.
Exodus,5,13,"And the taskmasters forced them to hurry, saying, “Fulfill your work, your daily quota, as when there was straw.”"
Exodus,5,14,"Also the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, “Why have you not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today, as before?”"
Exodus,5,15,"Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, “Why are you dealing thus with your servants?"
Exodus,5,16,"There is no straw given to your servants, and they say to us, ‘Make brick!’ And indeed your servants are beaten, but the fault is in your own people.”"
Exodus,5,17,"But he said, “You are idle! Idle! Therefore you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.’"
Exodus,5,18,"Therefore go now and work; for no straw shall be given you, yet you shall deliver the quota of bricks.”"
Exodus,5,19,"And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble after it was said, “You shall not reduce any bricks from your daily quota.”"
Exodus,5,20,"Then, as they came out from Pharaoh, they met Moses and Aaron who stood there to meet them."
Exodus,5,21,"And they said to them, “Let the LORD look on you and judge, because you have made us abhorrent in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us.”"
Exodus,5,22,"So Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Lord, why have You brought trouble on this people? Why is it You have sent me?"
Exodus,5,23,"For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this people; neither have You delivered Your people at all.”"
Exodus,6,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh. For with a strong hand he will let them go, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land.”"
Exodus,6,2,And God spoke to Moses and said to him: “I am the LORD.
Exodus,6,3,"I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name LORD I was not known to them."
Exodus,6,4,"I have also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were strangers."
Exodus,6,5,"And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered My covenant."
Exodus,6,6,"Therefore say to the children of Israel: ‘I am the LORD; I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, I will rescue you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments."
Exodus,6,7,"I will take you as My people, and I will be your God. Then you shall know that I am the LORD your God who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians."
Exodus,6,8,"And I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to you as a heritage: I am the LORD.’”"
Exodus,6,9,"So Moses spoke thus to the children of Israel; but they did not heed Moses, because of anguish of spirit and cruel bondage."
Exodus,6,10,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Exodus,6,11,"“Go in, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the children of Israel go out of his land.”"
Exodus,6,12,"And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, “The children of Israel have not heeded me. How then shall Pharaoh heed me, for I am of uncircumcised lips?”"
Exodus,6,13,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, and gave them a command for the children of Israel and for Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt."
Exodus,6,14,"These are the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. These are the families of Reuben."
Exodus,6,15,"And the sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These are the families of Simeon."
Exodus,6,16,"These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were one hundred and thirty-seven."
Exodus,6,17,The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimi according to their families.
Exodus,6,18,"And the sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. And the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred and thirty-three."
Exodus,6,19,The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of Levi according to their generations.
Exodus,6,20,"Now Amram took for himself Jochebed, his father’s sister, as wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram were one hundred and thirty-seven."
Exodus,6,21,"The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri."
Exodus,6,22,"And the sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Zithri."
Exodus,6,23,"Aaron took to himself Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Nahshon, as wife; and she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
Exodus,6,24,"And the sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These are the families of the Korahites."
Exodus,6,25,"Eleazar, Aaron’s son, took for himself one of the daughters of Putiel as wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites according to their families."
Exodus,6,26,"These are the same Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, “Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.”"
Exodus,6,27,"These are the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt. These are the same Moses and Aaron."
Exodus,6,28,"And it came to pass, on the day the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,"
Exodus,6,29,"that the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, “I am the LORD. Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you.”"
Exodus,6,30,"But Moses said before the LORD, “Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh heed me?”"
Exodus,7,1,"So the LORD said to Moses: “See, I have made you as God to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet."
Exodus,7,2,You shall speak all that I command you. And Aaron your brother shall tell Pharaoh to send the children of Israel out of his land.
Exodus,7,3,"And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt."
Exodus,7,4,"But Pharaoh will not heed you, so that I may lay My hand on Egypt and bring My armies and My people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments."
Exodus,7,5,"And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out My hand on Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them.”"
Exodus,7,6,"Then Moses and Aaron did so; just as the LORD commanded them, so they did."
Exodus,7,7,And Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.
Exodus,7,8,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,"
Exodus,7,9,"“When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, ‘Show a miracle for yourselves,’ then you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and cast it before Pharaoh, and let it become a serpent.’”"
Exodus,7,10,"So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, just as the LORD commanded. And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent."
Exodus,7,11,"But Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers; so the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments."
Exodus,7,12,"For every man threw down his rod, and they became serpents. But Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods."
Exodus,7,13,"And Pharaoh’s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, as the LORD had said."
Exodus,7,14,So the LORD said to Moses: “Pharaoh’s heart is hard; he refuses to let the people go.
Exodus,7,15,"Go to Pharaoh in the morning, when he goes out to the water, and you shall stand by the river’s bank to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand."
Exodus,7,16,"And you shall say to him, ‘The LORD God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, “Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness”; but indeed, until now you would not hear!"
Exodus,7,17,"Thus says the LORD: “By this you shall know that I am the LORD. Behold, I will strike the waters which are in the river with the rod that is in my hand, and they shall be turned to blood."
Exodus,7,18,"And the fish that are in the river shall die, the river shall stink, and the Egyptians will loathe to drink the water of the river.”’”"
Exodus,7,19,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their streams, over their rivers, over their ponds, and over all their pools of water, that they may become blood. And there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in buckets of wood and pitchers of stone.’”"
Exodus,7,20,"And Moses and Aaron did so, just as the LORD commanded. So he lifted up the rod and struck the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants. And all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood."
Exodus,7,21,"The fish that were in the river died, the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river. So there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,7,22,"Then the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments; and Pharaoh’s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, as the LORD had said."
Exodus,7,23,And Pharaoh turned and went into his house. Neither was his heart moved by this.
Exodus,7,24,"So all the Egyptians dug all around the river for water to drink, because they could not drink the water of the river."
Exodus,7,25,And seven days passed after the LORD had struck the river.
Exodus,8,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,8,2,"But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all your territory with frogs."
Exodus,8,3,"So the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into your house, into your bedroom, on your bed, into the houses of your servants, on your people, into your ovens, and into your kneading bowls."
Exodus,8,4,"And the frogs shall come up on you, on your people, and on all your servants.”’”"
Exodus,8,5,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,8,6,"So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,7,"And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,8,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, “Entreat the LORD that He may take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to the LORD.”"
Exodus,8,9,"And Moses said to Pharaoh, “Accept the honor of saying when I shall intercede for you, for your servants, and for your people, to destroy the frogs from you and your houses, that they may remain in the river only.”"
Exodus,8,10,"So he said, “Tomorrow.” And he said, “Let it be according to your word, that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God."
Exodus,8,11,"And the frogs shall depart from you, from your houses, from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only.”"
Exodus,8,12,Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh. And Moses cried out to the LORD concerning the frogs which He had brought against Pharaoh.
Exodus,8,13,"So the LORD did according to the word of Moses. And the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courtyards, and out of the fields."
Exodus,8,14,"They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank."
Exodus,8,15,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not heed them, as the LORD had said."
Exodus,8,16,"So the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the land, so that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,8,17,"And they did so. For Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth, and it became lice on man and beast. All the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,18,"Now the magicians so worked with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not. So there were lice on man and beast."
Exodus,8,19,"Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, just as the LORD had said."
Exodus,8,20,"And the LORD said to Moses, “Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he comes out to the water. Then say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,8,21,"Or else, if you will not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and your servants, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they stand."
Exodus,8,22,"And in that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, in which My people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there, in order that you may know that I am the LORD in the midst of the land."
Exodus,8,23,I will make a difference between My people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall be.”’”
Exodus,8,24,"And the LORD did so. Thick swarms of flies came into the house of Pharaoh, into his servants’ houses, and into all the land of Egypt. The land was corrupted because of the swarms of flies."
Exodus,8,25,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.”"
Exodus,8,26,"And Moses said, “It is not right to do so, for we would be sacrificing the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God. If we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, then will they not stone us?"
Exodus,8,27,We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as He will command us.”
Exodus,8,28,"So Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Intercede for me.”"
Exodus,8,29,"Then Moses said, “Indeed I am going out from you, and I will entreat the LORD, that the swarms of flies may depart tomorrow from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. But let Pharaoh not deal deceitfully anymore in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.”"
Exodus,8,30,So Moses went out from Pharaoh and entreated the LORD.
Exodus,8,31,"And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. Not one remained."
Exodus,8,32,But Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also; neither would he let the people go.
Exodus,9,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh and tell him, ‘Thus says the LORD God of the Hebrews: “Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,9,2,"For if you refuse to let them go, and still hold them,"
Exodus,9,3,"behold, the hand of the LORD will be on your cattle in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the oxen, and on the sheep—a very severe pestilence."
Exodus,9,4,And the LORD will make a difference between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt. So nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel.”’”
Exodus,9,5,"Then the LORD appointed a set time, saying, “Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land.”"
Exodus,9,6,"So the LORD did this thing on the next day, and all the livestock of Egypt died; but of the livestock of the children of Israel, not one died."
Exodus,9,7,"Then Pharaoh sent, and indeed, not even one of the livestock of the Israelites was dead. But the heart of Pharaoh became hard, and he did not let the people go."
Exodus,9,8,"So the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Take for yourselves handfuls of ashes from a furnace, and let Moses scatter it toward the heavens in the sight of Pharaoh."
Exodus,9,9,"And it will become fine dust in all the land of Egypt, and it will cause boils that break out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,9,10,"Then they took ashes from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses scattered them toward heaven. And they caused boils that break out in sores on man and beast."
Exodus,9,11,"And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians."
Exodus,9,12,"But the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh; and he did not heed them, just as the LORD had spoken to Moses."
Exodus,9,13,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD God of the Hebrews: “Let My people go, that they may serve Me,"
Exodus,9,14,"for at this time I will send all My plagues to your very heart, and on your servants and on your people, that you may know that there is none like Me in all the earth."
Exodus,9,15,"Now if I had stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, then you would have been cut off from the earth."
Exodus,9,16,"But indeed for this purpose I have raised you up, that I may show My power in you, and that My name may be declared in all the earth."
Exodus,9,17,As yet you exalt yourself against My people in that you will not let them go.
Exodus,9,18,"Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause very heavy hail to rain down, such as has not been in Egypt since its founding until now."
Exodus,9,19,"Therefore send now and gather your livestock and all that you have in the field, for the hail shall come down on every man and every animal which is found in the field and is not brought home; and they shall die.”’”"
Exodus,9,20,He who feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his livestock flee to the houses.
Exodus,9,21,But he who did not regard the word of the LORD left his servants and his livestock in the field.
Exodus,9,22,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt—on man, on beast, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,9,23,"And Moses stretched out his rod toward heaven; and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire darted to the ground. And the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt."
Exodus,9,24,"So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, so very heavy that there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation."
Exodus,9,25,"And the hail struck throughout the whole land of Egypt, all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail struck every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field."
Exodus,9,26,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail."
Exodus,9,27,"And Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “I have sinned this time. The LORD is righteous, and my people and I are wicked."
Exodus,9,28,"Entreat the LORD, that there may be no more mighty thundering and hail, for it is enough. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.”"
Exodus,9,29,"So Moses said to him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to the LORD; the thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, that you may know that the earth is the LORD’s."
Exodus,9,30,"But as for you and your servants, I know that you will not yet fear the LORD God.”"
Exodus,9,31,"Now the flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was in the head and the flax was in bud."
Exodus,9,32,"But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they are late crops."
Exodus,9,33,"So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread out his hands to the LORD; then the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth."
Exodus,9,34,"And when Pharaoh saw that the rain, the hail, and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet more; and he hardened his heart, he and his servants."
Exodus,9,35,"So the heart of Pharaoh was hard; neither would he let the children of Israel go, as the LORD had spoken by Moses."
Exodus,10,1,"Now the LORD said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh; for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his servants, that I may show these signs of Mine before him,"
Exodus,10,2,"and that you may tell in the hearing of your son and your son’s son the mighty things I have done in Egypt, and My signs which I have done among them, that you may know that I am the LORD.”"
Exodus,10,3,"So Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh and said to him, “Thus says the LORD God of the Hebrews: ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,10,4,"Or else, if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory."
Exodus,10,5,"And they shall cover the face of the earth, so that no one will be able to see the earth; and they shall eat the residue of what is left, which remains to you from the hail, and they shall eat every tree which grows up for you out of the field."
Exodus,10,6,"They shall fill your houses, the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians—which neither your fathers nor your fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.’” And he turned and went out from Pharaoh."
Exodus,10,7,"Then Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt is destroyed?”"
Exodus,10,8,"So Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go, serve the LORD your God. Who are the ones that are going?”"
Exodus,10,9,"And Moses said, “We will go with our young and our old; with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds we will go, for we must hold a feast to the LORD.”"
Exodus,10,10,"Then he said to them, “The LORD had better be with you when I let you and your little ones go! Beware, for evil is ahead of you."
Exodus,10,11,"Not so! Go now, you who are men, and serve the LORD, for that is what you desired.” And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence."
Exodus,10,12,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land—all that the hail has left.”"
Exodus,10,13,"So Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind on the land all that day and all that night. When it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts."
Exodus,10,14,"And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and rested on all the territory of Egypt. They were very severe; previously there had been no such locusts as they, nor shall there be such after them."
Exodus,10,15,"For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. So there remained nothing green on the trees or on the plants of the field throughout all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,10,16,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and said, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you."
Exodus,10,17,"Now therefore, please forgive my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God, that He may take away from me this death only.”"
Exodus,10,18,So he went out from Pharaoh and entreated the LORD.
Exodus,10,19,"And the LORD turned a very strong west wind, which took the locusts away and blew them into the Red Sea. There remained not one locust in all the territory of Egypt."
Exodus,10,20,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go."
Exodus,10,21,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, darkness which may even be felt.”"
Exodus,10,22,"So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days."
Exodus,10,23,They did not see one another; nor did anyone rise from his place for three days. But all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
Exodus,10,24,"Then Pharaoh called to Moses and said, “Go, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be kept back. Let your little ones also go with you.”"
Exodus,10,25,"But Moses said, “You must also give us sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God."
Exodus,10,26,"Our livestock also shall go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind. For we must take some of them to serve the LORD our God, and even we do not know with what we must serve the LORD until we arrive there.”"
Exodus,10,27,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go."
Exodus,10,28,"Then Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Take heed to yourself and see my face no more! For in the day you see my face you shall die!”"
Exodus,10,29,"So Moses said, “You have spoken well. I will never see your face again.”"
Exodus,11,1,"And the LORD said to Moses, “I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. Afterward he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will surely drive you out of here altogether."
Exodus,11,2,"Speak now in the hearing of the people, and let every man ask from his neighbor and every woman from her neighbor, articles of silver and articles of gold.”"
Exodus,11,3,"And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants and in the sight of the people."
Exodus,11,4,"Then Moses said, “Thus says the LORD: ‘About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt;"
Exodus,11,5,"and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the handmill, and all the firstborn of the animals."
Exodus,11,6,"Then there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as was not like it before, nor shall be like it again."
Exodus,11,7,"But against none of the children of Israel shall a dog move its tongue, against man or beast, that you may know that the LORD does make a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.’"
Exodus,11,8,"And all these your servants shall come down to me and bow down to me, saying, ‘Get out, and all the people who follow you!’ After that I will go out.” Then he went out from Pharaoh in great anger."
Exodus,11,9,"But the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not heed you, so that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,11,10,"So Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land."
Exodus,12,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,"
Exodus,12,2,“This month shall be your beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you.
Exodus,12,3,"Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying: ‘On the tenth of this month every man shall take for himself a lamb, according to the house of his father, a lamb for a household."
Exodus,12,4,"And if the household is too small for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next to his house take it according to the number of the persons; according to each man’s need you shall make your count for the lamb."
Exodus,12,5,"Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats."
Exodus,12,6,Now you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month. Then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at twilight.
Exodus,12,7,And they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses where they eat it.
Exodus,12,8,"Then they shall eat the flesh on that night; roasted in fire, with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it."
Exodus,12,9,"Do not eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted in fire—its head with its legs and its entrails."
Exodus,12,10,"You shall let none of it remain until morning, and what remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire."
Exodus,12,11,"And thus you shall eat it: with a belt on your waist, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. So you shall eat it in haste. It is the LORD’s Passover."
Exodus,12,12,"‘For I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD."
Exodus,12,13,"Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt."
Exodus,12,14,‘So this day shall be to you a memorial; and you shall keep it as a feast to the LORD throughout your generations. You shall keep it as a feast by an everlasting ordinance.
Exodus,12,15,"Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses. For whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel."
Exodus,12,16,"On the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and on the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation for you. No manner of work shall be done on them; but that which everyone must eat—that only may be prepared by you."
Exodus,12,17,"So you shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this same day I will have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as an everlasting ordinance."
Exodus,12,18,"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at evening."
Exodus,12,19,"For seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses, since whoever eats what is leavened, that same person shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a stranger or a native of the land."
Exodus,12,20,You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.’”
Exodus,12,21,"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Pick out and take lambs for yourselves according to your families, and kill the Passover lamb."
Exodus,12,22,"And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin. And none of you shall go out of the door of his house until morning."
Exodus,12,23,"For the LORD will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to strike you."
Exodus,12,24,And you shall observe this thing as an ordinance for you and your sons forever.
Exodus,12,25,"It will come to pass when you come to the land which the LORD will give you, just as He promised, that you shall keep this service."
Exodus,12,26,"And it shall be, when your children say to you, ‘What do you mean by this service?’"
Exodus,12,27,"that you shall say, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice of the LORD, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians and delivered our households.’” So the people bowed their heads and worshiped."
Exodus,12,28,"Then the children of Israel went away and did so; just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did."
Exodus,12,29,"And it came to pass at midnight that the LORD struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of livestock."
Exodus,12,30,"So Pharaoh rose in the night, he, all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead."
Exodus,12,31,"Then he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, “Rise, go out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel. And go, serve the LORD as you have said."
Exodus,12,32,"Also take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also.”"
Exodus,12,33,"And the Egyptians urged the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste. For they said, “We shall all be dead.”"
Exodus,12,34,"So the people took their dough before it was leavened, having their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes on their shoulders."
Exodus,12,35,"Now the children of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, and they had asked from the Egyptians articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing."
Exodus,12,36,"And the LORD had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they granted them what they requested. Thus they plundered the Egyptians."
Exodus,12,37,"Then the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children."
Exodus,12,38,"A mixed multitude went up with them also, and flocks and herds—a great deal of livestock."
Exodus,12,39,"And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they had brought out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because they were driven out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared provisions for themselves."
Exodus,12,40,Now the sojourn of the children of Israel who lived in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
Exodus,12,41,And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years—on that very same day—it came to pass that all the armies of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
Exodus,12,42,"It is a night of solemn observance to the LORD for bringing them out of the land of Egypt. This is that night of the LORD, a solemn observance for all the children of Israel throughout their generations."
Exodus,12,43,"And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover: No foreigner shall eat it."
Exodus,12,44,"But every man’s servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then he may eat it."
Exodus,12,45,A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat it.
Exodus,12,46,"In one house it shall be eaten; you shall not carry any of the flesh outside the house, nor shall you break one of its bones."
Exodus,12,47,All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
Exodus,12,48,"And when a stranger dwells with you and wants to keep the Passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as a native of the land. For no uncircumcised person shall eat it."
Exodus,12,49,One law shall be for the native-born and for the stranger who dwells among you.”
Exodus,12,50,"Thus all the children of Israel did; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did."
Exodus,12,51,"And it came to pass, on that very same day, that the LORD brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt according to their armies."
Exodus,13,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Exodus,13,2,"“Consecrate to Me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and beast; it is Mine.”"
Exodus,13,3,"And Moses said to the people: “Remember this day in which you went out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out of this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten."
Exodus,13,4,"On this day you are going out, in the month Abib."
Exodus,13,5,"And it shall be, when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month."
Exodus,13,6,"Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD."
Exodus,13,7,"Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days. And no leavened bread shall be seen among you, nor shall leaven be seen among you in all your quarters."
Exodus,13,8,"And you shall tell your son in that day, saying, ‘This is done because of what the LORD did for me when I came up from Egypt.’"
Exodus,13,9,"It shall be as a sign to you on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the LORD’s law may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand the LORD has brought you out of Egypt."
Exodus,13,10,You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
Exodus,13,11,"“And it shall be, when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to you and your fathers, and gives it to you,"
Exodus,13,12,"that you shall set apart to the LORD all that open the womb, that is, every firstborn that comes from an animal which you have; the males shall be the LORD’s."
Exodus,13,13,"But every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. And all the firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem."
Exodus,13,14,"So it shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ that you shall say to him, ‘By strength of hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
Exodus,13,15,"And it came to pass, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that the LORD killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast. Therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all males that open the womb, but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’"
Exodus,13,16,"It shall be as a sign on your hand and as frontlets between your eyes, for by strength of hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,13,17,"Then it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, “Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and return to Egypt.”"
Exodus,13,18,So God led the people around by way of the wilderness of the Red Sea. And the children of Israel went up in orderly ranks out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus,13,19,"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had placed the children of Israel under solemn oath, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here with you.”"
Exodus,13,20,So they took their journey from Succoth and camped in Etham at the edge of the wilderness.
Exodus,13,21,"And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so as to go by day and night."
Exodus,13,22,He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day or the pillar of fire by night from before the people.
Exodus,14,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Exodus,14,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn and camp before Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baal Zephon; you shall camp before it by the sea."
Exodus,14,3,"For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, ‘They are bewildered by the land; the wilderness has closed them in.’"
Exodus,14,4,"Then I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, so that he will pursue them; and I will gain honor over Pharaoh and over all his army, that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD.” And they did so."
Exodus,14,5,"Now it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled, and the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned against the people; and they said, “Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?”"
Exodus,14,6,So he made ready his chariot and took his people with him.
Exodus,14,7,"Also, he took six hundred choice chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt with captains over every one of them."
Exodus,14,8,"And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel; and the children of Israel went out with boldness."
Exodus,14,9,"So the Egyptians pursued them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and overtook them camping by the sea beside Pi Hahiroth, before Baal Zephon."
Exodus,14,10,"And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them. So they were very afraid, and the children of Israel cried out to the LORD."
Exodus,14,11,"Then they said to Moses, “Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you so dealt with us, to bring us up out of Egypt?"
Exodus,14,12,"Is this not the word that we told you in Egypt, saying, ‘Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness.”"
Exodus,14,13,"And Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which He will accomplish for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall see again no more forever."
Exodus,14,14,"The LORD will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.”"
Exodus,14,15,"And the LORD said to Moses, “Why do you cry to Me? Tell the children of Israel to go forward."
Exodus,14,16,"But lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it. And the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea."
Exodus,14,17,"And I indeed will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them. So I will gain honor over Pharaoh and over all his army, his chariots, and his horsemen."
Exodus,14,18,"Then the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gained honor for Myself over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”"
Exodus,14,19,"And the Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud went from before them and stood behind them."
Exodus,14,20,"So it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. Thus it was a cloud and darkness to the one, and it gave light by night to the other, so that the one did not come near the other all that night."
Exodus,14,21,"Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea into dry land, and the waters were divided."
Exodus,14,22,"So the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left."
Exodus,14,23,"And the Egyptians pursued and went after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen."
Exodus,14,24,"Now it came to pass, in the morning watch, that the LORD looked down upon the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud, and He troubled the army of the Egyptians."
Exodus,14,25,"And He took off their chariot wheels, so that they drove them with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, “Let us flee from the face of Israel, for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.”"
Exodus,14,26,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.”"
Exodus,14,27,"And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and when the morning appeared, the sea returned to its full depth, while the Egyptians were fleeing into it. So the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea."
Exodus,14,28,"Then the waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen, and all the army of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them. Not so much as one of them remained."
Exodus,14,29,"But the children of Israel had walked on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left."
Exodus,14,30,"So the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore."
Exodus,14,31,"Thus Israel saw the great work which the LORD had done in Egypt; so the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD and His servant Moses."
Exodus,15,1,"Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying: “I will sing to the LORD, For He has triumphed gloriously! The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea!"
Exodus,15,2,"The LORD is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation; He is my God, and I will praise Him; My father’s God, and I will exalt Him."
Exodus,15,3,The LORD is a man of war; The LORD is His name.
Exodus,15,4,Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He has cast into the sea; His chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea.
Exodus,15,5,The depths have covered them; They sank to the bottom like a stone.
Exodus,15,6,"“Your right hand, O LORD, has become glorious in power; Your right hand, O LORD, has dashed the enemy in pieces."
Exodus,15,7,And in the greatness of Your excellence You have overthrown those who rose against You; You sent forth Your wrath; It consumed them like stubble.
Exodus,15,8,And with the blast of Your nostrils The waters were gathered together; The floods stood upright like a heap; The depths congealed in the heart of the sea.
Exodus,15,9,"The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; My desire shall be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, My hand shall destroy them.’"
Exodus,15,10,"You blew with Your wind, The sea covered them; They sank like lead in the mighty waters."
Exodus,15,11,"“Who is like You, O LORD, among the gods? Who is like You, glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises, doing wonders?"
Exodus,15,12,You stretched out Your right hand; The earth swallowed them.
Exodus,15,13,You in Your mercy have led forth The people whom You have redeemed; You have guided them in Your strength To Your holy habitation.
Exodus,15,14,“The people will hear and be afraid; Sorrow will take hold of the inhabitants of Philistia.
Exodus,15,15,"Then the chiefs of Edom will be dismayed; The mighty men of Moab, Trembling will take hold of them; All the inhabitants of Canaan will melt away."
Exodus,15,16,"Fear and dread will fall on them; By the greatness of Your arm They will be as still as a stone, Till Your people pass over, O LORD, Till the people pass over Whom You have purchased."
Exodus,15,17,"You will bring them in and plant them In the mountain of Your inheritance, In the place, O LORD, which You have made For Your own dwelling, The sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established."
Exodus,15,18,“The LORD shall reign forever and ever.”
Exodus,15,19,"For the horses of Pharaoh went with his chariots and his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought back the waters of the sea upon them. But the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea."
Exodus,15,20,"Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances."
Exodus,15,21,"And Miriam answered them: “Sing to the LORD, For He has triumphed gloriously! The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea!”"
Exodus,15,22,So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea; then they went out into the Wilderness of Shur. And they went three days in the wilderness and found no water.
Exodus,15,23,"Now when they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Marah."
Exodus,15,24,"And the people complained against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?”"
Exodus,15,25,"So he cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a tree. When he cast it into the waters, the waters were made sweet. There He made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there He tested them,"
Exodus,15,26,"and said, “If you diligently heed the voice of the LORD your God and do what is right in His sight, give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have brought on the Egyptians. For I am the LORD who heals you.”"
Exodus,15,27,"Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees; so they camped there by the waters."
Exodus,16,1,"And they journeyed from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they departed from the land of Egypt."
Exodus,16,2,Then the whole congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
Exodus,16,3,"And the children of Israel said to them, “Oh, that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat and when we ate bread to the full! For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”"
Exodus,16,4,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain quota every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not."
Exodus,16,5,"And it shall be on the sixth day that they shall prepare what they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.”"
Exodus,16,6,"Then Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, “At evening you shall know that the LORD has brought you out of the land of Egypt."
Exodus,16,7,"And in the morning you shall see the glory of the LORD; for He hears your complaints against the LORD. But what are we, that you complain against us?”"
Exodus,16,8,"Also Moses said, “This shall be seen when the LORD gives you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to the full; for the LORD hears your complaints which you make against Him. And what are we? Your complaints are not against us but against the LORD.”"
Exodus,16,9,"Then Moses spoke to Aaron, “Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, ‘Come near before the LORD, for He has heard your complaints.’”"
Exodus,16,10,"Now it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud."
Exodus,16,11,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Exodus,16,12,"“I have heard the complaints of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, ‘At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. And you shall know that I am the LORD your God.’”"
Exodus,16,13,"So it was that quails came up at evening and covered the camp, and in the morning the dew lay all around the camp."
Exodus,16,14,"And when the layer of dew lifted, there, on the surface of the wilderness, was a small round substance, as fine as frost on the ground."
Exodus,16,15,"So when the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, “This is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat."
Exodus,16,16,"This is the thing which the LORD has commanded: ‘Let every man gather it according to each one’s need, one omer for each person, according to the number of persons; let every man take for those who are in his tent.’”"
Exodus,16,17,"Then the children of Israel did so and gathered, some more, some less."
Exodus,16,18,"So when they measured it by omers, he who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack. Every man had gathered according to each one’s need."
Exodus,16,19,"And Moses said, “Let no one leave any of it till morning.”"
Exodus,16,20,"Notwithstanding they did not heed Moses. But some of them left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them."
Exodus,16,21,"So they gathered it every morning, every man according to his need. And when the sun became hot, it melted."
Exodus,16,22,"And so it was, on the sixth day, that they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses."
Exodus,16,23,"Then he said to them, “This is what the LORD has said: ‘Tomorrow is a Sabbath rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. Bake what you will bake today, and boil what you will boil; and lay up for yourselves all that remains, to be kept until morning.’”"
Exodus,16,24,"So they laid it up till morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not stink, nor were there any worms in it."
Exodus,16,25,"Then Moses said, “Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field."
Exodus,16,26,"Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none.”"
Exodus,16,27,"Now it happened that some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, but they found none."
Exodus,16,28,"And the LORD said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?"
Exodus,16,29,See! For the LORD has given you the Sabbath; therefore He gives you on the sixth day bread for two days. Let every man remain in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.”
Exodus,16,30,So the people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus,16,31,"And the house of Israel called its name Manna. And it was like white coriander seed, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey."
Exodus,16,32,"Then Moses said, “This is the thing which the LORD has commanded: ‘Fill an omer with it, to be kept for your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,16,33,"And Moses said to Aaron, “Take a pot and put an omer of manna in it, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.”"
Exodus,16,34,"As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept."
Exodus,16,35,"And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land; they ate manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan."
Exodus,16,36,Now an omer is one-tenth of an ephah.
Exodus,17,1,"Then all the congregation of the children of Israel set out on their journey from the Wilderness of Sin, according to the commandment of the LORD, and camped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink."
Exodus,17,2,"Therefore the people contended with Moses, and said, “Give us water, that we may drink.” So Moses said to them, “Why do you contend with me? Why do you tempt the LORD?”"
Exodus,17,3,"And the people thirsted there for water, and the people complained against Moses, and said, “Why is it you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?”"
Exodus,17,4,"So Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me!”"
Exodus,17,5,"And the LORD said to Moses, “Go on before the people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel. Also take in your hand your rod with which you struck the river, and go."
Exodus,17,6,"Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.” And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel."
Exodus,17,7,"So he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the contention of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”"
Exodus,17,8,Now Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
Exodus,17,9,"And Moses said to Joshua, “Choose us some men and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.”"
Exodus,17,10,"So Joshua did as Moses said to him, and fought with Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill."
Exodus,17,11,"And so it was, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed."
Exodus,17,12,"But Moses’ hands became heavy; so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. And Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun."
Exodus,17,13,So Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
Exodus,17,14,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this for a memorial in the book and recount it in the hearing of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.”"
Exodus,17,15,"And Moses built an altar and called its name, The-LORD-Is-My-Banner;"
Exodus,17,16,"for he said, “Because the LORD has sworn: the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.”"
Exodus,18,1,"And Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people—that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt."
Exodus,18,2,"Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her back,"
Exodus,18,3,"with her two sons, of whom the name of one was Gershom (for he said, “I have been a stranger in a foreign land”)"
Exodus,18,4,"and the name of the other was Eliezer (for he said, “The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh”);"
Exodus,18,5,"and Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness, where he was encamped at the mountain of God."
Exodus,18,6,"Now he had said to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her.”"
Exodus,18,7,"So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down, and kissed him. And they asked each other about their well-being, and they went into the tent."
Exodus,18,8,"And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardship that had come upon them on the way, and how the LORD had delivered them."
Exodus,18,9,"Then Jethro rejoiced for all the good which the LORD had done for Israel, whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians."
Exodus,18,10,"And Jethro said, “Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians."
Exodus,18,11,"Now I know that the LORD is greater than all the gods; for in the very thing in which they behaved proudly, He was above them.”"
Exodus,18,12,"Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and other sacrifices to offer to God. And Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God."
Exodus,18,13,"And so it was, on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people; and the people stood before Moses from morning until evening."
Exodus,18,14,"So when Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did for the people, he said, “What is this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit, and all the people stand before you from morning until evening?”"
Exodus,18,15,"And Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God."
Exodus,18,16,"When they have a difficulty, they come to me, and I judge between one and another; and I make known the statutes of God and His laws.”"
Exodus,18,17,"So Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you do is not good."
Exodus,18,18,Both you and these people who are with you will surely wear yourselves out. For this thing is too much for you; you are not able to perform it by yourself.
Exodus,18,19,"Listen now to my voice; I will give you counsel, and God will be with you: Stand before God for the people, so that you may bring the difficulties to God."
Exodus,18,20,"And you shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and show them the way in which they must walk and the work they must do."
Exodus,18,21,"Moreover you shall select from all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
Exodus,18,22,"And let them judge the people at all times. Then it will be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they themselves shall judge. So it will be easier for you, for they will bear the burden with you."
Exodus,18,23,"If you do this thing, and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all this people will also go to their place in peace.”"
Exodus,18,24,So Moses heeded the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
Exodus,18,25,"And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people: rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
Exodus,18,26,"So they judged the people at all times; the hard cases they brought to Moses, but they judged every small case themselves."
Exodus,18,27,"Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way to his own land."
Exodus,19,1,"In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai."
Exodus,19,2,"For they had departed from Rephidim, had come to the Wilderness of Sinai, and camped in the wilderness. So Israel camped there before the mountain."
Exodus,19,3,"And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, “Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:"
Exodus,19,4,"‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Myself."
Exodus,19,5,"Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine."
Exodus,19,6,And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.”
Exodus,19,7,"So Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before them all these words which the LORD commanded him."
Exodus,19,8,"Then all the people answered together and said, “All that the LORD has spoken we will do.” So Moses brought back the words of the people to the LORD."
Exodus,19,9,"And the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I come to you in the thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you forever.” So Moses told the words of the people to the LORD."
Exodus,19,10,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes."
Exodus,19,11,And let them be ready for the third day. For on the third day the LORD will come down upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
Exodus,19,12,"You shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, ‘Take heed to yourselves that you do not go up to the mountain or touch its base. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death."
Exodus,19,13,"Not a hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot with an arrow; whether man or beast, he shall not live.’ When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come near the mountain.”"
Exodus,19,14,"So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes."
Exodus,19,15,"And he said to the people, “Be ready for the third day; do not come near your wives.”"
Exodus,19,16,"Then it came to pass on the third day, in the morning, that there were thunderings and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain; and the sound of the trumpet was very loud, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled."
Exodus,19,17,"And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain."
Exodus,19,18,"Now Mount Sinai was completely in smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire. Its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly."
Exodus,19,19,"And when the blast of the trumpet sounded long and became louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by voice."
Exodus,19,20,"Then the LORD came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain. And the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up."
Exodus,19,21,"And the LORD said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to gaze at the LORD, and many of them perish."
Exodus,19,22,"Also let the priests who come near the LORD consecrate themselves, lest the LORD break out against them.”"
Exodus,19,23,"But Moses said to the LORD, “The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai; for You warned us, saying, ‘Set bounds around the mountain and consecrate it.’”"
Exodus,19,24,"Then the LORD said to him, “Away! Get down and then come up, you and Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest He break out against them.”"
Exodus,19,25,So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.
Exodus,20,1,"And God spoke all these words, saying:"
Exodus,20,2,"“I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
Exodus,20,3,“You shall have no other gods before Me.
Exodus,20,4,"“You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth;"
Exodus,20,5,"you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,"
Exodus,20,6,"but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments."
Exodus,20,7,"“You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain."
Exodus,20,8,"“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."
Exodus,20,9,"Six days you shall labor and do all your work,"
Exodus,20,10,"but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates."
Exodus,20,11,"For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it."
Exodus,20,12,"“Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the LORD your God is giving you."
Exodus,20,13,“You shall not murder.
Exodus,20,14,“You shall not commit adultery.
Exodus,20,15,“You shall not steal.
Exodus,20,16,“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
Exodus,20,17,"“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor’s.”"
Exodus,20,18,"Now all the people witnessed the thunderings, the lightning flashes, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they trembled and stood afar off."
Exodus,20,19,"Then they said to Moses, “You speak with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.”"
Exodus,20,20,"And Moses said to the people, “Do not fear; for God has come to test you, and that His fear may be before you, so that you may not sin.”"
Exodus,20,21,"So the people stood afar off, but Moses drew near the thick darkness where God was."
Exodus,20,22,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: ‘You have seen that I have talked with you from heaven."
Exodus,20,23,You shall not make anything to be with Me—gods of silver or gods of gold you shall not make for yourselves.
Exodus,20,24,"An altar of earth you shall make for Me, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I record My name I will come to you, and I will bless you."
Exodus,20,25,"And if you make Me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone; for if you use your tool on it, you have profaned it."
Exodus,20,26,"Nor shall you go up by steps to My altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed on it.’"
Exodus,21,1,“Now these are the judgments which you shall set before them:
Exodus,21,2,"If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years; and in the seventh he shall go out free and pay nothing."
Exodus,21,3,"If he comes in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him."
Exodus,21,4,"If his master has given him a wife, and she has borne him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself."
Exodus,21,5,"But if the servant plainly says, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,’"
Exodus,21,6,"then his master shall bring him to the judges. He shall also bring him to the door, or to the doorpost, and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him forever."
Exodus,21,7,"“And if a man sells his daughter to be a female slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do."
Exodus,21,8,"If she does not please her master, who has betrothed her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has dealt deceitfully with her."
Exodus,21,9,"And if he has betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her according to the custom of daughters."
Exodus,21,10,"If he takes another wife, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, and her marriage rights."
Exodus,21,11,"And if he does not do these three for her, then she shall go out free, without paying money."
Exodus,21,12,“He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death.
Exodus,21,13,"However, if he did not lie in wait, but God delivered him into his hand, then I will appoint for you a place where he may flee."
Exodus,21,14,"“But if a man acts with premeditation against his neighbor, to kill him by treachery, you shall take him from My altar, that he may die."
Exodus,21,15,“And he who strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
Exodus,21,16,"“He who kidnaps a man and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, shall surely be put to death."
Exodus,21,17,“And he who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
Exodus,21,18,"“If men contend with each other, and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist, and he does not die but is confined to his bed,"
Exodus,21,19,"if he rises again and walks about outside with his staff, then he who struck him shall be acquitted. He shall only pay for the loss of his time, and shall provide for him to be thoroughly healed."
Exodus,21,20,"“And if a man beats his male or female servant with a rod, so that he dies under his hand, he shall surely be punished."
Exodus,21,21,"Notwithstanding, if he remains alive a day or two, he shall not be punished; for he is his property."
Exodus,21,22,"“If men fight, and hurt a woman with child, so that she gives birth prematurely, yet no harm follows, he shall surely be punished accordingly as the woman’s husband imposes on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine."
Exodus,21,23,"But if any harm follows, then you shall give life for life,"
Exodus,21,24,"eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,"
Exodus,21,25,"burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe."
Exodus,21,26,"“If a man strikes the eye of his male or female servant, and destroys it, he shall let him go free for the sake of his eye."
Exodus,21,27,"And if he knocks out the tooth of his male or female servant, he shall let him go free for the sake of his tooth."
Exodus,21,28,"“If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, then the ox shall surely be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be acquitted."
Exodus,21,29,"But if the ox tended to thrust with its horn in times past, and it has been made known to his owner, and he has not kept it confined, so that it has killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death."
Exodus,21,30,"If there is imposed on him a sum of money, then he shall pay to redeem his life, whatever is imposed on him."
Exodus,21,31,"Whether it has gored a son or gored a daughter, according to this judgment it shall be done to him."
Exodus,21,32,"If the ox gores a male or female servant, he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned."
Exodus,21,33,"“And if a man opens a pit, or if a man digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls in it,"
Exodus,21,34,"the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money to their owner, but the dead animal shall be his."
Exodus,21,35,"“If one man’s ox hurts another’s, so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and divide the money from it; and the dead ox they shall also divide."
Exodus,21,36,"Or if it was known that the ox tended to thrust in time past, and its owner has not kept it confined, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead animal shall be his own."
Exodus,22,1,"“If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and slaughters it or sells it, he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep."
Exodus,22,2,"If the thief is found breaking in, and he is struck so that he dies, there shall be no guilt for his bloodshed."
Exodus,22,3,"If the sun has risen on him, there shall be guilt for his bloodshed. He should make full restitution; if he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft."
Exodus,22,4,"If the theft is certainly found alive in his hand, whether it is an ox or donkey or sheep, he shall restore double."
Exodus,22,5,"“If a man causes a field or vineyard to be grazed, and lets loose his animal, and it feeds in another man’s field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard."
Exodus,22,6,"“If fire breaks out and catches in thorns, so that stacked grain, standing grain, or the field is consumed, he who kindled the fire shall surely make restitution."
Exodus,22,7,"“If a man delivers to his neighbor money or articles to keep, and it is stolen out of the man’s house, if the thief is found, he shall pay double."
Exodus,22,8,"If the thief is not found, then the master of the house shall be brought to the judges to see whether he has put his hand into his neighbor’s goods."
Exodus,22,9,"“For any kind of trespass, whether it concerns an ox, a donkey, a sheep, or clothing, or for any kind of lost thing which another claims to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whomever the judges condemn shall pay double to his neighbor."
Exodus,22,10,"If a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep, and it dies, is hurt, or driven away, no one seeing it,"
Exodus,22,11,"then an oath of the LORD shall be between them both, that he has not put his hand into his neighbor’s goods; and the owner of it shall accept that, and he shall not make it good."
Exodus,22,12,"But if, in fact, it is stolen from him, he shall make restitution to the owner of it."
Exodus,22,13,"If it is torn to pieces by a beast, then he shall bring it as evidence, and he shall not make good what was torn."
Exodus,22,14,"“And if a man borrows anything from his neighbor, and it becomes injured or dies, the owner of it not being with it, he shall surely make it good."
Exodus,22,15,"If its owner was with it, he shall not make it good; if it was hired, it came for its hire."
Exodus,22,16,"“If a man entices a virgin who is not betrothed, and lies with her, he shall surely pay the bride-price for her to be his wife."
Exodus,22,17,"If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the bride-price of virgins."
Exodus,22,18,“You shall not permit a sorceress to live.
Exodus,22,19,“Whoever lies with an animal shall surely be put to death.
Exodus,22,20,"“He who sacrifices to any god, except to the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed."
Exodus,22,21,"“You shall neither mistreat a stranger nor oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt."
Exodus,22,22,“You shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child.
Exodus,22,23,"If you afflict them in any way, and they cry at all to Me, I will surely hear their cry;"
Exodus,22,24,"and My wrath will become hot, and I will kill you with the sword; your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless."
Exodus,22,25,"“If you lend money to any of My people who are poor among you, you shall not be like a moneylender to him; you shall not charge him interest."
Exodus,22,26,"If you ever take your neighbor’s garment as a pledge, you shall return it to him before the sun goes down."
Exodus,22,27,"For that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin. What will he sleep in? And it will be that when he cries to Me, I will hear, for I am gracious."
Exodus,22,28,"“You shall not revile God, nor curse a ruler of your people."
Exodus,22,29,“You shall not delay to offer the first of your ripe produce and your juices. The firstborn of your sons you shall give to Me.
Exodus,22,30,Likewise you shall do with your oxen and your sheep. It shall be with its mother seven days; on the eighth day you shall give it to Me.
Exodus,22,31,“And you shall be holy men to Me: you shall not eat meat torn by beasts in the field; you shall throw it to the dogs.
Exodus,23,1,“You shall not circulate a false report. Do not put your hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.
Exodus,23,2,You shall not follow a crowd to do evil; nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to turn aside after many to pervert justice.
Exodus,23,3,You shall not show partiality to a poor man in his dispute.
Exodus,23,4,"“If you meet your enemy’s ox or his donkey going astray, you shall surely bring it back to him again."
Exodus,23,5,"If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying under its burden, and you would refrain from helping it, you shall surely help him with it."
Exodus,23,6,“You shall not pervert the judgment of your poor in his dispute.
Exodus,23,7,Keep yourself far from a false matter; do not kill the innocent and righteous. For I will not justify the wicked.
Exodus,23,8,"And you shall take no bribe, for a bribe blinds the discerning and perverts the words of the righteous."
Exodus,23,9,"“Also you shall not oppress a stranger, for you know the heart of a stranger, because you were strangers in the land of Egypt."
Exodus,23,10,"“Six years you shall sow your land and gather in its produce,"
Exodus,23,11,"but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave, the beasts of the field may eat. In like manner you shall do with your vineyard and your olive grove."
Exodus,23,12,"Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest, that your ox and your donkey may rest, and the son of your female servant and the stranger may be refreshed."
Exodus,23,13,"“And in all that I have said to you, be circumspect and make no mention of the name of other gods, nor let it be heard from your mouth."
Exodus,23,14,“Three times you shall keep a feast to Me in the year:
Exodus,23,15,"You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread (you shall eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month of Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt; none shall appear before Me empty);"
Exodus,23,16,"and the Feast of Harvest, the firstfruits of your labors which you have sown in the field; and the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you have gathered in the fruit of your labors from the field."
Exodus,23,17,“Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord GOD.
Exodus,23,18,“You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; nor shall the fat of My sacrifice remain until morning.
Exodus,23,19,The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring into the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.
Exodus,23,20,"“Behold, I send an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared."
Exodus,23,21,"Beware of Him and obey His voice; do not provoke Him, for He will not pardon your transgressions; for My name is in Him."
Exodus,23,22,"But if you indeed obey His voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries."
Exodus,23,23,For My Angel will go before you and bring you in to the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Canaanites and the Hivites and the Jebusites; and I will cut them off.
Exodus,23,24,"You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their works; but you shall utterly overthrow them and completely break down their sacred pillars."
Exodus,23,25,"“So you shall serve the LORD your God, and He will bless your bread and your water. And I will take sickness away from the midst of you."
Exodus,23,26,No one shall suffer miscarriage or be barren in your land; I will fulfill the number of your days.
Exodus,23,27,"“I will send My fear before you, I will cause confusion among all the people to whom you come, and will make all your enemies turn their backs to you."
Exodus,23,28,"And I will send hornets before you, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before you."
Exodus,23,29,"I will not drive them out from before you in one year, lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field become too numerous for you."
Exodus,23,30,"Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you have increased, and you inherit the land."
Exodus,23,31,"And I will set your bounds from the Red Sea to the sea, Philistia, and from the desert to the River. For I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you."
Exodus,23,32,"You shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods."
Exodus,23,33,"They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against Me. For if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.”"
Exodus,24,1,"Now He said to Moses, “Come up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship from afar."
Exodus,24,2,"And Moses alone shall come near the LORD, but they shall not come near; nor shall the people go up with him.”"
Exodus,24,3,"So Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD and all the judgments. And all the people answered with one voice and said, “All the words which the LORD has said we will do.”"
Exodus,24,4,"And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD. And he rose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of Israel."
Exodus,24,5,"Then he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the LORD."
Exodus,24,6,"And Moses took half the blood and put it in basins, and half the blood he sprinkled on the altar."
Exodus,24,7,"Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read in the hearing of the people. And they said, “All that the LORD has said we will do, and be obedient.”"
Exodus,24,8,"And Moses took the blood, sprinkled it on the people, and said, “This is the blood of the covenant which the LORD has made with you according to all these words.”"
Exodus,24,9,"Then Moses went up, also Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel,"
Exodus,24,10,"and they saw the God of Israel. And there was under His feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and it was like the very heavens in its clarity."
Exodus,24,11,"But on the nobles of the children of Israel He did not lay His hand. So they saw God, and they ate and drank."
Exodus,24,12,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Come up to Me on the mountain and be there; and I will give you tablets of stone, and the law and commandments which I have written, that you may teach them.”"
Exodus,24,13,"So Moses arose with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up to the mountain of God."
Exodus,24,14,"And he said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we come back to you. Indeed, Aaron and Hur are with you. If any man has a difficulty, let him go to them.”"
Exodus,24,15,"Then Moses went up into the mountain, and a cloud covered the mountain."
Exodus,24,16,"Now the glory of the LORD rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And on the seventh day He called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud."
Exodus,24,17,The sight of the glory of the LORD was like a consuming fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel.
Exodus,24,18,So Moses went into the midst of the cloud and went up into the mountain. And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
Exodus,25,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Exodus,25,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring Me an offering. From everyone who gives it willingly with his heart you shall take My offering."
Exodus,25,3,"And this is the offering which you shall take from them: gold, silver, and bronze;"
Exodus,25,4,"blue, purple, and scarlet thread, fine linen, and goats’ hair;"
Exodus,25,5,"ram skins dyed red, badger skins, and acacia wood;"
Exodus,25,6,"oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense;"
Exodus,25,7,"onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate."
Exodus,25,8,"And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them."
Exodus,25,9,"According to all that I show you, that is, the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furnishings, just so you shall make it."
Exodus,25,10,"“And they shall make an ark of acacia wood; two and a half cubits shall be its length, a cubit and a half its width, and a cubit and a half its height."
Exodus,25,11,"And you shall overlay it with pure gold, inside and out you shall overlay it, and shall make on it a molding of gold all around."
Exodus,25,12,"You shall cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in its four corners; two rings shall be on one side, and two rings on the other side."

Exodus,30,31,"“And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘This shall be a holy anointing oil to Me throughout your generations."
Exodus,30,32,"It shall not be poured on man’s flesh; nor shall you make any other like it, according to its composition. It is holy, and it shall be holy to you."
Exodus,30,33,"Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on an outsider, shall be cut off from his people.’”"
Exodus,30,34,"And the LORD said to Moses: “Take sweet spices, stacte and onycha and galbanum, and pure frankincense with these sweet spices; there shall be equal amounts of each."
Exodus,30,35,"You shall make of these an incense, a compound according to the art of the perfumer, salted, pure, and holy."
Exodus,30,36,"And you shall beat some of it very fine, and put some of it before the Testimony in the tabernacle of meeting where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you."
Exodus,30,37,"But as for the incense which you shall make, you shall not make any for yourselves, according to its composition. It shall be to you holy for the LORD."
Exodus,30,38,"Whoever makes any like it, to smell it, he shall be cut off from his people.”"
Exodus,31,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Exodus,31,2,"“See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah."
Exodus,31,3,"And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,"
Exodus,31,4,"to design artistic works, to work in gold, in silver, in bronze,"
Exodus,31,5,"in cutting jewels for setting, in carving wood, and to work in all manner of workmanship."
Exodus,31,6,"“And I, indeed I, have appointed with him Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and I have put wisdom in the hearts of all the gifted artisans, that they may make all that I have commanded you:"
Exodus,31,7,"the tabernacle of meeting, the ark of the Testimony and the mercy seat that is on it, and all the furniture of the tabernacle—"
Exodus,31,8,"the table and its utensils, the pure gold lampstand with all its utensils, the altar of incense,"
Exodus,31,9,"the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the laver and its base—"
Exodus,31,10,"the garments of ministry, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests,"
Exodus,31,11,and the anointing oil and sweet incense for the holy place. According to all that I have commanded you they shall do.”
Exodus,31,12,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Exodus,31,13,"“Speak also to the children of Israel, saying: ‘Surely My Sabbaths you shall keep, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you."
Exodus,31,14,"You shall keep the Sabbath, therefore, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people."
Exodus,31,15,"Work shall be done for six days, but the seventh is the Sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death."
Exodus,31,16,"Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant."
Exodus,31,17,"It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.’”"
Exodus,31,18,"And when He had made an end of speaking with him on Mount Sinai, He gave Moses two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God."
Exodus,32,1,"Now when the people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain, the people gathered together to Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make us gods that shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.”"
Exodus,32,2,"And Aaron said to them, “Break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.”"
Exodus,32,3,"So all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron."
Exodus,32,4,"And he received the gold from their hand, and he fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made a molded calf. Then they said, “This is your god, O Israel, that brought you out of the land of Egypt!”"
Exodus,32,5,"So when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made a proclamation and said, “Tomorrow is a feast to the LORD.”"
Exodus,32,6,"Then they rose early on the next day, offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."
Exodus,32,7,"And the LORD said to Moses, “Go, get down! For your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves."
Exodus,32,8,"They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molded calf, and worshiped it and sacrificed to it, and said, ‘This is your god, O Israel, that brought you out of the land of Egypt!’”"
Exodus,32,9,"And the LORD said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and indeed it is a stiff-necked people!"
Exodus,32,10,"Now therefore, let Me alone, that My wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them. And I will make of you a great nation.”"
Exodus,32,11,"Then Moses pleaded with the LORD his God, and said: “LORD, why does Your wrath burn hot against Your people whom You have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?"
Exodus,32,12,"Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, ‘He brought them out to harm them, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from Your fierce wrath, and relent from this harm to Your people."
Exodus,32,13,"Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven; and all this land that I have spoken of I give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.’”"
Exodus,32,14,So the LORD relented from the harm which He said He would do to His people.
Exodus,32,15,"And Moses turned and went down from the mountain, and the two tablets of the Testimony were in his hand. The tablets were written on both sides; on the one side and on the other they were written."
Exodus,32,16,"Now the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God engraved on the tablets."
Exodus,32,17,"And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is a noise of war in the camp.”"
Exodus,32,18,"But he said: “It is not the noise of the shout of victory, Nor the noise of the cry of defeat, But the sound of singing I hear.”"
Exodus,32,19,"So it was, as soon as he came near the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing. So Moses’ anger became hot, and he cast the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain."
Exodus,32,20,"Then he took the calf which they had made, burned it in the fire, and ground it to powder; and he scattered it on the water and made the children of Israel drink it."
Exodus,32,21,"And Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?”"
Exodus,32,22,"So Aaron said, “Do not let the anger of my lord become hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil."
Exodus,32,23,"For they said to me, ‘Make us gods that shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’"
Exodus,32,24,"And I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let them break it off.’ So they gave it to me, and I cast it into the fire, and this calf came out.”"
Exodus,32,25,"Now when Moses saw that the people were unrestrained (for Aaron had not restrained them, to their shame among their enemies),"
Exodus,32,26,"then Moses stood in the entrance of the camp, and said, “Whoever is on the LORD’s side—come to me!” And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him."
Exodus,32,27,"And he said to them, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘Let every man put his sword on his side, and go in and out from entrance to entrance throughout the camp, and let every man kill his brother, every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.’”"
Exodus,32,28,So the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And about three thousand men of the people fell that day.
Exodus,32,29,"Then Moses said, “Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, that He may bestow on you a blessing this day, for every man has opposed his son and his brother.”"
Exodus,32,30,"Now it came to pass on the next day that Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. So now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”"
Exodus,32,31,"Then Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Oh, these people have committed a great sin, and have made for themselves a god of gold!"
Exodus,32,32,"Yet now, if You will forgive their sin—but if not, I pray, blot me out of Your book which You have written.”"
Exodus,32,33,"And the LORD said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book."
Exodus,32,34,"Now therefore, go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, My Angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit for punishment, I will visit punishment upon them for their sin.”"
Exodus,32,35,So the LORD plagued the people because of what they did with the calf which Aaron made.
Exodus,33,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Depart and go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘To your descendants I will give it.’"
Exodus,33,2,"And I will send My Angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanite and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite."
Exodus,33,3,"Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst, lest I consume you on the way, for you are a stiff-necked people.”"
Exodus,33,4,"And when the people heard this bad news, they mourned, and no one put on his ornaments."
Exodus,33,5,"For the LORD had said to Moses, “Say to the children of Israel, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. I could come up into your midst in one moment and consume you. Now therefore, take off your ornaments, that I may know what to do to you.’”"
Exodus,33,6,So the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by Mount Horeb.
Exodus,33,7,"Moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the tabernacle of meeting. And it came to pass that everyone who sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of meeting which was outside the camp."
Exodus,33,8,"So it was, whenever Moses went out to the tabernacle, that all the people rose, and each man stood at his tent door and watched Moses until he had gone into the tabernacle."
Exodus,33,9,"And it came to pass, when Moses entered the tabernacle, that the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses."
Exodus,33,10,"All the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the tabernacle door, and all the people rose and worshiped, each man in his tent door."
Exodus,33,11,"So the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he would return to the camp, but his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not depart from the tabernacle."
Exodus,33,12,"Then Moses said to the LORD, “See, You say to me, ‘Bring up this people.’ But You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found grace in My sight.’"
Exodus,33,13,"Now therefore, I pray, if I have found grace in Your sight, show me now Your way, that I may know You and that I may find grace in Your sight. And consider that this nation is Your people.”"
Exodus,33,14,"And He said, “My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”"
Exodus,33,15,"Then he said to Him, “If Your Presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here."
Exodus,33,16,"For how then will it be known that Your people and I have found grace in Your sight, except You go with us? So we shall be separate, Your people and I, from all the people who are upon the face of the earth.”"
Exodus,33,17,"So the LORD said to Moses, “I will also do this thing that you have spoken; for you have found grace in My sight, and I know you by name.”"
Exodus,33,18,"And he said, “Please, show me Your glory.”"
Exodus,33,19,"Then He said, “I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.”"
Exodus,33,20,"But He said, “You cannot see My face; for no man shall see Me, and live.”"
Exodus,33,21,"And the LORD said, “Here is a place by Me, and you shall stand on the rock."
Exodus,33,22,"So it shall be, while My glory passes by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock, and will cover you with My hand while I pass by."
Exodus,33,23,"Then I will take away My hand, and you shall see My back; but My face shall not be seen.”"
Exodus,34,1,"And the LORD said to Moses, “Cut two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I will write on these tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke."
Exodus,34,2,"So be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself to Me there on the top of the mountain."
Exodus,34,3,"And no man shall come up with you, and let no man be seen throughout all the mountain; let neither flocks nor herds feed before that mountain.”"
Exodus,34,4,"So he cut two tablets of stone like the first ones. Then Moses rose early in the morning and went up Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him; and he took in his hand the two tablets of stone."
Exodus,34,5,"Now the LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD."
Exodus,34,6,"And the LORD passed before him and proclaimed, “The LORD, the LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth,"
Exodus,34,7,"keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children’s children to the third and the fourth generation.”"
Exodus,34,8,"So Moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped."
Exodus,34,9,"Then he said, “If now I have found grace in Your sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray, go among us, even though we are a stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us as Your inheritance.”"
Exodus,34,10,"And He said: “Behold, I make a covenant. Before all your people I will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the LORD. For it is an awesome thing that I will do with you."
Exodus,34,11,"Observe what I command you this day. Behold, I am driving out from before you the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite."
Exodus,34,12,"Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be a snare in your midst."
Exodus,34,13,"But you shall destroy their altars, break their sacred pillars, and cut down their wooden images"
Exodus,34,14,"(for you shall worship no other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God),"
Exodus,34,15,"lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they play the harlot with their gods and make sacrifice to their gods, and one of them invites you and you eat of his sacrifice,"
Exodus,34,16,"and you take of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters play the harlot with their gods and make your sons play the harlot with their gods."
Exodus,34,17,“You shall make no molded gods for yourselves.
Exodus,34,18,"“The Feast of Unleavened Bread you shall keep. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, in the appointed time of the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt."
Exodus,34,19,"“All that open the womb are Mine, and every male firstborn among your livestock, whether ox or sheep."
Exodus,34,20,"But the firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb. And if you will not redeem him, then you shall break his neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. “And none shall appear before Me empty-handed."
Exodus,34,21,"“Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest."
Exodus,34,22,"“And you shall observe the Feast of Weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the year’s end."
Exodus,34,23,"“Three times in the year all your men shall appear before the Lord, the LORD God of Israel."
Exodus,34,24,For I will cast out the nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither will any man covet your land when you go up to appear before the LORD your God three times in the year.
Exodus,34,25,"“You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leaven, nor shall the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover be left until morning."
Exodus,34,26,“The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring to the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.”
Exodus,34,27,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write these words, for according to the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”"
Exodus,34,28,"So he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water. And He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments."
Exodus,34,29,"Now it was so, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai (and the two tablets of the Testimony were in Moses’ hand when he came down from the mountain), that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone while he talked with Him."
Exodus,34,30,"So when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him."
Exodus,34,31,"Then Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses talked with them."
Exodus,34,32,"Afterward all the children of Israel came near, and he gave them as commandments all that the LORD had spoken with him on Mount Sinai."
Exodus,34,33,"And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face."
Exodus,34,34,"But whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with Him, he would take the veil off until he came out; and he would come out and speak to the children of Israel whatever he had been commanded."
Exodus,34,35,"And whenever the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone, then Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with Him."
Exodus,35,1,"Then Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said to them, “These are the words which the LORD has commanded you to do:"
Exodus,35,2,"Work shall be done for six days, but the seventh day shall be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of rest to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it shall be put to death."
Exodus,35,3,You shall kindle no fire throughout your dwellings on the Sabbath day.”
Exodus,35,4,"And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, “This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying:"
Exodus,35,5,"‘Take from among you an offering to the LORD. Whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it as an offering to the LORD: gold, silver, and bronze;"
Exodus,35,6,"blue, purple, and scarlet thread, fine linen, and goats’ hair;"
Exodus,35,7,"ram skins dyed red, badger skins, and acacia wood;"
Exodus,35,8,"oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense;"
Exodus,35,9,"onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate."
Exodus,35,10,‘All who are gifted artisans among you shall come and make all that the LORD has commanded:
Exodus,35,11,"the tabernacle, its tent, its covering, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;"
Exodus,35,12,"the ark and its poles, with the mercy seat, and the veil of the covering;"
Exodus,35,13,"the table and its poles, all its utensils, and the showbread;"
Exodus,35,14,"also the lampstand for the light, its utensils, its lamps, and the oil for the light;"
Exodus,35,15,"the incense altar, its poles, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, and the screen for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle;"
Exodus,35,16,"the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles, all its utensils, and the laver and its base;"
Exodus,35,17,"the hangings of the court, its pillars, their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;"
Exodus,35,18,"the pegs of the tabernacle, the pegs of the court, and their cords;"
Exodus,35,19,"the garments of ministry, for ministering in the holy place—the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests.’”"
Exodus,35,20,And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
Exodus,35,21,"Then everyone came whose heart was stirred, and everyone whose spirit was willing, and they brought the LORD’s offering for the work of the tabernacle of meeting, for all its service, and for the holy garments."
Exodus,35,22,"They came, both men and women, as many as had a willing heart, and brought earrings and nose rings, rings and necklaces, all jewelry of gold, that is, every man who made an offering of gold to the LORD."
Exodus,35,23,"And every man, with whom was found blue, purple, and scarlet thread, fine linen, and goats’ hair, red skins of rams, and badger skins, brought them."
Exodus,35,24,"Everyone who offered an offering of silver or bronze brought the LORD’s offering. And everyone with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it."
Exodus,35,25,"All the women who were gifted artisans spun yarn with their hands, and brought what they had spun, of blue, purple, and scarlet, and fine linen."
Exodus,35,26,And all the women whose hearts stirred with wisdom spun yarn of goats’ hair.
Exodus,35,27,"The rulers brought onyx stones, and the stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate,"
Exodus,35,28,"and spices and oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense."
Exodus,35,29,"The children of Israel brought a freewill offering to the LORD, all the men and women whose hearts were willing to bring material for all kinds of work which the LORD, by the hand of Moses, had commanded to be done."
Exodus,35,30,"And Moses said to the children of Israel, “See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;"
Exodus,35,31,"and He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom and understanding, in knowledge and all manner of workmanship,"
Exodus,35,32,"to design artistic works, to work in gold and silver and bronze,"
Exodus,35,33,"in cutting jewels for setting, in carving wood, and to work in all manner of artistic workmanship."
Exodus,35,34,"“And He has put in his heart the ability to teach, in him and Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan."
Exodus,35,35,"He has filled them with skill to do all manner of work of the engraver and the designer and the tapestry maker, in blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine linen, and of the weaver—those who do every work and those who design artistic works."
Exodus,36,1,"“And Bezalel and Aholiab, and every gifted artisan in whom the LORD has put wisdom and understanding, to know how to do all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, shall do according to all that the LORD has commanded.”"
Exodus,36,2,"Then Moses called Bezalel and Aholiab, and every gifted artisan in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, everyone whose heart was stirred, to come and do the work."
Exodus,36,3,And they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of making the sanctuary. So they continued bringing to him freewill offerings every morning.
Exodus,36,4,"Then all the craftsmen who were doing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from the work he was doing,"
Exodus,36,5,"and they spoke to Moses, saying, “The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which the LORD commanded us to do.”"
Exodus,36,6,"So Moses gave a commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, “Let neither man nor woman do any more work for the offering of the sanctuary.” And the people were restrained from bringing,"
Exodus,36,7,for the material they had was sufficient for all the work to be done—indeed too much.
Exodus,36,8,"Then all the gifted artisans among them who worked on the tabernacle made ten curtains woven of fine linen, and of blue, purple, and scarlet thread; with artistic designs of cherubim they made them."
Exodus,36,9,"The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; the curtains were all the same size."
Exodus,36,10,"And he coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled to one another."
Exodus,36,11,He made loops of blue yarn on the edge of the curtain on the selvedge of one set; likewise he did on the outer edge of the other curtain of the second set.
Exodus,36,12,"Fifty loops he made on one curtain, and fifty loops he made on the edge of the curtain on the end of the second set; the loops held one curtain to another."
Exodus,36,13,"And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains to one another with the clasps, that it might be one tabernacle."
Exodus,36,14,He made curtains of goats’ hair for the tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains.
Exodus,36,15,"The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; the eleven curtains were the same size."
Exodus,36,16,He coupled five curtains by themselves and six curtains by themselves.
Exodus,36,17,"And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that is outermost in one set, and fifty loops he made on the edge of the curtain of the second set."
Exodus,36,18,"He also made fifty bronze clasps to couple the tent together, that it might be one."
Exodus,36,19,"Then he made a covering for the tent of ram skins dyed red, and a covering of badger skins above that."
Exodus,36,20,"For the tabernacle he made boards of acacia wood, standing upright."
Exodus,36,21,"The length of each board was ten cubits, and the width of each board a cubit and a half."
Exodus,36,22,Each board had two tenons for binding one to another. Thus he made for all the boards of the tabernacle.
Exodus,36,23,"And he made boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side."
Exodus,36,24,Forty sockets of silver he made to go under the twenty boards: two sockets under each of the boards for its two tenons.
Exodus,36,25,"And for the other side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty boards"
Exodus,36,26,and their forty sockets of silver: two sockets under each of the boards.
Exodus,36,27,For the west side of the tabernacle he made six boards.
Exodus,36,28,He also made two boards for the two back corners of the tabernacle.
Exodus,36,29,And they were coupled at the bottom and coupled together at the top by one ring. Thus he made both of them for the two corners.
Exodus,36,30,So there were eight boards and their sockets—sixteen sockets of silver—two sockets under each of the boards.
Exodus,36,31,"And he made bars of acacia wood: five for the boards on one side of the tabernacle,"
Exodus,36,32,"five bars for the boards on the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle on the far side westward."
Exodus,36,33,And he made the middle bar to pass through the boards from one end to the other.
Exodus,36,34,"He overlaid the boards with gold, made their rings of gold to be holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold."
Exodus,36,35,"And he made a veil of blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine woven linen; it was worked with an artistic design of cherubim."
Exodus,36,36,"He made for it four pillars of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, with their hooks of gold; and he cast four sockets of silver for them."
Exodus,36,37,"He also made a screen for the tabernacle door, of blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine woven linen, made by a weaver,"
Exodus,36,38,"and its five pillars with their hooks. And he overlaid their capitals and their rings with gold, but their five sockets were bronze."
Exodus,37,1,"Then Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; two and a half cubits was its length, a cubit and a half its width, and a cubit and a half its height."
Exodus,37,2,"He overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and made a molding of gold all around it."
Exodus,37,3,"And he cast for it four rings of gold to be set in its four corners: two rings on one side, and two rings on the other side of it."
Exodus,37,4,"He made poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold."
Exodus,37,5,"And he put the poles into the rings at the sides of the ark, to bear the ark."
Exodus,37,6,He also made the mercy seat of pure gold; two and a half cubits was its length and a cubit and a half its width.
Exodus,37,7,He made two cherubim of beaten gold; he made them of one piece at the two ends of the mercy seat:
Exodus,37,8,"one cherub at one end on this side, and the other cherub at the other end on that side. He made the cherubim at the two ends of one piece with the mercy seat."
Exodus,37,9,"The cherubim spread out their wings above, and covered the mercy seat with their wings. They faced one another; the faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat."
Exodus,37,10,"He made the table of acacia wood; two cubits was its length, a cubit its width, and a cubit and a half its height."

Exodus,37,12,"Also he made a frame of a handbreadth all around it, and made a molding of gold for the frame all around it."
Exodus,37,13,"And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings on the four corners that were at its four legs."
Exodus,37,14,"The rings were close to the frame, as holders for the poles to bear the table."

Exodus,37,16,"He made of pure gold the utensils which were on the table: its dishes, its cups, its bowls, and its pitchers for pouring."
Exodus,37,17,"He also made the lampstand of pure gold; of hammered work he made the lampstand. Its shaft, its branches, its bowls, its ornamental knobs, and its flowers were of the same piece."
Exodus,37,18,"And six branches came out of its sides: three branches of the lampstand out of one side, and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side."

Exodus,37,21,"There was a knob under the first two branches of the same, a knob under the second two branches of the same, and a knob under the third two branches of the same, according to the six branches extending from it."

Exodus,38,25,"And the silver from those who were numbered of the congregation was one hundred talents and one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary:"
Exodus,38,26,"a bekah for each man (that is, half a shekel, according to the shekel of the sanctuary), for everyone included in the numbering from twenty years old and above, for six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty men."
Exodus,38,27,"And from the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary and the bases of the veil: one hundred sockets from the hundred talents, one talent for each socket."

Exodus,39,3,"And they beat the gold into thin sheets and cut it into threads, to work it in with the blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and the fine linen, into artistic designs."
Exodus,39,4,They made shoulder straps for it to couple it together; it was coupled together at its two edges.
Exodus,39,5,"And the intricately woven band of his ephod that was on it was of the same workmanship, woven of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and of fine woven linen, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,6,"And they set onyx stones, enclosed in settings of gold; they were engraved, as signets are engraved, with the names of the sons of Israel."
Exodus,39,7,"He put them on the shoulders of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,8,"And he made the breastplate, artistically woven like the workmanship of the ephod, of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and of fine woven linen."
Exodus,39,9,They made the breastplate square by doubling it; a span was its length and a span its width when doubled.
Exodus,39,10,"And they set in it four rows of stones: a row with a sardius, a topaz, and an emerald was the first row;"
Exodus,39,11,"the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond;"
Exodus,39,12,"the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;"

Exodus,39,15,"And they made chains for the breastplate at the ends, like braided cords of pure gold."
Exodus,39,16,"They also made two settings of gold and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate."
Exodus,39,17,And they put the two braided chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.
Exodus,39,18,"The two ends of the two braided chains they fastened in the two settings, and put them on the shoulder straps of the ephod in the front."
Exodus,39,19,"And they made two rings of gold and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, on the edge of it, which was on the inward side of the ephod."
Exodus,39,20,"They made two other gold rings and put them on the two shoulder straps, underneath the ephod toward its front, right at the seam above the intricately woven band of the ephod."
Exodus,39,21,"And they bound the breastplate by means of its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it would be above the intricately woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate would not come loose from the ephod, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,22,"He made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue."
Exodus,39,23,"And there was an opening in the middle of the robe, like the opening in a coat of mail, with a woven binding all around the opening, so that it would not tear."
Exodus,39,24,"They made on the hem of the robe pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet, and of fine woven linen."
Exodus,39,25,"And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates on the hem of the robe all around between the pomegranates:"
Exodus,39,26,"a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, all around the hem of the robe to minister in, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,27,"They made tunics, artistically woven of fine linen, for Aaron and his sons,"
Exodus,39,28,"a turban of fine linen, exquisite hats of fine linen, short trousers of fine woven linen,"
Exodus,39,29,"and a sash of fine woven linen with blue, purple, and scarlet thread, made by a weaver, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,30,"Then they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it an inscription like the engraving of a signet: HOLINESS TO THE LORD."
Exodus,39,31,"And they tied to it a blue cord, to fasten it above on the turban, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,32,Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was finished. And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses; so they did.
Exodus,39,33,"And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its furnishings: its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;"
Exodus,39,34,"the covering of ram skins dyed red, the covering of badger skins, and the veil of the covering;"
Exodus,39,35,"the ark of the Testimony with its poles, and the mercy seat;"
Exodus,39,36,"the table, all its utensils, and the showbread;"
Exodus,39,37,"the pure gold lampstand with its lamps (the lamps set in order), all its utensils, and the oil for light;"
Exodus,39,38,"the gold altar, the anointing oil, and the sweet incense; the screen for the tabernacle door;"
Exodus,39,39,"the bronze altar, its grate of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils; the laver with its base;"
Exodus,39,40,"the hangings of the court, its pillars and its sockets, the screen for the court gate, its cords, and its pegs; all the utensils for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;"
Exodus,39,41,"and the garments of ministry, to minister in the holy place: the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons’ garments, to minister as priests."
Exodus,39,42,"According to all that the LORD had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work."
Exodus,39,43,"Then Moses looked over all the work, and indeed they had done it; as the LORD had commanded, just so they had done it. And Moses blessed them."
Exodus,40,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Exodus,40,2,“On the first day of the first month you shall set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
Exodus,40,3,"You shall put in it the ark of the Testimony, and partition off the ark with the veil."
Exodus,40,4,You shall bring in the table and arrange the things that are to be set in order on it; and you shall bring in the lampstand and light its lamps.
Exodus,40,5,"You shall also set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the Testimony, and put up the screen for the door of the tabernacle."
Exodus,40,6,Then you shall set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
Exodus,40,7,"And you shall set the laver between the tabernacle of meeting and the altar, and put water in it."
Exodus,40,8,"You shall set up the court all around, and hang up the screen at the court gate."
Exodus,40,9,"“And you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it; and you shall hallow it and all its utensils, and it shall be holy."
Exodus,40,10,"You shall anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar. The altar shall be most holy."
Exodus,40,11,"And you shall anoint the laver and its base, and consecrate it."
Exodus,40,12,“Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of meeting and wash them with water.
Exodus,40,13,"You shall put the holy garments on Aaron, and anoint him and consecrate him, that he may minister to Me as priest."
Exodus,40,14,And you shall bring his sons and clothe them with tunics.
Exodus,40,15,"You shall anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may minister to Me as priests; for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.”"
Exodus,40,16,"Thus Moses did; according to all that the LORD had commanded him, so he did."
Exodus,40,17,"And it came to pass in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was raised up."
Exodus,40,18,"So Moses raised up the tabernacle, fastened its sockets, set up its boards, put in its bars, and raised up its pillars."
Exodus,40,19,"And he spread out the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,20,"He took the Testimony and put it into the ark, inserted the poles through the rings of the ark, and put the mercy seat on top of the ark."
Exodus,40,21,"And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, hung up the veil of the covering, and partitioned off the ark of the Testimony, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,22,"He put the table in the tabernacle of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil;"
Exodus,40,23,"and he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,24,"He put the lampstand in the tabernacle of meeting, across from the table, on the south side of the tabernacle;"
Exodus,40,25,"and he lit the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,26,He put the gold altar in the tabernacle of meeting in front of the veil;
Exodus,40,27,"and he burned sweet incense on it, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,28,He hung up the screen at the door of the tabernacle.
Exodus,40,29,"And he put the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the grain offering, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,30,"He set the laver between the tabernacle of meeting and the altar, and put water there for washing;"
Exodus,40,31,"and Moses, Aaron, and his sons would wash their hands and their feet with water from it."
Exodus,40,32,"Whenever they went into the tabernacle of meeting, and when they came near the altar, they washed, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,33,"And he raised up the court all around the tabernacle and the altar, and hung up the screen of the court gate. So Moses finished the work."
Exodus,40,34,"Then the cloud covered the tabernacle of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle."
Exodus,40,35,"And Moses was not able to enter the tabernacle of meeting, because the cloud rested above it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle."
Exodus,40,36,"Whenever the cloud was taken up from above the tabernacle, the children of Israel would go onward in all their journeys."
Exodus,40,37,"But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not journey till the day that it was taken up."
Exodus,40,38,"For the cloud of the LORD was above the tabernacle by day, and fire was over it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys."
Leviticus,1,1,"Now the LORD called to Moses, and spoke to him from the tabernacle of meeting, saying,"
Leviticus,1,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When any one of you brings an offering to the LORD, you shall bring your offering of the livestock—of the herd and of the flock."
Leviticus,1,3,"‘If his offering is a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish; he shall offer it of his own free will at the door of the tabernacle of meeting before the LORD."
Leviticus,1,4,"Then he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him."
Leviticus,1,5,"He shall kill the bull before the LORD; and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood and sprinkle the blood all around on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of meeting."
Leviticus,1,6,And he shall skin the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces.
Leviticus,1,7,"The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay the wood in order on the fire."
Leviticus,1,8,"Then the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat in order on the wood that is on the fire upon the altar;"
Leviticus,1,9,"but he shall wash its entrails and its legs with water. And the priest shall burn all on the altar as a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,1,10,"‘If his offering is of the flocks—of the sheep or of the goats—as a burnt sacrifice, he shall bring a male without blemish."
Leviticus,1,11,"He shall kill it on the north side of the altar before the LORD; and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle its blood all around on the altar."
Leviticus,1,12,"And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire upon the altar;"
Leviticus,1,13,"but he shall wash the entrails and the legs with water. Then the priest shall bring it all and burn it on the altar; it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,1,14,"‘And if the burnt sacrifice of his offering to the LORD is of birds, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves or young pigeons."
Leviticus,1,15,"The priest shall bring it to the altar, wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; its blood shall be drained out at the side of the altar."
Leviticus,1,16,"And he shall remove its crop with its feathers and cast it beside the altar on the east side, into the place for ashes."
Leviticus,1,17,"Then he shall split it at its wings, but shall not divide it completely; and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,2,1,"‘When anyone offers a grain offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour. And he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense on it."
Leviticus,2,2,"He shall bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests, one of whom shall take from it his handful of fine flour and oil with all the frankincense. And the priest shall burn it as a memorial on the altar, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,2,3,The rest of the grain offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’. It is most holy of the offerings to the LORD made by fire.
Leviticus,2,4,"‘And if you bring as an offering a grain offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil."
Leviticus,2,5,"But if your offering is a grain offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour, unleavened, mixed with oil."
Leviticus,2,6,You shall break it in pieces and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
Leviticus,2,7,"‘If your offering is a grain offering baked in a covered pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil."
Leviticus,2,8,"You shall bring the grain offering that is made of these things to the LORD. And when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar."
Leviticus,2,9,"Then the priest shall take from the grain offering a memorial portion, and burn it on the altar. It is an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,2,10,And what is left of the grain offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’. It is most holy of the offerings to the LORD made by fire.
Leviticus,2,11,"‘No grain offering which you bring to the LORD shall be made with leaven, for you shall burn no leaven nor any honey in any offering to the LORD made by fire."
Leviticus,2,12,"As for the offering of the firstfruits, you shall offer them to the LORD, but they shall not be burned on the altar for a sweet aroma."
Leviticus,2,13,And every offering of your grain offering you shall season with salt; you shall not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your grain offering. With all your offerings you shall offer salt.
Leviticus,2,14,"‘If you offer a grain offering of your firstfruits to the LORD, you shall offer for the grain offering of your firstfruits green heads of grain roasted on the fire, grain beaten from full heads."
Leviticus,2,15,"And you shall put oil on it, and lay frankincense on it. It is a grain offering."
Leviticus,2,16,"Then the priest shall burn the memorial portion: part of its beaten grain and part of its oil, with all the frankincense, as an offering made by fire to the LORD."
Leviticus,3,1,"‘When his offering is a sacrifice of a peace offering, if he offers it of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD."
Leviticus,3,2,"And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of meeting; and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall sprinkle the blood all around on the altar."
Leviticus,3,3,"Then he shall offer from the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire to the LORD. The fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,"
Leviticus,3,4,"the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove;"
Leviticus,3,5,"and Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which is on the wood that is on the fire, as an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,3,6,"‘If his offering as a sacrifice of a peace offering to the LORD is of the flock, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish."
Leviticus,3,7,"If he offers a lamb as his offering, then he shall offer it before the LORD."
Leviticus,3,8,"And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of meeting; and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle its blood all around on the altar."
Leviticus,3,9,"‘Then he shall offer from the sacrifice of the peace offering, as an offering made by fire to the LORD, its fat and the whole fat tail which he shall remove close to the backbone. And the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,"
Leviticus,3,10,"the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove;"
Leviticus,3,11,"and the priest shall burn them on the altar as food, an offering made by fire to the LORD."
Leviticus,3,12,"‘And if his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD."
Leviticus,3,13,He shall lay his hand on its head and kill it before the tabernacle of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood all around on the altar.
Leviticus,3,14,"Then he shall offer from it his offering, as an offering made by fire to the LORD. The fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,"
Leviticus,3,15,"the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove;"
Leviticus,3,16,"and the priest shall burn them on the altar as food, an offering made by fire for a sweet aroma; all the fat is the LORD’s."
Leviticus,3,17,‘This shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings: you shall eat neither fat nor blood.’”
Leviticus,4,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,4,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘If a person sins unintentionally against any of the commandments of the LORD in anything which ought not to be done, and does any of them,"
Leviticus,4,3,"if the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, then let him offer to the LORD for his sin which he has sinned a young bull without blemish as a sin offering."
Leviticus,4,4,"He shall bring the bull to the door of the tabernacle of meeting before the LORD, lay his hand on the bull’s head, and kill the bull before the LORD."
Leviticus,4,5,Then the anointed priest shall take some of the bull’s blood and bring it to the tabernacle of meeting.
Leviticus,4,6,"The priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before the LORD, in front of the veil of the sanctuary."
Leviticus,4,7,"And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of meeting; and he shall pour the remaining blood of the bull at the base of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of meeting."
Leviticus,4,8,"He shall take from it all the fat of the bull as the sin offering. The fat that covers the entrails and all the fat which is on the entrails,"
Leviticus,4,9,"the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove,"
Leviticus,4,10,as it was taken from the bull of the sacrifice of the peace offering; and the priest shall burn them on the altar of the burnt offering.
Leviticus,4,11,"But the bull’s hide and all its flesh, with its head and legs, its entrails and offal—"
Leviticus,4,12,"the whole bull he shall carry outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned."
Leviticus,4,13,"‘Now if the whole congregation of Israel sins unintentionally, and the thing is hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done something against any of the commandments of the LORD in anything which should not be done, and are guilty;"
Leviticus,4,14,"when the sin which they have committed becomes known, then the assembly shall offer a young bull for the sin, and bring it before the tabernacle of meeting."
Leviticus,4,15,And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before the LORD. Then the bull shall be killed before the LORD.
Leviticus,4,16,The anointed priest shall bring some of the bull’s blood to the tabernacle of meeting.
Leviticus,4,17,"Then the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, in front of the veil."
Leviticus,4,18,"And he shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of meeting; and he shall pour the remaining blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of meeting."
Leviticus,4,19,He shall take all the fat from it and burn it on the altar.
Leviticus,4,20,"And he shall do with the bull as he did with the bull as a sin offering; thus he shall do with it. So the priest shall make atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them."
Leviticus,4,21,"Then he shall carry the bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bull. It is a sin offering for the assembly."
Leviticus,4,22,"‘When a ruler has sinned, and done something unintentionally against any of the commandments of the LORD his God in anything which should not be done, and is guilty,"
Leviticus,4,23,"or if his sin which he has committed comes to his knowledge, he shall bring as his offering a kid of the goats, a male without blemish."
Leviticus,4,24,"And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it at the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD. It is a sin offering."
Leviticus,4,25,"The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering."
Leviticus,4,26,"And he shall burn all its fat on the altar, like the fat of the sacrifice of the peace offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him."
Leviticus,4,27,"‘If anyone of the common people sins unintentionally by doing something against any of the commandments of the LORD in anything which ought not to be done, and is guilty,"
Leviticus,4,28,"or if his sin which he has committed comes to his knowledge, then he shall bring as his offering a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has committed."
Leviticus,4,29,"And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and kill the sin offering at the place of the burnt offering."
Leviticus,4,30,"Then the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour all the remaining blood at the base of the altar."
Leviticus,4,31,"He shall remove all its fat, as fat is removed from the sacrifice of the peace offering; and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a sweet aroma to the LORD. So the priest shall make atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him."
Leviticus,4,32,"‘If he brings a lamb as his sin offering, he shall bring a female without blemish."
Leviticus,4,33,"Then he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and kill it as a sin offering at the place where they kill the burnt offering."
Leviticus,4,34,"The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour all the remaining blood at the base of the altar."
Leviticus,4,35,"He shall remove all its fat, as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of the peace offering. Then the priest shall burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire to the LORD. So the priest shall make atonement for his sin that he has committed, and it shall be forgiven him."
Leviticus,5,1,"‘If a person sins in hearing the utterance of an oath, and is a witness, whether he has seen or known of the matter—if he does not tell it, he bears guilt."
Leviticus,5,2,"‘Or if a person touches any unclean thing, whether it is the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean livestock, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and he is unaware of it, he also shall be unclean and guilty."
Leviticus,5,3,"Or if he touches human uncleanness—whatever uncleanness with which a man may be defiled, and he is unaware of it—when he realizes it, then he shall be guilty."
Leviticus,5,4,"‘Or if a person swears, speaking thoughtlessly with his lips to do evil or to do good, whatever it is that a man may pronounce by an oath, and he is unaware of it—when he realizes it, then he shall be guilty in any of these matters."
Leviticus,5,5,"‘And it shall be, when he is guilty in any of these matters, that he shall confess that he has sinned in that thing;"
Leviticus,5,6,"and he shall bring his trespass offering to the LORD for his sin which he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats as a sin offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin."
Leviticus,5,7,"‘If he is not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring to the LORD, for his trespass which he has committed, two turtledoves or two young pigeons: one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering."
Leviticus,5,8,"And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide it completely."
Leviticus,5,9,"Then he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,10,"And he shall offer the second as a burnt offering according to the prescribed manner. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin which he has committed, and it shall be forgiven him."
Leviticus,5,11,"‘But if he is not able to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he who sinned shall bring for his offering one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a sin offering. He shall put no oil on it, nor shall he put frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,12,"Then he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as a memorial portion, and burn it on the altar according to the offerings made by fire to the LORD. It is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,13,"The priest shall make atonement for him, for his sin that he has committed in any of these matters; and it shall be forgiven him. The rest shall be the priest’s as a grain offering.’”"
Leviticus,5,14,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Leviticus,5,15,"“If a person commits a trespass, and sins unintentionally in regard to the holy things of the LORD, then he shall bring to the LORD as his trespass offering a ram without blemish from the flocks, with your valuation in shekels of silver according to the shekel of the sanctuary, as a trespass offering."
Leviticus,5,16,"And he shall make restitution for the harm that he has done in regard to the holy thing, and shall add one-fifth to it and give it to the priest. So the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him."
Leviticus,5,17,"“If a person sins, and commits any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD, though he does not know it, yet he is guilty and shall bear his iniquity."
Leviticus,5,18,"And he shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish from the flock, with your valuation, as a trespass offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him regarding his ignorance in which he erred and did not know it, and it shall be forgiven him."
Leviticus,5,19,It is a trespass offering; he has certainly trespassed against the LORD.”
Leviticus,6,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Leviticus,6,2,"“If a person sins and commits a trespass against the LORD by lying to his neighbor about what was delivered to him for safekeeping, or about a pledge, or about a robbery, or if he has extorted from his neighbor,"
Leviticus,6,3,"or if he has found what was lost and lies concerning it, and swears falsely—in any one of these things that a man may do in which he sins:"
Leviticus,6,4,"then it shall be, because he has sinned and is guilty, that he shall restore what he has stolen, or the thing which he has extorted, or what was delivered to him for safekeeping, or the lost thing which he found,"
Leviticus,6,5,"or all that about which he has sworn falsely. He shall restore its full value, add one-fifth more to it, and give it to whomever it belongs, on the day of his trespass offering."
Leviticus,6,6,"And he shall bring his trespass offering to the LORD, a ram without blemish from the flock, with your valuation, as a trespass offering, to the priest."
Leviticus,6,7,"So the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD, and he shall be forgiven for any one of these things that he may have done in which he trespasses.”"
Leviticus,6,8,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,6,9,"“Command Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering shall be on the hearth upon the altar all night until morning, and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it."
Leviticus,6,10,"And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen trousers he shall put on his body, and take up the ashes of the burnt offering which the fire has consumed on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar."
Leviticus,6,11,"Then he shall take off his garments, put on other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place."
Leviticus,6,12,"And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it; it shall not be put out. And the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order on it; and he shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings."
Leviticus,6,13,A fire shall always be burning on the altar; it shall never go out.
Leviticus,6,14,‘This is the law of the grain offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer it on the altar before the LORD.
Leviticus,6,15,"He shall take from it his handful of the fine flour of the grain offering, with its oil, and all the frankincense which is on the grain offering, and shall burn it on the altar for a sweet aroma, as a memorial to the LORD."
Leviticus,6,16,And the remainder of it Aaron and his sons shall eat; with unleavened bread it shall be eaten in a holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of meeting they shall eat it.
Leviticus,6,17,"It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of My offerings made by fire; it is most holy, like the sin offering and the trespass offering."
Leviticus,6,18,All the males among the children of Aaron may eat it. It shall be a statute forever in your generations concerning the offerings made by fire to the LORD. Everyone who touches them must be holy.’”
Leviticus,6,19,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,6,20,"“This is the offering of Aaron and his sons, which they shall offer to the LORD, beginning on the day when he is anointed: one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a daily grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it at night."
Leviticus,6,21,"It shall be made in a pan with oil. When it is mixed, you shall bring it in. The baked pieces of the grain offering you shall offer for a sweet aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,6,22,"The priest from among his sons, who is anointed in his place, shall offer it. It is a statute forever to the LORD. It shall be wholly burned."
Leviticus,6,23,For every grain offering for the priest shall be wholly burned. It shall not be eaten.”
Leviticus,6,24,"Also the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,6,25,"“Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed, the sin offering shall be killed before the LORD. It is most holy."
Leviticus,6,26,"The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. In a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of meeting."
Leviticus,6,27,"Everyone who touches its flesh must be holy. And when its blood is sprinkled on any garment, you shall wash that on which it was sprinkled, in a holy place."
Leviticus,6,28,"But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken. And if it is boiled in a bronze pot, it shall be both scoured and rinsed in water."
Leviticus,6,29,All the males among the priests may eat it. It is most holy.
Leviticus,6,30,"But no sin offering from which any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of meeting, to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten. It shall be burned in the fire."
Leviticus,7,1,‘Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering (it is most holy):
Leviticus,7,2,In the place where they kill the burnt offering they shall kill the trespass offering. And its blood he shall sprinkle all around on the altar.
Leviticus,7,3,"And he shall offer from it all its fat. The fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails,"
Leviticus,7,4,"the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove;"
Leviticus,7,5,and the priest shall burn them on the altar as an offering made by fire to the LORD. It is a trespass offering.
Leviticus,7,6,Every male among the priests may eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place. It is most holy.
Leviticus,7,7,The trespass offering is like the sin offering; there is one law for them both: the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it.
Leviticus,7,8,"And the priest who offers anyone’s burnt offering, that priest shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has offered."
Leviticus,7,9,"Also every grain offering that is baked in the oven and all that is prepared in the covered pan, or in a pan, shall be the priest’s who offers it."
Leviticus,7,10,"Every grain offering, whether mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron, to one as much as the other."
Leviticus,7,11,‘This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which he shall offer to the LORD:
Leviticus,7,12,"If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer, with the sacrifice of thanksgiving, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers anointed with oil, or cakes of blended flour mixed with oil."
Leviticus,7,13,"Besides the cakes, as his offering he shall offer leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offering."
Leviticus,7,14,And from it he shall offer one cake from each offering as a heave offering to the LORD. It shall belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering.
Leviticus,7,15,‘The flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day it is offered. He shall not leave any of it until morning.
Leviticus,7,16,"But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice; but on the next day the remainder of it also may be eaten;"
Leviticus,7,17,the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day must be burned with fire.
Leviticus,7,18,"And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering is eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, nor shall it be imputed to him; it shall be an abomination to him who offers it, and the person who eats of it shall bear guilt."
Leviticus,7,19,"‘The flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned with fire. And as for the clean flesh, all who are clean may eat of it."
Leviticus,7,20,"But the person who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace offering that belongs to the LORD, while he is unclean, that person shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,21,"Moreover the person who touches any unclean thing, such as human uncleanness, an unclean animal, or any abominable unclean thing, and who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace offering that belongs to the LORD, that person shall be cut off from his people.’”"
Leviticus,7,22,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,7,23,"“Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘You shall not eat any fat, of ox or sheep or goat."
Leviticus,7,24,"And the fat of an animal that dies naturally, and the fat of what is torn by wild beasts, may be used in any other way; but you shall by no means eat it."
Leviticus,7,25,"For whoever eats the fat of the animal of which men offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, the person who eats it shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,26,"Moreover you shall not eat any blood in any of your dwellings, whether of bird or beast."
Leviticus,7,27,"Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.’”"
Leviticus,7,28,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,7,29,"“Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offering to the LORD shall bring his offering to the LORD from the sacrifice of his peace offering."
Leviticus,7,30,"His own hands shall bring the offerings made by fire to the LORD. The fat with the breast he shall bring, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before the LORD."
Leviticus,7,31,"And the priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’."
Leviticus,7,32,Also the right thigh you shall give to the priest as a heave offering from the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
Leviticus,7,33,"He among the sons of Aaron, who offers the blood of the peace offering and the fat, shall have the right thigh for his part."
Leviticus,7,34,"For the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering I have taken from the children of Israel, from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons from the children of Israel by a statute forever.’”"
Leviticus,7,35,"This is the consecrated portion for Aaron and his sons, from the offerings made by fire to the LORD, on the day when Moses presented them to minister to the LORD as priests."
Leviticus,7,36,"The LORD commanded this to be given to them by the children of Israel, on the day that He anointed them, by a statute forever throughout their generations."
Leviticus,7,37,"This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, the consecrations, and the sacrifice of the peace offering,"
Leviticus,7,38,"which the LORD commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day when He commanded the children of Israel to offer their offerings to the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai."
Leviticus,8,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Leviticus,8,2,"“Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, the anointing oil, a bull as the sin offering, two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;"
Leviticus,8,3,and gather all the congregation together at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.”
Leviticus,8,4,So Moses did as the LORD commanded him. And the congregation was gathered together at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.
Leviticus,8,5,"And Moses said to the congregation, “This is what the LORD commanded to be done.”"
Leviticus,8,6,Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.
Leviticus,8,7,"And he put the tunic on him, girded him with the sash, clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him; and he girded him with the intricately woven band of the ephod, and with it tied the ephod on him."
Leviticus,8,8,"Then he put the breastplate on him, and he put the Urim and the Thummim in the breastplate."
Leviticus,8,9,"And he put the turban on his head. Also on the turban, on its front, he put the golden plate, the holy crown, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,10,"Also Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them."
Leviticus,8,11,"He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the laver and its base, to consecrate them."
Leviticus,8,12,"And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him, to consecrate him."
Leviticus,8,13,"Then Moses brought Aaron’s sons and put tunics on them, girded them with sashes, and put hats on them, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,14,"And he brought the bull for the sin offering. Then Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull for the sin offering,"
Leviticus,8,15,"and Moses killed it. Then he took the blood, and put some on the horns of the altar all around with his finger, and purified the altar. And he poured the blood at the base of the altar, and consecrated it, to make atonement for it."
Leviticus,8,16,"Then he took all the fat that was on the entrails, the fatty lobe attached to the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned them on the altar."
Leviticus,8,17,"But the bull, its hide, its flesh, and its offal, he burned with fire outside the camp, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,18,"Then he brought the ram as the burnt offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram,"
Leviticus,8,19,and Moses killed it. Then he sprinkled the blood all around on the altar.
Leviticus,8,20,"And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burned the head, the pieces, and the fat."
Leviticus,8,21,"Then he washed the entrails and the legs in water. And Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,22,"And he brought the second ram, the ram of consecration. Then Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram,"
Leviticus,8,23,"and Moses killed it. Also he took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot."
Leviticus,8,24,"Then he brought Aaron’s sons. And Moses put some of the blood on the tips of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. And Moses sprinkled the blood all around on the altar."
Leviticus,8,25,"Then he took the fat and the fat tail, all the fat that was on the entrails, the fatty lobe attached to the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh;"
Leviticus,8,26,"and from the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD he took one unleavened cake, a cake of bread anointed with oil, and one wafer, and put them on the fat and on the right thigh;"
Leviticus,8,27,"and he put all these in Aaron’s hands and in his sons’ hands, and waved them as a wave offering before the LORD."
Leviticus,8,28,"Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar, on the burnt offering. They were consecration offerings for a sweet aroma. That was an offering made by fire to the LORD."
Leviticus,8,29,"And Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering before the LORD. It was Moses’ part of the ram of consecration, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,30,"Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he consecrated Aaron, his garments, his sons, and the garments of his sons with him."
Leviticus,8,31,"And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of consecration offerings, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’"
Leviticus,8,32,What remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire.
Leviticus,8,33,"And you shall not go outside the door of the tabernacle of meeting for seven days, until the days of your consecration are ended. For seven days he shall consecrate you."
Leviticus,8,34,"As he has done this day, so the LORD has commanded to do, to make atonement for you."
Leviticus,8,35,"Therefore you shall stay at the door of the tabernacle of meeting day and night for seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, so that you may not die; for so I have been commanded.”"
Leviticus,8,36,So Aaron and his sons did all the things that the LORD had commanded by the hand of Moses.
Leviticus,9,1,It came to pass on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.
Leviticus,9,2,"And he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a young bull as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD."
Leviticus,9,3,"And to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, ‘Take a kid of the goats as a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, as a burnt offering,"
Leviticus,9,4,"also a bull and a ram as peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with oil; for today the LORD will appear to you.’”"
Leviticus,9,5,So they brought what Moses commanded before the tabernacle of meeting. And all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
Leviticus,9,6,"Then Moses said, “This is the thing which the LORD commanded you to do, and the glory of the LORD will appear to you.”"
Leviticus,9,7,"And Moses said to Aaron, “Go to the altar, offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people. Offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as the LORD commanded.”"
Leviticus,9,8,"Aaron therefore went to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself."
Leviticus,9,9,"Then the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him. And he dipped his finger in the blood, put it on the horns of the altar, and poured the blood at the base of the altar."
Leviticus,9,10,"But the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe from the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,9,11,The flesh and the hide he burned with fire outside the camp.
Leviticus,9,12,"And he killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled all around on the altar."
Leviticus,9,13,"Then they presented the burnt offering to him, with its pieces and head, and he burned them on the altar."
Leviticus,9,14,"And he washed the entrails and the legs, and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar."
Leviticus,9,15,"Then he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and killed it and offered it for sin, like the first one."
Leviticus,9,16,And he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the prescribed manner.
Leviticus,9,17,"Then he brought the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt sacrifice of the morning."
Leviticus,9,18,"He also killed the bull and the ram as sacrifices of peace offerings, which were for the people. And Aaron’s sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled all around on the altar,"
Leviticus,9,19,"and the fat from the bull and the ram—the fatty tail, what covers the entrails and the kidneys, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver;"
Leviticus,9,20,and they put the fat on the breasts. Then he burned the fat on the altar;
Leviticus,9,21,"but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved as a wave offering before the LORD, as Moses had commanded."
Leviticus,9,22,"Then Aaron lifted his hand toward the people, blessed them, and came down from offering the sin offering, the burnt offering, and peace offerings."
Leviticus,9,23,"And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of meeting, and came out and blessed the people. Then the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people,"
Leviticus,9,24,"and fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. When all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces."
Leviticus,10,1,"Then Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in it, put incense on it, and offered profane fire before the LORD, which He had not commanded them."
Leviticus,10,2,"So fire went out from the LORD and devoured them, and they died before the LORD."
Leviticus,10,3,"And Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the LORD spoke, saying: ‘By those who come near Me I must be regarded as holy; And before all the people I must be glorified.’” So Aaron held his peace."
Leviticus,10,4,"Then Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.”"
Leviticus,10,5,"So they went near and carried them by their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had said."
Leviticus,10,6,"And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons, “Do not uncover your heads nor tear your clothes, lest you die, and wrath come upon all the people. But let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD has kindled."
Leviticus,10,7,"You shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of meeting, lest you die, for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you.” And they did according to the word of Moses."
Leviticus,10,8,"Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying:"
Leviticus,10,9,"“Do not drink wine or intoxicating drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tabernacle of meeting, lest you die. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations,"
Leviticus,10,10,"that you may distinguish between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean,"
Leviticus,10,11,and that you may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD has spoken to them by the hand of Moses.”
Leviticus,10,12,"And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons who were left: “Take the grain offering that remains of the offerings made by fire to the LORD, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy."
Leviticus,10,13,"You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons’ due, of the sacrifices made by fire to the LORD; for so I have been commanded."
Leviticus,10,14,"The breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering you shall eat in a clean place, you, your sons, and your daughters with you; for they are your due and your sons’ due, which are given from the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel."
Leviticus,10,15,"The thigh of the heave offering and the breast of the wave offering they shall bring with the offerings of fat made by fire, to offer as a wave offering before the LORD. And it shall be yours and your sons’ with you, by a statute forever, as the LORD has commanded.”"
Leviticus,10,16,"Then Moses made careful inquiry about the goat of the sin offering, and there it was—burned up. And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,"
Leviticus,10,17,"“Why have you not eaten the sin offering in a holy place, since it is most holy, and God has given it to you to bear the guilt of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?"
Leviticus,10,18,"See! Its blood was not brought inside the holy place; indeed you should have eaten it in a holy place, as I commanded.”"
Leviticus,10,19,"And Aaron said to Moses, “Look, this day they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD, and such things have befallen me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?”"
Leviticus,10,20,"So when Moses heard that, he was content."
Leviticus,11,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them,"
Leviticus,11,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘These are the animals which you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth:"
Leviticus,11,3,"Among the animals, whatever divides the hoof, having cloven hooves and chewing the cud—that you may eat."
Leviticus,11,4,"Nevertheless these you shall not eat among those that chew the cud or those that have cloven hooves: the camel, because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves, is unclean to you;"
Leviticus,11,5,"the rock hyrax, because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves, is unclean to you;"
Leviticus,11,6,"the hare, because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves, is unclean to you;"
Leviticus,11,7,"and the swine, though it divides the hoof, having cloven hooves, yet does not chew the cud, is unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,8,"Their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch. They are unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,9,"‘These you may eat of all that are in the water: whatever in the water has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers—that you may eat."
Leviticus,11,10,"But all in the seas or in the rivers that do not have fins and scales, all that move in the water or any living thing which is in the water, they are an abomination to you."
Leviticus,11,11,"They shall be an abomination to you; you shall not eat their flesh, but you shall regard their carcasses as an abomination."
Leviticus,11,12,Whatever in the water does not have fins or scales—that shall be an abomination to you.
Leviticus,11,13,"‘And these you shall regard as an abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, the vulture, the buzzard,"
Leviticus,11,14,"the kite, and the falcon after its kind;"
Leviticus,11,15,"every raven after its kind,"
Leviticus,11,16,"the ostrich, the short-eared owl, the sea gull, and the hawk after its kind;"
Leviticus,11,17,"the little owl, the fisher owl, and the screech owl;"
Leviticus,11,18,"the white owl, the jackdaw, and the carrion vulture;"
Leviticus,11,19,"the stork, the heron after its kind, the hoopoe, and the bat."
Leviticus,11,20,‘All flying insects that creep on all fours shall be an abomination to you.
Leviticus,11,21,Yet these you may eat of every flying insect that creeps on all fours: those which have jointed legs above their feet with which to leap on the earth.
Leviticus,11,22,"These you may eat: the locust after its kind, the destroying locust after its kind, the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind."
Leviticus,11,23,But all other flying insects which have four feet shall be an abomination to you.
Leviticus,11,24,‘By these you shall become unclean; whoever touches the carcass of any of them shall be unclean until evening;
Leviticus,11,25,whoever carries part of the carcass of any of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening:
Leviticus,11,26,"The carcass of any animal which divides the foot, but is not cloven-hoofed or does not chew the cud, is unclean to you. Everyone who touches it shall be unclean."
Leviticus,11,27,"And whatever goes on its paws, among all kinds of animals that go on all fours, those are unclean to you. Whoever touches any such carcass shall be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,11,28,Whoever carries any such carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. It is unclean to you.
Leviticus,11,29,"‘These also shall be unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth: the mole, the mouse, and the large lizard after its kind;"
Leviticus,11,30,"the gecko, the monitor lizard, the sand reptile, the sand lizard, and the chameleon."
Leviticus,11,31,These are unclean to you among all that creep. Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,11,32,"Anything on which any of them falls, when they are dead shall be unclean, whether it is any item of wood or clothing or skin or sack, whatever item it is, in which any work is done, it must be put in water. And it shall be unclean until evening; then it shall be clean."
Leviticus,11,33,Any earthen vessel into which any of them falls you shall break; and whatever is in it shall be unclean:
Leviticus,11,34,"in such a vessel, any edible food upon which water falls becomes unclean, and any drink that may be drunk from it becomes unclean."
Leviticus,11,35,"And everything on which a part of any such carcass falls shall be unclean; whether it is an oven or cooking stove, it shall be broken down; for they are unclean, and shall be unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,36,"Nevertheless a spring or a cistern, in which there is plenty of water, shall be clean, but whatever touches any such carcass becomes unclean."
Leviticus,11,37,"And if a part of any such carcass falls on any planting seed which is to be sown, it remains clean."
Leviticus,11,38,"But if water is put on the seed, and if a part of any such carcass falls on it, it becomes unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,39,"‘And if any animal which you may eat dies, he who touches its carcass shall be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,11,40,He who eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. He also who carries its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,11,41,‘And every creeping thing that creeps on the earth shall be an abomination. It shall not be eaten.
Leviticus,11,42,"Whatever crawls on its belly, whatever goes on all fours, or whatever has many feet among all creeping things that creep on the earth—these you shall not eat, for they are an abomination."
Leviticus,11,43,"You shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creeps; nor shall you make yourselves unclean with them, lest you be defiled by them."
Leviticus,11,44,"For I am the LORD your God. You shall therefore consecrate yourselves, and you shall be holy; for I am holy. Neither shall you defile yourselves with any creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
Leviticus,11,45,"For I am the LORD who brings you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy."
Leviticus,11,46,"‘This is the law of the animals and the birds and every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that creeps on the earth,"
Leviticus,11,47,"to distinguish between the unclean and the clean, and between the animal that may be eaten and the animal that may not be eaten.’”"
Leviticus,12,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,12,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘If a woman has conceived, and borne a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of her customary impurity she shall be unclean."
Leviticus,12,3,And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
Leviticus,12,4,"She shall then continue in the blood of her purification thirty-three days. She shall not touch any hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary until the days of her purification are fulfilled."
Leviticus,12,5,"‘But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her customary impurity, and she shall continue in the blood of her purification sixty-six days."
Leviticus,12,6,"‘When the days of her purification are fulfilled, whether for a son or a daughter, she shall bring to the priest a lamb of the first year as a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove as a sin offering, to the door of the tabernacle of meeting."
Leviticus,12,7,"Then he shall offer it before the LORD, and make atonement for her. And she shall be clean from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who has borne a male or a female."
Leviticus,12,8,"‘And if she is not able to bring a lamb, then she may bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons—one as a burnt offering and the other as a sin offering. So the priest shall make atonement for her, and she will be clean.’”"
Leviticus,13,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:"
Leviticus,13,2,"“When a man has on the skin of his body a swelling, a scab, or a bright spot, and it becomes on the skin of his body like a leprous sore, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests."
Leviticus,13,3,"The priest shall examine the sore on the skin of the body; and if the hair on the sore has turned white, and the sore appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a leprous sore. Then the priest shall examine him, and pronounce him unclean."
Leviticus,13,4,"But if the bright spot is white on the skin of his body, and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and its hair has not turned white, then the priest shall isolate the one who has the sore seven days."
Leviticus,13,5,"And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day; and indeed if the sore appears to be as it was, and the sore has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall isolate him another seven days."
Leviticus,13,6,"Then the priest shall examine him again on the seventh day; and indeed if the sore has faded, and the sore has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only a scab, and he shall wash his clothes and be clean."
Leviticus,13,7,"But if the scab should at all spread over the skin, after he has been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen by the priest again."
Leviticus,13,8,"And if the priest sees that the scab has indeed spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is leprosy."
Leviticus,13,9,"“When the leprous sore is on a person, then he shall be brought to the priest."
Leviticus,13,10,"And the priest shall examine him; and indeed if the swelling on the skin is white, and it has turned the hair white, and there is a spot of raw flesh in the swelling,"
Leviticus,13,11,"it is an old leprosy on the skin of his body. The priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not isolate him, for he is unclean."
Leviticus,13,12,"“And if leprosy breaks out all over the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of the one who has the sore, from his head to his foot, wherever the priest looks,"
Leviticus,13,13,"then the priest shall consider; and indeed if the leprosy has covered all his body, he shall pronounce him clean who has the sore. It has all turned white. He is clean."
Leviticus,13,14,"But when raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean."
Leviticus,13,15,And the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him to be unclean; for the raw flesh is unclean. It is leprosy.
Leviticus,13,16,"Or if the raw flesh changes and turns white again, he shall come to the priest."
Leviticus,13,17,"And the priest shall examine him; and indeed if the sore has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him clean who has the sore. He is clean."
Leviticus,13,18,"“If the body develops a boil in the skin, and it is healed,"
Leviticus,13,19,"and in the place of the boil there comes a white swelling or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it shall be shown to the priest;"
Leviticus,13,20,"and if, when the priest sees it, it indeed appears deeper than the skin, and its hair has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a leprous sore which has broken out of the boil."
Leviticus,13,21,"But if the priest examines it, and indeed there are no white hairs in it, and it is not deeper than the skin, but has faded, then the priest shall isolate him seven days;"
Leviticus,13,22,"and if it should at all spread over the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a leprous sore."
Leviticus,13,23,"But if the bright spot stays in one place, and has not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean."
Leviticus,13,24,"“Or if the body receives a burn on its skin by fire, and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot, reddish-white or white,"
Leviticus,13,25,"then the priest shall examine it; and indeed if the hair of the bright spot has turned white, and it appears deeper than the skin, it is leprosy broken out in the burn. Therefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a leprous sore."
Leviticus,13,26,"But if the priest examines it, and indeed there are no white hairs in the bright spot, and it is not deeper than the skin, but has faded, then the priest shall isolate him seven days."
Leviticus,13,27,"And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day. If it has at all spread over the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a leprous sore."
Leviticus,13,28,"But if the bright spot stays in one place, and has not spread on the skin, but has faded, it is a swelling from the burn. The priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the scar from the burn."
Leviticus,13,29,"“If a man or woman has a sore on the head or the beard,"
Leviticus,13,30,"then the priest shall examine the sore; and indeed if it appears deeper than the skin, and there is in it thin yellow hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a scaly leprosy of the head or beard."
Leviticus,13,31,"But if the priest examines the scaly sore, and indeed it does not appear deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall isolate the one who has the scale seven days."
Leviticus,13,32,"And on the seventh day the priest shall examine the sore; and indeed if the scale has not spread, and there is no yellow hair in it, and the scale does not appear deeper than the skin,"
Leviticus,13,33,"he shall shave himself, but the scale he shall not shave. And the priest shall isolate the one who has the scale another seven days."
Leviticus,13,34,"On the seventh day the priest shall examine the scale; and indeed if the scale has not spread over the skin, and does not appear deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. He shall wash his clothes and be clean."
Leviticus,13,35,"But if the scale should at all spread over the skin after his cleansing,"
Leviticus,13,36,"then the priest shall examine him; and indeed if the scale has spread over the skin, the priest need not seek for yellow hair. He is unclean."
Leviticus,13,37,"But if the scale appears to be at a standstill, and there is black hair grown up in it, the scale has healed. He is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean."
Leviticus,13,38,"“If a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the body, specifically white bright spots,"
Leviticus,13,39,"then the priest shall look; and indeed if the bright spots on the skin of the body are dull white, it is a white spot that grows on the skin. He is clean."
Leviticus,13,40,"“As for the man whose hair has fallen from his head, he is bald, but he is clean."
Leviticus,13,41,"He whose hair has fallen from his forehead, he is bald on the forehead, but he is clean."
Leviticus,13,42,"And if there is on the bald head or bald forehead a reddish-white sore, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead."
Leviticus,13,43,"Then the priest shall examine it; and indeed if the swelling of the sore is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy on the skin of the body,"
Leviticus,13,44,he is a leprous man. He is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his sore is on his head.
Leviticus,13,45,"“Now the leper on whom the sore is, his clothes shall be torn and his head bare; and he shall cover his mustache, and cry, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’"
Leviticus,13,46,"He shall be unclean. All the days he has the sore he shall be unclean. He is unclean, and he shall dwell alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp."
Leviticus,13,47,"“Also, if a garment has a leprous plague in it, whether it is a woolen garment or a linen garment,"
Leviticus,13,48,"whether it is in the warp or woof of linen or wool, whether in leather or in anything made of leather,"
Leviticus,13,49,"and if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in anything made of leather, it is a leprous plague and shall be shown to the priest."
Leviticus,13,50,The priest shall examine the plague and isolate that which has the plague seven days.
Leviticus,13,51,"And he shall examine the plague on the seventh day. If the plague has spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, in the leather or in anything made of leather, the plague is an active leprosy. It is unclean."
Leviticus,13,52,"He shall therefore burn that garment in which is the plague, whether warp or woof, in wool or in linen, or anything of leather, for it is an active leprosy; the garment shall be burned in the fire."
Leviticus,13,53,"“But if the priest examines it, and indeed the plague has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in anything made of leather,"
Leviticus,13,54,then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which is the plague; and he shall isolate it another seven days.
Leviticus,13,55,"Then the priest shall examine the plague after it has been washed; and indeed if the plague has not changed its color, though the plague has not spread, it is unclean, and you shall burn it in the fire; it continues eating away, whether the damage is outside or inside."
Leviticus,13,56,"If the priest examines it, and indeed the plague has faded after washing it, then he shall tear it out of the garment, whether out of the warp or out of the woof, or out of the leather."
Leviticus,13,57,"But if it appears again in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in anything made of leather, it is a spreading plague; you shall burn with fire that in which is the plague."
Leviticus,13,58,"And if you wash the garment, either warp or woof, or whatever is made of leather, if the plague has disappeared from it, then it shall be washed a second time, and shall be clean."
Leviticus,13,59,"“This is the law of the leprous plague in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp or woof, or in anything made of leather, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean.”"
Leviticus,14,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,14,2,“This shall be the law of the leper for the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest.
Leviticus,14,3,"And the priest shall go out of the camp, and the priest shall examine him; and indeed, if the leprosy is healed in the leper,"
Leviticus,14,4,"then the priest shall command to take for him who is to be cleansed two living and clean birds, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop."
Leviticus,14,5,And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water.
Leviticus,14,6,"As for the living bird, he shall take it, the cedar wood and the scarlet and the hyssop, and dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water."
Leviticus,14,7,"And he shall sprinkle it seven times on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose in the open field."
Leviticus,14,8,"He who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean. After that he shall come into the camp, and shall stay outside his tent seven days."
Leviticus,14,9,"But on the seventh day he shall shave all the hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows—all his hair he shall shave off. He shall wash his clothes and wash his body in water, and he shall be clean."
Leviticus,14,10,"“And on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and one log of oil."
Leviticus,14,11,"Then the priest who makes him clean shall present the man who is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of meeting."
Leviticus,14,12,"And the priest shall take one male lamb and offer it as a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them as a wave offering before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,13,"Then he shall kill the lamb in the place where he kills the sin offering and the burnt offering, in a holy place; for as the sin offering is the priest’s, so is the trespass offering. It is most holy."
Leviticus,14,14,"The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot."
Leviticus,14,15,"And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand."
Leviticus,14,16,"Then the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,17,"And of the rest of the oil in his hand, the priest shall put some on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the blood of the trespass offering."
Leviticus,14,18,The rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed. So the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD.
Leviticus,14,19,"“Then the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness. Afterward he shall kill the burnt offering."
Leviticus,14,20,"And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. So the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean."
Leviticus,14,21,"“But if he is poor and cannot afford it, then he shall take one male lamb as a trespass offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, a log of oil,"
Leviticus,14,22,"and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, such as he is able to afford: one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering."
Leviticus,14,23,"He shall bring them to the priest on the eighth day for his cleansing, to the door of the tabernacle of meeting, before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,24,"And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,25,"Then he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering and put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot."
Leviticus,14,26,And the priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand.
Leviticus,14,27,Then the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD.
Leviticus,14,28,"And the priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, on the thumb of the right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the trespass offering."
Leviticus,14,29,"The rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,30,"And he shall offer one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, such as he can afford—"
Leviticus,14,31,"such as he is able to afford, the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, with the grain offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him who is to be cleansed before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,32,"This is the law for one who had a leprous sore, who cannot afford the usual cleansing.”"
Leviticus,14,33,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:"
Leviticus,14,34,"“When you have come into the land of Canaan, which I give you as a possession, and I put the leprous plague in a house in the land of your possession,"
Leviticus,14,35,"and he who owns the house comes and tells the priest, saying, ‘It seems to me that there is some plague in the house,’"
Leviticus,14,36,"then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goes into it to examine the plague, that all that is in the house may not be made unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to examine the house."
Leviticus,14,37,"And he shall examine the plague; and indeed if the plague is on the walls of the house with ingrained streaks, greenish or reddish, which appear to be deep in the wall,"
Leviticus,14,38,"then the priest shall go out of the house, to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days."
Leviticus,14,39,"And the priest shall come again on the seventh day and look; and indeed if the plague has spread on the walls of the house,"
Leviticus,14,40,"then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which is the plague, and they shall cast them into an unclean place outside the city."
Leviticus,14,41,"And he shall cause the house to be scraped inside, all around, and the dust that they scrape off they shall pour out in an unclean place outside the city."
Leviticus,14,42,"Then they shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones, and he shall take other mortar and plaster the house."
Leviticus,14,43,"“Now if the plague comes back and breaks out in the house, after he has taken away the stones, after he has scraped the house, and after it is plastered,"
Leviticus,14,44,"then the priest shall come and look; and indeed if the plague has spread in the house, it is an active leprosy in the house. It is unclean."
Leviticus,14,45,"And he shall break down the house, its stones, its timber, and all the plaster of the house, and he shall carry them outside the city to an unclean place."
Leviticus,14,46,Moreover he who goes into the house at all while it is shut up shall be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,14,47,"And he who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes, and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes."
Leviticus,14,48,"“But if the priest comes in and examines it, and indeed the plague has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed."
Leviticus,14,49,"And he shall take, to cleanse the house, two birds, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop."
Leviticus,14,50,Then he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water;
Leviticus,14,51,"and he shall take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times."
Leviticus,14,52,"And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and the running water and the living bird, with the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet."
Leviticus,14,53,"Then he shall let the living bird loose outside the city in the open field, and make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean."
Leviticus,14,54,"“This is the law for any leprous sore and scale,"
Leviticus,14,55,"for the leprosy of a garment and of a house,"
Leviticus,14,56,"for a swelling and a scab and a bright spot,"
Leviticus,14,57,to teach when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law of leprosy.”
Leviticus,15,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,"
Leviticus,15,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When any man has a discharge from his body, his discharge is unclean."
Leviticus,15,3,"And this shall be his uncleanness in regard to his discharge—whether his body runs with his discharge, or his body is stopped up by his discharge, it is his uncleanness."
Leviticus,15,4,"Every bed is unclean on which he who has the discharge lies, and everything on which he sits shall be unclean."
Leviticus,15,5,"And whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,6,"He who sits on anything on which he who has the discharge sat shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,7,"And he who touches the body of him who has the discharge shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,8,"If he who has the discharge spits on him who is clean, then he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,9,Any saddle on which he who has the discharge rides shall be unclean.
Leviticus,15,10,"Whoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean until evening. He who carries any of those things shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,11,"And whomever the one who has the discharge touches, and has not rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,12,"The vessel of earth that he who has the discharge touches shall be broken, and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water."
Leviticus,15,13,"‘And when he who has a discharge is cleansed of his discharge, then he shall count for himself seven days for his cleansing, wash his clothes, and bathe his body in running water; then he shall be clean."
Leviticus,15,14,"On the eighth day he shall take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and come before the LORD, to the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and give them to the priest."
Leviticus,15,15,"Then the priest shall offer them, the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD because of his discharge."
Leviticus,15,16,"‘If any man has an emission of semen, then he shall wash all his body in water, and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,17,"And any garment and any leather on which there is semen, it shall be washed with water, and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,18,"Also, when a woman lies with a man, and there is an emission of semen, they shall bathe in water, and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,19,"‘If a woman has a discharge, and the discharge from her body is blood, she shall be set apart seven days; and whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,20,Everything that she lies on during her impurity shall be unclean; also everything that she sits on shall be unclean.
Leviticus,15,21,"Whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,22,"And whoever touches anything that she sat on shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,23,"If anything is on her bed or on anything on which she sits, when he touches it, he shall be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,24,"And if any man lies with her at all, so that her impurity is on him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean."
Leviticus,15,25,"‘If a woman has a discharge of blood for many days, other than at the time of her customary impurity, or if it runs beyond her usual time of impurity, all the days of her unclean discharge shall be as the days of her customary impurity. She shall be unclean."
Leviticus,15,26,"Every bed on which she lies all the days of her discharge shall be to her as the bed of her impurity; and whatever she sits on shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her impurity."
Leviticus,15,27,"Whoever touches those things shall be unclean; he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,28,"‘But if she is cleansed of her discharge, then she shall count for herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean."
Leviticus,15,29,"And on the eighth day she shall take for herself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and bring them to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of meeting."
Leviticus,15,30,"Then the priest shall offer the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, and the priest shall make atonement for her before the LORD for the discharge of her uncleanness."
Leviticus,15,31,"‘Thus you shall separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness, lest they die in their uncleanness when they defile My tabernacle that is among them."
Leviticus,15,32,"This is the law for one who has a discharge, and for him who emits semen and is unclean thereby,"
Leviticus,15,33,"and for her who is indisposed because of her customary impurity, and for one who has a discharge, either man or woman, and for him who lies with her who is unclean.’”"
Leviticus,16,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered profane fire before the LORD, and died;"
Leviticus,16,2,"and the LORD said to Moses: “Tell Aaron your brother not to come at just any time into the Holy Place inside the veil, before the mercy seat which is on the ark, lest he die; for I will appear in the cloud above the mercy seat."
Leviticus,16,3,"“Thus Aaron shall come into the Holy Place: with the blood of a young bull as a sin offering, and of a ram as a burnt offering."
Leviticus,16,4,"He shall put the holy linen tunic and the linen trousers on his body; he shall be girded with a linen sash, and with the linen turban he shall be attired. These are holy garments. Therefore he shall wash his body in water, and put them on."
Leviticus,16,5,"And he shall take from the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats as a sin offering, and one ram as a burnt offering."
Leviticus,16,6,"“Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house."
Leviticus,16,7,He shall take the two goats and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.
Leviticus,16,8,Then Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats: one lot for the LORD and the other lot for the scapegoat.
Leviticus,16,9,"And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the LORD’s lot fell, and offer it as a sin offering."
Leviticus,16,10,"But the goat on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make atonement upon it, and to let it go as the scapegoat into the wilderness."
Leviticus,16,11,"“And Aaron shall bring the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house, and shall kill the bull as the sin offering which is for himself."
Leviticus,16,12,"Then he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from the altar before the LORD, with his hands full of sweet incense beaten fine, and bring it inside the veil."
Leviticus,16,13,"And he shall put the incense on the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the Testimony, lest he die."
Leviticus,16,14,He shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat on the east side; and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.
Leviticus,16,15,"“Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering, which is for the people, bring its blood inside the veil, do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat and before the mercy seat."
Leviticus,16,16,"So he shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, for all their sins; and so he shall do for the tabernacle of meeting which remains among them in the midst of their uncleanness."
Leviticus,16,17,"There shall be no man in the tabernacle of meeting when he goes in to make atonement in the Holy Place, until he comes out, that he may make atonement for himself, for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel."
Leviticus,16,18,"And he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD, and make atonement for it, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar all around."
Leviticus,16,19,"Then he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, cleanse it, and consecrate it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel."
Leviticus,16,20,"“And when he has made an end of atoning for the Holy Place, the tabernacle of meeting, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat."
Leviticus,16,21,"Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, concerning all their sins, putting them on the head of the goat, and shall send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a suitable man."
Leviticus,16,22,The goat shall bear on itself all their iniquities to an uninhabited land; and he shall release the goat in the wilderness.
Leviticus,16,23,"“Then Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of meeting, shall take off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the Holy Place, and shall leave them there."
Leviticus,16,24,"And he shall wash his body with water in a holy place, put on his garments, come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people."
Leviticus,16,25,The fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar.
Leviticus,16,26,"And he who released the goat as the scapegoat shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp."
Leviticus,16,27,"The bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be carried outside the camp. And they shall burn in the fire their skins, their flesh, and their offal."
Leviticus,16,28,"Then he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp."
Leviticus,16,29,"“This shall be a statute forever for you: In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether a native of your own country or a stranger who dwells among you."
Leviticus,16,30,"For on that day the priest shall make atonement for you, to cleanse you, that you may be clean from all your sins before the LORD."
Leviticus,16,31,"It is a sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you shall afflict your souls. It is a statute forever."
Leviticus,16,32,"And the priest, who is anointed and consecrated to minister as priest in his father’s place, shall make atonement, and put on the linen clothes, the holy garments;"
Leviticus,16,33,"then he shall make atonement for the Holy Sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tabernacle of meeting and for the altar, and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly."
Leviticus,16,34,"This shall be an everlasting statute for you, to make atonement for the children of Israel, for all their sins, once a year.” And he did as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,17,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,17,2,"“Speak to Aaron, to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, ‘This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, saying:"
Leviticus,17,3,"“Whatever man of the house of Israel who kills an ox or lamb or goat in the camp, or who kills it outside the camp,"
Leviticus,17,4,"and does not bring it to the door of the tabernacle of meeting to offer an offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD, the guilt of bloodshed shall be imputed to that man. He has shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people,"
Leviticus,17,5,"to the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they offer in the open field, that they may bring them to the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of meeting, to the priest, and offer them as peace offerings to the LORD."
Leviticus,17,6,"And the priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and burn the fat for a sweet aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,17,7,"They shall no more offer their sacrifices to demons, after whom they have played the harlot. This shall be a statute forever for them throughout their generations.”’"
Leviticus,17,8,"“Also you shall say to them: ‘Whatever man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who dwell among you, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,"
Leviticus,17,9,"and does not bring it to the door of the tabernacle of meeting, to offer it to the LORD, that man shall be cut off from among his people."
Leviticus,17,10,"‘And whatever man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who dwell among you, who eats any blood, I will set My face against that person who eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people."
Leviticus,17,11,"For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul.’"
Leviticus,17,12,"Therefore I said to the children of Israel, ‘No one among you shall eat blood, nor shall any stranger who dwells among you eat blood.’"
Leviticus,17,13,"“Whatever man of the children of Israel, or of the strangers who dwell among you, who hunts and catches any animal or bird that may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with dust;"
Leviticus,17,14,"for it is the life of all flesh. Its blood sustains its life. Therefore I said to the children of Israel, ‘You shall not eat the blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood. Whoever eats it shall be cut off.’"
Leviticus,17,15,"“And every person who eats what died naturally or what was torn by beasts, whether he is a native of your own country or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. Then he shall be clean."
Leviticus,17,16,"But if he does not wash them or bathe his body, then he shall bear his guilt.”"

Leviticus,18,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,18,3,"According to the doings of the land of Egypt, where you dwelt, you shall not do; and according to the doings of the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you, you shall not do; nor shall you walk in their ordinances."

Leviticus,18,22,You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination.
Leviticus,18,23,"Nor shall you mate with any animal, to defile yourself with it. Nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it. It is perversion."

Leviticus,18,28,"lest the land vomit you out also when you defile it, as it vomited out the nations that were before you."
Leviticus,18,29,"For whoever commits any of these abominations, the persons who commit them shall be cut off from among their people."

Leviticus,22,16,or allow them to bear the guilt of trespass when they eat their holy offerings; for I the LORD sanctify them.’”
Leviticus,22,17,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,22,18,"“Speak to Aaron and his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘Whatever man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, who offers his sacrifice for any of his vows or for any of his freewill offerings, which they offer to the LORD as a burnt offering—"
Leviticus,22,19,"you shall offer of your own free will a male without blemish from the cattle, from the sheep, or from the goats."
Leviticus,22,20,"Whatever has a defect, you shall not offer, for it shall not be acceptable on your behalf."
Leviticus,22,21,"And whoever offers a sacrifice of a peace offering to the LORD, to fulfill his vow, or a freewill offering from the cattle or the sheep, it must be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no defect in it."
Leviticus,22,22,"Those that are blind or broken or maimed, or have an ulcer or eczema or scabs, you shall not offer to the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to the LORD."
Leviticus,22,23,"Either a bull or a lamb that has any limb too long or too short you may offer as a freewill offering, but for a vow it shall not be accepted."
Leviticus,22,24,"‘You shall not offer to the LORD what is bruised or crushed, or torn or cut; nor shall you make any offering of them in your land."
Leviticus,22,25,"Nor from a foreigner’s hand shall you offer any of these as the bread of your God, because their corruption is in them, and defects are in them. They shall not be accepted on your behalf.’”"
Leviticus,22,26,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Leviticus,22,27,"“When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall be seven days with its mother; and from the eighth day and thereafter it shall be accepted as an offering made by fire to the LORD."
Leviticus,22,28,"Whether it is a cow or ewe, do not kill both her and her young on the same day."
Leviticus,22,29,"And when you offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, offer it of your own free will."
Leviticus,22,30,On the same day it shall be eaten; you shall leave none of it until morning: I am the LORD.
Leviticus,22,31,"“Therefore you shall keep My commandments, and perform them: I am the LORD."
Leviticus,22,32,"You shall not profane My holy name, but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel. I am the LORD who sanctifies you,"
Leviticus,22,33,"who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD.”"
Leviticus,23,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘The feasts of the LORD, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, these are My feasts."
Leviticus,23,3,"‘Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work on it; it is the Sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings."
Leviticus,23,4,"‘These are the feasts of the LORD, holy convocations which you shall proclaim at their appointed times."
Leviticus,23,5,On the fourteenth day of the first month at twilight is the LORD’s Passover.
Leviticus,23,6,And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD; seven days you must eat unleavened bread.
Leviticus,23,7,On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no customary work on it.
Leviticus,23,8,But you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD for seven days. The seventh day shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no customary work on it.’”
Leviticus,23,9,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,10,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When you come into the land which I give to you, and reap its harvest, then you shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest."
Leviticus,23,11,"He shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted on your behalf; on the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it."
Leviticus,23,12,"And you shall offer on that day, when you wave the sheaf, a male lamb of the first year, without blemish, as a burnt offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,13,"Its grain offering shall be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering made by fire to the LORD, for a sweet aroma; and its drink offering shall be of wine, one-fourth of a hin."
Leviticus,23,14,You shall eat neither bread nor parched grain nor fresh grain until the same day that you have brought an offering to your God; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Leviticus,23,15,"‘And you shall count for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering: seven Sabbaths shall be completed."
Leviticus,23,16,Count fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath; then you shall offer a new grain offering to the LORD.
Leviticus,23,17,You shall bring from your dwellings two wave loaves of two-tenths of an ephah. They shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven. They are the firstfruits to the LORD.
Leviticus,23,18,"And you shall offer with the bread seven lambs of the first year, without blemish, one young bull, and two rams. They shall be as a burnt offering to the LORD, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering made by fire for a sweet aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,19,"Then you shall sacrifice one kid of the goats as a sin offering, and two male lambs of the first year as a sacrifice of a peace offering."
Leviticus,23,20,"The priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to the LORD for the priest."
Leviticus,23,21,And you shall proclaim on the same day that it is a holy convocation to you. You shall do no customary work on it. It shall be a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
Leviticus,23,22,"‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field when you reap, nor shall you gather any gleaning from your harvest. You shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God.’”"
Leviticus,23,23,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,24,"“Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a sabbath-rest, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation."
Leviticus,23,25,You shall do no customary work on it; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.’”
Leviticus,23,26,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Leviticus,23,27,"“Also the tenth day of this seventh month shall be the Day of Atonement. It shall be a holy convocation for you; you shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,28,"And you shall do no work on that same day, for it is the Day of Atonement, to make atonement for you before the LORD your God."
Leviticus,23,29,For any person who is not afflicted in soul on that same day shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus,23,30,"And any person who does any work on that same day, that person I will destroy from among his people."
Leviticus,23,31,You shall do no manner of work; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Leviticus,23,32,"It shall be to you a sabbath of solemn rest, and you shall afflict your souls; on the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall celebrate your sabbath.”"
Leviticus,23,33,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,34,"“Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,35,On the first day there shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work on it.
Leviticus,23,36,"For seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD. It is a sacred assembly, and you shall do no customary work on it."
Leviticus,23,37,"‘These are the feasts of the LORD which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering and a grain offering, a sacrifice and drink offerings, everything on its day—"
Leviticus,23,38,"besides the Sabbaths of the LORD, besides your gifts, besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill offerings which you give to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,39,"‘Also on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land, you shall keep the feast of the LORD for seven days; on the first day there shall be a sabbath-rest, and on the eighth day a sabbath-rest."
Leviticus,23,40,"And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palm trees, the boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days."
Leviticus,23,41,You shall keep it as a feast to the LORD for seven days in the year. It shall be a statute forever in your generations. You shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
Leviticus,23,42,"You shall dwell in booths for seven days. All who are native Israelites shall dwell in booths,"
Leviticus,23,43,that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.’”
Leviticus,23,44,So Moses declared to the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.
Leviticus,24,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Leviticus,24,2,"“Command the children of Israel that they bring to you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to make the lamps burn continually."
Leviticus,24,3,"Outside the veil of the Testimony, in the tabernacle of meeting, Aaron shall be in charge of it from evening until morning before the LORD continually; it shall be a statute forever in your generations."
Leviticus,24,4,He shall be in charge of the lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD continually.
Leviticus,24,5,“And you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it. Two-tenths of an ephah shall be in each cake.
Leviticus,24,6,"You shall set them in two rows, six in a row, on the pure gold table before the LORD."
Leviticus,24,7,"And you shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, an offering made by fire to the LORD."
Leviticus,24,8,"Every Sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant."
Leviticus,24,9,"And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy to him from the offerings of the LORD made by fire, by a perpetual statute.”"
Leviticus,24,10,"Now the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and this Israelite woman’s son and a man of Israel fought each other in the camp."
Leviticus,24,11,"And the Israelite woman’s son blasphemed the name of the LORD and cursed; and so they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)"
Leviticus,24,12,"Then they put him in custody, that the mind of the LORD might be shown to them."
Leviticus,24,13,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,24,14,"“Take outside the camp him who has cursed; then let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him."
Leviticus,24,15,"“Then you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin."
Leviticus,24,16,"And whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall certainly stone him, the stranger as well as him who is born in the land. When he blasphemes the name of the LORD, he shall be put to death."
Leviticus,24,17,‘Whoever kills any man shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus,24,18,"Whoever kills an animal shall make it good, animal for animal."
Leviticus,24,19,"‘If a man causes disfigurement of his neighbor, as he has done, so shall it be done to him—"
Leviticus,24,20,"fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has caused disfigurement of a man, so shall it be done to him."
Leviticus,24,21,And whoever kills an animal shall restore it; but whoever kills a man shall be put to death.
Leviticus,24,22,You shall have the same law for the stranger and for one from your own country; for I am the LORD your God.’”
Leviticus,24,23,"Then Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they took outside the camp him who had cursed, and stoned him with stones. So the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,25,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying,"
Leviticus,25,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When you come into the land which I give you, then the land shall keep a sabbath to the LORD."
Leviticus,25,3,"Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and gather its fruit;"
Leviticus,25,4,"but in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath to the LORD. You shall neither sow your field nor prune your vineyard."
Leviticus,25,5,"What grows of its own accord of your harvest you shall not reap, nor gather the grapes of your untended vine, for it is a year of rest for the land."
Leviticus,25,6,"And the sabbath produce of the land shall be food for you: for you, your male and female servants, your hired man, and the stranger who dwells with you,"
Leviticus,25,7,for your livestock and the beasts that are in your land—all its produce shall be for food.
Leviticus,25,8,"‘And you shall count seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years; and the time of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to you forty-nine years."
Leviticus,25,9,Then you shall cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement you shall make the trumpet to sound throughout all your land.
Leviticus,25,10,"And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a Jubilee for you; and each of you shall return to his possession, and each of you shall return to his family."
Leviticus,25,11,"That fiftieth year shall be a Jubilee to you; in it you shall neither sow nor reap what grows of its own accord, nor gather the grapes of your untended vine."
Leviticus,25,12,For it is the Jubilee; it shall be holy to you; you shall eat its produce from the field.
Leviticus,25,13,"‘In this Year of Jubilee, each of you shall return to his possession."
Leviticus,25,14,"And if you sell anything to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor’s hand, you shall not oppress one another."
Leviticus,25,15,"According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor, and according to the number of years of crops he shall sell to you."
Leviticus,25,16,"According to the multitude of years you shall increase its price, and according to the fewer number of years you shall diminish its price; for he sells to you according to the number of the years of the crops."
Leviticus,25,17,"Therefore you shall not oppress one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,25,18,"‘So you shall observe My statutes and keep My judgments, and perform them; and you will dwell in the land in safety."
Leviticus,25,19,"Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill, and dwell there in safety."
Leviticus,25,20,"‘And if you say, “What shall we eat in the seventh year, since we shall not sow nor gather in our produce?”"
Leviticus,25,21,"Then I will command My blessing on you in the sixth year, and it will bring forth produce enough for three years."
Leviticus,25,22,"And you shall sow in the eighth year, and eat old produce until the ninth year; until its produce comes in, you shall eat of the old harvest."
Leviticus,25,23,"‘The land shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine; for you are strangers and sojourners with Me."
Leviticus,25,24,And in all the land of your possession you shall grant redemption of the land.
Leviticus,25,25,"‘If one of your brethren becomes poor, and has sold some of his possession, and if his redeeming relative comes to redeem it, then he may redeem what his brother sold."
Leviticus,25,26,"Or if the man has no one to redeem it, but he himself becomes able to redeem it,"
Leviticus,25,27,"then let him count the years since its sale, and restore the remainder to the man to whom he sold it, that he may return to his possession."
Leviticus,25,28,"But if he is not able to have it restored to himself, then what was sold shall remain in the hand of him who bought it until the Year of Jubilee; and in the Jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his possession."
Leviticus,25,29,"‘If a man sells a house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year he may redeem it."
Leviticus,25,30,"But if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to him who bought it, throughout his generations. It shall not be released in the Jubilee."
Leviticus,25,31,"However the houses of villages which have no wall around them shall be counted as the fields of the country. They may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee."
Leviticus,25,32,"Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, and the houses in the cities of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time."
Leviticus,25,33,"And if a man purchases a house from the Levites, then the house that was sold in the city of his possession shall be released in the Jubilee; for the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel."
Leviticus,25,34,"But the field of the common-land of their cities may not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession."
Leviticus,25,35,"‘If one of your brethren becomes poor, and falls into poverty among you, then you shall help him, like a stranger or a sojourner, that he may live with you."
Leviticus,25,36,"Take no usury or interest from him; but fear your God, that your brother may live with you."
Leviticus,25,37,"You shall not lend him your money for usury, nor lend him your food at a profit."
Leviticus,25,38,"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God."
Leviticus,25,39,"‘And if one of your brethren who dwells by you becomes poor, and sells himself to you, you shall not compel him to serve as a slave."
Leviticus,25,40,"As a hired servant and a sojourner he shall be with you, and shall serve you until the Year of Jubilee."
Leviticus,25,41,And then he shall depart from you—he and his children with him—and shall return to his own family. He shall return to the possession of his fathers.
Leviticus,25,42,"For they are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves."
Leviticus,25,43,"You shall not rule over him with rigor, but you shall fear your God."
Leviticus,25,44,"And as for your male and female slaves whom you may have—from the nations that are around you, from them you may buy male and female slaves."
Leviticus,25,45,"Moreover you may buy the children of the strangers who dwell among you, and their families who are with you, which they beget in your land; and they shall become your property."
Leviticus,25,46,"And you may take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them as a possession; they shall be your permanent slaves. But regarding your brethren, the children of Israel, you shall not rule over one another with rigor."
Leviticus,25,47,"‘Now if a sojourner or stranger close to you becomes rich, and one of your brethren who dwells by him becomes poor, and sells himself to the stranger or sojourner close to you, or to a member of the stranger’s family,"
Leviticus,25,48,after he is sold he may be redeemed again. One of his brothers may redeem him;
Leviticus,25,49,or his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him; or anyone who is near of kin to him in his family may redeem him; or if he is able he may redeem himself.
Leviticus,25,50,"Thus he shall reckon with him who bought him: The price of his release shall be according to the number of years, from the year that he was sold to him until the Year of Jubilee; it shall be according to the time of a hired servant for him."
Leviticus,25,51,"If there are still many years remaining, according to them he shall repay the price of his redemption from the money with which he was bought."
Leviticus,25,52,"And if there remain but a few years until the Year of Jubilee, then he shall reckon with him, and according to his years he shall repay him the price of his redemption."
Leviticus,25,53,"He shall be with him as a yearly hired servant, and he shall not rule with rigor over him in your sight."
Leviticus,25,54,"And if he is not redeemed in these years, then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee—he and his children with him."
Leviticus,25,55,For the children of Israel are servants to Me; they are My servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus,26,1,"‘You shall not make idols for yourselves; neither a carved image nor a sacred pillar shall you rear up for yourselves; nor shall you set up an engraved stone in your land, to bow down to it; for I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,26,2,You shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary: I am the LORD.
Leviticus,26,3,"‘If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments, and perform them,"
Leviticus,26,4,"then I will give you rain in its season, the land shall yield its produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit."
Leviticus,26,5,"Your threshing shall last till the time of vintage, and the vintage shall last till the time of sowing; you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely."
Leviticus,26,6,"I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none will make you afraid; I will rid the land of evil beasts, and the sword will not go through your land."
Leviticus,26,7,"You will chase your enemies, and they shall fall by the sword before you."
Leviticus,26,8,"Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight; your enemies shall fall by the sword before you."
Leviticus,26,9,"‘For I will look on you favorably and make you fruitful, multiply you and confirm My covenant with you."
Leviticus,26,10,"You shall eat the old harvest, and clear out the old because of the new."
Leviticus,26,11,"I will set My tabernacle among you, and My soul shall not abhor you."
Leviticus,26,12,"I will walk among you and be your God, and you shall be My people."
Leviticus,26,13,"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves; I have broken the bands of your yoke and made you walk upright."
Leviticus,26,14,"‘But if you do not obey Me, and do not observe all these commandments,"
Leviticus,26,15,"and if you despise My statutes, or if your soul abhors My judgments, so that you do not perform all My commandments, but break My covenant,"
Leviticus,26,16,"I also will do this to you: I will even appoint terror over you, wasting disease and fever which shall consume the eyes and cause sorrow of heart. And you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it."
Leviticus,26,17,"I will set My face against you, and you shall be defeated by your enemies. Those who hate you shall reign over you, and you shall flee when no one pursues you."
Leviticus,26,18,"‘And after all this, if you do not obey Me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins."
Leviticus,26,19,I will break the pride of your power; I will make your heavens like iron and your earth like bronze.
Leviticus,26,20,"And your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its produce, nor shall the trees of the land yield their fruit."
Leviticus,26,21,"‘Then, if you walk contrary to Me, and are not willing to obey Me, I will bring on you seven times more plagues, according to your sins."
Leviticus,26,22,"I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and make you few in number; and your highways shall be desolate."
Leviticus,26,23,"‘And if by these things you are not reformed by Me, but walk contrary to Me,"
Leviticus,26,24,"then I also will walk contrary to you, and I will punish you yet seven times for your sins."
Leviticus,26,25,And I will bring a sword against you that will execute the vengeance of the covenant; when you are gathered together within your cities I will send pestilence among you; and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
Leviticus,26,26,"When I have cut off your supply of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall bring back your bread by weight, and you shall eat and not be satisfied."
Leviticus,26,27,"‘And after all this, if you do not obey Me, but walk contrary to Me,"
Leviticus,26,28,"then I also will walk contrary to you in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins."
Leviticus,26,29,"You shall eat the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters."
Leviticus,26,30,"I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars, and cast your carcasses on the lifeless forms of your idols; and My soul shall abhor you."
Leviticus,26,31,"I will lay your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell the fragrance of your sweet aromas."
Leviticus,26,32,"I will bring the land to desolation, and your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it."
Leviticus,26,33,I will scatter you among the nations and draw out a sword after you; your land shall be desolate and your cities waste.
Leviticus,26,34,Then the land shall enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies’ land; then the land shall rest and enjoy its sabbaths.
Leviticus,26,35,As long as it lies desolate it shall rest— for the time it did not rest on your sabbaths when you dwelt in it.
Leviticus,26,36,"‘And as for those of you who are left, I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; the sound of a shaken leaf shall cause them to flee; they shall flee as though fleeing from a sword, and they shall fall when no one pursues."
Leviticus,26,37,"They shall stumble over one another, as it were before a sword, when no one pursues; and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies."
Leviticus,26,38,"You shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up."
Leviticus,26,39,"And those of you who are left shall waste away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; also in their fathers’ iniquities, which are with them, they shall waste away."
Leviticus,26,40,"‘But if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, with their unfaithfulness in which they were unfaithful to Me, and that they also have walked contrary to Me,"
Leviticus,26,41,"and that I also have walked contrary to them and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if their uncircumcised hearts are humbled, and they accept their guilt—"
Leviticus,26,42,"then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and My covenant with Isaac and My covenant with Abraham I will remember; I will remember the land."
Leviticus,26,43,"The land also shall be left empty by them, and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them; they will accept their guilt, because they despised My judgments and because their soul abhorred My statutes."
Leviticus,26,44,"Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, nor shall I abhor them, to utterly destroy them and break My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God."
Leviticus,26,45,"But for their sake I will remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.’”"
Leviticus,26,46,These are the statutes and judgments and laws which the LORD made between Himself and the children of Israel on Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
Leviticus,27,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,27,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When a man consecrates by a vow certain persons to the LORD, according to your valuation,"
Leviticus,27,3,"if your valuation is of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary."
Leviticus,27,4,"If it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels;"
Leviticus,27,5,"and if from five years old up to twenty years old, then your valuation for a male shall be twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels;"
Leviticus,27,6,"and if from a month old up to five years old, then your valuation for a male shall be five shekels of silver, and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver;"
Leviticus,27,7,"and if from sixty years old and above, if it is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels."
Leviticus,27,8,"‘But if he is too poor to pay your valuation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall set a value for him; according to the ability of him who vowed, the priest shall value him."
Leviticus,27,9,"‘If it is an animal that men may bring as an offering to the LORD, all that anyone gives to the LORD shall be holy."
Leviticus,27,10,"He shall not substitute it or exchange it, good for bad or bad for good; and if he at all exchanges animal for animal, then both it and the one exchanged for it shall be holy."
Leviticus,27,11,"If it is an unclean animal which they do not offer as a sacrifice to the LORD, then he shall present the animal before the priest;"
Leviticus,27,12,"and the priest shall set a value for it, whether it is good or bad; as you, the priest, value it, so it shall be."
Leviticus,27,13,"But if he wants at all to redeem it, then he must add one-fifth to your valuation."
Leviticus,27,14,"‘And when a man dedicates his house to be holy to the LORD, then the priest shall set a value for it, whether it is good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand."
Leviticus,27,15,"If he who dedicated it wants to redeem his house, then he must add one-fifth of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be his."
Leviticus,27,16,"‘If a man dedicates to the LORD part of a field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it. A homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver."
Leviticus,27,17,"If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand."
Leviticus,27,18,"But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money due according to the years that remain till the Year of Jubilee, and it shall be deducted from your valuation."
Leviticus,27,19,"And if he who dedicates the field ever wishes to redeem it, then he must add one-fifth of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall belong to him."
Leviticus,27,20,"But if he does not want to redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore;"
Leviticus,27,21,"but the field, when it is released in the Jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a devoted field; it shall be the possession of the priest."
Leviticus,27,22,"‘And if a man dedicates to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not the field of his possession,"
Leviticus,27,23,"then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation, up to the Year of Jubilee, and he shall give your valuation on that day as a holy offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,24,"In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, to the one who owned the land as a possession."
Leviticus,27,25,And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs to the shekel.
Leviticus,27,26,"‘But the firstborn of the animals, which should be the LORD’s firstborn, no man shall dedicate; whether it is an ox or sheep, it is the LORD’s."
Leviticus,27,27,"And if it is an unclean animal, then he shall redeem it according to your valuation, and shall add one-fifth to it; or if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation."
Leviticus,27,28,"‘Nevertheless no devoted offering that a man may devote to the LORD of all that he has, both man and beast, or the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted offering is most holy to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,29,"No person under the ban, who may become doomed to destruction among men, shall be redeemed, but shall surely be put to death."
Leviticus,27,30,"And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD’s. It is holy to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,31,"If a man wants at all to redeem any of his tithes, he shall add one-fifth to it."
Leviticus,27,32,"And concerning the tithe of the herd or the flock, of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth one shall be holy to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,33,"He shall not inquire whether it is good or bad, nor shall he exchange it; and if he exchanges it at all, then both it and the one exchanged for it shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.’”"
Leviticus,27,34,These are the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai.
Numbers,1,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying:"

Numbers,1,46,all who were numbered were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.
Numbers,1,47,But the Levites were not numbered among them by their fathers’ tribe;
Numbers,1,48,"for the LORD had spoken to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,1,49,"“Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, nor take a census of them among the children of Israel;"
Numbers,1,50,"but you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the Testimony, over all its furnishings, and over all things that belong to it; they shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they shall attend to it and camp around the tabernacle."
Numbers,1,51,"And when the tabernacle is to go forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall set it up. The outsider who comes near shall be put to death."
Numbers,1,52,"The children of Israel shall pitch their tents, everyone by his own camp, everyone by his own standard, according to their armies;"
Numbers,1,53,"but the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the Testimony, that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Israel; and the Levites shall keep charge of the tabernacle of the Testimony.”"
Numbers,1,54,"Thus the children of Israel did; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so they did."
Numbers,2,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:"
Numbers,2,2,"“Everyone of the children of Israel shall camp by his own standard, beside the emblems of his father’s house; they shall camp some distance from the tabernacle of meeting."
Numbers,2,3,"On the east side, toward the rising of the sun, those of the standard of the forces with Judah shall camp according to their armies; and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be the leader of the children of Judah.”"
Numbers,2,4,And his army was numbered at seventy-four thousand six hundred.
Numbers,2,5,"“Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar, and Nethanel the son of Zuar shall be the leader of the children of Issachar.”"

Numbers,2,8,And his army was numbered at fifty-seven thousand four hundred.
Numbers,2,9,"“All who were numbered according to their armies of the forces with Judah, one hundred and eighty-six thousand four hundred—these shall break camp first."
Numbers,2,10,"“On the south side shall be the standard of the forces with Reuben according to their armies, and the leader of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.”"
Numbers,2,11,And his army was numbered at forty-six thousand five hundred.
Numbers,2,12,"“Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon, and the leader of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.”"
Numbers,2,13,And his army was numbered at fifty-nine thousand three hundred.
Numbers,2,14,"“Then comes the tribe of Gad, and the leader of the children of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.”"
Numbers,2,15,And his army was numbered at forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty.
Numbers,2,16,"“All who were numbered according to their armies of the forces with Reuben, one hundred and fifty-one thousand four hundred and fifty—they shall be the second to break camp."
Numbers,2,17,"“And the tabernacle of meeting shall move out with the camp of the Levites in the middle of the camps; as they camp, so they shall move out, everyone in his place, by their standards."
Numbers,2,18,"“On the west side shall be the standard of the forces with Ephraim according to their armies, and the leader of the children of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.”"
Numbers,2,19,And his army was numbered at forty thousand five hundred.
Numbers,2,20,"“Next to him comes the tribe of Manasseh, and the leader of the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.”"
Numbers,2,21,And his army was numbered at thirty-two thousand two hundred.
Numbers,2,22,"“Then comes the tribe of Benjamin, and the leader of the children of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.”"
Numbers,2,23,And his army was numbered at thirty-five thousand four hundred.
Numbers,2,24,"“All who were numbered according to their armies of the forces with Ephraim, one hundred and eight thousand one hundred—they shall be the third to break camp."

Numbers,2,32,These are the ones who were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers’ houses. All who were numbered according to their armies of the forces were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.
Numbers,2,33,"But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel, just as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,2,34,"Thus the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses; so they camped by their standards and so they broke camp, each one by his family, according to their fathers’ houses."
Numbers,3,1,Now these are the records of Aaron and Moses when the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
Numbers,3,2,"And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab, the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
Numbers,3,3,"These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he consecrated to minister as priests."
Numbers,3,4,Nadab and Abihu had died before the LORD when they offered profane fire before the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai; and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar ministered as priests in the presence of Aaron their father.
Numbers,3,5,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,3,6,"“Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may serve him."
Numbers,3,7,"And they shall attend to his needs and the needs of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of meeting, to do the work of the tabernacle."
Numbers,3,8,"Also they shall attend to all the furnishings of the tabernacle of meeting, and to the needs of the children of Israel, to do the work of the tabernacle."
Numbers,3,9,And you shall give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are given entirely to him from among the children of Israel.
Numbers,3,10,"So you shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall attend to their priesthood; but the outsider who comes near shall be put to death.”"
Numbers,3,11,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,3,12,"“Now behold, I Myself have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of every firstborn who opens the womb among the children of Israel. Therefore the Levites shall be Mine,"
Numbers,3,13,"because all the firstborn are Mine. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified to Myself all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast. They shall be Mine: I am the LORD.”"
Numbers,3,14,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, saying:"
Numbers,3,15,"“Number the children of Levi by their fathers’ houses, by their families; you shall number every male from a month old and above.”"
Numbers,3,16,"So Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded."
Numbers,3,17,"These were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
Numbers,3,18,And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei.
Numbers,3,19,"And the sons of Kohath by their families: Amram, Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel."
Numbers,3,20,And the sons of Merari by their families: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites by their fathers’ houses.
Numbers,3,21,From Gershon came the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimites; these were the families of the Gershonites.
Numbers,3,22,"Those who were numbered, according to the number of all the males from a month old and above—of those who were numbered there were seven thousand five hundred."
Numbers,3,23,The families of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle westward.
Numbers,3,24,And the leader of the father’s house of the Gershonites was Eliasaph the son of Lael.
Numbers,3,25,"The duties of the children of Gershon in the tabernacle of meeting included the tabernacle, the tent with its covering, the screen for the door of the tabernacle of meeting,"
Numbers,3,26,"the screen for the door of the court, the hangings of the court which are around the tabernacle and the altar, and their cords, according to all the work relating to them."
Numbers,3,27,"From Kohath came the family of the Amramites, the family of the Izharites, the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites; these were the families of the Kohathites."
Numbers,3,28,"According to the number of all the males, from a month old and above, there were eight thousand six hundred keeping charge of the sanctuary."
Numbers,3,29,The families of the children of Kohath were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle.
Numbers,3,30,And the leader of the fathers’ house of the families of the Kohathites was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.
Numbers,3,31,"Their duty included the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the utensils of the sanctuary with which they ministered, the screen, and all the work relating to them."
Numbers,3,32,"And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest was to be chief over the leaders of the Levites, with oversight of those who kept charge of the sanctuary."
Numbers,3,33,From Merari came the family of the Mahlites and the family of the Mushites; these were the families of Merari.
Numbers,3,34,"And those who were numbered, according to the number of all the males from a month old and above, were six thousand two hundred."
Numbers,3,35,The leader of the fathers’ house of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail. These were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.
Numbers,3,36,"And the appointed duty of the children of Merari included the boards of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its sockets, its utensils, all the work relating to them,"
Numbers,3,37,"and the pillars of the court all around, with their sockets, their pegs, and their cords."
Numbers,3,38,"Moreover those who were to camp before the tabernacle on the east, before the tabernacle of meeting, were Moses, Aaron, and his sons, keeping charge of the sanctuary, to meet the needs of the children of Israel; but the outsider who came near was to be put to death."
Numbers,3,39,"All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, by their families, all the males from a month old and above, were twenty-two thousand."
Numbers,3,40,"Then the LORD said to Moses: “Number all the firstborn males of the children of Israel from a month old and above, and take the number of their names."
Numbers,3,41,"And you shall take the Levites for Me—I am the LORD—instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the livestock of the children of Israel.”"
Numbers,3,42,"So Moses numbered all the firstborn among the children of Israel, as the LORD commanded him."
Numbers,3,43,"And all the firstborn males, according to the number of names from a month old and above, of those who were numbered of them, were twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three."
Numbers,3,44,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,3,45,"“Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites instead of their livestock. The Levites shall be Mine: I am the LORD."
Numbers,3,46,"And for the redemption of the two hundred and seventy-three of the firstborn of the children of Israel, who are more than the number of the Levites,"
Numbers,3,47,"you shall take five shekels for each one individually; you shall take them in the currency of the shekel of the sanctuary, the shekel of twenty gerahs."
Numbers,3,48,"And you shall give the money, with which the excess number of them is redeemed, to Aaron and his sons.”"
Numbers,3,49,So Moses took the redemption money from those who were over and above those who were redeemed by the Levites.
Numbers,3,50,"From the firstborn of the children of Israel he took the money, one thousand three hundred and sixty-five shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary."
Numbers,3,51,"And Moses gave their redemption money to Aaron and his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,4,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:"
Numbers,4,2,"“Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among the children of Levi, by their families, by their fathers’ house,"
Numbers,4,3,"from thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, all who enter the service to do the work in the tabernacle of meeting."
Numbers,4,4,"“This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of meeting, relating to the most holy things:"
Numbers,4,5,"When the camp prepares to journey, Aaron and his sons shall come, and they shall take down the covering veil and cover the ark of the Testimony with it."
Numbers,4,6,"Then they shall put on it a covering of badger skins, and spread over that a cloth entirely of blue; and they shall insert its poles."
Numbers,4,7,"“On the table of showbread they shall spread a blue cloth, and put on it the dishes, the pans, the bowls, and the pitchers for pouring; and the showbread shall be on it."
Numbers,4,8,"They shall spread over them a scarlet cloth, and cover the same with a covering of badger skins; and they shall insert its poles."
Numbers,4,9,"And they shall take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand of the light, with its lamps, its wick-trimmers, its trays, and all its oil vessels, with which they service it."
Numbers,4,10,"Then they shall put it with all its utensils in a covering of badger skins, and put it on a carrying beam."
Numbers,4,11,"“Over the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth, and cover it with a covering of badger skins; and they shall insert its poles."
Numbers,4,12,"Then they shall take all the utensils of service with which they minister in the sanctuary, put them in a blue cloth, cover them with a covering of badger skins, and put them on a carrying beam."
Numbers,4,13,"Also they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth over it."
Numbers,4,14,"They shall put on it all its implements with which they minister there—the firepans, the forks, the shovels, the basins, and all the utensils of the altar—and they shall spread on it a covering of badger skins, and insert its poles."
Numbers,4,15,"And when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, when the camp is set to go, then the sons of Kohath shall come to carry them; but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. “These are the things in the tabernacle of meeting which the sons of Kohath are to carry."
Numbers,4,16,"“The appointed duty of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest is the oil for the light, the sweet incense, the daily grain offering, the anointing oil, the oversight of all the tabernacle, of all that is in it, with the sanctuary and its furnishings.”"
Numbers,4,17,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:"
Numbers,4,18,“Do not cut off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites;
Numbers,4,19,"but do this in regard to them, that they may live and not die when they approach the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in and appoint each of them to his service and his task."
Numbers,4,20,"But they shall not go in to watch while the holy things are being covered, lest they die.”"
Numbers,4,21,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,4,22,"“Also take a census of the sons of Gershon, by their fathers’ house, by their families."
Numbers,4,23,"From thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, you shall number them, all who enter to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of meeting."
Numbers,4,24,"This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and carrying:"
Numbers,4,25,"They shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle and the tabernacle of meeting with its covering, the covering of badger skins that is on it, the screen for the door of the tabernacle of meeting,"
Numbers,4,26,"the screen for the door of the gate of the court, the hangings of the court which are around the tabernacle and altar, and their cords, all the furnishings for their service and all that is made for these things: so shall they serve."
Numbers,4,27,"“Aaron and his sons shall assign all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, all their tasks and all their service. And you shall appoint to them all their tasks as their duty."
Numbers,4,28,This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of meeting. And their duties shall be under the authority of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
Numbers,4,29,"“As for the sons of Merari, you shall number them by their families and by their fathers’ house."
Numbers,4,30,"From thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, you shall number them, everyone who enters the service to do the work of the tabernacle of meeting."
Numbers,4,31,"And this is what they must carry as all their service for the tabernacle of meeting: the boards of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its sockets,"
Numbers,4,32,"and the pillars around the court with their sockets, pegs, and cords, with all their furnishings and all their service; and you shall assign to each man by name the items he must carry."
Numbers,4,33,"This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, as all their service for the tabernacle of meeting, under the authority of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.”"
Numbers,4,34,"And Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families and by their fathers’ house,"
Numbers,4,35,"from thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tabernacle of meeting;"
Numbers,4,36,and those who were numbered by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty.
Numbers,4,37,"These were the ones who were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, all who might serve in the tabernacle of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses."
Numbers,4,38,"And those who were numbered of the sons of Gershon, by their families and by their fathers’ house,"
Numbers,4,39,"from thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tabernacle of meeting—"
Numbers,4,40,"those who were numbered by their families, by their fathers’ house, were two thousand six hundred and thirty."
Numbers,4,41,"These are the ones who were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, of all who might serve in the tabernacle of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD."

Numbers,4,44,those who were numbered by their families were three thousand two hundred.
Numbers,4,45,"These are the ones who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses."

Numbers,4,48,those who were numbered were eight thousand five hundred and eighty.
Numbers,4,49,"According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by the hand of Moses, each according to his service and according to his task; thus were they numbered by him, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,5,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,5,2,"“Command the children of Israel that they put out of the camp every leper, everyone who has a discharge, and whoever becomes defiled by a corpse."
Numbers,5,3,"You shall put out both male and female; you shall put them outside the camp, that they may not defile their camps in the midst of which I dwell.”"
Numbers,5,4,"And the children of Israel did so, and put them outside the camp; as the LORD spoke to Moses, so the children of Israel did."
Numbers,5,5,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,5,6,"“Speak to the children of Israel: ‘When a man or woman commits any sin that men commit in unfaithfulness against the LORD, and that person is guilty,"
Numbers,5,7,"then he shall confess the sin which he has committed. He shall make restitution for his trespass in full, plus one-fifth of it, and give it to the one he has wronged."
Numbers,5,8,"But if the man has no relative to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution for the wrong must go to the LORD for the priest, in addition to the ram of the atonement with which atonement is made for him."
Numbers,5,9,"Every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his."
Numbers,5,10,And every man’s holy things shall be his; whatever any man gives the priest shall be his.’”
Numbers,5,11,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,5,12,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘If any man’s wife goes astray and behaves unfaithfully toward him,"
Numbers,5,13,"and a man lies with her carnally, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and it is concealed that she has defiled herself, and there was no witness against her, nor was she caught—"
Numbers,5,14,"if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, who has defiled herself; or if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, although she has not defiled herself—"
Numbers,5,15,"then the man shall bring his wife to the priest. He shall bring the offering required for her, one-tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil on it and put no frankincense on it, because it is a grain offering of jealousy, an offering for remembering, for bringing iniquity to remembrance."
Numbers,5,16,"‘And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD."
Numbers,5,17,"The priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water."
Numbers,5,18,"Then the priest shall stand the woman before the LORD, uncover the woman’s head, and put the offering for remembering in her hands, which is the grain offering of jealousy. And the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that brings a curse."
Numbers,5,19,"And the priest shall put her under oath, and say to the woman, “If no man has lain with you, and if you have not gone astray to uncleanness while under your husband’s authority, be free from this bitter water that brings a curse."
Numbers,5,20,"But if you have gone astray while under your husband’s authority, and if you have defiled yourself and some man other than your husband has lain with you”—"
Numbers,5,21,"then the priest shall put the woman under the oath of the curse, and he shall say to the woman—“the LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the LORD makes your thigh rot and your belly swell;"
Numbers,5,22,"and may this water that causes the curse go into your stomach, and make your belly swell and your thigh rot.” ‘Then the woman shall say, “Amen, so be it.”"
Numbers,5,23,"‘Then the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall scrape them off into the bitter water."
Numbers,5,24,"And he shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and the water that brings the curse shall enter her to become bitter."
Numbers,5,25,"Then the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the woman’s hand, shall wave the offering before the LORD, and bring it to the altar;"
Numbers,5,26,"and the priest shall take a handful of the offering, as its memorial portion, burn it on the altar, and afterward make the woman drink the water."
Numbers,5,27,"When he has made her drink the water, then it shall be, if she has defiled herself and behaved unfaithfully toward her husband, that the water that brings a curse will enter her and become bitter, and her belly will swell, her thigh will rot, and the woman will become a curse among her people."
Numbers,5,28,"But if the woman has not defiled herself, and is clean, then she shall be free and may conceive children."
Numbers,5,29,"‘This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, while under her husband’s authority, goes astray and defiles herself,"
Numbers,5,30,"or when the spirit of jealousy comes upon a man, and he becomes jealous of his wife; then he shall stand the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute all this law upon her."
Numbers,5,31,"Then the man shall be free from iniquity, but that woman shall bear her guilt.’”"
Numbers,6,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,6,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When either a man or woman consecrates an offering to take the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself to the LORD,"
Numbers,6,3,"he shall separate himself from wine and similar drink; he shall drink neither vinegar made from wine nor vinegar made from similar drink; neither shall he drink any grape juice, nor eat fresh grapes or raisins."
Numbers,6,4,"All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is produced by the grapevine, from seed to skin."
Numbers,6,5,"‘All the days of the vow of his separation no razor shall come upon his head; until the days are fulfilled for which he separated himself to the LORD, he shall be holy. Then he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow."
Numbers,6,6,All the days that he separates himself to the LORD he shall not go near a dead body.
Numbers,6,7,"He shall not make himself unclean even for his father or his mother, for his brother or his sister, when they die, because his separation to God is on his head."
Numbers,6,8,All the days of his separation he shall be holy to the LORD.
Numbers,6,9,"‘And if anyone dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles his consecrated head, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he shall shave it."
Numbers,6,10,"Then on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of meeting;"
Numbers,6,11,"and the priest shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he sinned in regard to the corpse; and he shall sanctify his head that same day."
Numbers,6,12,"He shall consecrate to the LORD the days of his separation, and bring a male lamb in its first year as a trespass offering; but the former days shall be lost, because his separation was defiled."
Numbers,6,13,"‘Now this is the law of the Nazirite: When the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought to the door of the tabernacle of meeting."
Numbers,6,14,"And he shall present his offering to the LORD: one male lamb in its first year without blemish as a burnt offering, one ewe lamb in its first year without blemish as a sin offering, one ram without blemish as a peace offering,"
Numbers,6,15,"a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their grain offering with their drink offerings."
Numbers,6,16,Then the priest shall bring them before the LORD and offer his sin offering and his burnt offering;
Numbers,6,17,"and he shall offer the ram as a sacrifice of a peace offering to the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread; the priest shall also offer its grain offering and its drink offering."
Numbers,6,18,"Then the Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and shall take the hair from his consecrated head and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offering."
Numbers,6,19,"‘And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and put them upon the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his consecrated hair,"
Numbers,6,20,"and the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before the LORD; they are holy for the priest, together with the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering. After that the Nazirite may drink wine.’"
Numbers,6,21,"“This is the law of the Nazirite who vows to the LORD the offering for his separation, and besides that, whatever else his hand is able to provide; according to the vow which he takes, so he must do according to the law of his separation.”"
Numbers,6,22,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,6,23,"“Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the way you shall bless the children of Israel. Say to them:"
Numbers,6,24,“The LORD bless you and keep you;
Numbers,6,25,"The LORD make His face shine upon you, And be gracious to you;"
Numbers,6,26,"The LORD lift up His countenance upon you, And give you peace.”’"
Numbers,6,27,"“So they shall put My name on the children of Israel, and I will bless them.”"
Numbers,7,1,"Now it came to pass, when Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, that he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings, and the altar and all its utensils; so he anointed them and consecrated them."
Numbers,7,2,"Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers’ houses, who were the leaders of the tribes and over those who were numbered, made an offering."
Numbers,7,3,"And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered carts and twelve oxen, a cart for every two of the leaders, and for each one an ox; and they presented them before the tabernacle."
Numbers,7,4,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,7,5,"“Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the work of the tabernacle of meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.”"
Numbers,7,6,"So Moses took the carts and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites."
Numbers,7,7,"Two carts and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service;"
Numbers,7,8,"and four carts and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the authority of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest."
Numbers,7,9,"But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because theirs was the service of the holy things, which they carried on their shoulders."
Numbers,7,10,Now the leaders offered the dedication offering for the altar when it was anointed; so the leaders offered their offering before the altar.
Numbers,7,11,"For the LORD said to Moses, “They shall offer their offering, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar.”"
Numbers,7,12,"And the one who offered his offering on the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, from the tribe of Judah."
Numbers,7,13,"His offering was one silver platter, the weight of which was one hundred and thirty shekels, and one silver bowl of seventy shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering;"

Numbers,7,89,"Now when Moses went into the tabernacle of meeting to speak with Him, he heard the voice of One speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubim; thus He spoke to him."
Numbers,8,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,8,2,"“Speak to Aaron, and say to him, ‘When you arrange the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.’”"
Numbers,8,3,"And Aaron did so; he arranged the lamps to face toward the front of the lampstand, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,8,4,"Now this workmanship of the lampstand was hammered gold; from its shaft to its flowers it was hammered work. According to the pattern which the LORD had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand."
Numbers,8,5,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,8,6,“Take the Levites from among the children of Israel and cleanse them ceremonially.
Numbers,8,7,"Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purification on them, and let them shave all their body, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean."
Numbers,8,8,"Then let them take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another young bull as a sin offering."
Numbers,8,9,"And you shall bring the Levites before the tabernacle of meeting, and you shall gather together the whole congregation of the children of Israel."
Numbers,8,10,"So you shall bring the Levites before the LORD, and the children of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites;"
Numbers,8,11,"and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD like a wave offering from the children of Israel, that they may perform the work of the LORD."
Numbers,8,12,"Then the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls, and you shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites."
Numbers,8,13,"“And you shall stand the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and then offer them like a wave offering to the LORD."
Numbers,8,14,"Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be Mine."
Numbers,8,15,After that the Levites shall go in to service the tabernacle of meeting. So you shall cleanse them and offer them like a wave offering.
Numbers,8,16,"For they are wholly given to Me from among the children of Israel; I have taken them for Myself instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the children of Israel."
Numbers,8,17,"For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are Mine, both man and beast; on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them to Myself."
Numbers,8,18,I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn of the children of Israel.
Numbers,8,19,"And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the work for the children of Israel in the tabernacle of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel, that there be no plague among the children of Israel when the children of Israel come near the sanctuary.”"
Numbers,8,20,"Thus Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel did to the Levites; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the children of Israel did to them."
Numbers,8,21,"And the Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes; then Aaron presented them like a wave offering before the LORD, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them."
Numbers,8,22,"After that the Levites went in to do their work in the tabernacle of meeting before Aaron and his sons; as the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them."
Numbers,8,23,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,8,24,“This is what pertains to the Levites: From twenty-five years old and above one may enter to perform service in the work of the tabernacle of meeting;
Numbers,8,25,"and at the age of fifty years they must cease performing this work, and shall work no more."
Numbers,8,26,"They may minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of meeting, to attend to needs, but they themselves shall do no work. Thus you shall do to the Levites regarding their duties.”"
Numbers,9,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying:"
Numbers,9,2,“Let the children of Israel keep the Passover at its appointed time.
Numbers,9,3,"On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time. According to all its rites and ceremonies you shall keep it.”"
Numbers,9,4,So Moses told the children of Israel that they should keep the Passover.
Numbers,9,5,"And they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, at twilight, in the Wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did."
Numbers,9,6,"Now there were certain men who were defiled by a human corpse, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron that day."
Numbers,9,7,"And those men said to him, “We became defiled by a human corpse. Why are we kept from presenting the offering of the LORD at its appointed time among the children of Israel?”"
Numbers,9,8,"And Moses said to them, “Stand still, that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you.”"
Numbers,9,9,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,9,10,"“Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘If anyone of you or your posterity is unclean because of a corpse, or is far away on a journey, he may still keep the LORD’s Passover."
Numbers,9,11,"On the fourteenth day of the second month, at twilight, they may keep it. They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs."
Numbers,9,12,"They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break one of its bones. According to all the ordinances of the Passover they shall keep it."
Numbers,9,13,"But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, and ceases to keep the Passover, that same person shall be cut off from among his people, because he did not bring the offering of the LORD at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin."
Numbers,9,14,"‘And if a stranger dwells among you, and would keep the LORD’s Passover, he must do so according to the rite of the Passover and according to its ceremony; you shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger and the native of the land.’”"
Numbers,9,15,"Now on the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the Testimony; from evening until morning it was above the tabernacle like the appearance of fire."
Numbers,9,16,"So it was always: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night."
Numbers,9,17,"Whenever the cloud was taken up from above the tabernacle, after that the children of Israel would journey; and in the place where the cloud settled, there the children of Israel would pitch their tents."
Numbers,9,18,"At the command of the LORD the children of Israel would journey, and at the command of the LORD they would camp; as long as the cloud stayed above the tabernacle they remained encamped."
Numbers,9,19,"Even when the cloud continued long, many days above the tabernacle, the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD and did not journey."
Numbers,9,20,"So it was, when the cloud was above the tabernacle a few days: according to the command of the LORD they would remain encamped, and according to the command of the LORD they would journey."
Numbers,9,21,"So it was, when the cloud remained only from evening until morning: when the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they would journey; whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud was taken up, they would journey."
Numbers,9,22,"Whether it was two days, a month, or a year that the cloud remained above the tabernacle, the children of Israel would remain encamped and not journey; but when it was taken up, they would journey."
Numbers,9,23,"At the command of the LORD they remained encamped, and at the command of the LORD they journeyed; they kept the charge of the LORD, at the command of the LORD by the hand of Moses."
Numbers,10,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,10,2,“Make two silver trumpets for yourself; you shall make them of hammered work; you shall use them for calling the congregation and for directing the movement of the camps.
Numbers,10,3,"When they blow both of them, all the congregation shall gather before you at the door of the tabernacle of meeting."
Numbers,10,4,"But if they blow only one, then the leaders, the heads of the divisions of Israel, shall gather to you."
Numbers,10,5,"When you sound the advance, the camps that lie on the east side shall then begin their journey."
Numbers,10,6,"When you sound the advance the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall begin their journey; they shall sound the call for them to begin their journeys."
Numbers,10,7,"And when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but not sound the advance."
Numbers,10,8,"The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and these shall be to you as an ordinance forever throughout your generations."
Numbers,10,9,"“When you go to war in your land against the enemy who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, and you will be remembered before the LORD your God, and you will be saved from your enemies."
Numbers,10,10,"Also in the day of your gladness, in your appointed feasts, and at the beginning of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be a memorial for you before your God: I am the LORD your God.”"
Numbers,10,11,"Now it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from above the tabernacle of the Testimony."
Numbers,10,12,And the children of Israel set out from the Wilderness of Sinai on their journeys; then the cloud settled down in the Wilderness of Paran.
Numbers,10,13,So they started out for the first time according to the command of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
Numbers,10,14,The standard of the camp of the children of Judah set out first according to their armies; over their army was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
Numbers,10,15,Over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.
Numbers,10,16,And over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
Numbers,10,17,"Then the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set out, carrying the tabernacle."
Numbers,10,18,And the standard of the camp of Reuben set out according to their armies; over their army was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
Numbers,10,19,Over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
Numbers,10,20,And over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
Numbers,10,21,"Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. (The tabernacle would be prepared for their arrival.)"
Numbers,10,22,And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set out according to their armies; over their army was Elishama the son of Ammihud.
Numbers,10,23,Over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
Numbers,10,24,And over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
Numbers,10,25,Then the standard of the camp of the children of Dan (the rear guard of all the camps) set out according to their armies; over their army was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
Numbers,10,26,Over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.
Numbers,10,27,And over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
Numbers,10,28,"Thus was the order of march of the children of Israel, according to their armies, when they began their journey."
Numbers,10,29,"Now Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out for the place of which the LORD said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will treat you well; for the LORD has promised good things to Israel.”"
Numbers,10,30,"And he said to him, “I will not go, but I will depart to my own land and to my relatives.”"
Numbers,10,31,"So Moses said, “Please do not leave, inasmuch as you know how we are to camp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes."
Numbers,10,32,"And it shall be, if you go with us—indeed it shall be—that whatever good the LORD will do to us, the same we will do to you.”"
Numbers,10,33,"So they departed from the mountain of the LORD on a journey of three days; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them for the three days’ journey, to search out a resting place for them."
Numbers,10,34,And the cloud of the LORD was above them by day when they went out from the camp.
Numbers,10,35,"So it was, whenever the ark set out, that Moses said: “Rise up, O LORD! Let Your enemies be scattered, And let those who hate You flee before You.”"
Numbers,10,36,"And when it rested, he said: “Return, O LORD, To the many thousands of Israel.”"
Numbers,11,1,"Now when the people complained, it displeased the LORD; for the LORD heard it, and His anger was aroused. So the fire of the LORD burned among them, and consumed some in the outskirts of the camp."
Numbers,11,2,"Then the people cried out to Moses, and when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire was quenched."
Numbers,11,3,"So he called the name of the place Taberah, because the fire of the LORD had burned among them."
Numbers,11,4,Now the mixed multitude who were among them yielded to intense craving; so the children of Israel also wept again and said: “Who will give us meat to eat?
Numbers,11,5,"We remember the fish which we ate freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic;"
Numbers,11,6,but now our whole being is dried up; there is nothing at all except this manna before our eyes!”
Numbers,11,7,"Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its color like the color of bdellium."
Numbers,11,8,"The people went about and gathered it, ground it on millstones or beat it in the mortar, cooked it in pans, and made cakes of it; and its taste was like the taste of pastry prepared with oil."
Numbers,11,9,"And when the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it."
Numbers,11,10,"Then Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, everyone at the door of his tent; and the anger of the LORD was greatly aroused; Moses also was displeased."
Numbers,11,11,"So Moses said to the LORD, “Why have You afflicted Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You have laid the burden of all these people on me?"
Numbers,11,12,"Did I conceive all these people? Did I beget them, that You should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a guardian carries a nursing child,’ to the land which You swore to their fathers?"
Numbers,11,13,"Where am I to get meat to give to all these people? For they weep all over me, saying, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’"
Numbers,11,14,"I am not able to bear all these people alone, because the burden is too heavy for me."
Numbers,11,15,"If You treat me like this, please kill me here and now—if I have found favor in Your sight—and do not let me see my wretchedness!”"
Numbers,11,16,"So the LORD said to Moses: “Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; bring them to the tabernacle of meeting, that they may stand there with you."
Numbers,11,17,"Then I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit that is upon you and will put the same upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you may not bear it yourself alone."
Numbers,11,18,"Then you shall say to the people, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept in the hearing of the LORD, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt.” Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you shall eat."
Numbers,11,19,"You shall eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,"
Numbers,11,20,"but for a whole month, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have despised the LORD who is among you, and have wept before Him, saying, “Why did we ever come up out of Egypt?”’”"
Numbers,11,21,"And Moses said, “The people whom I am among are six hundred thousand men on foot; yet You have said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat for a whole month.’"
Numbers,11,22,"Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to provide enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to provide enough for them?”"
Numbers,11,23,"And the LORD said to Moses, “Has the LORD’s arm been shortened? Now you shall see whether what I say will happen to you or not.”"
Numbers,11,24,"So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD, and he gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tabernacle."
Numbers,11,25,"Then the LORD came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and placed the same upon the seventy elders; and it happened, when the Spirit rested upon them, that they prophesied, although they never did so again."
Numbers,11,26,"But two men had remained in the camp: the name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them. Now they were among those listed, but who had not gone out to the tabernacle; yet they prophesied in the camp."
Numbers,11,27,"And a young man ran and told Moses, and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”"
Numbers,11,28,"So Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, one of his choice men, answered and said, “Moses my lord, forbid them!”"
Numbers,11,29,"Then Moses said to him, “Are you zealous for my sake? Oh, that all the LORD’s people were prophets and that the LORD would put His Spirit upon them!”"
Numbers,11,30,"And Moses returned to the camp, he and the elders of Israel."
Numbers,11,31,"Now a wind went out from the LORD, and it brought quail from the sea and left them fluttering near the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and about a day’s journey on the other side, all around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the ground."
Numbers,11,32,"And the people stayed up all that day, all night, and all the next day, and gathered the quail (he who gathered least gathered ten homers); and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp."
Numbers,11,33,"But while the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was aroused against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a very great plague."
Numbers,11,34,"So he called the name of that place Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had yielded to craving."
Numbers,11,35,"From Kibroth Hattaavah the people moved to Hazeroth, and camped at Hazeroth."
Numbers,12,1,Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married; for he had married an Ethiopian woman.
Numbers,12,2,"So they said, “Has the LORD indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us also?” And the LORD heard it."
Numbers,12,3,"(Now the man Moses was very humble, more than all men who were on the face of the earth.)"
Numbers,12,4,"Suddenly the LORD said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “Come out, you three, to the tabernacle of meeting!” So the three came out."
Numbers,12,5,"Then the LORD came down in the pillar of cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam. And they both went forward."
Numbers,12,6,"Then He said, “Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, make Myself known to him in a vision; I speak to him in a dream."
Numbers,12,7,Not so with My servant Moses; He is faithful in all My house.
Numbers,12,8,"I speak with him face to face, Even plainly, and not in dark sayings; And he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid To speak against My servant Moses?”"
Numbers,12,9,"So the anger of the LORD was aroused against them, and He departed."
Numbers,12,10,"And when the cloud departed from above the tabernacle, suddenly Miriam became leprous, as white as snow. Then Aaron turned toward Miriam, and there she was, a leper."
Numbers,12,11,"So Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord! Please do not lay this sin on us, in which we have done foolishly and in which we have sinned."
Numbers,12,12,"Please do not let her be as one dead, whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb!”"
Numbers,12,13,"So Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, “Please heal her, O God, I pray!”"
Numbers,12,14,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not be shamed seven days? Let her be shut out of the camp seven days, and afterward she may be received again.”"
Numbers,12,15,"So Miriam was shut out of the camp seven days, and the people did not journey till Miriam was brought in again."
Numbers,12,16,And afterward the people moved from Hazeroth and camped in the Wilderness of Paran.
Numbers,13,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,13,2,"“Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel; from each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a leader among them.”"
Numbers,13,3,"So Moses sent them from the Wilderness of Paran according to the command of the LORD, all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel."
Numbers,13,4,"Now these were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;"
Numbers,13,5,"from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;"
Numbers,13,6,"from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;"
Numbers,13,7,"from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;"
Numbers,13,8,"from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;"
Numbers,13,9,"from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;"
Numbers,13,10,"from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;"
Numbers,13,11,"from the tribe of Joseph, that is, from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;"
Numbers,13,12,"from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;"
Numbers,13,13,"from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;"
Numbers,13,14,"from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;"
Numbers,13,15,"from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi."
Numbers,13,16,"These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua."
Numbers,13,17,"Then Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up this way into the South, and go up to the mountains,"
Numbers,13,18,"and see what the land is like: whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, few or many;"
Numbers,13,19,whether the land they dwell in is good or bad; whether the cities they inhabit are like camps or strongholds;
Numbers,13,20,whether the land is rich or poor; and whether there are forests there or not. Be of good courage. And bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.
Numbers,13,21,"So they went up and spied out the land from the Wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, near the entrance of Hamath."
Numbers,13,22,"And they went up through the South and came to Hebron; Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)"
Numbers,13,23,"Then they came to the Valley of Eshcol, and there cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes; they carried it between two of them on a pole. They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs."
Numbers,13,24,"The place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the men of Israel cut down there."
Numbers,13,25,And they returned from spying out the land after forty days.
Numbers,13,26,"Now they departed and came back to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel in the Wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; they brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land."
Numbers,13,27,"Then they told him, and said: “We went to the land where you sent us. It truly flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit."
Numbers,13,28,Nevertheless the people who dwell in the land are strong; the cities are fortified and very large; moreover we saw the descendants of Anak there.
Numbers,13,29,"The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South; the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and along the banks of the Jordan.”"
Numbers,13,30,"Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, “Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it.”"
Numbers,13,31,"But the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.”"
Numbers,13,32,"And they gave the children of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, “The land through which we have gone as spies is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great stature."
Numbers,13,33,"There we saw the giants (the descendants of Anak came from the giants); and we were like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.”"
Numbers,14,1,"So all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried, and the people wept that night."
Numbers,14,2,"And all the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said to them, “If only we had died in the land of Egypt! Or if only we had died in this wilderness!"
Numbers,14,3,"Why has the LORD brought us to this land to fall by the sword, that our wives and children should become victims? Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?”"
Numbers,14,4,"So they said to one another, “Let us select a leader and return to Egypt.”"
Numbers,14,5,Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
Numbers,14,6,"But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes;"
Numbers,14,7,"and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying: “The land we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land."
Numbers,14,8,"If the LORD delights in us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us, ‘a land which flows with milk and honey.’"
Numbers,14,9,"Only do not rebel against the LORD, nor fear the people of the land, for they are our bread; their protection has departed from them, and the LORD is with us. Do not fear them.”"
Numbers,14,10,And all the congregation said to stone them with stones. Now the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of meeting before all the children of Israel.
Numbers,14,11,"Then the LORD said to Moses: “How long will these people reject Me? And how long will they not believe Me, with all the signs which I have performed among them?"
Numbers,14,12,"I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.”"
Numbers,14,13,"And Moses said to the LORD: “Then the Egyptians will hear it, for by Your might You brought these people up from among them,"
Numbers,14,14,"and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, LORD, are among these people; that You, LORD, are seen face to face and Your cloud stands above them, and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night."
Numbers,14,15,"Now if You kill these people as one man, then the nations which have heard of Your fame will speak, saying,"
Numbers,14,16,"‘Because the LORD was not able to bring this people to the land which He swore to give them, therefore He killed them in the wilderness.’"
Numbers,14,17,"And now, I pray, let the power of my Lord be great, just as You have spoken, saying,"
Numbers,14,18,"‘The LORD is longsuffering and abundant in mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but He by no means clears the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation.’"
Numbers,14,19,"Pardon the iniquity of this people, I pray, according to the greatness of Your mercy, just as You have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.”"
Numbers,14,20,"Then the LORD said: “I have pardoned, according to your word;"
Numbers,14,21,"but truly, as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD—"
Numbers,14,22,"because all these men who have seen My glory and the signs which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have put Me to the test now these ten times, and have not heeded My voice,"
Numbers,14,23,"they certainly shall not see the land of which I swore to their fathers, nor shall any of those who rejected Me see it."
Numbers,14,24,"But My servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit in him and has followed Me fully, I will bring into the land where he went, and his descendants shall inherit it."
Numbers,14,25,Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valley; tomorrow turn and move out into the wilderness by the Way of the Red Sea.”
Numbers,14,26,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,"
Numbers,14,27,“How long shall I bear with this evil congregation who complain against Me? I have heard the complaints which the children of Israel make against Me.
Numbers,14,28,"Say to them, ‘As I live,’ says the LORD, ‘just as you have spoken in My hearing, so I will do to you:"
Numbers,14,29,"The carcasses of you who have complained against Me shall fall in this wilderness, all of you who were numbered, according to your entire number, from twenty years old and above."
Numbers,14,30,"Except for Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun, you shall by no means enter the land which I swore I would make you dwell in."
Numbers,14,31,"But your little ones, whom you said would be victims, I will bring in, and they shall know the land which you have despised."
Numbers,14,32,"But as for you, your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness."
Numbers,14,33,"And your sons shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and bear the brunt of your infidelity, until your carcasses are consumed in the wilderness."
Numbers,14,34,"According to the number of the days in which you spied out the land, forty days, for each day you shall bear your guilt one year, namely forty years, and you shall know My rejection."
Numbers,14,35,"I the LORD have spoken this. I will surely do so to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.’”"
Numbers,14,36,"Now the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation complain against him by bringing a bad report of the land,"
Numbers,14,37,"those very men who brought the evil report about the land, died by the plague before the LORD."
Numbers,14,38,"But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive, of the men who went to spy out the land."
Numbers,14,39,"Then Moses told these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly."
Numbers,14,40,"And they rose early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, “Here we are, and we will go up to the place which the LORD has promised, for we have sinned!”"
Numbers,14,41,"And Moses said, “Now why do you transgress the command of the LORD? For this will not succeed."
Numbers,14,42,"Do not go up, lest you be defeated by your enemies, for the LORD is not among you."
Numbers,14,43,"For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you shall fall by the sword; because you have turned away from the LORD, the LORD will not be with you.”"
Numbers,14,44,"But they presumed to go up to the mountaintop. Nevertheless, neither the ark of the covenant of the LORD nor Moses departed from the camp."
Numbers,14,45,"Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who dwelt in that mountain came down and attacked them, and drove them back as far as Hormah."
Numbers,15,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,15,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When you have come into the land you are to inhabit, which I am giving to you,"
Numbers,15,3,"and you make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering or in your appointed feasts, to make a sweet aroma to the LORD, from the herd or the flock,"
Numbers,15,4,then he who presents his offering to the LORD shall bring a grain offering of one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of oil;
Numbers,15,5,"and one-fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering you shall prepare with the burnt offering or the sacrifice, for each lamb."
Numbers,15,6,Or for a ram you shall prepare as a grain offering two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-third of a hin of oil;
Numbers,15,7,and as a drink offering you shall offer one-third of a hin of wine as a sweet aroma to the LORD.
Numbers,15,8,"And when you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering, or as a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, or as a peace offering to the LORD,"
Numbers,15,9,then shall be offered with the young bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil;
Numbers,15,10,"and you shall bring as the drink offering half a hin of wine as an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD."
Numbers,15,11,"‘Thus it shall be done for each young bull, for each ram, or for each lamb or young goat."
Numbers,15,12,"According to the number that you prepare, so you shall do with everyone according to their number."
Numbers,15,13,"All who are native-born shall do these things in this manner, in presenting an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD."
Numbers,15,14,"And if a stranger dwells with you, or whoever is among you throughout your generations, and would present an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD, just as you do, so shall he do."
Numbers,15,15,"One ordinance shall be for you of the assembly and for the stranger who dwells with you, an ordinance forever throughout your generations; as you are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD."
Numbers,15,16,One law and one custom shall be for you and for the stranger who dwells with you.’”
Numbers,15,17,"Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,15,18,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When you come into the land to which I bring you,"
Numbers,15,19,"then it will be, when you eat of the bread of the land, that you shall offer up a heave offering to the LORD."
Numbers,15,20,"You shall offer up a cake of the first of your ground meal as a heave offering; as a heave offering of the threshing floor, so shall you offer it up."
Numbers,15,21,Of the first of your ground meal you shall give to the LORD a heave offering throughout your generations.
Numbers,15,22,"‘If you sin unintentionally, and do not observe all these commandments which the LORD has spoken to Moses—"
Numbers,15,23,"all that the LORD has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day the LORD gave commandment and onward throughout your generations—"
Numbers,15,24,"then it will be, if it is unintentionally committed, without the knowledge of the congregation, that the whole congregation shall offer one young bull as a burnt offering, as a sweet aroma to the LORD, with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats as a sin offering."
Numbers,15,25,"So the priest shall make atonement for the whole congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them, for it was unintentional; they shall bring their offering, an offering made by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their unintended sin."
Numbers,15,26,"It shall be forgiven the whole congregation of the children of Israel and the stranger who dwells among them, because all the people did it unintentionally."
Numbers,15,27,"‘And if a person sins unintentionally, then he shall bring a female goat in its first year as a sin offering."
Numbers,15,28,"So the priest shall make atonement for the person who sins unintentionally, when he sins unintentionally before the LORD, to make atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him."
Numbers,15,29,"You shall have one law for him who sins unintentionally, for him who is native-born among the children of Israel and for the stranger who dwells among them."
Numbers,15,30,"‘But the person who does anything presumptuously, whether he is native-born or a stranger, that one brings reproach on the LORD, and he shall be cut off from among his people."
Numbers,15,31,"Because he has despised the word of the LORD, and has broken His commandment, that person shall be completely cut off; his guilt shall be upon him.’”"
Numbers,15,32,"Now while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day."
Numbers,15,33,"And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation."
Numbers,15,34,"They put him under guard, because it had not been explained what should be done to him."
Numbers,15,35,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “The man must surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.”"
Numbers,15,36,"So, as the LORD commanded Moses, all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones, and he died."
Numbers,15,37,"Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,15,38,"“Speak to the children of Israel: Tell them to make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to put a blue thread in the tassels of the corners."
Numbers,15,39,"And you shall have the tassel, that you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the LORD and do them, and that you may not follow the harlotry to which your own heart and your own eyes are inclined,"
Numbers,15,40,"and that you may remember and do all My commandments, and be holy for your God."
Numbers,15,41,"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.”"
Numbers,16,1,"Now Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men;"
Numbers,16,2,"and they rose up before Moses with some of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation, representatives of the congregation, men of renown."
Numbers,16,3,"They gathered together against Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “You take too much upon yourselves, for all the congregation is holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?”"
Numbers,16,4,"So when Moses heard it, he fell on his face;"
Numbers,16,5,"and he spoke to Korah and all his company, saying, “Tomorrow morning the LORD will show who is His and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to Him. That one whom He chooses He will cause to come near to Him."
Numbers,16,6,"Do this: Take censers, Korah and all your company;"
Numbers,16,7,"put fire in them and put incense in them before the LORD tomorrow, and it shall be that the man whom the LORD chooses is the holy one. You take too much upon yourselves, you sons of Levi!”"
Numbers,16,8,"Then Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi:"
Numbers,16,9,"Is it a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the work of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to serve them;"
Numbers,16,10,"and that He has brought you near to Himself, you and all your brethren, the sons of Levi, with you? And are you seeking the priesthood also?"
Numbers,16,11,Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against the LORD. And what is Aaron that you complain against him?”
Numbers,16,12,"And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come up!"
Numbers,16,13,"Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you should keep acting like a prince over us?"
Numbers,16,14,"Moreover you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!”"
Numbers,16,15,"Then Moses was very angry, and said to the LORD, “Do not respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, nor have I hurt one of them.”"
Numbers,16,16,"And Moses said to Korah, “Tomorrow, you and all your company be present before the LORD—you and they, as well as Aaron."
Numbers,16,17,"Let each take his censer and put incense in it, and each of you bring his censer before the LORD, two hundred and fifty censers; both you and Aaron, each with his censer.”"
Numbers,16,18,"So every man took his censer, put fire in it, laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the tabernacle of meeting with Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,16,19,And Korah gathered all the congregation against them at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. Then the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.
Numbers,16,20,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,"
Numbers,16,21,"“Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.”"
Numbers,16,22,"Then they fell on their faces, and said, “O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and You be angry with all the congregation?”"
Numbers,16,23,"So the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,16,24,"“Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’”"
Numbers,16,25,"Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him."
Numbers,16,26,"And he spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart now from the tents of these wicked men! Touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins.”"
Numbers,16,27,"So they got away from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little children."
Numbers,16,28,"And Moses said: “By this you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works, for I have not done them of my own will."
Numbers,16,29,"If these men die naturally like all men, or if they are visited by the common fate of all men, then the LORD has not sent me."
Numbers,16,30,"But if the LORD creates a new thing, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the pit, then you will understand that these men have rejected the LORD.”"
Numbers,16,31,"Now it came to pass, as he finished speaking all these words, that the ground split apart under them,"
Numbers,16,32,"and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and all the men with Korah, with all their goods."
Numbers,16,33,"So they and all those with them went down alive into the pit; the earth closed over them, and they perished from among the assembly."
Numbers,16,34,"Then all Israel who were around them fled at their cry, for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us up also!”"
Numbers,16,35,And a fire came out from the LORD and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering incense.
Numbers,16,36,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,16,37,"“Tell Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to pick up the censers out of the blaze, for they are holy, and scatter the fire some distance away."
Numbers,16,38,"The censers of these men who sinned against their own souls, let them be made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar. Because they presented them before the LORD, therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.”"
Numbers,16,39,"So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned up had presented, and they were hammered out as a covering on the altar,"
Numbers,16,40,"to be a memorial to the children of Israel that no outsider, who is not a descendant of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before the LORD, that he might not become like Korah and his companions, just as the LORD had said to him through Moses."
Numbers,16,41,"On the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed the people of the LORD.”"
Numbers,16,42,"Now it happened, when the congregation had gathered against Moses and Aaron, that they turned toward the tabernacle of meeting; and suddenly the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared."
Numbers,16,43,Then Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of meeting.
Numbers,16,44,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,16,45,"“Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.” And they fell on their faces."
Numbers,16,46,"So Moses said to Aaron, “Take a censer and put fire in it from the altar, put incense on it, and take it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from the LORD. The plague has begun.”"
Numbers,16,47,"Then Aaron took it as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and already the plague had begun among the people. So he put in the incense and made atonement for the people."
Numbers,16,48,And he stood between the dead and the living; so the plague was stopped.
Numbers,16,49,"Now those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died in the Korah incident."
Numbers,16,50,"So Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tabernacle of meeting, for the plague had stopped."
Numbers,17,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,17,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and get from them a rod from each father’s house, all their leaders according to their fathers’ houses—twelve rods. Write each man’s name on his rod."
Numbers,17,3,And you shall write Aaron’s name on the rod of Levi. For there shall be one rod for the head of each father’s house.
Numbers,17,4,"Then you shall place them in the tabernacle of meeting before the Testimony, where I meet with you."
Numbers,17,5,"And it shall be that the rod of the man whom I choose will blossom; thus I will rid Myself of the complaints of the children of Israel, which they make against you.”"
Numbers,17,6,"So Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and each of their leaders gave him a rod apiece, for each leader according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was among their rods."
Numbers,17,7,And Moses placed the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.
Numbers,17,8,"Now it came to pass on the next day that Moses went into the tabernacle of witness, and behold, the rod of Aaron, of the house of Levi, had sprouted and put forth buds, had produced blossoms and yielded ripe almonds."
Numbers,17,9,"Then Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD to all the children of Israel; and they looked, and each man took his rod."
Numbers,17,10,"And the LORD said to Moses, “Bring Aaron’s rod back before the Testimony, to be kept as a sign against the rebels, that you may put their complaints away from Me, lest they die.”"
Numbers,17,11,"Thus did Moses; just as the LORD had commanded him, so he did."
Numbers,17,12,"So the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, “Surely we die, we perish, we all perish!"
Numbers,17,13,Whoever even comes near the tabernacle of the LORD must die. Shall we all utterly die?”
Numbers,18,1,"Then the LORD said to Aaron: “You and your sons and your father’s house with you shall bear the iniquity related to the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity associated with your priesthood."
Numbers,18,2,"Also bring with you your brethren of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may be joined with you and serve you while you and your sons are with you before the tabernacle of witness."
Numbers,18,3,"They shall attend to your needs and all the needs of the tabernacle; but they shall not come near the articles of the sanctuary and the altar, lest they die—they and you also."
Numbers,18,4,"They shall be joined with you and attend to the needs of the tabernacle of meeting, for all the work of the tabernacle; but an outsider shall not come near you."
Numbers,18,5,"And you shall attend to the duties of the sanctuary and the duties of the altar, that there may be no more wrath on the children of Israel."
Numbers,18,6,"Behold, I Myself have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel; they are a gift to you, given by the LORD, to do the work of the tabernacle of meeting."
Numbers,18,7,"Therefore you and your sons with you shall attend to your priesthood for everything at the altar and behind the veil; and you shall serve. I give your priesthood to you as a gift for service, but the outsider who comes near shall be put to death.”"
Numbers,18,8,"And the LORD spoke to Aaron: “Here, I Myself have also given you charge of My heave offerings, all the holy gifts of the children of Israel; I have given them as a portion to you and your sons, as an ordinance forever."
Numbers,18,9,"This shall be yours of the most holy things reserved from the fire: every offering of theirs, every grain offering and every sin offering and every trespass offering which they render to Me, shall be most holy for you and your sons."
Numbers,18,10,In a most holy place you shall eat it; every male shall eat it. It shall be holy to you.
Numbers,18,11,"“This also is yours: the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them to you, and your sons and daughters with you, as an ordinance forever. Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it."
Numbers,18,12,"“All the best of the oil, all the best of the new wine and the grain, their firstfruits which they offer to the LORD, I have given them to you."
Numbers,18,13,"Whatever first ripe fruit is in their land, which they bring to the LORD, shall be yours. Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it."
Numbers,18,14,“Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours.
Numbers,18,15,"“Everything that first opens the womb of all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether man or beast, shall be yours; nevertheless the firstborn of man you shall surely redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem."
Numbers,18,16,"And those redeemed of the devoted things you shall redeem when one month old, according to your valuation, for five shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs."
Numbers,18,17,"But the firstborn of a cow, the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and burn their fat as an offering made by fire for a sweet aroma to the LORD."
Numbers,18,18,"And their flesh shall be yours, just as the wave breast and the right thigh are yours."
Numbers,18,19,"“All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, I have given to you and your sons and daughters with you as an ordinance forever; it is a covenant of salt forever before the LORD with you and your descendants with you.”"
Numbers,18,20,"Then the LORD said to Aaron: “You shall have no inheritance in their land, nor shall you have any portion among them; I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel."
Numbers,18,21,"“Behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tithes in Israel as an inheritance in return for the work which they perform, the work of the tabernacle of meeting."
Numbers,18,22,"Hereafter the children of Israel shall not come near the tabernacle of meeting, lest they bear sin and die."
Numbers,18,23,"But the Levites shall perform the work of the tabernacle of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a statute forever, throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance."
Numbers,18,24,"For the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer up as a heave offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites as an inheritance; therefore I have said to them, ‘Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.’”"
Numbers,18,25,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,18,26,"“Speak thus to the Levites, and say to them: ‘When you take from the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them as your inheritance, then you shall offer up a heave offering of it to the LORD, a tenth of the tithe."
Numbers,18,27,And your heave offering shall be reckoned to you as though it were the grain of the threshing floor and as the fullness of the winepress.
Numbers,18,28,"Thus you shall also offer a heave offering to the LORD from all your tithes which you receive from the children of Israel, and you shall give the LORD’s heave offering from it to Aaron the priest."
Numbers,18,29,"Of all your gifts you shall offer up every heave offering due to the LORD, from all the best of them, the consecrated part of them.’"
Numbers,18,30,"Therefore you shall say to them: ‘When you have lifted up the best of it, then the rest shall be accounted to the Levites as the produce of the threshing floor and as the produce of the winepress."
Numbers,18,31,"You may eat it in any place, you and your households, for it is your reward for your work in the tabernacle of meeting."
Numbers,18,32,"And you shall bear no sin because of it, when you have lifted up the best of it. But you shall not profane the holy gifts of the children of Israel, lest you die.’”"
Numbers,19,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,"
Numbers,19,2,"“This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD has commanded, saying: ‘Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer without blemish, in which there is no defect and on which a yoke has never come."
Numbers,19,3,"You shall give it to Eleazar the priest, that he may take it outside the camp, and it shall be slaughtered before him;"
Numbers,19,4,"and Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, and sprinkle some of its blood seven times directly in front of the tabernacle of meeting."
Numbers,19,5,"Then the heifer shall be burned in his sight: its hide, its flesh, its blood, and its offal shall be burned."
Numbers,19,6,"And the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet, and cast them into the midst of the fire burning the heifer."
Numbers,19,7,"Then the priest shall wash his clothes, he shall bathe in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp; the priest shall be unclean until evening."
Numbers,19,8,"And the one who burns it shall wash his clothes in water, bathe in water, and shall be unclean until evening."
Numbers,19,9,"Then a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and store them outside the camp in a clean place; and they shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for the water of purification; it is for purifying from sin."
Numbers,19,10,"And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until evening. It shall be a statute forever to the children of Israel and to the stranger who dwells among them."
Numbers,19,11,‘He who touches the dead body of anyone shall be unclean seven days.
Numbers,19,12,"He shall purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day; then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not be clean."
Numbers,19,13,"Whoever touches the body of anyone who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD. That person shall be cut off from Israel. He shall be unclean, because the water of purification was not sprinkled on him; his uncleanness is still on him."
Numbers,19,14,‘This is the law when a man dies in a tent: All who come into the tent and all who are in the tent shall be unclean seven days;
Numbers,19,15,"and every open vessel, which has no cover fastened on it, is unclean."
Numbers,19,16,"Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain by a sword or who has died, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days."
Numbers,19,17,"‘And for an unclean person they shall take some of the ashes of the heifer burnt for purification from sin, and running water shall be put on them in a vessel."
Numbers,19,18,"A clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water, sprinkle it on the tent, on all the vessels, on the persons who were there, or on the one who touched a bone, the slain, the dead, or a grave."
Numbers,19,19,"The clean person shall sprinkle the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, wash his clothes, and bathe in water; and at evening he shall be clean."
Numbers,19,20,"‘But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself, that person shall be cut off from among the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. The water of purification has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean."
Numbers,19,21,It shall be a perpetual statute for them. He who sprinkles the water of purification shall wash his clothes; and he who touches the water of purification shall be unclean until evening.
Numbers,19,22,Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the person who touches it shall be unclean until evening.’”
Numbers,20,1,"Then the children of Israel, the whole congregation, came into the Wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there and was buried there."
Numbers,20,2,Now there was no water for the congregation; so they gathered together against Moses and Aaron.
Numbers,20,3,"And the people contended with Moses and spoke, saying: “If only we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!"
Numbers,20,4,"Why have you brought up the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our animals should die here?"
Numbers,20,5,"And why have you made us come up out of Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates; nor is there any water to drink.”"
Numbers,20,6,"So Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and they fell on their faces. And the glory of the LORD appeared to them."
Numbers,20,7,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,20,8,"“Take the rod; you and your brother Aaron gather the congregation together. Speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will yield its water; thus you shall bring water for them out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their animals.”"
Numbers,20,9,So Moses took the rod from before the LORD as He commanded him.
Numbers,20,10,"And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock; and he said to them, “Hear now, you rebels! Must we bring water for you out of this rock?”"
Numbers,20,11,"Then Moses lifted his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; and water came out abundantly, and the congregation and their animals drank."
Numbers,20,12,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not believe Me, to hallow Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.”"
Numbers,20,13,"This was the water of Meribah, because the children of Israel contended with the LORD, and He was hallowed among them."
Numbers,20,14,"Now Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. “Thus says your brother Israel: ‘You know all the hardship that has befallen us,"
Numbers,20,15,"how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers."
Numbers,20,16,"When we cried out to the LORD, He heard our voice and sent the Angel and brought us up out of Egypt; now here we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your border."
Numbers,20,17,"Please let us pass through your country. We will not pass through fields or vineyards, nor will we drink water from wells; we will go along the King’s Highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory.’”"
Numbers,20,18,"Then Edom said to him, “You shall not pass through my land, lest I come out against you with the sword.”"
Numbers,20,19,"So the children of Israel said to him, “We will go by the Highway, and if I or my livestock drink any of your water, then I will pay for it; let me only pass through on foot, nothing more.”"
Numbers,20,20,"Then he said, “You shall not pass through.” So Edom came out against them with many men and with a strong hand."
Numbers,20,21,Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory; so Israel turned away from him.
Numbers,20,22,"Now the children of Israel, the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor."
Numbers,20,23,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom, saying:"
Numbers,20,24,"“Aaron shall be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against My word at the water of Meribah."
Numbers,20,25,"Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;"
Numbers,20,26,and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; for Aaron shall be gathered to his people and die there.”
Numbers,20,27,"So Moses did just as the LORD commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation."
Numbers,20,28,Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
Numbers,20,29,"Now when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, all the house of Israel mourned for Aaron thirty days."
Numbers,21,1,"The king of Arad, the Canaanite, who dwelt in the South, heard that Israel was coming on the road to Atharim. Then he fought against Israel and took some of them prisoners."
Numbers,21,2,"So Israel made a vow to the LORD, and said, “If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.”"
Numbers,21,3,"And the LORD listened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites, and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. So the name of that place was called Hormah."
Numbers,21,4,"Then they journeyed from Mount Hor by the Way of the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the soul of the people became very discouraged on the way."
Numbers,21,5,"And the people spoke against God and against Moses: “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and our soul loathes this worthless bread.”"
Numbers,21,6,"So the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many of the people of Israel died."
Numbers,21,7,"Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you; pray to the LORD that He take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people."
Numbers,21,8,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.”"
Numbers,21,9,"So Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole; and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived."
Numbers,21,10,Now the children of Israel moved on and camped in Oboth.
Numbers,21,11,"And they journeyed from Oboth and camped at Ije Abarim, in the wilderness which is east of Moab, toward the sunrise."
Numbers,21,12,From there they moved and camped in the Valley of Zered.
Numbers,21,13,"From there they moved and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites."
Numbers,21,14,"Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD: “Waheb in Suphah, The brooks of the Arnon,"
Numbers,21,15,"And the slope of the brooks That reaches to the dwelling of Ar, And lies on the border of Moab.”"
Numbers,21,16,"From there they went to Beer, which is the well where the LORD said to Moses, “Gather the people together, and I will give them water.”"
Numbers,21,17,"Then Israel sang this song: “Spring up, O well! All of you sing to it—"
Numbers,21,18,"The well the leaders sank, Dug by the nation’s nobles, By the lawgiver, with their staves.” And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah,"
Numbers,21,19,"from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,"
Numbers,21,20,"and from Bamoth, in the valley that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah which looks down on the wasteland."
Numbers,21,21,"Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,"
Numbers,21,22,“Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into fields or vineyards; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.”
Numbers,21,23,"But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel in the wilderness, and he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel."
Numbers,21,24,"Then Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the people of Ammon; for the border of the people of Ammon was fortified."
Numbers,21,25,"So Israel took all these cities, and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and in all its villages."
Numbers,21,26,"For Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and had taken all his land from his hand as far as the Arnon."
Numbers,21,27,"Therefore those who speak in proverbs say: “Come to Heshbon, let it be built; Let the city of Sihon be repaired."
Numbers,21,28,"“For fire went out from Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon; It consumed Ar of Moab, The lords of the heights of the Arnon."
Numbers,21,29,"Woe to you, Moab! You have perished, O people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, To Sihon king of the Amorites."
Numbers,21,30,"“But we have shot at them; Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon. Then we laid waste as far as Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba.”"
Numbers,21,31,Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers,21,32,Then Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took its villages and drove out the Amorites who were there.
Numbers,21,33,"And they turned and went up by the way to Bashan. So Og king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei."
Numbers,21,34,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, with all his people and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.”"
Numbers,21,35,"So they defeated him, his sons, and all his people, until there was no survivor left him; and they took possession of his land."
Numbers,22,1,"Then the children of Israel moved, and camped in the plains of Moab on the side of the Jordan across from Jericho."
Numbers,22,2,Now Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
Numbers,22,3,"And Moab was exceedingly afraid of the people because they were many, and Moab was sick with dread because of the children of Israel."
Numbers,22,4,"So Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this company will lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.” And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time."
Numbers,22,5,"Then he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which is near the River in the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying: “Look, a people has come from Egypt. See, they cover the face of the earth, and are settling next to me!"
Numbers,22,6,"Therefore please come at once, curse this people for me, for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land, for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”"
Numbers,22,7,"So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the diviner’s fee in their hand, and they came to Balaam and spoke to him the words of Balak."
Numbers,22,8,"And he said to them, “Lodge here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, as the LORD speaks to me.” So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam."
Numbers,22,9,"Then God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men with you?”"
Numbers,22,10,"So Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, saying,"
Numbers,22,11,"‘Look, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the face of the earth. Come now, curse them for me; perhaps I shall be able to overpower them and drive them out.’”"
Numbers,22,12,"And God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.”"
Numbers,22,13,"So Balaam rose in the morning and said to the princes of Balak, “Go back to your land, for the LORD has refused to give me permission to go with you.”"
Numbers,22,14,"And the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.”"
Numbers,22,15,"Then Balak again sent princes, more numerous and more honorable than they."
Numbers,22,16,"And they came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor: ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me;"
Numbers,22,17,"for I will certainly honor you greatly, and I will do whatever you say to me. Therefore please come, curse this people for me.’”"
Numbers,22,18,"Then Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, “Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more."
Numbers,22,19,"Now therefore, please, you also stay here tonight, that I may know what more the LORD will say to me.”"
Numbers,22,20,"And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men come to call you, rise and go with them; but only the word which I speak to you—that you shall do.”"
Numbers,22,21,"So Balaam rose in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab."
Numbers,22,22,"Then God’s anger was aroused because he went, and the Angel of the LORD took His stand in the way as an adversary against him. And he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him."
Numbers,22,23,"Now the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. So Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road."
Numbers,22,24,"Then the Angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on this side and a wall on that side."
Numbers,22,25,"And when the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD, she pushed herself against the wall and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall; so he struck her again."
Numbers,22,26,"Then the Angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left."
Numbers,22,27,"And when the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam; so Balaam’s anger was aroused, and he struck the donkey with his staff."
Numbers,22,28,"Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”"
Numbers,22,29,"And Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have abused me. I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would kill you!”"
Numbers,22,30,"So the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden, ever since I became yours, to this day? Was I ever disposed to do this to you?” And he said, “No.”"
Numbers,22,31,"Then the LORD opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the Angel of the LORD standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand; and he bowed his head and fell flat on his face."
Numbers,22,32,"And the Angel of the LORD said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to stand against you, because your way is perverse before Me."
Numbers,22,33,"The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live.”"
Numbers,22,34,"And Balaam said to the Angel of the LORD, “I have sinned, for I did not know You stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases You, I will turn back.”"
Numbers,22,35,"Then the Angel of the LORD said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but only the word that I speak to you, that you shall speak.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak."
Numbers,22,36,"Now when Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is on the border at the Arnon, the boundary of the territory."
Numbers,22,37,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not earnestly send to you, calling for you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?”"
Numbers,22,38,"And Balaam said to Balak, “Look, I have come to you! Now, have I any power at all to say anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I must speak.”"
Numbers,22,39,"So Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjath Huzoth."
Numbers,22,40,"Then Balak offered oxen and sheep, and he sent some to Balaam and to the princes who were with him."
Numbers,22,41,"So it was, the next day, that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal, that from there he might observe the extent of the people."
Numbers,23,1,"Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.”"
Numbers,23,2,"And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,3,"Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps the LORD will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will tell you.” So he went to a desolate height."
Numbers,23,4,"And God met Balaam, and he said to Him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram.”"
Numbers,23,5,"Then the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.”"
Numbers,23,6,"So he returned to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, he and all the princes of Moab."
Numbers,23,7,"And he took up his oracle and said: “Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, From the mountains of the east. ‘Come, curse Jacob for me, And come, denounce Israel!’"
Numbers,23,8,“How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? And how shall I denounce whom the LORD has not denounced?
Numbers,23,9,"For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him; There! A people dwelling alone, Not reckoning itself among the nations."
Numbers,23,10,"“Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number one-fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my end be like his!”"
Numbers,23,11,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and look, you have blessed them bountifully!”"
Numbers,23,12,"So he answered and said, “Must I not take heed to speak what the LORD has put in my mouth?”"
Numbers,23,13,"Then Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place from which you may see them; you shall see only the outer part of them, and shall not see them all; curse them for me from there.”"
Numbers,23,14,"So he brought him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,15,"And he said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering while I meet the LORD over there.”"
Numbers,23,16,"Then the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, “Go back to Balak, and thus you shall speak.”"
Numbers,23,17,"So he came to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab were with him. And Balak said to him, “What has the LORD spoken?”"
Numbers,23,18,"Then he took up his oracle and said: “Rise up, Balak, and hear! Listen to me, son of Zippor!"
Numbers,23,19,"“God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?"
Numbers,23,20,"Behold, I have received a command to bless; He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it."
Numbers,23,21,"“He has not observed iniquity in Jacob, Nor has He seen wickedness in Israel. The LORD his God is with him, And the shout of a King is among them."
Numbers,23,22,God brings them out of Egypt; He has strength like a wild ox.
Numbers,23,23,"“For there is no sorcery against Jacob, Nor any divination against Israel. It now must be said of Jacob And of Israel, ‘Oh, what God has done!’"
Numbers,23,24,"Look, a people rises like a lioness, And lifts itself up like a lion; It shall not lie down until it devours the prey, And drinks the blood of the slain.”"
Numbers,23,25,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all!”"
Numbers,23,26,"So Balaam answered and said to Balak, “Did I not tell you, saying, ‘All that the LORD speaks, that I must do’?”"
Numbers,23,27,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.”"
Numbers,23,28,"So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that overlooks the wasteland."
Numbers,23,29,"Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.”"
Numbers,23,30,"And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on every altar."
Numbers,24,1,"Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times, to seek to use sorcery, but he set his face toward the wilderness."
Numbers,24,2,"And Balaam raised his eyes, and saw Israel encamped according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him."
Numbers,24,3,"Then he took up his oracle and said: “The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor, The utterance of the man whose eyes are opened,"
Numbers,24,4,"The utterance of him who hears the words of God, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Who falls down, with eyes wide open:"
Numbers,24,5,"“How lovely are your tents, O Jacob! Your dwellings, O Israel!"
Numbers,24,6,"Like valleys that stretch out, Like gardens by the riverside, Like aloes planted by the LORD, Like cedars beside the waters."
Numbers,24,7,"He shall pour water from his buckets, And his seed shall be in many waters. “His king shall be higher than Agag, And his kingdom shall be exalted."
Numbers,24,8,"“God brings him out of Egypt; He has strength like a wild ox; He shall consume the nations, his enemies; He shall break their bones And pierce them with his arrows."
Numbers,24,9,"‘He bows down, he lies down as a lion; And as a lion, who shall rouse him?’ “Blessed is he who blesses you, And cursed is he who curses you.”"
Numbers,24,10,"Then Balak’s anger was aroused against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, and look, you have bountifully blessed them these three times!"
Numbers,24,11,"Now therefore, flee to your place. I said I would greatly honor you, but in fact, the LORD has kept you back from honor.”"
Numbers,24,12,"So Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying,"
Numbers,24,13,"‘If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the LORD, to do good or bad of my own will. What the LORD says, that I must speak’?"
Numbers,24,14,"And now, indeed, I am going to my people. Come, I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the latter days.”"
Numbers,24,15,"So he took up his oracle and said: “The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor, And the utterance of the man whose eyes are opened;"
Numbers,24,16,"The utterance of him who hears the words of God, And has the knowledge of the Most High, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Who falls down, with eyes wide open:"
Numbers,24,17,"“I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not near; A Star shall come out of Jacob; A Scepter shall rise out of Israel, And batter the brow of Moab, And destroy all the sons of tumult."
Numbers,24,18,"“And Edom shall be a possession; Seir also, his enemies, shall be a possession, While Israel does valiantly."
Numbers,24,19,"Out of Jacob One shall have dominion, And destroy the remains of the city.”"
Numbers,24,20,"Then he looked on Amalek, and he took up his oracle and said: “Amalek was first among the nations, But shall be last until he perishes.”"
Numbers,24,21,"Then he looked on the Kenites, and he took up his oracle and said: “Firm is your dwelling place, And your nest is set in the rock;"
Numbers,24,22,Nevertheless Kain shall be burned. How long until Asshur carries you away captive?”
Numbers,24,23,Then he took up his oracle and said: “Alas! Who shall live when God does this?
Numbers,24,24,"But ships shall come from the coasts of Cyprus, And they shall afflict Asshur and afflict Eber, And so shall Amalek, until he perishes.”"
Numbers,24,25,So Balaam rose and departed and returned to his place; Balak also went his way.
Numbers,25,1,"Now Israel remained in Acacia Grove, and the people began to commit harlotry with the women of Moab."
Numbers,25,2,"They invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods."
Numbers,25,3,"So Israel was joined to Baal of Peor, and the anger of the LORD was aroused against Israel."
Numbers,25,4,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of the people and hang the offenders before the LORD, out in the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel.”"
Numbers,25,5,"So Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Every one of you kill his men who were joined to Baal of Peor.”"
Numbers,25,6,"And indeed, one of the children of Israel came and presented to his brethren a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping at the door of the tabernacle of meeting."
Numbers,25,7,"Now when Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand;"
Numbers,25,8,"and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stopped among the children of Israel."
Numbers,25,9,And those who died in the plague were twenty-four thousand.
Numbers,25,10,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,25,11,"“Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned back My wrath from the children of Israel, because he was zealous with My zeal among them, so that I did not consume the children of Israel in My zeal."
Numbers,25,12,"Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give to him My covenant of peace;"
Numbers,25,13,"and it shall be to him and his descendants after him a covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was zealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.’”"
Numbers,25,14,"Now the name of the Israelite who was killed, who was killed with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, a leader of a father’s house among the Simeonites."
Numbers,25,15,And the name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a father’s house in Midian.
Numbers,25,16,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,25,17,"“Harass the Midianites, and attack them;"
Numbers,25,18,"for they harassed you with their schemes by which they seduced you in the matter of Peor and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a leader of Midian, their sister, who was killed in the day of the plague because of Peor.”"
Numbers,26,1,"And it came to pass, after the plague, that the LORD spoke to Moses and Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying:"
Numbers,26,2,"“Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel from twenty years old and above, by their fathers’ houses, all who are able to go to war in Israel.”"
Numbers,26,3,"So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho, saying:"
Numbers,26,4,"“Take a census of the people from twenty years old and above, just as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel who came out of the land of Egypt.”"
Numbers,26,5,"Reuben was the firstborn of Israel. The children of Reuben were: of Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites;"
Numbers,26,6,"of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the family of the Carmites."
Numbers,26,7,These are the families of the Reubenites: those who were numbered of them were forty-three thousand seven hundred and thirty.
Numbers,26,8,And the son of Pallu was Eliab.
Numbers,26,9,"The sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the Dathan and Abiram, representatives of the congregation, who contended against Moses and Aaron in the company of Korah, when they contended against the LORD;"
Numbers,26,10,"and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up together with Korah when that company died, when the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men; and they became a sign."
Numbers,26,11,Nevertheless the children of Korah did not die.

Numbers,26,53,"“To these the land shall be divided as an inheritance, according to the number of names."
Numbers,26,54,"To a large tribe you shall give a larger inheritance, and to a small tribe you shall give a smaller inheritance. Each shall be given its inheritance according to those who were numbered of them."
Numbers,26,55,But the land shall be divided by lot; they shall inherit according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.
Numbers,26,56,According to the lot their inheritance shall be divided between the larger and the smaller.”
Numbers,26,57,"And these are those who were numbered of the Levites according to their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites."
Numbers,26,58,"These are the families of the Levites: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, and the family of the Korathites. And Kohath begot Amram."
Numbers,26,59,"The name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt; and to Amram she bore Aaron and Moses and their sister Miriam."
Numbers,26,60,"To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
Numbers,26,61,And Nadab and Abihu died when they offered profane fire before the LORD.
Numbers,26,62,"Now those who were numbered of them were twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and above; for they were not numbered among the other children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given to them among the children of Israel."
Numbers,26,63,"These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho."
Numbers,26,64,But among these there was not a man of those who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest when they numbered the children of Israel in the Wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers,26,65,"For the LORD had said of them, “They shall surely die in the wilderness.” So there was not left a man of them, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun."
Numbers,27,1,"Then came the daughters of Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah."
Numbers,27,2,"And they stood before Moses, before Eleazar the priest, and before the leaders and all the congregation, by the doorway of the tabernacle of meeting, saying:"
Numbers,27,3,"“Our father died in the wilderness; but he was not in the company of those who gathered together against the LORD, in company with Korah, but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons."
Numbers,27,4,Why should the name of our father be removed from among his family because he had no son? Give us a possession among our father’s brothers.”
Numbers,27,5,So Moses brought their case before the LORD.
Numbers,27,6,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,27,7,"“The daughters of Zelophehad speak what is right; you shall surely give them a possession of inheritance among their father’s brothers, and cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them."
Numbers,27,8,"And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘If a man dies and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter."
Numbers,27,9,"If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers."
Numbers,27,10,"If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers."
Numbers,27,11,"And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the relative closest to him in his family, and he shall possess it.’” And it shall be to the children of Israel a statute of judgment, just as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,27,12,"Now the LORD said to Moses: “Go up into this Mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel."
Numbers,27,13,"And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered."
Numbers,27,14,"For in the Wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against My command to hallow Me at the waters before their eyes.” (These are the waters of Meribah, at Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin.)"
Numbers,27,15,"Then Moses spoke to the LORD, saying:"
Numbers,27,16,"“Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,"
Numbers,27,17,"who may go out before them and go in before them, who may lead them out and bring them in, that the congregation of the LORD may not be like sheep which have no shepherd.”"
Numbers,27,18,"And the LORD said to Moses: “Take Joshua the son of Nun with you, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him;"
Numbers,27,19,"set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation, and inaugurate him in their sight."
Numbers,27,20,"And you shall give some of your authority to him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient."
Numbers,27,21,"He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire before the LORD for him by the judgment of the Urim. At his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, he and all the children of Israel with him—all the congregation.”"
Numbers,27,22,So Moses did as the LORD commanded him. He took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation.
Numbers,27,23,"And he laid his hands on him and inaugurated him, just as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses."
Numbers,28,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,28,2,"“Command the children of Israel, and say to them, ‘My offering, My food for My offerings made by fire as a sweet aroma to Me, you shall be careful to offer to Me at their appointed time.’"
Numbers,28,3,"“And you shall say to them, ‘This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to the LORD: two male lambs in their first year without blemish, day by day, as a regular burnt offering."
Numbers,28,4,"The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, the other lamb you shall offer in the evening,"
Numbers,28,5,and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering mixed with one-fourth of a hin of pressed oil.
Numbers,28,6,"It is a regular burnt offering which was ordained at Mount Sinai for a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD."
Numbers,28,7,And its drink offering shall be one-fourth of a hin for each lamb; in a holy place you shall pour out the drink to the LORD as an offering.
Numbers,28,8,"The other lamb you shall offer in the evening; as the morning grain offering and its drink offering, you shall offer it as an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD."
Numbers,28,9,"‘And on the Sabbath day two lambs in their first year, without blemish, and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, with its drink offering—"
Numbers,28,10,"this is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, besides the regular burnt offering with its drink offering."
Numbers,28,11,"‘At the beginnings of your months you shall present a burnt offering to the LORD: two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs in their first year, without blemish;"
Numbers,28,12,"three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, for each bull; two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram;"
Numbers,28,13,"and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with oil, as a grain offering for each lamb, as a burnt offering of sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD."
Numbers,28,14,"Their drink offering shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, one-third of a hin for a ram, and one-fourth of a hin for a lamb; this is the burnt offering for each month throughout the months of the year."
Numbers,28,15,"Also one kid of the goats as a sin offering to the LORD shall be offered, besides the regular burnt offering and its drink offering."
Numbers,28,16,‘On the fourteenth day of the first month is the Passover of the LORD.

Numbers,29,39,"‘These you shall present to the LORD at your appointed feasts (besides your vowed offerings and your freewill offerings) as your burnt offerings and your grain offerings, as your drink offerings and your peace offerings.’”"
Numbers,29,40,"So Moses told the children of Israel everything, just as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,30,1,"Then Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, “This is the thing which the LORD has commanded:"
Numbers,30,2,"If a man makes a vow to the LORD, or swears an oath to bind himself by some agreement, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth."
Numbers,30,3,"“Or if a woman makes a vow to the LORD, and binds herself by some agreement while in her father’s house in her youth,"
Numbers,30,4,"and her father hears her vow and the agreement by which she has bound herself, and her father holds his peace, then all her vows shall stand, and every agreement with which she has bound herself shall stand."
Numbers,30,5,"But if her father overrules her on the day that he hears, then none of her vows nor her agreements by which she has bound herself shall stand; and the LORD will release her, because her father overruled her."
Numbers,30,6,"“If indeed she takes a husband, while bound by her vows or by a rash utterance from her lips by which she bound herself,"
Numbers,30,7,"and her husband hears it, and makes no response to her on the day that he hears, then her vows shall stand, and her agreements by which she bound herself shall stand."
Numbers,30,8,"But if her husband overrules her on the day that he hears it, he shall make void her vow which she took and what she uttered with her lips, by which she bound herself, and the LORD will release her."
Numbers,30,9,"“Also any vow of a widow or a divorced woman, by which she has bound herself, shall stand against her."
Numbers,30,10,"“If she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound herself by an agreement with an oath,"
Numbers,30,11,"and her husband heard it, and made no response to her and did not overrule her, then all her vows shall stand, and every agreement by which she bound herself shall stand."
Numbers,30,12,"But if her husband truly made them void on the day he heard them, then whatever proceeded from her lips concerning her vows or concerning the agreement binding her, it shall not stand; her husband has made them void, and the LORD will release her."
Numbers,30,13,"Every vow and every binding oath to afflict her soul, her husband may confirm it, or her husband may make it void."
Numbers,30,14,"Now if her husband makes no response whatever to her from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or all the agreements that bind her; he confirms them, because he made no response to her on the day that he heard them."
Numbers,30,15,"But if he does make them void after he has heard them, then he shall bear her guilt.”"
Numbers,30,16,"These are the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, and between a father and his daughter in her youth in her father’s house."
Numbers,31,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,31,2,“Take vengeance on the Midianites for the children of Israel. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people.”
Numbers,31,3,"So Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm some of yourselves for war, and let them go against the Midianites to take vengeance for the LORD on Midian."
Numbers,31,4,A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel you shall send to the war.”
Numbers,31,5,"So there were recruited from the divisions of Israel one thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war."
Numbers,31,6,"Then Moses sent them to the war, one thousand from each tribe; he sent them to the war with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, with the holy articles and the signal trumpets in his hand."
Numbers,31,7,"And they warred against the Midianites, just as the LORD commanded Moses, and they killed all the males."
Numbers,31,8,"They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of those who were killed—Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. Balaam the son of Beor they also killed with the sword."
Numbers,31,9,"And the children of Israel took the women of Midian captive, with their little ones, and took as spoil all their cattle, all their flocks, and all their goods."
Numbers,31,10,"They also burned with fire all the cities where they dwelt, and all their forts."
Numbers,31,11,And they took all the spoil and all the booty—of man and beast.
Numbers,31,12,"Then they brought the captives, the booty, and the spoil to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho."
Numbers,31,13,"And Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation, went to meet them outside the camp."
Numbers,31,14,"But Moses was angry with the officers of the army, with the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds, who had come from the battle."
Numbers,31,15,And Moses said to them: “Have you kept all the women alive?
Numbers,31,16,"Look, these women caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to trespass against the LORD in the incident of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD."
Numbers,31,17,"Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man intimately."
Numbers,31,18,But keep alive for yourselves all the young girls who have not known a man intimately.
Numbers,31,19,"And as for you, remain outside the camp seven days; whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day."
Numbers,31,20,"Purify every garment, everything made of leather, everything woven of goats’ hair, and everything made of wood.”"
Numbers,31,21,"Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to the battle, “This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses:"
Numbers,31,22,"Only the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead,"
Numbers,31,23,"everything that can endure fire, you shall put through the fire, and it shall be clean; and it shall be purified with the water of purification. But all that cannot endure fire you shall put through water."
Numbers,31,24,"And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you may come into the camp.”"
Numbers,31,25,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Numbers,31,26,“Count up the plunder that was taken—of man and beast—you and Eleazar the priest and the chief fathers of the congregation;
Numbers,31,27,"and divide the plunder into two parts, between those who took part in the war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation."
Numbers,31,28,"And levy a tribute for the LORD on the men of war who went out to battle: one of every five hundred of the persons, the cattle, the donkeys, and the sheep;"
Numbers,31,29,"take it from their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest as a heave offering to the LORD."
Numbers,31,30,"And from the children of Israel’s half you shall take one of every fifty, drawn from the persons, the cattle, the donkeys, and the sheep, from all the livestock, and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.”"
Numbers,31,31,So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers,31,32,"The booty remaining from the plunder, which the men of war had taken, was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep,"
Numbers,31,33,"seventy-two thousand cattle,"
Numbers,31,34,"sixty-one thousand donkeys,"
Numbers,31,35,"and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of women who had not known a man intimately."
Numbers,31,36,"And the half, the portion for those who had gone out to war, was in number three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep;"
Numbers,31,37,and the LORD’s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five.
Numbers,31,38,"The cattle were thirty-six thousand, of which the LORD’s tribute was seventy-two."
Numbers,31,39,"The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred, of which the LORD’s tribute was sixty-one."
Numbers,31,40,"The persons were sixteen thousand, of which the LORD’s tribute was thirty-two persons."
Numbers,31,41,"So Moses gave the tribute which was the LORD’s heave offering to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,31,42,"And from the children of Israel’s half, which Moses separated from the men who fought—"
Numbers,31,43,"now the half belonging to the congregation was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,"
Numbers,31,44,"thirty-six thousand cattle,"
Numbers,31,45,"thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,"
Numbers,31,46,and sixteen thousand persons—
Numbers,31,47,"and from the children of Israel’s half Moses took one of every fifty, drawn from man and beast, and gave them to the Levites, who kept charge of the tabernacle of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,31,48,"Then the officers who were over thousands of the army, the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, came near to Moses;"
Numbers,31,49,"and they said to Moses, “Your servants have taken a count of the men of war who are under our command, and not a man of us is missing."
Numbers,31,50,"Therefore we have brought an offering for the LORD, what every man found of ornaments of gold: armlets and bracelets and signet rings and earrings and necklaces, to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD.”"
Numbers,31,51,"So Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from them, all the fashioned ornaments."
Numbers,31,52,"And all the gold of the offering that they offered to the LORD, from the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels."
Numbers,31,53,"(The men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)"
Numbers,31,54,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of meeting as a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD."
Numbers,32,1,"Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock; and when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, that indeed the region was a place for livestock,"
Numbers,32,2,"the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the leaders of the congregation, saying,"
Numbers,32,3,"“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Shebam, Nebo, and Beon,"
Numbers,32,4,"the country which the LORD defeated before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.”"
Numbers,32,5,"Therefore they said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Do not take us over the Jordan.”"
Numbers,32,6,And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben: “Shall your brethren go to war while you sit here?
Numbers,32,7,Now why will you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD has given them?
Numbers,32,8,Thus your fathers did when I sent them away from Kadesh Barnea to see the land.
Numbers,32,9,"For when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, so that they did not go into the land which the LORD had given them."
Numbers,32,10,"So the LORD’s anger was aroused on that day, and He swore an oath, saying,"
Numbers,32,11,"‘Surely none of the men who came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and above, shall see the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they have not wholly followed Me,"
Numbers,32,12,"except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have wholly followed the LORD.’"
Numbers,32,13,"So the LORD’s anger was aroused against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD was gone."
Numbers,32,14,"And look! You have risen in your fathers’ place, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more the fierce anger of the LORD against Israel."
Numbers,32,15,"For if you turn away from following Him, He will once again leave them in the wilderness, and you will destroy all these people.”"
Numbers,32,16,"Then they came near to him and said: “We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones,"
Numbers,32,17,"but we ourselves will be armed, ready to go before the children of Israel until we have brought them to their place; and our little ones will dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land."
Numbers,32,18,We will not return to our homes until every one of the children of Israel has received his inheritance.
Numbers,32,19,"For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has fallen to us on this eastern side of the Jordan.”"
Numbers,32,20,"Then Moses said to them: “If you do this thing, if you arm yourselves before the LORD for the war,"
Numbers,32,21,"and all your armed men cross over the Jordan before the LORD until He has driven out His enemies from before Him,"
Numbers,32,22,"and the land is subdued before the LORD, then afterward you may return and be blameless before the LORD and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD."
Numbers,32,23,"But if you do not do so, then take note, you have sinned against the LORD; and be sure your sin will find you out."
Numbers,32,24,"Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do what has proceeded out of your mouth.”"
Numbers,32,25,"And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying: “Your servants will do as my lord commands."
Numbers,32,26,"Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock will be there in the cities of Gilead;"
Numbers,32,27,"but your servants will cross over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, just as my lord says.”"
Numbers,32,28,"So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel."
Numbers,32,29,"And Moses said to them: “If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben cross over the Jordan with you, every man armed for battle before the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead as a possession."
Numbers,32,30,"But if they do not cross over armed with you, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.”"
Numbers,32,31,"Then the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying: “As the LORD has said to your servants, so we will do."
Numbers,32,32,"We will cross over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, but the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us on this side of the Jordan.”"
Numbers,32,33,"So Moses gave to the children of Gad, to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land with its cities within the borders, the cities of the surrounding country."
Numbers,32,34,"And the children of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer,"
Numbers,32,35,"Atroth and Shophan and Jazer and Jogbehah,"
Numbers,32,36,"Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran, fortified cities, and folds for sheep."
Numbers,32,37,"And the children of Reuben built Heshbon and Elealeh and Kirjathaim,"
Numbers,32,38,Nebo and Baal Meon (their names being changed) and Shibmah; and they gave other names to the cities which they built.
Numbers,32,39,"And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it."
Numbers,32,40,"So Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he dwelt in it."
Numbers,32,41,"Also Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its small towns, and called them Havoth Jair."
Numbers,32,42,"Then Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages, and he called it Nobah, after his own name."
Numbers,33,1,"These are the journeys of the children of Israel, who went out of the land of Egypt by their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,33,2,Now Moses wrote down the starting points of their journeys at the command of the LORD. And these are their journeys according to their starting points:
Numbers,33,3,"They departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the day after the Passover the children of Israel went out with boldness in the sight of all the Egyptians."
Numbers,33,4,"For the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, whom the LORD had killed among them. Also on their gods the LORD had executed judgments."
Numbers,33,5,Then the children of Israel moved from Rameses and camped at Succoth.
Numbers,33,6,"They departed from Succoth and camped at Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness."
Numbers,33,7,"They moved from Etham and turned back to Pi Hahiroth, which is east of Baal Zephon; and they camped near Migdol."
Numbers,33,8,"They departed from before Hahiroth and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, went three days’ journey in the Wilderness of Etham, and camped at Marah."
Numbers,33,9,They moved from Marah and came to Elim. At Elim were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; so they camped there.
Numbers,33,10,They moved from Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
Numbers,33,11,They moved from the Red Sea and camped in the Wilderness of Sin.
Numbers,33,12,They journeyed from the Wilderness of Sin and camped at Dophkah.
Numbers,33,13,They departed from Dophkah and camped at Alush.
Numbers,33,14,"They moved from Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink."
Numbers,33,15,They departed from Rephidim and camped in the Wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers,33,16,They moved from the Wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth Hattaavah.
Numbers,33,17,They departed from Kibroth Hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
Numbers,33,18,They departed from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.
Numbers,33,19,They departed from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon Perez.
Numbers,33,20,They departed from Rimmon Perez and camped at Libnah.
Numbers,33,21,They moved from Libnah and camped at Rissah.
Numbers,33,22,They journeyed from Rissah and camped at Kehelathah.
Numbers,33,23,They went from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher.
Numbers,33,24,They moved from Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah.
Numbers,33,25,They moved from Haradah and camped at Makheloth.
Numbers,33,26,They moved from Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
Numbers,33,27,They departed from Tahath and camped at Terah.
Numbers,33,28,They moved from Terah and camped at Mithkah.
Numbers,33,29,They went from Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah.
Numbers,33,30,They departed from Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth.
Numbers,33,31,They departed from Moseroth and camped at Bene Jaakan.
Numbers,33,32,They moved from Bene Jaakan and camped at Hor Hagidgad.
Numbers,33,33,They went from Hor Hagidgad and camped at Jotbathah.
Numbers,33,34,They moved from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah.
Numbers,33,35,They departed from Abronah and camped at Ezion Geber.
Numbers,33,36,"They moved from Ezion Geber and camped in the Wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh."
Numbers,33,37,"They moved from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the boundary of the land of Edom."
Numbers,33,38,"Then Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the command of the LORD, and died there in the fortieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, on the first day of the fifth month."
Numbers,33,39,Aaron was one hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor.
Numbers,33,40,"Now the king of Arad, the Canaanite, who dwelt in the South in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel."
Numbers,33,41,So they departed from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
Numbers,33,42,They departed from Zalmonah and camped at Punon.
Numbers,33,43,They departed from Punon and camped at Oboth.
Numbers,33,44,"They departed from Oboth and camped at Ije Abarim, at the border of Moab."
Numbers,33,45,They departed from Ijim and camped at Dibon Gad.
Numbers,33,46,They moved from Dibon Gad and camped at Almon Diblathaim.
Numbers,33,47,"They moved from Almon Diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo."
Numbers,33,48,"They departed from the mountains of Abarim and camped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho."
Numbers,33,49,"They camped by the Jordan, from Beth Jesimoth as far as the Abel Acacia Grove in the plains of Moab."
Numbers,33,50,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho, saying,"
Numbers,33,51,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When you have crossed the Jordan into the land of Canaan,"
Numbers,33,52,"then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, destroy all their engraved stones, destroy all their molded images, and demolish all their high places;"
Numbers,33,53,"you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell in it, for I have given you the land to possess."
Numbers,33,54,"And you shall divide the land by lot as an inheritance among your families; to the larger you shall give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller you shall give a smaller inheritance; there everyone’s inheritance shall be whatever falls to him by lot. You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers."
Numbers,33,55,"But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it shall be that those whom you let remain shall be irritants in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they shall harass you in the land where you dwell."
Numbers,33,56,Moreover it shall be that I will do to you as I thought to do to them.’”
Numbers,34,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,34,2,"“Command the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When you come into the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance—the land of Canaan to its boundaries."
Numbers,34,3,Your southern border shall be from the Wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom; then your southern border shall extend eastward to the end of the Salt Sea;
Numbers,34,4,"your border shall turn from the southern side of the Ascent of Akrabbim, continue to Zin, and be on the south of Kadesh Barnea; then it shall go on to Hazar Addar, and continue to Azmon;"
Numbers,34,5,"the border shall turn from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt, and it shall end at the Sea."
Numbers,34,6,"‘As for the western border, you shall have the Great Sea for a border; this shall be your western border."
Numbers,34,7,‘And this shall be your northern border: From the Great Sea you shall mark out your border line to Mount Hor;
Numbers,34,8,from Mount Hor you shall mark out your border to the entrance of Hamath; then the direction of the border shall be toward Zedad;
Numbers,34,9,"the border shall proceed to Ziphron, and it shall end at Hazar Enan. This shall be your northern border."
Numbers,34,10,‘You shall mark out your eastern border from Hazar Enan to Shepham;
Numbers,34,11,the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain; the border shall go down and reach to the eastern side of the Sea of Chinnereth;
Numbers,34,12,"the border shall go down along the Jordan, and it shall end at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land with its surrounding boundaries.’”"
Numbers,34,13,"Then Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying: “This is the land which you shall inherit by lot, which the LORD has commanded to give to the nine tribes and to the half-tribe."
Numbers,34,14,"For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and the half-tribe of Manasseh has received its inheritance."
Numbers,34,15,"The two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance on this side of the Jordan, across from Jericho eastward, toward the sunrise.”"
Numbers,34,16,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,34,17,“These are the names of the men who shall divide the land among you as an inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun.
Numbers,34,18,And you shall take one leader of every tribe to divide the land for the inheritance.
Numbers,34,19,"These are the names of the men: from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;"
Numbers,34,20,"from the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud;"
Numbers,34,21,"from the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon;"
Numbers,34,22,"a leader from the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli;"
Numbers,34,23,"from the sons of Joseph: a leader from the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod,"
Numbers,34,24,"and a leader from the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan;"
Numbers,34,25,"a leader from the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach;"
Numbers,34,26,"a leader from the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan;"
Numbers,34,27,"a leader from the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi;"
Numbers,34,28,"and a leader from the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.”"
Numbers,34,29,These are the ones the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance among the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
Numbers,35,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, saying:"
Numbers,35,2,"“Command the children of Israel that they give the Levites cities to dwell in from the inheritance of their possession, and you shall also give the Levites common-land around the cities."
Numbers,35,3,"They shall have the cities to dwell in; and their common-land shall be for their cattle, for their herds, and for all their animals."
Numbers,35,4,The common-land of the cities which you will give the Levites shall extend from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits all around.
Numbers,35,5,"And you shall measure outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, on the south side two thousand cubits, on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits. The city shall be in the middle. This shall belong to them as common-land for the cities."
Numbers,35,6,"“Now among the cities which you will give to the Levites you shall appoint six cities of refuge, to which a manslayer may flee. And to these you shall add forty-two cities."
Numbers,35,7,So all the cities you will give to the Levites shall be forty-eight; these you shall give with their common-land.
Numbers,35,8,"And the cities which you will give shall be from the possession of the children of Israel; from the larger tribe you shall give many, from the smaller you shall give few. Each shall give some of its cities to the Levites, in proportion to the inheritance that each receives.”"
Numbers,35,9,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,35,10,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,"
Numbers,35,11,"then you shall appoint cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any person accidentally may flee there."
Numbers,35,12,"They shall be cities of refuge for you from the avenger, that the manslayer may not die until he stands before the congregation in judgment."
Numbers,35,13,"And of the cities which you give, you shall have six cities of refuge."
Numbers,35,14,"You shall appoint three cities on this side of the Jordan, and three cities you shall appoint in the land of Canaan, which will be cities of refuge."
Numbers,35,15,"These six cities shall be for refuge for the children of Israel, for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them, that anyone who kills a person accidentally may flee there."
Numbers,35,16,"‘But if he strikes him with an iron implement, so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,17,"And if he strikes him with a stone in the hand, by which one could die, and he does die, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,18,"Or if he strikes him with a wooden hand weapon, by which one could die, and he does die, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,19,"The avenger of blood himself shall put the murderer to death; when he meets him, he shall put him to death."
Numbers,35,20,"If he pushes him out of hatred or, while lying in wait, hurls something at him so that he dies,"
Numbers,35,21,"or in enmity he strikes him with his hand so that he dies, the one who struck him shall surely be put to death. He is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him."
Numbers,35,22,"‘However, if he pushes him suddenly without enmity, or throws anything at him without lying in wait,"
Numbers,35,23,"or uses a stone, by which a man could die, throwing it at him without seeing him, so that he dies, while he was not his enemy or seeking his harm,"
Numbers,35,24,then the congregation shall judge between the manslayer and the avenger of blood according to these judgments.
Numbers,35,25,"So the congregation shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall return him to the city of refuge where he had fled, and he shall remain there until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil."
Numbers,35,26,"But if the manslayer at any time goes outside the limits of the city of refuge where he fled,"
Numbers,35,27,"and the avenger of blood finds him outside the limits of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the manslayer, he shall not be guilty of blood,"
Numbers,35,28,because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the manslayer may return to the land of his possession.
Numbers,35,29,‘And these things shall be a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Numbers,35,30,"Whoever kills a person, the murderer shall be put to death on the testimony of witnesses; but one witness is not sufficient testimony against a person for the death penalty."
Numbers,35,31,"Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,32,"And you shall take no ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge, that he may return to dwell in the land before the death of the priest."
Numbers,35,33,"So you shall not pollute the land where you are; for blood defiles the land, and no atonement can be made for the land, for the blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of him who shed it."
Numbers,35,34,"Therefore do not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell; for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.’”"
Numbers,36,1,"Now the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the leaders, the chief fathers of the children of Israel."
Numbers,36,2,"And they said: “The LORD commanded my lord Moses to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel, and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters."
Numbers,36,3,"Now if they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry; so it will be taken from the lot of our inheritance."
Numbers,36,4,"And when the Jubilee of the children of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry; so their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.”"
Numbers,36,5,"Then Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying: “What the tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks is right."
Numbers,36,6,"This is what the LORD commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, ‘Let them marry whom they think best, but they may marry only within the family of their father’s tribe.’"
Numbers,36,7,"So the inheritance of the children of Israel shall not change hands from tribe to tribe, for every one of the children of Israel shall keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers."
Numbers,36,8,"And every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be the wife of one of the family of her father’s tribe, so that the children of Israel each may possess the inheritance of his fathers."
Numbers,36,9,"Thus no inheritance shall change hands from one tribe to another, but every tribe of the children of Israel shall keep its own inheritance.”"
Numbers,36,10,"Just as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad;"
Numbers,36,11,"for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to the sons of their father’s brothers."
Numbers,36,12,"They were married into the families of the children of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of their father’s family."
Numbers,36,13,"These are the commandments and the judgments which the LORD commanded the children of Israel by the hand of Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho."
Deuteronomy,1,1,"These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side of the Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain opposite Suph, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab."
Deuteronomy,1,2,It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea.
Deuteronomy,1,3,"Now it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that the LORD had given him as commandments to them,"
Deuteronomy,1,4,"after he had killed Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei."
Deuteronomy,1,5,"On this side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying,"
Deuteronomy,1,6,"“The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: ‘You have dwelt long enough at this mountain."
Deuteronomy,1,7,"Turn and take your journey, and go to the mountains of the Amorites, to all the neighboring places in the plain, in the mountains and in the lowland, in the South and on the seacoast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the River Euphrates."
Deuteronomy,1,8,"See, I have set the land before you; go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers—to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—to give to them and their descendants after them.’"
Deuteronomy,1,9,"“And I spoke to you at that time, saying: ‘I alone am not able to bear you."
Deuteronomy,1,10,"The LORD your God has multiplied you, and here you are today, as the stars of heaven in multitude."
Deuteronomy,1,11,"May the LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times more numerous than you are, and bless you as He has promised you!"
Deuteronomy,1,12,How can I alone bear your problems and your burdens and your complaints?
Deuteronomy,1,13,"Choose wise, understanding, and knowledgeable men from among your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.’"
Deuteronomy,1,14,"And you answered me and said, ‘The thing which you have told us to do is good.’"
Deuteronomy,1,15,"So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and made them heads over you, leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, leaders of tens, and officers for your tribes."
Deuteronomy,1,16,"“Then I commanded your judges at that time, saying, ‘Hear the cases between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the stranger who is with him."
Deuteronomy,1,17,"You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small as well as the great; you shall not be afraid in any man’s presence, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.’"
Deuteronomy,1,18,And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.
Deuteronomy,1,19,"“So we departed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw on the way to the mountains of the Amorites, as the LORD our God had commanded us. Then we came to Kadesh Barnea."
Deuteronomy,1,20,"And I said to you, ‘You have come to the mountains of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us."
Deuteronomy,1,21,"Look, the LORD your God has set the land before you; go up and possess it, as the LORD God of your fathers has spoken to you; do not fear or be discouraged.’"
Deuteronomy,1,22,"“And every one of you came near to me and said, ‘Let us send men before us, and let them search out the land for us, and bring back word to us of the way by which we should go up, and of the cities into which we shall come.’"
Deuteronomy,1,23,"“The plan pleased me well; so I took twelve of your men, one man from each tribe."
Deuteronomy,1,24,"And they departed and went up into the mountains, and came to the Valley of Eshcol, and spied it out."
Deuteronomy,1,25,"They also took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us; and they brought back word to us, saying, ‘It is a good land which the LORD our God is giving us.’"
Deuteronomy,1,26,"“Nevertheless you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the LORD your God;"
Deuteronomy,1,27,"and you complained in your tents, and said, ‘Because the LORD hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us."
Deuteronomy,1,28,"Where can we go up? Our brethren have discouraged our hearts, saying, “The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.”’"
Deuteronomy,1,29,"“Then I said to you, ‘Do not be terrified, or afraid of them."
Deuteronomy,1,30,"The LORD your God, who goes before you, He will fight for you, according to all He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,"
Deuteronomy,1,31,"and in the wilderness where you saw how the LORD your God carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went until you came to this place.’"
Deuteronomy,1,32,"Yet, for all that, you did not believe the LORD your God,"
Deuteronomy,1,33,"who went in the way before you to search out a place for you to pitch your tents, to show you the way you should go, in the fire by night and in the cloud by day."
Deuteronomy,1,34,"“And the LORD heard the sound of your words, and was angry, and took an oath, saying,"
Deuteronomy,1,35,"‘Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see that good land of which I swore to give to your fathers,"
Deuteronomy,1,36,"except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and his children I am giving the land on which he walked, because he wholly followed the LORD.’"
Deuteronomy,1,37,"The LORD was also angry with me for your sakes, saying, ‘Even you shall not go in there."
Deuteronomy,1,38,"Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it."
Deuteronomy,1,39,"‘Moreover your little ones and your children, who you say will be victims, who today have no knowledge of good and evil, they shall go in there; to them I will give it, and they shall possess it."
Deuteronomy,1,40,"But as for you, turn and take your journey into the wilderness by the Way of the Red Sea.’"
Deuteronomy,1,41,"“Then you answered and said to me, ‘We have sinned against the LORD; we will go up and fight, just as the LORD our God commanded us.’ And when everyone of you had girded on his weapons of war, you were ready to go up into the mountain."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"“And the LORD said to me, ‘Tell them, “Do not go up nor fight, for I am not among you; lest you be defeated before your enemies.”"
Deuteronomy,1,43,"So I spoke to you; yet you would not listen, but rebelled against the command of the LORD, and presumptuously went up into the mountain."
Deuteronomy,1,44,"And the Amorites who dwelt in that mountain came out against you and chased you as bees do, and drove you back from Seir to Hormah."
Deuteronomy,1,45,"Then you returned and wept before the LORD, but the LORD would not listen to your voice nor give ear to you."
Deuteronomy,1,46,"“So you remained in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you spent there."
Deuteronomy,2,1,"“Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness of the Way of the Red Sea, as the LORD spoke to me, and we skirted Mount Seir for many days."
Deuteronomy,2,2,"“And the LORD spoke to me, saying:"
Deuteronomy,2,3,‘You have skirted this mountain long enough; turn northward.
Deuteronomy,2,4,"And command the people, saying, “You are about to pass through the territory of your brethren, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore watch yourselves carefully."
Deuteronomy,2,5,"Do not meddle with them, for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as one footstep, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession."
Deuteronomy,2,6,"You shall buy food from them with money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water from them with money, that you may drink."
Deuteronomy,2,7,“For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand. He knows your trudging through this great wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.”’
Deuteronomy,2,8,"“And when we passed beyond our brethren, the descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir, away from the road of the plain, away from Elath and Ezion Geber, we turned and passed by way of the Wilderness of Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"Then the LORD said to me, ‘Do not harass Moab, nor contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.’”"
Deuteronomy,2,10,"(The Emim had dwelt there in times past, a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim."
Deuteronomy,2,11,"They were also regarded as giants, like the Anakim, but the Moabites call them Emim."
Deuteronomy,2,12,"The Horites formerly dwelt in Seir, but the descendants of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their place, just as Israel did to the land of their possession which the LORD gave them.)"
Deuteronomy,2,13,“‘Now rise and cross over the Valley of the Zered.’ So we crossed over the Valley of the Zered.
Deuteronomy,2,14,"And the time we took to come from Kadesh Barnea until we crossed over the Valley of the Zered was thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war was consumed from the midst of the camp, just as the LORD had sworn to them."
Deuteronomy,2,15,"For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp until they were consumed."
Deuteronomy,2,16,"“So it was, when all the men of war had finally perished from among the people,"
Deuteronomy,2,17,"that the LORD spoke to me, saying:"
Deuteronomy,2,18,"‘This day you are to cross over at Ar, the boundary of Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,19,"And when you come near the people of Ammon, do not harass them or meddle with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the descendants of Lot as a possession.’”"
Deuteronomy,2,20,"(That was also regarded as a land of giants; giants formerly dwelt there. But the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,"
Deuteronomy,2,21,"a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim. But the LORD destroyed them before them, and they dispossessed them and dwelt in their place,"
Deuteronomy,2,22,"just as He had done for the descendants of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them. They dispossessed them and dwelt in their place, even to this day."
Deuteronomy,2,23,"And the Avim, who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza—the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and dwelt in their place.)"
Deuteronomy,2,24,"“‘Rise, take your journey, and cross over the River Arnon. Look, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to possess it, and engage him in battle."
Deuteronomy,2,25,"This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the nations under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.’"
Deuteronomy,2,26,"“And I sent messengers from the Wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,27,"‘Let me pass through your land; I will keep strictly to the road, and I will turn neither to the right nor to the left."
Deuteronomy,2,28,"You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink; only let me pass through on foot,"
Deuteronomy,2,29,"just as the descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar did for me, until I cross the Jordan to the land which the LORD our God is giving us.’"
Deuteronomy,2,30,"“But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through, for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into your hand, as it is this day."
Deuteronomy,2,31,"“And the LORD said to me, ‘See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to possess it, that you may inherit his land.’"
Deuteronomy,2,32,Then Sihon and all his people came out against us to fight at Jahaz.
Deuteronomy,2,33,"And the LORD our God delivered him over to us; so we defeated him, his sons, and all his people."
Deuteronomy,2,34,"We took all his cities at that time, and we utterly destroyed the men, women, and little ones of every city; we left none remaining."
Deuteronomy,2,35,"We took only the livestock as plunder for ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we took."
Deuteronomy,2,36,"From Aroer, which is on the bank of the River Arnon, and from the city that is in the ravine, as far as Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us; the LORD our God delivered all to us."
Deuteronomy,2,37,"Only you did not go near the land of the people of Ammon—anywhere along the River Jabbok, or to the cities of the mountains, or wherever the LORD our God had forbidden us."
Deuteronomy,3,1,"“Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan; and Og king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"And the LORD said to me, ‘Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand; you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.’"
Deuteronomy,3,3,"“So the LORD our God also delivered into our hands Og king of Bashan, with all his people, and we attacked him until he had no survivors remaining."
Deuteronomy,3,4,"And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,5,"All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides a great many rural towns."
Deuteronomy,3,6,"And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city."
Deuteronomy,3,7,But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as booty for ourselves.
Deuteronomy,3,8,"“And at that time we took the land from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were on this side of the Jordan, from the River Arnon to Mount Hermon"
Deuteronomy,3,9,"(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir),"
Deuteronomy,3,10,"all the cities of the plain, all Gilead, and all Bashan, as far as Salcah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,11,"“For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the giants. Indeed his bedstead was an iron bedstead. (Is it not in Rabbah of the people of Ammon?) Nine cubits is its length and four cubits its width, according to the standard cubit."
Deuteronomy,3,12,"“And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the River Arnon, and half the mountains of Gilead and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites."
Deuteronomy,3,13,"The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh. (All the region of Argob, with all Bashan, was called the land of the giants."
Deuteronomy,3,14,"Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and called Bashan after his own name, Havoth Jair, to this day.)"
Deuteronomy,3,15,“Also I gave Gilead to Machir.
Deuteronomy,3,16,"And to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave from Gilead as far as the River Arnon, the middle of the river as the border, as far as the River Jabbok, the border of the people of Ammon;"
Deuteronomy,3,17,"the plain also, with the Jordan as the border, from Chinnereth as far as the east side of the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah."
Deuteronomy,3,18,"“Then I commanded you at that time, saying: ‘The LORD your God has given you this land to possess. All you men of valor shall cross over armed before your brethren, the children of Israel."
Deuteronomy,3,19,"But your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall stay in your cities which I have given you,"
Deuteronomy,3,20,"until the LORD has given rest to your brethren as to you, and they also possess the land which the LORD your God is giving them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his possession which I have given you.’"
Deuteronomy,3,21,"“And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, ‘Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings; so will the LORD do to all the kingdoms through which you pass."
Deuteronomy,3,22,"You must not fear them, for the LORD your God Himself fights for you.’"
Deuteronomy,3,23,"“Then I pleaded with the LORD at that time, saying:"
Deuteronomy,3,24,"‘O Lord GOD, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty hand, for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do anything like Your works and Your mighty deeds?"
Deuteronomy,3,25,"I pray, let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, those pleasant mountains, and Lebanon.’"
Deuteronomy,3,26,"“But the LORD was angry with me on your account, and would not listen to me. So the LORD said to me: ‘Enough of that! Speak no more to Me of this matter."
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift your eyes toward the west, the north, the south, and the east; behold it with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan."
Deuteronomy,3,28,"But command Joshua, and encourage him and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you will see.’"
Deuteronomy,3,29,“So we stayed in the valley opposite Beth Peor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,"“Now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I teach you to observe, that you may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers is giving you."
Deuteronomy,4,2,"You shall not add to the word which I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you."
Deuteronomy,4,3,Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal Peor; for the LORD your God has destroyed from among you all the men who followed Baal of Peor.
Deuteronomy,4,4,"But you who held fast to the LORD your God are alive today, every one of you."
Deuteronomy,4,5,"“Surely I have taught you statutes and judgments, just as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should act according to them in the land which you go to possess."
Deuteronomy,4,6,"Therefore be careful to observe them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes, and say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.’"
Deuteronomy,4,7,"“For what great nation is there that has God so near to it, as the LORD our God is to us, for whatever reason we may call upon Him?"

Deuteronomy,10,17,"For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality nor takes a bribe."
Deuteronomy,10,18,"He administers justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing."
Deuteronomy,10,19,"Therefore love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,10,20,"You shall fear the LORD your God; you shall serve Him, and to Him you shall hold fast, and take oaths in His name."
Deuteronomy,10,21,"He is your praise, and He is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things which your eyes have seen."
Deuteronomy,10,22,"Your fathers went down to Egypt with seventy persons, and now the LORD your God has made you as the stars of heaven in multitude."
Deuteronomy,11,1,"“Therefore you shall love the LORD your God, and keep His charge, His statutes, His judgments, and His commandments always."
Deuteronomy,11,2,"Know today that I do not speak with your children, who have not known and who have not seen the chastening of the LORD your God, His greatness and His mighty hand and His outstretched arm—"
Deuteronomy,11,3,"His signs and His acts which He did in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to all his land;"
Deuteronomy,11,4,"what He did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and their chariots: how He made the waters of the Red Sea overflow them as they pursued you, and how the LORD has destroyed them to this day;"
Deuteronomy,11,5,what He did for you in the wilderness until you came to this place;
Deuteronomy,11,6,"and what He did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, their households, their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel—"
Deuteronomy,11,7,but your eyes have seen every great act of the LORD which He did.
Deuteronomy,11,8,"“Therefore you shall keep every commandment which I command you today, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land which you cross over to possess,"
Deuteronomy,11,9,"and that you may prolong your days in the land which the LORD swore to give your fathers, to them and their descendants, ‘a land flowing with milk and honey.’"
Deuteronomy,11,10,"For the land which you go to possess is not like the land of Egypt from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and watered it by foot, as a vegetable garden;"
Deuteronomy,11,11,"but the land which you cross over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, which drinks water from the rain of heaven,"
Deuteronomy,11,12,"a land for which the LORD your God cares; the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year to the very end of the year."
Deuteronomy,11,13,"‘And it shall be that if you earnestly obey My commandments which I command you today, to love the LORD your God and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul,"
Deuteronomy,11,14,"then I will give you the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil."
Deuteronomy,11,15,"And I will send grass in your fields for your livestock, that you may eat and be filled.’"
Deuteronomy,11,16,"“Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them,"
Deuteronomy,11,17,"lest the LORD’s anger be aroused against you, and He shut up the heavens so that there be no rain, and the land yield no produce, and you perish quickly from the good land which the LORD is giving you."
Deuteronomy,11,18,"“Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes."
Deuteronomy,11,19,"You shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up."
Deuteronomy,11,20,"And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,"
Deuteronomy,11,21,"that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land of which the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, like the days of the heavens above the earth."
Deuteronomy,11,22,"“For if you carefully keep all these commandments which I command you to do—to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways, and to hold fast to Him—"
Deuteronomy,11,23,"then the LORD will drive out all these nations from before you, and you will dispossess greater and mightier nations than yourselves."
Deuteronomy,11,24,"Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the River Euphrates, even to the Western Sea, shall be your territory."
Deuteronomy,11,25,"No man shall be able to stand against you; the LORD your God will put the dread of you and the fear of you upon all the land where you tread, just as He has said to you."
Deuteronomy,11,26,"“Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse:"
Deuteronomy,11,27,"the blessing, if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you today;"
Deuteronomy,11,28,"and the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside from the way which I command you today, to go after other gods which you have not known."
Deuteronomy,11,29,"Now it shall be, when the LORD your God has brought you into the land which you go to possess, that you shall put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal."
Deuteronomy,11,30,"Are they not on the other side of the Jordan, toward the setting sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the plain opposite Gilgal, beside the terebinth trees of Moreh?"
Deuteronomy,11,31,"For you will cross over the Jordan and go in to possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you, and you will possess it and dwell in it."
Deuteronomy,11,32,And you shall be careful to observe all the statutes and judgments which I set before you today.
Deuteronomy,12,1,"“These are the statutes and judgments which you shall be careful to observe in the land which the LORD God of your fathers is giving you to possess, all the days that you live on the earth."
Deuteronomy,12,2,"You shall utterly destroy all the places where the nations which you shall dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree."
Deuteronomy,12,3,"And you shall destroy their altars, break their sacred pillars, and burn their wooden images with fire; you shall cut down the carved images of their gods and destroy their names from that place."
Deuteronomy,12,4,You shall not worship the LORD your God with such things.
Deuteronomy,12,5,"“But you shall seek the place where the LORD your God chooses, out of all your tribes, to put His name for His dwelling place; and there you shall go."
Deuteronomy,12,6,"There you shall take your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the heave offerings of your hand, your vowed offerings, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks."
Deuteronomy,12,7,"And there you shall eat before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice in all to which you have put your hand, you and your households, in which the LORD your God has blessed you."
Deuteronomy,12,8,“You shall not at all do as we are doing here today—every man doing whatever is right in his own eyes—
Deuteronomy,12,9,for as yet you have not come to the rest and the inheritance which the LORD your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy,12,10,"But when you cross over the Jordan and dwell in the land which the LORD your God is giving you to inherit, and He gives you rest from all your enemies round about, so that you dwell in safety,"
Deuteronomy,12,11,"then there will be the place where the LORD your God chooses to make His name abide. There you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the heave offerings of your hand, and all your choice offerings which you vow to the LORD."
Deuteronomy,12,12,"And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you and your sons and your daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, since he has no portion nor inheritance with you."
Deuteronomy,12,13,Take heed to yourself that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see;
Deuteronomy,12,14,"but in the place which the LORD chooses, in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you."
Deuteronomy,12,15,"“However, you may slaughter and eat meat within all your gates, whatever your heart desires, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which He has given you; the unclean and the clean may eat of it, of the gazelle and the deer alike."
Deuteronomy,12,16,Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it on the earth like water.
Deuteronomy,12,17,"You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain or your new wine or your oil, of the firstborn of your herd or your flock, of any of your offerings which you vow, of your freewill offerings, or of the heave offering of your hand."
Deuteronomy,12,18,"But you must eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God chooses, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all to which you put your hands."
Deuteronomy,12,19,Take heed to yourself that you do not forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.
Deuteronomy,12,20,"“When the LORD your God enlarges your border as He has promised you, and you say, ‘Let me eat meat,’ because you long to eat meat, you may eat as much meat as your heart desires."
Deuteronomy,12,21,"If the place where the LORD your God chooses to put His name is too far from you, then you may slaughter from your herd and from your flock which the LORD has given you, just as I have commanded you, and you may eat within your gates as much as your heart desires."
Deuteronomy,12,22,"Just as the gazelle and the deer are eaten, so you may eat them; the unclean and the clean alike may eat them."
Deuteronomy,12,23,"Only be sure that you do not eat the blood, for the blood is the life; you may not eat the life with the meat."
Deuteronomy,12,24,You shall not eat it; you shall pour it on the earth like water.
Deuteronomy,12,25,"You shall not eat it, that it may go well with you and your children after you, when you do what is right in the sight of the LORD."
Deuteronomy,12,26,"Only the holy things which you have, and your vowed offerings, you shall take and go to the place which the LORD chooses."
Deuteronomy,12,27,"And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the meat and the blood, on the altar of the LORD your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the LORD your God, and you shall eat the meat."
Deuteronomy,12,28,"Observe and obey all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you and your children after you forever, when you do what is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,12,29,"“When the LORD your God cuts off from before you the nations which you go to dispossess, and you displace them and dwell in their land,"
Deuteronomy,12,30,"take heed to yourself that you are not ensnared to follow them, after they are destroyed from before you, and that you do not inquire after their gods, saying, ‘How did these nations serve their gods? I also will do likewise.’"
Deuteronomy,12,31,You shall not worship the LORD your God in that way; for every abomination to the LORD which He hates they have done to their gods; for they burn even their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods.
Deuteronomy,12,32,"“Whatever I command you, be careful to observe it; you shall not add to it nor take away from it."
Deuteronomy,13,1,"“If there arises among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and he gives you a sign or a wonder,"
Deuteronomy,13,2,"and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, ‘Let us go after other gods’—which you have not known—‘and let us serve them,’"
Deuteronomy,13,3,"you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams, for the LORD your God is testing you to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul."
Deuteronomy,13,4,"You shall walk after the LORD your God and fear Him, and keep His commandments and obey His voice; you shall serve Him and hold fast to Him."
Deuteronomy,13,5,"But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has spoken in order to turn you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of bondage, to entice you from the way in which the LORD your God commanded you to walk. So you shall put away the evil from your midst."
Deuteronomy,13,6,"“If your brother, the son of your mother, your son or your daughter, the wife of your bosom, or your friend who is as your own soul, secretly entices you, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods,’ which you have not known, neither you nor your fathers,"
Deuteronomy,13,7,"of the gods of the people which are all around you, near to you or far off from you, from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth,"
Deuteronomy,13,8,"you shall not consent to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him or conceal him;"
Deuteronomy,13,9,"but you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people."
Deuteronomy,13,10,"And you shall stone him with stones until he dies, because he sought to entice you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage."
Deuteronomy,13,11,"So all Israel shall hear and fear, and not again do such wickedness as this among you."
Deuteronomy,13,12,"“If you hear someone in one of your cities, which the LORD your God gives you to dwell in, saying,"
Deuteronomy,13,13,"‘Corrupt men have gone out from among you and enticed the inhabitants of their city, saying, “Let us go and serve other gods”’—which you have not known—"
Deuteronomy,13,14,"then you shall inquire, search out, and ask diligently. And if it is indeed true and certain that such an abomination was committed among you,"
Deuteronomy,13,15,"you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying it, all that is in it and its livestock—with the edge of the sword."
Deuteronomy,13,16,"And you shall gather all its plunder into the middle of the street, and completely burn with fire the city and all its plunder, for the LORD your God. It shall be a heap forever; it shall not be built again."
Deuteronomy,13,17,"So none of the accursed things shall remain in your hand, that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of His anger and show you mercy, have compassion on you and multiply you, just as He swore to your fathers,"
Deuteronomy,13,18,"because you have listened to the voice of the LORD your God, to keep all His commandments which I command you today, to do what is right in the eyes of the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,14,1,“You are the children of the LORD your God; you shall not cut yourselves nor shave the front of your head for the dead.
Deuteronomy,14,2,"For you are a holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure above all the peoples who are on the face of the earth."
Deuteronomy,14,3,“You shall not eat any detestable thing.
Deuteronomy,14,4,"These are the animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,"
Deuteronomy,14,5,"the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the mountain goat, the antelope, and the mountain sheep."
Deuteronomy,14,6,"And you may eat every animal with cloven hooves, having the hoof split into two parts, and that chews the cud, among the animals."
Deuteronomy,14,7,"Nevertheless, of those that chew the cud or have cloven hooves, you shall not eat, such as these: the camel, the hare, and the rock hyrax; for they chew the cud but do not have cloven hooves; they are unclean for you."
Deuteronomy,14,8,"Also the swine is unclean for you, because it has cloven hooves, yet does not chew the cud; you shall not eat their flesh or touch their dead carcasses."
Deuteronomy,14,9,“These you may eat of all that are in the waters: you may eat all that have fins and scales.
Deuteronomy,14,10,And whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean for you.
Deuteronomy,14,11,“All clean birds you may eat.
Deuteronomy,14,12,"But these you shall not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the buzzard,"
Deuteronomy,14,13,"the red kite, the falcon, and the kite after their kinds;"
Deuteronomy,14,14,every raven after its kind;
Deuteronomy,14,15,"the ostrich, the short-eared owl, the sea gull, and the hawk after their kinds;"
Deuteronomy,14,16,"the little owl, the screech owl, the white owl,"
Deuteronomy,14,17,"the jackdaw, the carrion vulture, the fisher owl,"
Deuteronomy,14,18,"the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe and the bat."
Deuteronomy,14,19,“Also every creeping thing that flies is unclean for you; they shall not be eaten.
Deuteronomy,14,20,“You may eat all clean birds.
Deuteronomy,14,21,"“You shall not eat anything that dies of itself; you may give it to the alien who is within your gates, that he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner; for you are a holy people to the LORD your God. “You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk."
Deuteronomy,14,22,“You shall truly tithe all the increase of your grain that the field produces year by year.
Deuteronomy,14,23,"And you shall eat before the LORD your God, in the place where He chooses to make His name abide, the tithe of your grain and your new wine and your oil, of the firstborn of your herds and your flocks, that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always."
Deuteronomy,14,24,"But if the journey is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry the tithe, or if the place where the LORD your God chooses to put His name is too far from you, when the LORD your God has blessed you,"
Deuteronomy,14,25,"then you shall exchange it for money, take the money in your hand, and go to the place which the LORD your God chooses."
Deuteronomy,14,26,"And you shall spend that money for whatever your heart desires: for oxen or sheep, for wine or similar drink, for whatever your heart desires; you shall eat there before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your household."
Deuteronomy,14,27,"You shall not forsake the Levite who is within your gates, for he has no part nor inheritance with you."

Deuteronomy,15,1,“At the end of every seven years you shall grant a release of debts.
Deuteronomy,15,2,"And this is the form of the release: Every creditor who has lent anything to his neighbor shall release it; he shall not require it of his neighbor or his brother, because it is called the LORD’s release."
Deuteronomy,15,3,"Of a foreigner you may require it; but you shall give up your claim to what is owed by your brother,"
Deuteronomy,15,4,except when there may be no poor among you; for the LORD will greatly bless you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance—
Deuteronomy,15,5,"only if you carefully obey the voice of the LORD your God, to observe with care all these commandments which I command you today."
Deuteronomy,15,6,"For the LORD your God will bless you just as He promised you; you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow; you shall reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over you."
Deuteronomy,15,7,"“If there is among you a poor man of your brethren, within any of the gates in your land which the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your poor brother,"

Deuteronomy,15,9,"Beware lest there be a wicked thought in your heart, saying, ‘The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand,’ and your eye be evil against your poor brother and you give him nothing, and he cry out to the LORD against you, and it become sin among you."

Deuteronomy,15,15,"You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you; therefore I command you this thing today."
Deuteronomy,15,16,"And if it happens that he says to you, ‘I will not go away from you,’ because he loves you and your house, since he prospers with you,"
Deuteronomy,15,17,"then you shall take an awl and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant forever. Also to your female servant you shall do likewise."
Deuteronomy,15,18,It shall not seem hard to you when you send him away free from you; for he has been worth a double hired servant in serving you six years. Then the LORD your God will bless you in all that you do.

Deuteronomy,16,3,"You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat unleavened bread with it, that is, the bread of affliction (for you came out of the land of Egypt in haste), that you may remember the day in which you came out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life."
Deuteronomy,16,4,"And no leaven shall be seen among you in all your territory for seven days, nor shall any of the meat which you sacrifice the first day at twilight remain overnight until morning."

Deuteronomy,18,5,"For the LORD your God has chosen him out of all your tribes to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons forever."
Deuteronomy,18,6,"“So if a Levite comes from any of your gates, from where he dwells among all Israel, and comes with all the desire of his mind to the place which the LORD chooses,"
Deuteronomy,18,7,"then he may serve in the name of the LORD his God as all his brethren the Levites do, who stand there before the LORD."

Deuteronomy,18,14,"For these nations which you will dispossess listened to soothsayers and diviners; but as for you, the LORD your God has not appointed such for you."
Deuteronomy,18,15,"“The LORD your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your midst, from your brethren. Him you shall hear,"
Deuteronomy,18,16,"according to all you desired of the LORD your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, ‘Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, nor let me see this great fire anymore, lest I die.’"
Deuteronomy,18,17,“And the LORD said to me: ‘What they have spoken is good.
Deuteronomy,18,18,"I will raise up for them a Prophet like you from among their brethren, and will put My words in His mouth, and He shall speak to them all that I command Him."
Deuteronomy,18,19,"And it shall be that whoever will not hear My words, which He speaks in My name, I will require it of him."
Deuteronomy,18,20,"But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in My name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.’"
Deuteronomy,18,21,"And if you say in your heart, ‘How shall we know the word which the LORD has not spoken?’—"
Deuteronomy,18,22,"when a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the thing does not happen or come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD has not spoken; the prophet has spoken it presumptuously; you shall not be afraid of him."
Deuteronomy,19,1,"“When the LORD your God has cut off the nations whose land the LORD your God is giving you, and you dispossess them and dwell in their cities and in their houses,"

Deuteronomy,19,3,"You shall prepare roads for yourself, and divide into three parts the territory of your land which the LORD your God is giving you to inherit, that any manslayer may flee there."
Deuteronomy,19,4,"“And this is the case of the manslayer who flees there, that he may live: Whoever kills his neighbor unintentionally, not having hated him in time past—"
Deuteronomy,19,5,"as when a man goes to the woods with his neighbor to cut timber, and his hand swings a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies—he shall flee to one of these cities and live;"
Deuteronomy,19,6,"lest the avenger of blood, while his anger is hot, pursue the manslayer and overtake him, because the way is long, and kill him, though he was not deserving of death, since he had not hated the victim in time past."
Deuteronomy,19,7,"Therefore I command you, saying, ‘You shall separate three cities for yourself.’"
Deuteronomy,19,8,"“Now if the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as He swore to your fathers, and gives you the land which He promised to give to your fathers,"
Deuteronomy,19,9,"and if you keep all these commandments and do them, which I command you today, to love the LORD your God and to walk always in His ways, then you shall add three more cities for yourself besides these three,"
Deuteronomy,19,10,"lest innocent blood be shed in the midst of your land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and thus guilt of bloodshed be upon you."
Deuteronomy,19,11,"“But if anyone hates his neighbor, lies in wait for him, rises against him and strikes him mortally, so that he dies, and he flees to one of these cities,"
Deuteronomy,19,12,"then the elders of his city shall send and bring him from there, and deliver him over to the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die."

Deuteronomy,19,17,"then both men in the controversy shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges who serve in those days."
Deuteronomy,19,18,"And the judges shall make careful inquiry, and indeed, if the witness is a false witness, who has testified falsely against his brother,"
Deuteronomy,19,19,then you shall do to him as he thought to have done to his brother; so you shall put away the evil from among you.
Deuteronomy,19,20,"And those who remain shall hear and fear, and hereafter they shall not again commit such evil among you."
Deuteronomy,19,21,"Your eye shall not pity: life shall be for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot."
Deuteronomy,20,1,"“When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses and chariots and people more numerous than you, do not be afraid of them; for the LORD your God is with you, who brought you up from the land of Egypt."

Deuteronomy,20,12,"Now if the city will not make peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it."
Deuteronomy,20,13,"And when the LORD your God delivers it into your hands, you shall strike every male in it with the edge of the sword."

Deuteronomy,20,16,"“But of the cities of these peoples which the LORD your God gives you as an inheritance, you shall let nothing that breathes remain alive,"
Deuteronomy,20,17,"but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, just as the LORD your God has commanded you,"
Deuteronomy,20,18,"lest they teach you to do according to all their abominations which they have done for their gods, and you sin against the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,20,19,"“When you besiege a city for a long time, while making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them; if you can eat of them, do not cut them down to use in the siege, for the tree of the field is man’s food."
Deuteronomy,20,20,"Only the trees which you know are not trees for food you may destroy and cut down, to build siegeworks against the city that makes war with you, until it is subdued."
Deuteronomy,21,1,"“If anyone is found slain, lying in the field in the land which the LORD your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who killed him,"
Deuteronomy,21,2,then your elders and your judges shall go out and measure the distance from the slain man to the surrounding cities.
Deuteronomy,21,3,And it shall be that the elders of the city nearest to the slain man will take a heifer which has not been worked and which has not pulled with a yoke.
Deuteronomy,21,4,"The elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with flowing water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and they shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley."
Deuteronomy,21,5,"Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near, for the LORD your God has chosen them to minister to Him and to bless in the name of the LORD; by their word every controversy and every assault shall be settled."
Deuteronomy,21,6,And all the elders of that city nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley.
Deuteronomy,21,7,"Then they shall answer and say, ‘Our hands have not shed this blood, nor have our eyes seen it."
Deuteronomy,21,8,"Provide atonement, O LORD, for Your people Israel, whom You have redeemed, and do not lay innocent blood to the charge of Your people Israel.’ And atonement shall be provided on their behalf for the blood."

Deuteronomy,21,18,"“If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and who, when they have chastened him, will not heed them,"
Deuteronomy,21,19,"then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city, to the gate of his city."
Deuteronomy,21,20,"And they shall say to the elders of his city, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.’"
Deuteronomy,21,21,"Then all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones; so you shall put away the evil from among you, and all Israel shall hear and fear."
Deuteronomy,21,22,"“If a man has committed a sin deserving of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree,"
Deuteronomy,21,23,"his body shall not remain overnight on the tree, but you shall surely bury him that day, so that you do not defile the land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance; for he who is hanged is accursed of God."
Deuteronomy,22,1,"“You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep going astray, and hide yourself from them; you shall certainly bring them back to your brother."

Deuteronomy,22,4,"“You shall not see your brother’s donkey or his ox fall down along the road, and hide yourself from them; you shall surely help him lift them up again."
Deuteronomy,22,5,"“A woman shall not wear anything that pertains to a man, nor shall a man put on a woman’s garment, for all who do so are an abomination to the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,22,6,"“If a bird’s nest happens to be before you along the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, with the mother sitting on the young or on the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young;"
Deuteronomy,22,7,"you shall surely let the mother go, and take the young for yourself, that it may be well with you and that you may prolong your days."
Deuteronomy,22,8,"“When you build a new house, then you shall make a parapet for your roof, that you may not bring guilt of bloodshed on your household if anyone falls from it."

Deuteronomy,22,14,"and charges her with shameful conduct, and brings a bad name on her, and says, ‘I took this woman, and when I came to her I found she was not a virgin,’"
Deuteronomy,22,15,then the father and mother of the young woman shall take and bring out the evidence of the young woman’s virginity to the elders of the city at the gate.
Deuteronomy,22,16,"And the young woman’s father shall say to the elders, ‘I gave my daughter to this man as wife, and he detests her."
Deuteronomy,22,17,"Now he has charged her with shameful conduct, saying, “I found your daughter was not a virgin,” and yet these are the evidences of my daughter’s virginity.’ And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city."
Deuteronomy,22,18,Then the elders of that city shall take that man and punish him;
Deuteronomy,22,19,"and they shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver and give them to the father of the young woman, because he has brought a bad name on a virgin of Israel. And she shall be his wife; he cannot divorce her all his days."
Deuteronomy,22,20,"“But if the thing is true, and evidences of virginity are not found for the young woman,"
Deuteronomy,22,21,"then they shall bring out the young woman to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done a disgraceful thing in Israel, to play the harlot in her father’s house. So you shall put away the evil from among you."
Deuteronomy,22,22,"“If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then both of them shall die—the man that lay with the woman, and the woman; so you shall put away the evil from Israel."
Deuteronomy,22,23,"“If a young woman who is a virgin is betrothed to a husband, and a man finds her in the city and lies with her,"
Deuteronomy,22,24,"then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry out in the city, and the man because he humbled his neighbor’s wife; so you shall put away the evil from among you."
Deuteronomy,22,25,"“But if a man finds a betrothed young woman in the countryside, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die."
Deuteronomy,22,26,"But you shall do nothing to the young woman; there is in the young woman no sin deserving of death, for just as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him, even so is this matter."
Deuteronomy,22,27,"For he found her in the countryside, and the betrothed young woman cried out, but there was no one to save her."
Deuteronomy,22,28,"“If a man finds a young woman who is a virgin, who is not betrothed, and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are found out,"
Deuteronomy,22,29,"then the man who lay with her shall give to the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife because he has humbled her; he shall not be permitted to divorce her all his days."
