Genesis,17,14,"And the uncircumcised{H6189} man child{H2145} whose{H834} flesh{H1320} of his foreskin{H6190} is not circumcised{H4135}{(H8735)}, that soul{H5315} shall be cut off{H3772}{(H8738)} from his people{H5971}; he hath broken{H6565}{(H8689)} my covenant{H1285}."
Genesis,17,15,"And God{H430} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Abraham{H85}, As for Sarai{H8297} thy wife{H802}, thou shalt not call{H7121}{(H8799)} her name{H8034} Sarai{H8297}, but{H3588} Sarah{H8283} shall her name{H8034} be."
Genesis,17,16,"And I will bless{H1288}{(H8765)} her, and give{H5414}{(H8804)} thee a son{H1121} also of her: yea, I will bless{H1288}{(H8765)} her, and she shall be a mother of nations{H1471}; kings{H4428} of people{H5971} shall be of her."
Genesis,17,17,"Then Abraham{H85} fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon his face{H6440}, and laughed{H6711}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} in his heart{H3820}, Shall a child be born{H3205}{(H8735)} unto him that is an hundred{H3967} years{H8141} old{H1121}? and shall Sarah{H8283}, that is ninety{H8673} years{H8141} old{H1323}, bear{H3205}{(H8799)}?"
Genesis,17,18,"And Abraham{H85} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto God{H430}, O that{H3863} Ishmael{H3458} might live{H2421}{(H8799)} before thee{H6440}!"
Genesis,17,19,"And God{H430} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Sarah{H8283} thy wife{H802} shall bear{H3205}{(H8802)} thee a son{H1121} indeed{H61}; and thou shalt call{H7121}{(H8804)} his name{H8034} Isaac{H3327}: and I will establish{H6965}{(H8689)} my covenant{H1285} with him for an everlasting{H5769} covenant{H1285}, and with his seed{H2233} after him{H310}."
Genesis,17,20,"And as for Ishmael{H3458}, I have heard thee{H8085}{(H8804)}: Behold, I have blessed{H1288}{(H8765)} him, and will make him fruitful{H6509}{(H8689)}, and will multiply{H7235}{(H8689)} him exceedingly{H3966}{H3966}; twelve{H6240}{H8147} princes{H5387} shall he beget{H3205}{(H8686)}, and I will make him{H5414}{(H8804)} a great{H1419} nation{H1471}."
Genesis,17,21,"But my covenant{H1285} will I establish{H6965}{(H8686)} with Isaac{H3327}, which Sarah{H8283} shall bear{H3205}{(H8799)} unto thee at this set time{H4150} in the next{H312} year{H8141}."
Genesis,17,22,"And he left off{H3615}{(H8762)} talking{H1696}{(H8763)} with him, and God{H430} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} from Abraham{H85}."
Genesis,17,23,"And Abraham{H85} took{H3947}{(H8799)} Ishmael{H3458} his son{H1121}, and all that were born{H3211} in his house{H1004}, and all that were bought{H4736} with his money{H3701}, every male{H2145} among the men{H582} of Abraham's{H85} house{H1004}; and circumcised{H4135}{(H8799)} the flesh{H1320} of their foreskin{H6190} in the selfsame{H6106} day{H3117}, as God{H430} had said{H1696}{(H8765)} unto him."
Genesis,17,24,"And Abraham{H85} was ninety{H8673} years{H8141} old{H1121} and nine{H8672}, when he was circumcised{H4135}{(H8736)} in the flesh{H1320} of his foreskin{H6190}."
Genesis,17,25,"And Ishmael{H3458} his son{H1121} was thirteen{H6240}{H7969} years{H8141} old{H1121}, when he was circumcised{H4135}{(H8736)} in the flesh{H1320} of his foreskin{H6190}."
Genesis,17,26,"In the selfsame{H6106} day{H3117} was Abraham{H85} circumcised{H4135}{(H8738)}, and Ishmael{H3458} his son{H1121}."
Genesis,17,27,"And all the men{H582} of his house{H1004}, born{H3211} in the house{H1004}, and bought{H4736} with money{H3701} of the stranger{H1121}{H5236}, were circumcised{H4135}{(H8738)} with him."
Genesis,18,1,And the LORD{H3068} appeared{H7200}{(H8735)} unto him in the plains{H436} of Mamre{H4471}: and he sat{H3427}{(H8802)} in the tent{H168} door{H6607} in the heat{H2527} of the day{H3117};
Genesis,18,2,"And he lift up{H5375}{(H8799)} his eyes{H5869} and looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, lo, three{H7969} men{H582} stood{H5324}{(H8737)} by him: and when he saw{H7200}{(H8799)} them, he ran{H7323}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} them from the tent{H168} door{H6607}, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} himself toward the ground{H776},"
Genesis,18,3,"And said{H559}{(H8799)}, My Lord{H136}, if now I have found{H4672}{(H8804)} favour{H2580} in thy sight{H5869}, pass not away{H5674}{(H8799)}, I pray thee, from thy servant{H5650}:"
Genesis,18,4,"Let a little{H4592} water{H4325}, I pray you{H4994}, be fetched{H3947}{(H8714)}, and wash{H7364}{(H8798)} your feet{H7272}, and rest yourselves{H8172}{(H8734)} under the tree{H6086}:"
Genesis,18,5,"And I will fetch{H3947}{(H8799)} a morsel{H6595} of bread{H3899}, and comfort ye{H5582}{(H8798)} your hearts{H3820}; after that{H310} ye shall pass on{H5674}{(H8799)}: for therefore are ye come{H5674}{(H8804)} to{H5921} your servant{H5650}. And they said{H1696}{(H8765)}, So do{H6213}{(H8799)}, as thou hast said{H559}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,18,6,"And Abraham{H85} hastened{H4116}{(H8762)} into the tent{H168} unto Sarah{H8283}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Make ready quickly{H4116}{(H8761)} three{H7969} measures{H5429} of fine{H5560} meal{H7058}, knead{H3888}{(H8798)} it, and make{H6213} cakes{H5692} upon the hearth{H6213}{(H8798)}."
Genesis,18,7,"And Abraham{H85} ran{H7323}{(H8804)} unto the herd{H1241}, and fetcht{H3947}{(H8799)} a calf{H1121}{H1241} tender{H7390} and good{H2896}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} it unto a young man{H5288}; and he hasted{H4116}{(H8762)} to dress{H6213}{(H8800)} it."
Genesis,18,8,"And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} butter{H2529}, and milk{H2461}, and the calf{H1121}{H1241} which he had dressed{H6213}{(H8804)}, and set{H5414}{(H8799)} it before them{H6440}; and he stood{H5975}{(H8802)} by them under the tree{H6086}, and they did eat{H398}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,18,9,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Where{H346} is Sarah{H8283} thy wife{H802}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, in the tent{H168}."
Genesis,18,10,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will certainly{H7725}{(H8800)} return{H7725}{(H8799)} unto thee according to the time{H6256} of life{H2416}; and, lo, Sarah{H8283} thy wife{H802} shall have a son{H1121}. And Sarah{H8283} heard{H8085}{(H8802)} it in the tent{H168} door{H6607}, which was behind him{H310}."
Genesis,18,11,Now Abraham{H85} and Sarah{H8283} were old{H2205} and well stricken{H935}{(H8802)} in age{H3117}; and it ceased{H2308}{(H8804)} to be with Sarah{H8283} after the manner{H734} of women{H802}.
Genesis,18,12,"Therefore Sarah{H8283} laughed{H6711}{(H8799)} within herself{H7130}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, After{H310} I am waxed old{H1086}{(H8800)} shall I have pleasure{H5730}, my lord{H113} being old also{H2204}{(H8804)}?"
Genesis,18,13,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Abraham{H85}, Wherefore{H4100} did Sarah{H8283} laugh{H6711}{(H8804)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Shall I of a surety{H552} bear{H3205}{(H8799)} a child, which{H589} am old{H2204}{(H8804)}?"
Genesis,18,14,"Is{H6381} any thing{H1697} too hard{H6381}{(H8735)} for the LORD{H3068}? At the time appointed{H4150} I will return{H7725}{(H8799)} unto thee, according to the time{H6256} of life{H2416}, and Sarah{H8283} shall have a son{H1121}."
Genesis,18,15,"Then Sarah{H8283} denied{H3584}{(H8762)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I laughed{H6711}{(H8804)} not; for she was afraid{H3372}{(H8804)}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Nay{H3808}; but thou didst laugh{H6711}{(H8804)}."
Genesis,18,16,"And the men{H582} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} from thence, and looked{H8259}{(H8686)} toward{H6440} Sodom{H5467}: and Abraham{H85} went{H1980}{(H8802)} with them to bring them on the way{H7971}{(H8763)}."
Genesis,18,17,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8804)}, Shall I hide{H3680}{(H8764)} from Abraham{H85} that thing which{H834} I do{H6213}{(H8802)};"
Genesis,18,18,"Seeing that Abraham{H85} shall surely become a great{H1419} and mighty{H6099} nation{H1471}, and all the nations{H1471} of the earth{H776} shall be blessed{H1288}{(H8738)} in him?"
Genesis,18,19,"For I know{H3045}{(H8804)} him, that{H834} he will command{H6680}{(H8762)} his children{H1121} and his household{H1004} after him{H310}, and they shall keep{H8104}{(H8804)} the way{H1870} of the LORD{H3068}, to do{H6213}{(H8800)} justice{H6666} and judgment{H4941}; that the LORD{H3068} may bring{H935}{(H8687)} upon Abraham{H85} that which he hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} of him."
Genesis,18,20,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Because the cry{H2201} of Sodom{H5467} and Gomorrah{H6017} is great{H7227}, and because their sin{H2403} is very{H3966} grievous{H3513}{(H8804)};"
Genesis,18,21,"I will go down{H3381}{(H8799)} now, and see{H7200}{(H8799)} whether they have done{H6213}{(H8804)} altogether{H3617} according to the cry{H6818} of it, which is come{H935}{(H8802)} unto me; and if not, I will know{H3045}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,18,22,"And the men{H582} turned their faces{H6437}{(H8799)} from thence, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} toward Sodom{H5467}: but Abraham{H85} stood{H5975}{(H8802)} yet{H5750} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}."
Genesis,18,23,"And Abraham{H85} drew near{H5066}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Wilt thou also destroy{H5595}{(H8799)} the righteous{H6662} with{H5973} the wicked{H7563}?"
Genesis,18,24,Peradventure there be{H3426} fifty{H2572} righteous{H6662} within{H8432} the city{H5892}: wilt thou also destroy{H5595}{(H8799)} and not spare{H5375}{(H8799)} the place{H4725} for{H4616} the fifty{H2572} righteous{H6662} that are therein{H7130}?
Genesis,18,25,"That be far{H2486} from thee to do{H6213}{(H8800)} after this manner{H1697}, to slay{H4191}{(H8687)} the righteous{H6662} with the wicked{H7563}: and that the righteous{H6662} should be as the wicked{H7563}, that be far{H2486} from thee: Shall not the Judge{H8199}{(H8802)} of all the earth{H776} do{H6213}{(H8799)} right{H4941}?"
Genesis,18,26,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)}, If I find{H4672}{(H8799)} in Sodom{H5467} fifty{H2572} righteous{H6662} within{H8432} the city{H5892}, then I will spare{H5375}{(H8804)} all the place{H4725} for their sakes."
Genesis,18,27,"And Abraham{H85} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold now, I have taken upon me{H2974}{(H8689)} to speak{H1696}{(H8763)} unto the Lord{H136}, which{H595} am but dust{H6083} and ashes{H665}:"
Genesis,18,28,"Peradventure there shall lack{H2637}{(H8799)} five{H2568} of the fifty{H2572} righteous{H6662}: wilt thou destroy{H7843}{(H8686)} all the city{H5892} for lack of five{H2568}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, If I find{H4672}{(H8799)} there forty{H705} and five{H2568}, I will not destroy{H7843}{(H8686)} it."
Genesis,18,29,"And he spake{H1696}{(H8763)} unto him yet again{H3254}{(H8686)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Peradventure there shall be forty{H705} found{H4672}{(H8735)} there. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will not do{H6213}{(H8799)} it for forty's{H705} sake."
Genesis,18,30,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Oh{H4994} let not the Lord{H136} be angry{H2734}{(H8799)}, and I will speak{H1696}{(H8762)}: Peradventure there shall thirty{H7970} be found{H4672}{(H8735)} there. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will not do{H6213}{(H8799)} it, if I find{H4672}{(H8799)} thirty{H7970} there."
Genesis,18,31,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold now, I have taken upon me{H2974}{(H8689)} to speak{H1696}{(H8763)} unto the Lord{H136}: Peradventure there shall be twenty{H6242} found{H4672}{(H8735)} there.

Genesis,18,33,"And the LORD{H3068} went his way{H3212}{(H8799)}, as soon as{H834} he had left{H3615}{(H8765)} communing{H1696}{(H8763)} with Abraham{H85}: and Abraham{H85} returned{H7725}{(H8804)} unto his place{H4725}."
Genesis,19,1,And there came{H935}{(H8799)} two{H8147} angels{H4397} to Sodom{H5467} at even{H6153}; and Lot{H3876} sat{H3427}{(H8802)} in the gate{H8179} of Sodom{H5467}: and Lot{H3876} seeing{H7200}{(H8799)} them rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} them; and he bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} himself with his face{H639} toward the ground{H776};
Genesis,19,2,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold now, my lords{H113}, turn in{H5493}{(H8798)}, I pray you, into your servant's{H5650} house{H1004}, and tarry all night{H3885}{(H8798)}, and wash{H7364}{(H8798)} your feet{H7272}, and ye shall rise up early{H7925}{(H8689)}, and go{H1980}{(H8804)} on your ways{H1870}. And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Nay; but we will abide{H3885} in the street{H7339} all night{H3885}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,19,3,"And he pressed{H6484}{(H8799)} upon them greatly{H3966}; and they turned in{H5493}{(H8799)} unto him, and entered{H935}{(H8799)} into his house{H1004}; and he made{H6213}{(H8799)} them a feast{H4960}, and did bake{H644}{(H8804)} unleavened bread{H4682}, and they did eat{H398}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,19,4,"But before they lay down{H7901}{(H8799)}, the men{H582} of the city{H5892}, even the men{H582} of Sodom{H5467}, compassed{H5437} the house{H1004} round{H5437}{(H8738)}, both old{H2205} and young{H5288}, all the people{H5971} from every quarter{H7097}:"
Genesis,19,5,"And they called{H7121}{(H8799)} unto Lot{H3876}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Where are the men{H582} which came in{H935}{(H8804)} to thee this night{H3915}? bring them out{H3318}{(H8685)} unto us, that we may know{H3045}{(H8799)} them."
Genesis,19,6,"And Lot{H3876} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} at the door{H6607} unto them, and shut{H5462}{(H8804)} the door{H1817} after him{H310},"

Genesis,19,8,"Behold now, I have two{H8147} daughters{H1323} which have not known{H3045}{(H8804)} man{H376}; let me, I pray you, bring them out{H3318}{(H8686)} unto you, and do{H6213}{(H8798)} ye to them as is good{H2896} in your eyes{H5869}: only unto these{H411} men{H582} do{H6213}{(H8799)} nothing{H408}{H1697}; for therefore came{H935}{(H8804)} they under the shadow{H6738} of my roof{H6982}."
Genesis,19,9,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Stand{H5066}{(H8798)} back{H1973}. And they said{H559}{(H8799)} again, This one{H259} fellow came in{H935}{(H8804)} to sojourn{H1481}{(H8800)}, and he will needs{H8199}{(H8800)} be a judge{H8199}{(H8799)}: now will we deal worse{H7489}{(H8686)} with thee, than with them. And they pressed{H6484}{(H8799)} sore{H3966} upon the man{H376}, even Lot{H3876}, and came near{H5066}{(H8799)} to break{H7665}{(H8800)} the door{H1817}."
Genesis,19,10,"But the men{H582} put forth{H7971}{(H8799)} their hand{H3027}, and pulled{H935}{(H8686)} Lot{H3876} into the house{H1004} to them, and shut{H5462}{(H8804)} to the door{H1817}."
Genesis,19,11,"And they smote{H5221}{(H8689)} the men{H582} that were at the door{H6607} of the house{H1004} with blindness{H5575}, both small{H6996} and great{H1419}: so that they wearied{H3811}{(H8799)} themselves to find{H4672}{(H8800)} the door{H6607}."
Genesis,19,12,"And the men{H582} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Lot{H3876}, Hast thou here{H6311} any{H4310} besides? son in law{H2860}, and thy sons{H1121}, and thy daughters{H1323}, and whatsoever{H834} thou hast in the city{H5892}, bring them out{H3318}{(H8685)} of this place{H4725}:"
Genesis,19,13,"For we{H587} will destroy{H7843}{(H8688)}{H853} this place{H4725}, because the cry of them{H6818} is waxen great{H1431}{(H8804)} before{H854} the face{H6440} of the LORD{H3068}; and the LORD{H3068} hath sent{H7971}{(H8762)} us to destroy{H7843}{(H8763)} it."
Genesis,19,14,"And Lot{H3876} went out{H3318}{(H8799)}, and spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto his sons in law{H2860}, which married{H3947}{(H8802)} his daughters{H1323}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Up{H6965}{(H8798)}, get you out{H3318}{(H8798)} of this place{H4725}; for the LORD{H3068} will destroy{H7843}{(H8688)} this city{H5892}. But he seemed as one that mocked{H6711}{(H8764)} unto{H5869} his sons in law{H2860}."
Genesis,19,15,"And when{H3644} the morning{H7837} arose{H5927}{(H8804)}, then the angels{H4397} hastened{H213}{(H8686)} Lot{H3876}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, take{H3947}{(H8798)} thy wife{H802}, and thy two{H8147} daughters{H1323}, which are here{H4672}{(H8737)}; lest thou be consumed{H5595}{(H8735)} in the iniquity{H5771} of the city{H5892}."
Genesis,19,16,"And while he lingered{H4102}{(H8698)}, the men{H582} laid hold{H2388}{(H8686)} upon his hand{H3027}, and upon the hand{H3027} of his wife{H802}, and upon the hand{H3027} of his two{H8147} daughters{H1323}; the LORD{H3068} being merciful{H2551} unto him: and they brought him forth{H3318}{(H8686)}, and set him{H3240}{(H8686)} without{H2351} the city{H5892}."
Genesis,19,17,"And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth{H3318}{(H8687)} abroad{H2351}, that he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Escape{H4422}{(H8734)} for{H5921} thy life{H5315}; look{H5027}{(H8686)} not behind thee{H310}, neither stay{H5975}{(H8799)} thou in all the plain{H3603}; escape{H4422}{(H8734)} to the mountain{H2022}, lest thou be consumed{H5595}{(H8735)}."
Genesis,19,18,"And Lot{H3876} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord{H113}:"
Genesis,19,19,"Behold now, thy servant{H5650} hath found{H4672}{(H8804)} grace{H2580} in thy sight{H5869}, and thou hast magnified{H1431}{(H8686)} thy mercy{H2617}, which thou hast shewed{H6213}{(H8804)} unto me{H5978} in saving{H2421}{(H8687)} my life{H5315}; and I cannot{H3201}{(H8799)} escape{H4422}{(H8736)} to the mountain{H2022}, lest some evil{H7451} take{H1692}{(H8799)} me, and I die{H4191}{(H8804)}:"
Genesis,19,20,"Behold now, this city{H5892} is near{H7138} to flee{H5127}{(H8800)} unto, and it{H1931} is a little one{H4705}: Oh, let me escape{H4422}{(H8735)} thither,( is it not a little one{H4705}?) and my soul{H5315} shall live{H2421}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,19,21,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, See{H2009}, I have accepted{H5375}{(H8804)} thee{H6440} concerning this thing{H1697} also, that I will not overthrow{H2015}{(H8800)} this city{H5892}, for the which{H834} thou hast spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}."
Genesis,19,22,"Haste{H4116}{(H8761)} thee, escape{H4422}{(H8734)} thither; for I cannot{H3201}{(H8799)} do{H6213}{(H8800)} any thing{H1697} till thou be come{H935}{(H8800)} thither. Therefore the name{H8034} of the city{H5892} was called{H7121}{(H8804)} Zoar{H6820}."
Genesis,19,23,The sun{H8121} was risen{H3318}{(H8804)} upon the earth{H776} when Lot{H3876} entered{H935}{(H8804)} into Zoar{H6820}.
Genesis,19,24,Then the LORD{H3068} rained{H4305}{(H8689)} upon Sodom{H5467} and upon Gomorrah{H6017} brimstone{H1614} and fire{H784} from the LORD{H3068} out of heaven{H8064};
Genesis,19,25,"And he overthrew{H2015}{(H8799)} those{H411} cities{H5892}, and all the plain{H3603}, and all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the cities{H5892}, and that which grew{H6780} upon the ground{H127}."
Genesis,19,26,"But his wife{H802} looked back{H5027}{(H8686)} from behind him{H310}, and she became a pillar{H5333} of salt{H4417}."
Genesis,19,27,And Abraham{H85} gat up early{H7925}{(H8686)} in the morning{H1242} to the place{H4725} where he stood{H5975}{(H8804)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}:
Genesis,19,28,"And he looked{H8259}{(H8686)} toward{H6440} Sodom{H5467} and Gomorrah{H6017}, and toward{H6440} all the land{H776} of the plain{H3603}, and beheld{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, lo, the smoke{H7008} of the country{H776} went up{H5927}{(H8804)} as the smoke{H7008} of a furnace{H3536}."
Genesis,19,29,"And it came to pass, when God{H430} destroyed{H7843}{(H8763)} the cities{H5892} of the plain{H3603}, that God{H430} remembered{H2142}{(H8799)} Abraham{H85}, and sent{H7971}{(H8762)} Lot{H3876} out of the midst{H8432} of the overthrow{H2018}, when he overthrew{H2015}{(H8800)} the cities{H5892} in the which{H2004} Lot{H3876} dwelt{H3427}{(H8804)}."
Genesis,19,30,"And Lot{H3876} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} out of Zoar{H6820}, and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in the mountain{H2022}, and his two{H8147} daughters{H1323} with him; for he feared{H3372}{(H8804)} to dwell{H3427}{(H8800)} in Zoar{H6820}: and he dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in a cave{H4631}, he and his two{H8147} daughters{H1323}."
Genesis,19,31,"And the firstborn{H1067} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the younger{H6810}, Our father{H1} is old{H2204}{(H8804)}, and there is not a man{H376} in the earth{H776} to come in{H935}{(H8800)} unto us after the manner{H1870} of all the earth{H776}:"
Genesis,19,32,"Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, let us make{H8248} our father{H1} drink{H8248}{(H8686)} wine{H3196}, and we will lie{H7901}{(H8799)} with him, that we may preserve{H2421}{(H8762)} seed{H2233} of our father{H1}."
Genesis,19,33,"And they made{H8248} their father{H1} drink{H8248}{(H8686)} wine{H3196} that night{H3915}: and the firstborn{H1067} went in{H935}{(H8799)}, and lay{H7901}{(H8799)} with her father{H1}; and he perceived{H3045}{(H8804)} not when she lay down{H7901}{(H8800)}, nor when she arose{H6965}{(H8800)}."
Genesis,19,34,"And it came to pass on the morrow{H4283}, that the firstborn{H1067} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the younger{H6810}, Behold, I lay{H7901}{(H8804)} yesternight{H570} with my father{H1}: let us make him drink{H8248}{(H8686)} wine{H3196} this night{H3915} also; and go thou in{H935}{(H8798)}, and lie{H7901}{(H8798)} with him, that we may preserve{H2421}{(H8762)} seed{H2233} of our father{H1}."
Genesis,19,35,"And they made{H8248} their father{H1} drink{H8248}{(H8686)} wine{H3196} that{H1931} night{H3915} also: and the younger{H6810} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and lay{H7901}{(H8799)} with him; and he perceived{H3045}{(H8804)} not when she lay down{H7901}{(H8800)}, nor when she arose{H6965}{(H8800)}."
Genesis,19,36,Thus were both{H8147} the daughters{H1323} of Lot{H3876} with child{H2029}{(H8799)} by their father{H1}.
Genesis,19,37,"And the firstborn{H1067} bare{H3205}{(H8799)} a son{H1121}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} his name{H8034} Moab{H4124}: the same{H1931} is the father{H1} of the Moabites{H4124} unto this day{H3117}."
Genesis,19,38,"And the younger{H6810}, she also bare{H3205}{(H8804)} a son{H1121}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} his name{H8034} Benammi{H1151}: the same is the father{H1} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} unto this day{H3117}."
Genesis,20,1,"And Abraham{H85} journeyed{H5265}{(H8799)} from thence toward the south{H5045} country{H776}, and dwelled{H3427}{(H8799)} between Kadesh{H6946} and Shur{H7793}, and sojourned{H1481}{(H8799)} in Gerar{H1642}."
Genesis,20,2,"And Abraham{H85} said{H559}{(H8799)} of{H413} Sarah{H8283} his wife{H802}, She is my sister{H269}: and Abimelech{H40} king{H4428} of Gerar{H1642} sent{H7971}{(H8799)}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} Sarah{H8283}."
Genesis,20,3,"But God{H430} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Abimelech{H40} in a dream{H2472} by night{H3915}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man{H4191}{(H8801)}, for the woman{H802} which thou hast taken{H3947}{(H8804)}; for she is a man's{H1167} wife{H1166}{(H8803)}."
Genesis,20,4,"But Abimelech{H40} had not come near{H7126}{(H8804)} her: and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Lord{H136}, wilt thou slay{H2026}{(H8799)} also a righteous{H6662} nation{H1471}?"
Genesis,20,5,"Said{H559}{(H8804)} he not unto me, She{H1931} is my sister{H269}? and she{H1931}, even{H1571} she{H1931} herself said{H559}{(H8804)}, He is my brother{H251}: in the integrity{H8537} of my heart{H3824} and innocency{H5356} of my hands{H3709} have I done{H6213}{(H8804)} this."
Genesis,20,6,"And God{H430} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him in a dream{H2472}, Yea{H1571}, I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that thou didst{H6213}{(H8804)} this in the integrity{H8537} of thy heart{H3824}; for I also withheld{H2820}{(H8799)} thee from sinning{H2398}{(H8800)} against me: therefore suffered{H5414}{(H8804)} I thee not to touch{H5060}{(H8800)} her."
Genesis,20,7,"Now therefore restore{H7725}{(H8685)} the man{H376} his wife{H802}; for he is a prophet{H5030}, and he shall pray{H6419}{(H8691)} for thee{H1157}, and thou shalt live{H2421}{(H8798)}: and if thou restore{H7725}{(H8688)} her not, know{H3045}{(H8798)} thou that thou shalt surely{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}, thou, and all that are thine."
Genesis,20,8,"Therefore Abimelech{H40} rose early{H7925}{(H8686)} in the morning{H1242}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} all his servants{H5650}, and told{H1696}{(H8762)} all these things{H1697} in their ears{H241}: and the men{H582} were sore{H3966} afraid{H3372}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,20,9,"Then Abimelech{H40} called{H7121}{(H8799)} Abraham{H85}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, What hast thou done{H6213}{(H8804)} unto us? and what have I offended{H2398}{(H8804)} thee, that thou hast brought{H935}{(H8689)} on me and on my kingdom{H4467} a great{H1419} sin{H2401}? thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)} deeds{H4639} unto me that ought not to be done{H6213}{(H8735)}."
Genesis,20,10,"And Abimelech{H40} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Abraham{H85}, What{H4100} sawest thou{H7200}{(H8804)}, that thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)} this thing{H1697}?"
Genesis,20,11,"And Abraham{H85} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Because I thought{H559}{(H8804)}, Surely{H7535} the fear{H3374} of God{H430} is not in this place{H4725}; and they will slay me{H2026}{(H8804)} for my wife's{H802} sake{H1697}."
Genesis,20,12,"And yet indeed{H546} she is my sister{H269}; she is the daughter{H1323} of my father{H1}, but not the daughter{H1323} of my mother{H517}; and she became my wife{H802}."
Genesis,20,13,"And it came to pass, when God{H430} caused me to wander{H8582}{(H8689)} from my father's{H1} house{H1004}, that I said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, This is thy kindness{H2617} which thou shalt shew{H6213}{(H8799)} unto me; at every place{H4725} whither we shall come{H935}{(H8799)}, say{H559}{(H8798)} of me, He is my brother{H251}."
Genesis,20,14,"And Abimelech{H40} took{H3947}{(H8799)} sheep{H6629}, and oxen{H1241}, and menservants{H5650}, and womenservants{H8198}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} them unto Abraham{H85}, and restored{H7725}{(H8686)} him Sarah{H8283} his wife{H802}."
Genesis,20,15,"And Abimelech{H40} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, my land{H776} is before thee{H6440}: dwell{H3427}{(H8798)} where it pleaseth{H2896}{H5869} thee."
Genesis,20,16,"And unto Sarah{H8283} he said{H559}{(H8804)}, Behold, I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} thy brother{H251} a thousand{H505} pieces of silver{H3701}: behold, he is to thee a covering{H3682} of the eyes{H5869}, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved{H3198}{(H8737)}."
Genesis,20,17,"So Abraham{H85} prayed{H6419}{(H8691)} unto God{H430}: and God{H430} healed{H7495}{(H8799)} Abimelech{H40}, and his wife{H802}, and his maidservants{H519}; and they bare{H3205}{(H8799)} children."
Genesis,20,18,"For the LORD{H3068} had fast{H6113}{(H8800)} closed up{H6113}{(H8804)} all the wombs{H7358} of the house{H1004} of Abimelech{H40}, because{H1697} of Sarah{H8283} Abraham's{H85} wife{H802}."
Genesis,21,1,"And the LORD{H3068} visited{H6485}{(H8804)} Sarah{H8283} as he had said{H559}{(H8804)}, and the LORD{H3068} did{H6213}{(H8799)} unto Sarah{H8283} as he had spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}."
Genesis,21,2,"For Sarah{H8283} conceived{H2029}{(H8799)}, and bare{H3205}{(H8799)} Abraham{H85} a son{H1121} in his old age{H2208}, at the set time{H4150} of which God{H430} had spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} to him."
Genesis,21,3,"And Abraham{H85} called{H7121}{(H8799)} the name{H8034} of his son{H1121} that was born{H3205}{(H8737)} unto him, whom Sarah{H8283} bare{H3205}{(H8804)} to him, Isaac{H3327}."
Genesis,21,4,"And Abraham{H85} circumcised{H4135}{(H8799)} his son{H1121} Isaac{H3327} being eight{H8083} days{H3117} old{H1121}, as God{H430} had commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} him."
Genesis,21,5,"And Abraham{H85} was an hundred{H3967} years{H8141} old{H1121}, when his son{H1121} Isaac{H3327} was born{H3205}{(H8736)} unto him."
Genesis,21,6,"And Sarah{H8283} said{H559}{(H8799)}, God{H430} hath made{H6213}{(H8804)} me to laugh{H6712}, so that all that hear{H8085}{(H8802)} will laugh{H6711}{(H8799)} with me."
Genesis,21,7,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who would have said{H4448}{(H8765)} unto Abraham{H85}, that Sarah{H8283} should have given children{H1121} suck{H3243}{(H8689)}? for I have born{H3205}{(H8804)} him a son{H1121} in his old age{H2208}."
Genesis,21,8,"And the child{H3206} grew{H1431}{(H8799)}, and was weaned{H1580}{(H8735)}: and Abraham{H85} made{H6213}{(H8799)} a great{H1419} feast{H4960} the same day{H3117} that Isaac{H3327} was weaned{H1580}{(H8736)}."
Genesis,21,9,"And Sarah{H8283} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the son{H1121} of Hagar{H1904} the Egyptian{H4713}, which she had born{H3205}{(H8804)} unto Abraham{H85}, mocking{H6711}{(H8764)}."
Genesis,21,10,"Wherefore she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Abraham{H85}, Cast out{H1644}{(H8761)} this bondwoman{H519} and her son{H1121}: for the son{H1121} of this bondwoman{H519} shall not be heir{H3423}{(H8799)} with my son{H1121}, even with Isaac{H3327}."
Genesis,21,11,And the thing{H1697} was very{H3966} grievous{H3415}{(H8799)} in Abraham's{H85} sight{H5869} because{H182} of his son{H1121}.
Genesis,21,12,"And God{H430} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Abraham{H85}, Let it not be grievous{H3415}{(H8799)} in thy sight{H5869} because of the lad{H5288}, and because of thy bondwoman{H519}; in all that Sarah{H8283} hath said{H559}{(H8799)} unto thee, hearken{H8085}{(H8798)} unto her voice{H6963}; for in Isaac{H3327} shall thy seed{H2233} be called{H7121}{(H8735)}."
Genesis,21,13,"And also of the son{H1121} of the bondwoman{H519} will I make{H7760}{(H8799)} a nation{H1471}, because he is thy seed{H2233}."
Genesis,21,14,"And Abraham{H85} rose up early{H7925}{(H8686)} in the morning{H1242}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} bread{H3899}, and a bottle{H2573} of water{H4325}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} it unto Hagar{H1904}, putting{H7760}{(H8804)} it on her shoulder{H7926}, and the child{H3206}, and sent her away{H7971}{(H8762)}: and she departed{H3212}{(H8799)}, and wandered{H8582}{(H8799)} in the wilderness{H4057} of Beersheba{H884}."
Genesis,21,15,"And the water{H4325} was spent{H3615}{(H8799)} in{H4480} the bottle{H2573}, and she cast{H7993}{(H8686)} the child{H3206} under one{H259} of the shrubs{H7880}."

Genesis,30,14,"And Reuben{H7205} went in{H3212}{(H8799)} the days{H3117} of wheat{H2406} harvest{H7105}, and found{H4672}{(H8799)} mandrakes{H1736} in the field{H7704}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} them unto his mother{H517} Leah{H3812}. Then Rachel{H7354} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Leah{H3812}, Give me{H5414}{(H8798)}, I pray thee, of thy son's{H1121} mandrakes{H1736}."
Genesis,30,15,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Is it a small matter{H4592} that thou hast taken{H3947}{(H8800)} my husband{H376}? and wouldest thou take away{H3947}{(H8800)} my son's{H1121} mandrakes{H1736} also? And Rachel{H7354} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Therefore he shall lie{H7901}{(H8799)} with thee to night{H3915} for{H8478} thy son's{H1121} mandrakes{H1736}."
Genesis,30,16,"And Jacob{H3290} came{H935}{(H8799)} out of the field{H7704} in the evening{H6153}, and Leah{H3812} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou must come in{H935}{(H8799)} unto me; for surely{H7936}{(H8800)} I have hired{H7936}{(H8804)} thee with my son's{H1121} mandrakes{H1736}. And he lay{H7901}{(H8799)} with her that night{H3915}."
Genesis,30,17,"And God{H430} hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} unto Leah{H3812}, and she conceived{H2029}{(H8799)}, and bare{H3205}{(H8799)} Jacob{H3290} the fifth{H2549} son{H1121}."
Genesis,30,18,"And Leah{H3812} said{H559}{(H8799)}, God{H430} hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} me my hire{H7939}, because{H834} I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} my maiden{H8198} to my husband{H376}: and she called{H7121}{(H8799)} his name{H8034} Issachar{H3485}."
Genesis,30,19,"And Leah{H3812} conceived{H2029}{(H8799)} again, and bare{H3205}{(H8799)} Jacob{H3290} the sixth{H8345} son{H1121}."
Genesis,30,20,"And Leah{H3812} said{H559}{(H8799)}, God{H430} hath endued{H2064}{(H8804)} me with a good{H2896} dowry{H2065}; now{H6471} will my husband{H376} dwell{H2082}{(H8799)} with me, because I have born{H3205}{(H8804)} him six{H8337} sons{H1121}: and she called{H7121}{(H8799)} his name{H8034} Zebulun{H2074}."
Genesis,30,21,"And afterwards{H310} she bare{H3205}{(H8804)} a daughter{H1323}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} her name{H8034} Dinah{H1783}."
Genesis,30,22,"And God{H430} remembered{H2142}{(H8799)} Rachel{H7354}, and God{H430} hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} to her, and opened{H6605}{(H8799)} her womb{H7358}."
Genesis,30,23,"And she conceived{H2029}{(H8799)}, and bare{H3205}{(H8799)} a son{H1121}; and said{H559}{(H8799)}, God{H430} hath taken away{H622}{(H8804)} my reproach{H2781}:"
Genesis,30,24,"And she called{H7121}{(H8799)} his name{H8034} Joseph{H3130}; and said{H559}{(H8800)}, The LORD{H3068} shall add{H3254}{(H8686)} to me another{H312} son{H1121}."
Genesis,30,25,"And it came to pass, when Rachel{H7354} had born{H3205}{(H8804)} Joseph{H3130}, that Jacob{H3290} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Laban{H3837}, Send me away{H7971}{(H8761)}, that I may go{H3212}{(H8799)} unto mine own place{H4725}, and to my country{H776}."
Genesis,30,26,"Give{H5414}{(H8798)} me my wives{H802} and my children{H3206}, for{H2004} whom I have served{H5647}{(H8804)} thee, and let me go{H3212}{(H8799)}: for thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} my service{H5656} which I have done{H5647}{(H8804)} thee."
Genesis,30,27,"And Laban{H3837} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, I pray thee, if I have found{H4672}{(H8804)} favour{H2580} in thine eyes{H5869}, tarry: for I have learned by experience{H5172}{(H8765)} that the LORD{H3068} hath blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} me for thy sake{H1558}."
Genesis,30,28,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Appoint{H5344}{(H8798)} me thy wages{H7939}, and I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} it."
Genesis,30,29,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} how{H834} I have served{H5647}{(H8804)} thee, and how{H834} thy cattle{H4735} was with me."
Genesis,30,30,"For it was little{H4592} which thou hadst before I{H6440} came, and it is now increased{H6555}{(H8799)} unto a multitude{H7230}; and the LORD{H3068} hath blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} thee since my coming{H7272}: and now when{H4970} shall I provide{H6213}{(H8799)} for mine own house{H1004} also?"
Genesis,30,31,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, What shall I give thee{H5414}{(H8799)}? And Jacob{H3290} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou shalt not give{H5414}{(H8799)} me any thing{H3972}: if thou wilt do{H6213}{(H8799)} this thing{H1697} for me, I will again{H7725}{(H8799)} feed{H7462}{(H8799)} and keep{H8104}{(H8799)} thy flock{H6629}:"
Genesis,30,32,"I will pass{H5674}{(H8799)} through all thy flock{H6629} to day{H3117}, removing{H5493}{(H8687)} from thence all the speckled{H5348} and spotted{H2921}{(H8803)} cattle{H7716}, and all the brown{H2345} cattle{H7716} among the sheep{H3775}, and the spotted{H2921}{(H8803)} and speckled{H5348} among the goats{H5795}: and of such shall be my hire{H7939}."
Genesis,30,33,"So shall my righteousness{H6666} answer{H6030}{(H8804)} for me in time{H3117} to come{H4279}, when it shall come{H935}{(H8799)} for my hire{H7939} before thy face{H6440}: every one{H3605} that is not speckled{H5348} and spotted{H2921}{(H8803)} among the goats{H5795}, and brown{H2345} among the sheep{H3775}, that shall be counted stolen{H1589}{(H8803)} with me."
Genesis,30,34,"And Laban{H3837} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, I would it might be{H3863} according to thy word{H1697}."
Genesis,30,35,"And he removed{H5493}{(H8686)} that day{H3117} the he goats{H8495} that were ringstraked{H6124} and spotted{H2921}{(H8803)}, and all the she goats{H5795} that were speckled{H5348} and spotted{H2921}{(H8803)}, and every one that had some white{H3836} in it, and all the brown{H2345} among the sheep{H3775}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} them into the hand{H3027} of his sons{H1121}."
Genesis,30,36,And he set{H7760}{(H8799)} three{H7969} days{H3117}' journey{H1870} betwixt himself and Jacob{H3290}: and Jacob{H3290} fed{H7462}{(H8802)} the rest{H3498}{(H8737)} of Laban's{H3837} flocks{H6629}.
Genesis,30,37,"And Jacob{H3290} took{H3947}{(H8799)} him rods{H4731} of green{H3892} poplar{H3839}, and of the hazel{H3869} and chesnut tree{H6196}; and pilled{H6478}{(H8762)} white{H3836} strakes{H6479} in them, and made the white{H3836} appear{H4286} which was in the rods{H4731}."
Genesis,30,38,"And he set{H3322}{(H8686)} the rods{H4731} which he had pilled{H6478}{(H8765)} before{H5227} the flocks{H6629} in the gutters{H7298} in the watering{H4325} troughs{H8268} when the flocks{H6629} came{H935}{(H8799)} to drink{H8354}{(H8800)}, that they should conceive{H3179}{(H8799)} when they came{H935}{(H8800)} to drink{H8354}{(H8800)}."
Genesis,30,39,"And the flocks{H6629} conceived{H3179}{(H8799)} before the rods{H4731}, and brought forth{H3205}{(H8799)} cattle{H6629} ringstraked{H6124}, speckled{H5348}, and spotted{H2921}{(H8803)}."
Genesis,30,40,"And Jacob{H3290} did separate{H6504}{(H8689)} the lambs{H3775}, and set{H5414}{(H8799)} the faces{H6440} of the flocks{H6629} toward{H413} the ringstraked{H6124}, and all the brown{H2345} in the flock{H6629} of Laban{H3837}; and he put{H7896}{(H8799)} his own flocks{H5739} by themselves, and put{H7896}{(H8804)} them not unto Laban's{H3837} cattle{H6629}."
Genesis,30,41,"And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger{H7194}{(H8794)} cattle{H6629} did conceive{H3179}{(H8763)}, that Jacob{H3290} laid{H7760}{(H8804)} the rods{H4731} before the eyes{H5869} of the cattle{H6629} in the gutters{H7298}, that they might conceive{H3179}{(H8763)} among the rods{H4731}."
Genesis,30,42,"But when the cattle{H6629} were feeble{H5848}{(H8687)}, he put them not in{H7760}{(H8799)}: so the feebler{H5848}{(H8803)} were Laban's{H3837}, and the stronger{H7194}{(H8803)} Jacob's{H3290}."
Genesis,30,43,"And the man{H376} increased{H6555}{(H8799)} exceedingly{H3966}{H3966}, and had much{H7227} cattle{H6629}, and maidservants{H8198}, and menservants{H5650}, and camels{H1581}, and asses{H2543}."
Genesis,31,1,"And he heard{H8085}{(H8799)} the words{H1697} of Laban's{H3837} sons{H1121}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Jacob{H3290} hath taken away{H3947}{(H8804)} all that was our father's{H1}; and of that which was our father's{H1} hath he gotten{H6213}{(H8804)} all this glory{H3519}."
Genesis,31,2,"And Jacob{H3290} beheld{H7200}{(H8799)} the countenance{H6440} of Laban{H3837}, and, behold, it was not toward him as{H8543} before{H8032}."
Genesis,31,3,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jacob{H3290}, Return{H7725}{(H8798)} unto the land{H776} of thy fathers{H1}, and to thy kindred{H4138}; and I will be with thee."
Genesis,31,4,"And Jacob{H3290} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and called{H7121}{(H8799)} Rachel{H7354} and Leah{H3812} to the field{H7704} unto his flock{H6629},"
Genesis,31,5,"And said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, I see{H7200}{(H8802)} your father's{H1} countenance{H6440}, that it is not toward me as{H8543} before{H8032}; but the God{H430} of my father{H1} hath been{H1961}{(H8804)} with me."
Genesis,31,6,And ye{H859} know{H3045}{(H8804)} that with all my power{H3581} I have served{H5647}{(H8804)} your father{H1}.
Genesis,31,7,"And your father{H1} hath deceived{H2048}{(H8765)} me, and changed{H2498}{(H8689)} my wages{H4909} ten{H6235} times{H4489}; but God{H430} suffered him{H5414}{(H8804)} not to hurt{H7489}{(H8687)} me{H5978}."
Genesis,31,8,"If he said{H559}{(H8799)} thus, The speckled{H5348} shall be thy wages{H7939}; then all the cattle{H6629} bare{H3205}{(H8804)} speckled{H5348}: and if he said{H559}{(H8799)} thus, The ringstraked{H6124} shall be thy hire{H7939}; then bare{H3205}{(H8804)} all the cattle{H6629} ringstraked{H6124}."
Genesis,31,9,"Thus God{H430} hath taken away{H5337}{(H8686)} the cattle{H4735} of your father{H1}, and given{H5414}{(H8799)} them to me."
Genesis,31,10,"And it came to pass at the time{H6256} that the cattle{H6629} conceived{H3179}{(H8763)}, that I lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} mine eyes{H5869}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} in a dream{H2472}, and, behold, the rams{H6260} which leaped{H5927}{(H8802)} upon the cattle{H6629} were ringstraked{H6124}, speckled{H5348}, and grisled{H1261}."
Genesis,31,11,"And the angel{H4397} of God{H430} spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto me in a dream{H2472}, saying, Jacob{H3290}: And I said{H559}{(H8799)}, Here am I."
Genesis,31,12,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Lift up{H5375}{(H8798)} now thine eyes{H5869}, and see{H7200}{(H8798)}, all the rams{H6260} which leap{H5927}{(H8802)} upon the cattle{H6629} are ringstraked{H6124}, speckled{H5348}, and grisled{H1261}: for I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} all that Laban{H3837} doeth{H6213}{(H8802)} unto thee."
Genesis,31,13,"I am the God{H410} of Bethel{H1008}, where thou anointedst{H4886}{(H8804)} the pillar{H4676}, and where thou vowedst{H5087}{(H8804)} a vow{H5088} unto me: now arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, get thee out{H3318}{(H8798)} from this land{H776}, and return{H7725}{(H8798)} unto the land{H776} of thy kindred{H4138}."
Genesis,31,14,"And Rachel{H7354} and Leah{H3812} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Is there yet any portion{H2506} or inheritance{H5159} for us in our father's{H1} house{H1004}?"
Genesis,31,15,"Are we not counted{H2803}{(H8738)} of him strangers{H5237}? for he hath sold{H4376}{(H8804)} us, and hath quite{H398}{(H8800)} devoured{H398}{(H8799)} also our money{H3701}."
Genesis,31,16,"For all the riches{H6239} which God{H430} hath taken{H5337}{(H8689)} from our father{H1}, that is ours, and our children's{H1121}: now then, whatsoever God{H430} hath said{H559}{(H8804)} unto thee, do{H6213}{(H8798)}."
Genesis,31,17,"Then Jacob{H3290} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)}, and set{H5375}{(H8799)} his sons{H1121} and his wives{H802} upon camels{H1581};"
Genesis,31,18,"And he carried away{H5090}{(H8799)} all his cattle{H4735}, and all his goods{H7399} which he had gotten{H7408}{(H8804)}, the cattle{H4735} of his getting{H7075}, which he had gotten{H7408}{(H8804)} in Padanaram{H6307}, for to go{H935}{(H8800)} to Isaac{H3327} his father{H1} in the land{H776} of Canaan{H3667}."
Genesis,31,19,And Laban{H3837} went{H1980}{(H8804)} to shear{H1494}{(H8800)} his sheep{H6629}: and Rachel{H7354} had stolen{H1589}{(H8799)} the images{H8655} that were her father's{H1}.
Genesis,31,20,"And Jacob{H3290} stole away{H1589}{(H8799)} unawares{H3820} to Laban{H3837} the Syrian{H761}, in that{H5921} he told{H5046}{(H8689)} him not{H1097} that he fled{H1272}{(H8802)}."
Genesis,31,21,"So he fled{H1272}{(H8799)} with all that he had; and he rose up{H6965}{(H8799)}, and passed over{H5674}{(H8799)} the river{H5104}, and set{H7760}{(H8799)} his face{H6440} toward the mount{H2022} Gilead{H1568}."
Genesis,31,22,And it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} Laban{H3837} on the third{H7992} day{H3117} that Jacob{H3290} was fled{H1272}{(H8804)}.
Genesis,31,23,"And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} his brethren{H251} with him, and pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} after him{H310} seven{H7651} days{H3117}' journey{H1870}; and they overtook{H1692}{(H8686)} him in the mount{H2022} Gilead{H1568}."
Genesis,31,24,"And God{H430} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Laban{H3837} the Syrian{H761} in a dream{H2472} by night{H3915}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Take heed{H8104}{(H8734)} that thou speak{H1696}{(H8762)} not to{H5973} Jacob{H3290} either good{H2896} or{H5704} bad{H7451}."
Genesis,31,25,Then Laban{H3837} overtook{H5381}{(H8686)} Jacob{H3290}. Now Jacob{H3290} had pitched{H8628}{(H8804)} his tent{H168} in the mount{H2022}: and Laban{H3837} with his brethren{H251} pitched{H8628}{(H8804)} in the mount{H2022} of Gilead{H1568}.
Genesis,31,26,"And Laban{H3837} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Jacob{H3290}, What hast thou done{H6213}{(H8804)}, that thou hast stolen away{H1589}{(H8799)} unawares{H3824} to me, and carried away{H5090}{(H8762)} my daughters{H1323}, as captives{H7617}{(H8803)} taken with the sword{H2719}?"
Genesis,31,27,"Wherefore didst thou flee away{H1272}{(H8800)} secretly{H2244}{(H8738)}, and steal away{H1589}{(H8799)} from me; and didst not tell{H5046}{(H8689)} me, that I might have sent thee away{H7971}{(H8762)} with mirth{H8057}, and with songs{H7892}, with tabret{H8596}, and with harp{H3658}?"
Genesis,31,28,And hast not suffered{H5203}{(H8804)} me to kiss{H5401}{(H8763)} my sons{H1121} and my daughters{H1323}? thou hast now done foolishly{H5528}{(H8689)} in so doing{H6213}{(H8800)}.
Genesis,31,29,"It is{H3426} in the power{H410} of my hand{H3027} to do{H6213}{(H8800)} you hurt{H7451}: but the God{H430} of your father{H1} spake{H559}{(H8804)} unto me yesternight{H570}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Take thou heed{H8104}{(H8734)} that thou speak not{H1696}{(H8763)} to Jacob{H3290} either good{H2896} or bad{H7451}."
Genesis,31,30,"And now, though thou wouldest needs{H1980}{(H8800)} be gone{H1980}{(H8804)}, because thou sore{H3700}{(H8736)} longedst{H3700}{(H8738)} after thy father's{H1} house{H1004}, yet wherefore hast thou stolen{H1589}{(H8804)} my gods{H430}?"
Genesis,31,31,"And Jacob{H3290} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} to Laban{H3837}, Because I was afraid{H3372}{(H8804)}: for I said{H559}{(H8804)}, Peradventure{H6435} thou wouldest take by force{H1497}{(H8799)} thy daughters{H1323} from me."
Genesis,31,32,"With whomsoever{H834} thou findest{H4672}{(H8799)} thy gods{H430}, let him not live{H2421}{(H8799)}: before{H5048} our brethren{H251} discern{H5234}{(H8685)} thou what is thine with me, and take{H3947}{(H8798)} it to thee. For Jacob{H3290} knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not that Rachel{H7354} had stolen{H1589}{(H8804)} them."
Genesis,31,33,"And Laban{H3837} went{H935}{(H8799)} into Jacob's{H3290} tent{H168}, and into Leah's{H3812} tent{H168}, and into the two{H8147} maidservants{H519}' tents{H168}; but he found{H4672}{(H8804)} them not. Then went he out{H3318}{(H8799)} of Leah's{H3812} tent{H168}, and entered{H935}{(H8799)} into Rachel's{H7354} tent{H168}."
Genesis,31,34,"Now Rachel{H7354} had taken{H3947}{(H8804)} the images{H8655}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} them in the camel's{H1581} furniture{H3733}, and sat{H3427}{(H8799)} upon them. And Laban{H3837} searched{H4959}{(H8762)} all the tent{H168}, but found{H4672}{(H8804)} them not."
Genesis,31,35,"And she said{H559}{(H8799)} to her father{H1}, Let it not displease{H2734}{(H8799)}{H5869} my lord{H113} that I cannot{H3201}{(H8799)} rise up{H6965}{(H8800)} before thee{H6440}; for the custom{H1870} of women{H802} is upon me. And he searched{H2664}{(H8762)}, but found{H4672}{(H8804)} not the images{H8655}."
Genesis,31,36,"And Jacob{H3290} was wroth{H2734}{(H8799)}, and chode{H7378}{(H8799)} with Laban{H3837}: and Jacob{H3290} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} to Laban{H3837}, What is my trespass{H6588}? what is my sin{H2403}, that thou hast so hotly pursued{H1814}{(H8804)} after me{H310}?"
Genesis,31,37,"Whereas{H3588} thou hast searched{H4959}{(H8765)} all my stuff{H3627}, what hast thou found{H4672}{(H8804)} of all thy household{H1004} stuff{H3627}? set{H7760}{(H8798)} it here{H3541} before my brethren{H251} and thy brethren{H251}, that they may judge{H3198}{(H8686)} betwixt{H996} us both{H8147}."
Genesis,31,38,"This twenty{H6242} years{H8141} have I been with thee; thy ewes{H7353} and thy she goats{H5795} have not cast their young{H7921}{(H8765)}, and the rams{H352} of thy flock{H6629} have I not eaten{H398}{(H8804)}."
Genesis,31,39,"That which was torn{H2966} of beasts I brought{H935}{(H8689)} not unto thee; I bare the loss{H2398}{(H8762)} of it; of my hand{H3027} didst thou require{H1245}{(H8762)} it, whether stolen{H1589}{(H8803)} by day{H3117}, or stolen{H1589}{(H8803)} by night{H3915}."
Genesis,31,40,"Thus I was; in the day{H3117} the drought{H2721} consumed{H398}{(H8804)} me, and the frost{H7140} by night{H3915}; and my sleep{H8142} departed{H5074}{(H8799)} from mine eyes{H5869}."
Genesis,31,41,"Thus have I been twenty{H6242} years{H8141} in thy house{H1004}; I served thee{H5647}{(H8804)} fourteen{H702}{H6240} years{H8141} for thy two{H8147} daughters{H1323}, and six{H8337} years{H8141} for thy cattle{H6629}: and thou hast changed{H2498}{(H8686)} my wages{H4909} ten{H6235} times{H4489}."
Genesis,31,42,"Except{H3884} the God{H430} of my father{H1}, the God{H430} of Abraham{H85}, and the fear{H6343} of Isaac{H3327}, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away{H7971}{(H8765)} now empty{H7387}. God{H430} hath seen{H7200}{(H8804)} mine affliction{H6040} and the labour{H3018} of my hands{H3709}, and rebuked{H3198}{(H8686)} thee yesternight{H570}."
Genesis,31,43,"And Laban{H3837} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jacob{H3290}, These daughters{H1323} are my daughters{H1323}, and these children{H1121} are my children{H1121}, and these cattle{H6629} are my cattle{H6629}, and all that thou seest{H7200}{(H8802)} is mine: and what can I do{H6213}{(H8799)} this day{H3117} unto these my daughters{H1323}, or{H176} unto their children{H1121} which they have born{H3205}{(H8804)}?"
Genesis,31,44,"Now therefore come thou{H3212}{(H8798)}, let us make{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285}, I and thou; and let it be for a witness{H5707} between me and thee."
Genesis,31,45,"And Jacob{H3290} took{H3947}{(H8799)} a stone{H68}, and set it up{H7311}{(H8686)} for a pillar{H4676}."
Genesis,31,46,"And Jacob{H3290} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his brethren{H251}, Gather{H3950}{(H8798)} stones{H68}; and they took{H3947}{(H8799)} stones{H68}, and made{H6213}{(H8799)} an heap{H1530}: and they did eat{H398}{(H8799)} there upon the heap{H1530}."
Genesis,31,47,And Laban{H3837} called{H7121}{(H8799)} it Jegarsahadutha{H3026}: but Jacob{H3290} called{H7121}{(H8804)} it Galeed{H1567}.
Genesis,31,48,"And Laban{H3837} said{H559}{(H8799)}, This heap{H1530} is a witness{H5707} between me and thee this day{H3117}. Therefore was the name{H8034} of it called{H7121}{(H8804)} Galeed{H1567};"
Genesis,31,49,"And Mizpah{H4709}; for{H834} he said{H559}{(H8804)}, The LORD{H3068} watch{H6822}{(H8799)} between me and thee, when we are absent{H5641}{(H8735)} one{H376} from another{H7453}."
Genesis,31,50,"If thou shalt afflict{H6031}{(H8762)} my daughters{H1323}, or if thou shalt take{H3947}{(H8799)} other wives{H802} beside{H5921} my daughters{H1323}, no man{H376} is with us; see{H7200}{(H8798)}, God{H430} is witness{H5707} betwixt me and thee."
Genesis,31,51,"And Laban{H3837} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Jacob{H3290}, Behold this heap{H1530}, and behold this pillar{H4676}, which I have cast{H3384}{(H8804)} betwixt me and thee;"
Genesis,31,52,"This heap{H1530} be witness{H5707}, and this pillar{H4676} be witness{H5713}, that I will not pass over{H5674}{(H8799)} this heap{H1530} to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over{H5674}{(H8799)} this heap{H1530} and this pillar{H4676} unto me, for harm{H7451}."
Genesis,31,53,"The God{H430} of Abraham{H85}, and the God{H430} of Nahor{H5152}, the God{H430} of their father{H1}, judge{H8199}{(H8799)} betwixt us. And Jacob{H3290} sware{H7650}{(H8735)} by the fear{H6343} of his father{H1} Isaac{H3327}."
Genesis,31,54,"Then Jacob{H3290} offered{H2076}{(H8799)} sacrifice{H2077} upon the mount{H2022}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} his brethren{H251} to eat{H398}{(H8800)} bread{H3899}: and they did eat{H398}{(H8799)} bread{H3899}, and tarried all night{H3885}{(H8799)} in the mount{H2022}."
Genesis,31,55,"And early{H7925} in the morning{H1242} Laban{H3837} rose up{H7925}{(H8686)}, and kissed{H5401}{(H8762)} his sons{H1121} and his daughters{H1323}, and blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} them: and Laban{H3837} departed{H3212}{(H8799)}, and returned{H7725}{(H8799)} unto his place{H4725}."
Genesis,32,1,"And Jacob{H3290} went{H1980}{(H8804)} on his way{H1870}, and the angels{H4397} of God{H430} met{H6293}{(H8799)} him."
Genesis,32,2,"And when Jacob{H3290} saw them{H7200}{(H8804)}, he said{H559}{(H8799)}, This is God's{H430} host{H4264}: and he called{H7121}{(H8799)} the name{H8034} of that place{H4725} Mahanaim{H4266}."
Genesis,32,3,"And Jacob{H3290} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} before him{H6440} to Esau{H6215} his brother{H251} unto the land{H776} of Seir{H8165}, the country{H7704} of Edom{H123}."
Genesis,32,4,"And he commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus shall ye speak{H559}{(H8799)} unto my lord{H113} Esau{H6215}; Thy servant{H5650} Jacob{H3290} saith{H559}{(H8804)} thus, I have sojourned{H1481}{(H8804)} with Laban{H3837}, and stayed there{H309}{(H8799)} until now:"
Genesis,32,5,"And I have oxen{H7794}, and asses{H2543}, flocks{H6629}, and menservants{H5650}, and womenservants{H8198}: and I have sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to tell{H5046}{(H8687)} my lord{H113}, that I may find{H4672}{(H8800)} grace{H2580} in thy sight{H5869}."
Genesis,32,6,"And the messengers{H4397} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to Jacob{H3290}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, We came{H935}{(H8804)} to thy brother{H251} Esau{H6215}, and also he cometh{H1980}{(H8802)} to meet thee{H7125}{(H8800)}, and four hundred{H3967} men{H376} with him."
Genesis,32,7,"Then Jacob{H3290} was greatly{H3966} afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} and distressed{H3334}{(H8799)}: and he divided{H2673}{(H8799)} the people{H5971} that was with him, and the flocks{H6629}, and herds{H1241}, and the camels{H1581}, into two{H8147} bands{H4264};"
Genesis,32,8,"And said{H559}{(H8799)}, If Esau{H6215} come{H935}{(H8799)} to the one{H259} company{H4264}, and smite it{H5221}{(H8689)}, then the other company{H4264} which is left{H7604}{(H8737)} shall escape{H6413}."
Genesis,32,9,"And Jacob{H3290} said{H559}{(H8799)}, O God{H430} of my father{H1} Abraham{H85}, and God{H430} of my father{H1} Isaac{H3327}, the LORD{H3068} which saidst{H559}{(H8802)} unto me, Return{H7725}{(H8798)} unto thy country{H776}, and to thy kindred{H4138}, and I will deal well{H3190}{(H8686)} with thee:"
Genesis,32,10,"I am not worthy of the least{H6994}{(H8804)} of all the mercies{H2617}, and of all the truth{H571}, which thou hast shewed{H6213}{(H8804)} unto thy servant{H5650}; for with my staff{H4731} I passed over{H5674}{(H8804)} this Jordan{H3383}; and now I am become two{H8147} bands{H4264}."
Genesis,32,11,"Deliver me{H5337}{(H8685)}, I pray thee, from the hand{H3027} of my brother{H251}, from the hand{H3027} of Esau{H6215}: for I fear{H3373} him, lest he will come{H935}{(H8799)} and smite me{H5221}{(H8689)}, and the mother{H517} with{H5921} the children{H1121}."
Genesis,32,12,"And thou saidst{H559}{(H8804)}, I will surely{H3190}{(H8687)} do thee good{H3190}{(H8686)}, and make{H7760}{(H8804)} thy seed{H2233} as the sand{H2344} of the sea{H3220}, which cannot be numbered{H5608}{(H8735)} for multitude{H7230}."
Genesis,32,13,And he lodged{H3885}{(H8799)} there that same night{H3915}; and took{H3947}{(H8799)} of that which came{H935}{(H8802)} to his hand{H3027} a present{H4503} for Esau{H6215} his brother{H251};
Genesis,32,14,"Two hundred{H3967} she goats{H5795}, and twenty{H6242} he goats{H8495}, two hundred{H3967} ewes{H7353}, and twenty{H6242} rams{H352},"
Genesis,32,15,"Thirty{H7970} milch{H3243}{(H8688)} camels{H1581} with their colts{H1121}, forty{H705} kine{H6510}, and ten{H6235} bulls{H6499}, twenty{H6242} she asses{H860}, and ten{H6235} foals{H5895}."
Genesis,32,16,"And he delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} them into the hand{H3027} of his servants{H5650}, every drove{H5739} by themselves; and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his servants{H5650}, Pass over{H5674}{(H8798)} before me{H6440}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} a space{H7305} betwixt{H996} drove{H5739} and{H996} drove{H5739}."
Genesis,32,17,"And he commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} the foremost{H7223}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, When Esau{H6215} my brother{H251} meeteth thee{H6298}{(H8799)}, and asketh thee{H7592}{(H8804)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Whose art thou? and whither goest{H3212}{(H8799)} thou? and whose are these before{H6440} thee?"
Genesis,32,18,"Then thou shalt say{H559}{(H8804)}, They be thy servant{H5650} Jacob's{H3290}; it is a present{H4503} sent{H7971}{(H8803)} unto my lord{H113} Esau{H6215}: and, behold, also he is behind us{H310}."
Genesis,32,19,"And so{H1571} commanded he{H6680}{(H8762)} the second{H8145}, and the third{H7992}, and all that followed{H1980}{(H8802)}{H310} the droves{H5739}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, On this manner{H1697} shall ye speak{H1696}{(H8762)} unto Esau{H6215}, when ye find{H4672}{(H8800)} him."
Genesis,32,20,"And say ye{H559}{(H8804)} moreover{H1571}, Behold, thy servant{H5650} Jacob{H3290} is behind us{H310}. For he said{H559}{(H8804)}, I will appease{H3722}{(H8762)} him{H6440} with the present{H4503} that goeth{H1980}{(H8802)} before me{H6440}, and afterward{H310} I will see{H7200}{(H8799)} his face{H6440}; peradventure he will accept{H5375}{(H8799)} of me{H6440}."
Genesis,32,21,So went{H5674} the present{H4503} over{H5674}{(H8799)} before him{H6440}: and himself lodged{H3885}{(H8804)} that night{H3915} in the company{H4264}.
Genesis,32,22,"And he rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} that night{H3915}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} his two{H8147} wives{H802}, and his two{H8147} womenservants{H8198}, and his eleven{H6240}{H259} sons{H3206}, and passed over{H5674}{(H8799)} the ford{H4569} Jabbok{H2999}."
Genesis,32,23,"And he took them{H3947}{(H8799)}, and sent them over{H5674}{(H8686)} the brook{H5158}, and sent over{H5674}{(H8686)} that he had."
Genesis,32,24,And Jacob{H3290} was left{H3498}{(H8735)} alone; and there wrestled{H79}{(H8735)} a man{H376} with him until the breaking{H5927}{(H8800)} of the day{H7837}.
Genesis,32,25,"And when he saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that he prevailed{H3201}{(H8804)} not against him, he touched{H5060}{(H8799)} the hollow of his thigh{H3409}; and the hollow{H3709} of Jacob's{H3290} thigh{H3409} was out of joint{H3363}{(H8799)}, as he wrestled{H79}{(H8736)} with him."
Genesis,32,26,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let me go{H7971}{(H8761)}, for the day{H7837} breaketh{H5927}{(H8804)}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will not let thee go{H7971}{(H8762)}, except{H518} thou bless{H1288}{(H8765)} me."
Genesis,32,27,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, What is thy name{H8034}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Jacob{H3290}."
Genesis,32,28,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thy name{H8034} shall be called{H559}{(H8735)} no more Jacob{H3290}, but Israel{H3478}: for as a prince hast thou power{H8280}{(H8804)} with God{H430} and with men{H582}, and hast prevailed{H3201}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,32,29,"And Jacob{H3290} asked{H7592}{(H8799)} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Tell{H5046}{(H8685)} me, I pray thee, thy name{H8034}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Wherefore is it{H2088} that thou dost ask{H7592}{(H8799)} after my name{H8034}? And he blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} him there."
Genesis,32,30,"And Jacob{H3290} called{H7121}{(H8799)} the name{H8034} of the place{H4725} Peniel{H6439}: for I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} God{H430} face{H6440} to face{H6440}, and my life{H5315} is preserved{H5337}{(H8735)}."
Genesis,32,31,"And as he passed over{H5674}{(H8804)} Penuel{H6439} the sun{H8121} rose{H2224}{(H8799)} upon him, and he halted{H6760}{(H8802)} upon his thigh{H3409}."
Genesis,32,32,"Therefore the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} eat{H398}{(H8799)} not of the sinew{H1517} which shrank{H5384}, which is upon the hollow{H3709} of the thigh{H3409}, unto this day{H3117}: because he touched{H5060}{(H8804)} the hollow{H3709} of Jacob's{H3290} thigh{H3409} in the sinew{H1517} that shrank{H5384}."
Genesis,33,1,"And Jacob{H3290} lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} his eyes{H5869}, and looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, behold, Esau{H6215} came{H935}{(H8802)}, and with him four{H702} hundred{H3967} men{H376}. And he divided{H2673}{(H8799)} the children{H3206} unto Leah{H3812}, and unto Rachel{H7354}, and unto the two{H8147} handmaids{H8198}."

Genesis,33,3,"And he passed over{H5674}{(H8804)} before them{H6440}, and bowed himself{H7812}{(H8691)} to the ground{H776} seven{H7651} times{H6471}, until he came near{H5066}{(H8800)} to his brother{H251}."
Genesis,33,4,"And Esau{H6215} ran{H7323}{(H8799)} to meet him{H7125}{(H8800)}, and embraced{H2263}{(H8762)} him, and fell{H5307}{(H8799)} on his neck{H6677}, and kissed him{H5401}{(H8799)}: and they wept{H1058}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,33,5,"And he lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} his eyes{H5869}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the women{H802} and the children{H3206}; and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who are those{H428} with thee? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, The children{H3206} which God{H430} hath graciously given{H2603}{(H8804)} thy servant{H5650}."
Genesis,33,6,"Then the handmaidens{H8198} came near{H5066}{(H8799)}, they and their children{H3206}, and they bowed themselves{H7812}{(H8691)}."

Genesis,37,24,"And they took{H3947}{(H8799)} him, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} him into a pit{H953}: and the pit{H953} was empty{H7386}, there was no water{H4325} in it."
Genesis,37,25,"And they sat down{H3427}{(H8799)} to eat{H398}{(H8800)} bread{H3899}: and they lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} their eyes{H5869} and looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, behold, a company{H736} of Ishmeelites{H3459} came{H935}{(H8802)} from Gilead{H1568} with their camels{H1581} bearing{H5375}{(H8802)} spicery{H5219} and balm{H6875} and myrrh{H3910}, going{H1980}{(H8802)} to carry it down{H3381}{(H8687)} to Egypt{H4714}."
Genesis,37,26,"And Judah{H3063} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his brethren{H251}, What profit{H1215} is it if we slay{H2026}{(H8799)} our brother{H251}, and conceal{H3680}{(H8765)} his blood{H1818}?"
Genesis,37,27,"Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and let us sell{H4376}{(H8799)} him to the Ishmeelites{H3459}, and let not our hand{H3027} be upon him; for he is our brother{H251} and our flesh{H1320}. And his brethren{H251} were content{H8085}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,37,28,"Then there passed{H5674}{(H8799)} by Midianites{H4084} merchantmen{H582}{H5503}{(H8802)}; and they drew{H4900}{(H8799)} and lifted up{H5927}{(H8686)} Joseph{H3130} out of the pit{H953}, and sold{H4376}{(H8799)} Joseph{H3130} to the Ishmeelites{H3459} for twenty{H6242} pieces of silver{H3701}: and they brought{H935}{(H8686)} Joseph{H3130} into Egypt{H4714}."
Genesis,37,29,"And Reuben{H7205} returned{H7725}{(H8799)} unto the pit{H953}; and, behold, Joseph{H3130} was not in the pit{H953}; and he rent{H7167}{(H8799)} his clothes{H899}."

Genesis,37,33,"And he knew it{H5234}{(H8686)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, It is my son's{H1121} coat{H3801}; an evil{H7451} beast{H2416} hath devoured{H398}{(H8804)} him; Joseph{H3130} is without doubt{H2963}{(H8800)} rent in pieces{H2963}{(H8776)}."
Genesis,37,34,"And Jacob{H3290} rent{H7167}{(H8799)} his clothes{H8071}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} sackcloth{H8242} upon his loins{H4975}, and mourned{H56}{(H8691)} for his son{H1121} many{H7227} days{H3117}."
Genesis,37,35,"And all his sons{H1121} and all his daughters{H1323} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} to comfort{H5162}{(H8763)} him; but he refused{H3985}{(H8762)} to be comforted{H5162}{(H8692)}; and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, For I will go down{H3381}{(H8799)} into the grave{H7585} unto my son{H1121} mourning{H57}.

Genesis,38,1,"And it came to pass at that time{H6256}, that Judah{H3063} went down{H3381}{(H8799)} from his brethren{H251}, and turned{H5186}{(H8799)} in to a certain{H376} Adullamite{H5726}, whose name{H8034} was Hirah{H2437}."
Genesis,38,2,"And Judah{H3063} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} there a daughter{H1323} of a certain{H376} Canaanite{H3669}, whose name{H8034} was Shuah{H7770}; and he took her{H3947}{(H8799)}, and went in{H935}{(H8799)} unto her."
Genesis,38,3,"And she conceived{H2029}{(H8799)}, and bare{H3205}{(H8799)} a son{H1121}; and he called{H7121}{(H8799)} his name{H8034} Er{H6147}."
Genesis,38,4,"And she conceived{H2029}{(H8799)} again, and bare{H3205}{(H8799)} a son{H1121}; and she called{H7121}{(H8799)} his name{H8034} Onan{H209}."
Genesis,38,5,"And she yet again conceived{H3254}{(H8686)}, and bare{H3205}{(H8799)} a son{H1121}; and called{H7121}{(H8799)} his name{H8034} Shelah{H7956}: and he was at Chezib{H3580}, when she bare{H3205}{(H8800)} him."

Genesis,38,7,"And Er{H6147}, Judah's{H3063} firstborn{H1060}, was wicked{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}; and the LORD{H3068} slew{H4191}{(H8686)} him."
Genesis,38,8,"And Judah{H3063} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Onan{H209}, Go in{H935}{(H8798)} unto thy brother's{H251} wife{H802}, and marry{H2992}{(H8761)} her, and raise up{H6965}{(H8685)} seed{H2233} to thy brother{H251}."
Genesis,38,9,"And Onan{H209} knew{H3045}{(H8799)} that the seed{H2233} should not be his; and it came to pass, when{H518} he went in{H935}{(H8802)} unto his brother's{H251} wife{H802}, that he spilled{H7843}{(H8765)} it on the ground{H776}, lest{H1115} that he should give{H5414}{(H8800)} seed{H2233} to his brother{H251}."
Genesis,38,10,And the thing which{H834} he did{H6213}{(H8804)} displeased{H3415}{(H8799)}{H5869} the LORD{H3068}: wherefore he slew{H4191}{(H8686)} him also.
Genesis,38,11,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Judah{H3063} to Tamar{H8559} his daughter in law{H3618}, Remain{H3427}{(H8798)} a widow{H490} at thy father's{H1} house{H1004}, till Shelah{H7956} my son{H1121} be grown{H1431}{(H8799)}: for he said{H559}{(H8804)}, Lest peradventure he die{H4191}{(H8799)} also, as his brethren{H251} did.

Genesis,38,13,"And it was told{H5046}{(H8714)} Tamar{H8559}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold thy father in law{H2524} goeth up{H5927}{(H8802)} to Timnath{H8553} to shear{H1494}{(H8800)} his sheep{H6629}."
Genesis,38,14,"And she put{H5493} her widow's{H491} garments{H899} off{H5493}{(H8686)} from her, and covered her{H3680}{(H8762)} with a vail{H6809}, and wrapped herself{H5968}{(H8691)}, and sat in{H3427}{(H8799)} an open{H5869} place{H6607}, which is by the way{H1870} to Timnath{H8553}; for she saw{H7200}{(H8804)} that Shelah{H7956} was grown{H1431}{(H8804)}, and she was not given{H5414}{(H8738)} unto him to wife{H802}."

Genesis,38,16,"And he turned{H5186}{(H8799)} unto her by the way{H1870}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go to{H3051}{(H8798)}, I pray thee, let me come in{H935}{(H8799)} unto thee;(for he knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not that she was his daughter in law{H3618}.)

And she said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thy signet{H2368}, and thy bracelets{H6616}, and thy staff{H4294} that is in thine hand{H3027}. And he gave{H5414}{(H8799)} it her, and came in{H935}{(H8799)} unto her, and she conceived{H2029}{(H8799)} by him."
Genesis,38,19,"And she arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went away{H3212}{(H8799)}, and laid by{H5493}{(H8686)} her vail{H6809} from her, and put on{H3847}{(H8799)} the garments{H899} of her widowhood{H491}."

Genesis,39,17,"And she spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto him according to these words{H1697}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The Hebrew{H5680} servant{H5650}, which thou hast brought{H935}{(H8689)} unto us, came in{H935}{(H8804)} unto me to mock{H6711}{(H8763)} me:"
Genesis,39,18,"And it came to pass, as I lifted up{H7311}{(H8687)} my voice{H6963} and cried{H7121}{(H8799)}, that he left{H5800}{(H8799)} his garment{H899} with me{H681}, and fled{H5127}{(H8799)} out{H2351}."
Genesis,39,19,"And it came to pass, when his master{H113} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} the words{H1697} of his wife{H802}, which she spake{H1696}{(H8765)} unto him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, After this manner{H1697} did{H6213}{(H8804)} thy servant{H5650} to me; that his wrath{H639} was kindled{H2734}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,39,20,"And Joseph's{H3130} master{H113} took{H3947}{(H8799)} him, and put him{H5414}{(H8799)} into the prison{H1004}{H5470}, a place{H4725} where the king's{H4428} prisoners{H615} were bound{H631}{(H8803)}: and he was there in the prison{H1004}{H5470}."
Genesis,39,21,"But the LORD{H3068} was with Joseph{H3130}, and shewed{H5186}{(H8799)} him mercy{H2617}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him favour{H2580} in the sight{H5869} of the keeper{H8269} of the prison{H1004}{H5470}."
Genesis,39,22,"And the keeper{H8269} of the prison{H1004}{H5470} committed{H5414}{(H8799)} to Joseph's{H3130} hand{H3027} all the prisoners{H615} that were in the prison{H1004}{H5470}; and whatsoever they did{H6213}{(H8802)} there, he was the doer{H6213}{(H8802)} of it."
Genesis,39,23,"The keeper{H8269} of the prison{H1004}{H5470} looked{H7200}{(H8802)} not to any thing{H3972} that was under his hand{H3027}; because the LORD{H3068} was with him, and that which he did{H6213}{(H8802)}, the LORD{H3068} made it to prosper{H6743}{(H8688)}."
Genesis,40,1,"And it came to pass after{H310} these things{H1697}, that the butler{H8248}{(H8688)} of the king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714} and his baker{H644}{(H8802)} had offended{H2398}{(H8804)} their lord{H113} the king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714}."
Genesis,40,2,"And Pharaoh{H6547} was wroth{H7107}{(H8799)} against{H5921} two{H8147} of his officers{H5631}, against the chief{H8269} of the butlers{H8248}{(H8688)}, and against the chief{H8269} of the bakers{H644}{(H8802)}."
Genesis,40,3,"And he put{H5414}{(H8799)} them in ward{H4929} in the house{H1004} of the captain{H8269} of the guard{H2876}, into the prison{H1004}{H5470}, the place{H4725} where Joseph{H3130} was bound{H631}{(H8803)}."
Genesis,40,4,"And the captain{H8269} of the guard{H2876} charged{H6485}{(H8799)} Joseph{H3130} with them, and he served{H8334}{(H8762)} them: and they continued a season{H3117} in ward{H4929}."
Genesis,40,5,"And they dreamed{H2492}{(H8799)} a dream{H2472} both of them{H8147}, each man{H376} his dream{H2472} in one{H259} night{H3915}, each man{H376} according to the interpretation{H6623} of his dream{H2472}, the butler{H8248}{(H8688)} and the baker{H644}{(H8802)} of the king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714}, which were bound{H631}{(H8803)} in the prison{H1004}{H5470}."
Genesis,40,6,"And Joseph{H3130} came in{H935}{(H8799)} unto them in the morning{H1242}, and looked{H7200}{(H8799)} upon them, and, behold, they were sad{H2196}{(H8802)}."
Genesis,40,7,"And he asked{H7592}{(H8799)} Pharaoh's{H6547} officers{H5631} that were with him in the ward{H4929} of his lord's{H113} house{H1004}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Wherefore look{H6440} ye so sadly{H7451} to day{H3117}?"
Genesis,40,8,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, We have dreamed{H2492}{(H8804)} a dream{H2472}, and there is no interpreter{H6622}{(H8802)} of it. And Joseph{H3130} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Do not interpretations{H6623} belong to God{H430}? tell me{H5608}{(H8761)} them, I pray you."
Genesis,40,9,"And the chief{H8269} butler{H8248}{(H8688)} told{H5608}{(H8762)} his dream{H2472} to Joseph{H3130}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} to him, In my dream{H2472}, behold, a vine{H1612} was before me{H6440};"
Genesis,40,10,"And in the vine{H1612} were three{H7969} branches{H8299}: and it was as though it budded{H6524}{(H8802)}, and her blossoms{H5322} shot forth{H5927}{(H8804)}; and the clusters{H811} thereof brought forth ripe{H1310}{(H8689)} grapes{H6025}:"
Genesis,40,11,"And Pharaoh's{H6547} cup{H3563} was in my hand{H3027}: and I took{H3947}{(H8799)} the grapes{H6025}, and pressed{H7818}{(H8799)} them into Pharaoh's{H6547} cup{H3563}, and I gave{H5414}{(H8799)} the cup{H3563} into Pharaoh's{H6547} hand{H3709}."
Genesis,40,12,"And Joseph{H3130} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, This is the interpretation{H6623} of it: The three{H7969} branches{H8299} are three{H7969} days{H3117}:"
Genesis,40,13,"Yet{H5750} within three{H7969} days{H3117} shall Pharaoh{H6547} lift up{H5375}{(H8799)} thine head{H7218}, and restore{H7725}{(H8689)} thee unto thy place{H3653}: and thou shalt deliver{H5414}{(H8804)} Pharaoh's{H6547} cup{H3563} into his hand{H3027}, after the former{H7223} manner{H4941} when thou wast his butler{H8248}{(H8688)}."
Genesis,40,14,"But think{H2142}{(H8804)} on me when it shall be well{H3190}{(H8799)} with thee, and shew{H6213}{(H8804)} kindness{H2617}, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention{H2142}{(H8689)} of me unto Pharaoh{H6547}, and bring me{H3318}{(H8689)} out of this house{H1004}:"
Genesis,40,15,For indeed I was stolen away{H1589}{(H8795)} out of the land{H776} of the Hebrews{H5680}: and here also have I done{H6213}{(H8804)} nothing{H3972} that they should put{H7760}{(H8804)} me into the dungeon{H953}.
Genesis,40,16,"When the chief{H8269} baker{H644}{(H8802)} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that the interpretation{H6622}{(H8804)} was good{H2896}, he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joseph{H3130}, I also{H637} was in my dream{H2472}, and, behold, I had three{H7969} white{H2751} baskets{H5536} on my head{H7218}:"
Genesis,40,17,And in the uppermost{H5945} basket{H5536} there was of all manner{H3978} of bakemeats{H4639}{H644}{(H8802)} for Pharaoh{H6547}; and the birds{H5775} did eat{H398}{(H8802)} them out of the basket{H5536} upon{H5921} my head{H7218}.
Genesis,40,18,"And Joseph{H3130} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, This is the interpretation{H6623} thereof: The three{H7969} baskets{H5536} are three{H7969} days{H3117}:"
Genesis,40,19,"Yet within three{H7969} days{H3117} shall Pharaoh{H6547} lift up{H5375}{(H8799)} thy head{H7218} from off thee, and shall hang{H8518}{(H8804)} thee on a tree{H6086}; and the birds{H5775} shall eat{H398}{(H8804)} thy flesh{H1320} from off thee."
Genesis,40,20,"And it came to pass the third{H7992} day{H3117}, which was Pharaoh's{H6547} birthday{H3117}{H3205}{(H8715)}, that he made{H6213}{(H8799)} a feast{H4960} unto all his servants{H5650}: and he lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} the head{H7218} of the chief{H8269} butler{H8248}{(H8688)} and of the chief{H8269} baker{H644}{(H8802)} among{H8432} his servants{H5650}."
Genesis,40,21,And he restored{H7725} the chief{H8269} butler{H8248}{(H8688)} unto his butlership{H4945} again{H7725}{(H8686)}; and he gave{H5414}{(H8799)} the cup{H3563} into Pharaoh's{H6547} hand{H3709}:
Genesis,40,22,But he hanged{H8518}{(H8804)} the chief{H8269} baker{H644}{(H8802)}: as Joseph{H3130} had interpreted{H6622}{(H8804)} to them.
Genesis,40,23,"Yet did not the chief{H8269} butler{H8248}{(H8688)} remember{H2142}{(H8804)} Joseph{H3130}, but forgat{H7911}{(H8799)} him."
Genesis,41,1,"And it came to pass at the end{H7093} of two full{H3117} years{H8141}, that Pharaoh{H6547} dreamed{H2492}{(H8802)}: and, behold, he stood{H5975}{(H8802)} by the river{H2975}."
Genesis,41,2,"And, behold, there came up{H5927}{(H8802)} out of the river{H2975} seven{H7651} well{H3303} favoured{H4758} kine{H6510} and fatfleshed{H1277}{H1320}; and they fed{H7462}{(H8799)} in a meadow{H260}."
Genesis,41,3,"And, behold, seven{H7651} other{H312} kine{H6510} came up{H5927}{(H8802)} after them{H310} out of the river{H2975}, ill{H7451} favoured{H4758} and leanfleshed{H1851}{H1320}; and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} by{H681} the other kine{H6510} upon the brink{H8193} of the river{H2975}."
Genesis,41,4,And the ill{H7451} favoured{H4758} and leanfleshed{H1851}{H1320} kine{H6510} did eat up{H398}{(H8799)} the seven{H7651} well{H3303} favoured{H4758} and fat{H1277} kine{H6510}. So Pharaoh{H6547} awoke{H3364}{(H8799)}.
Genesis,41,5,"And he slept{H3462}{(H8799)} and dreamed{H2492}{(H8799)} the second time{H8145}: and, behold, seven{H7651} ears of corn{H7641} came up{H5927}{(H8802)} upon one{H259} stalk{H7070}, rank{H1277} and good{H2896}."
Genesis,41,6,"And, behold, seven{H7651} thin{H1851} ears{H7641} and blasted{H7710}{(H8803)} with the east wind{H6921} sprung up{H6779}{(H8802)} after them{H310}."
Genesis,41,7,"And the seven thin{H1851} ears{H7641} devoured{H1104}{(H8799)} the seven{H7651} rank{H1277} and full{H4392} ears{H7641}. And Pharaoh{H6547} awoke{H3364}{(H8799)}, and, behold, it was a dream{H2472}."
Genesis,41,8,"And it came to pass in the morning{H1242} that his spirit{H7307} was troubled{H6470}{(H8735)}; and he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and called{H7121}{(H8799)} for all the magicians{H2748} of Egypt{H4714}, and all the wise men{H2450} thereof: and Pharaoh{H6547} told{H5608}{(H8762)} them his dream{H2472}; but there was none that could interpret{H6622}{(H8802)} them unto Pharaoh{H6547}."
Genesis,41,9,"Then spake{H1696}{(H8762)} the chief{H8269} butler{H8248}{(H8688)} unto Pharaoh{H6547}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I do remember{H2142}{(H8688)} my faults{H2399} this day{H3117}:"
Genesis,41,10,"Pharaoh{H6547} was wroth{H7107}{(H8804)} with his servants{H5650}, and put{H5414}{(H8799)} me in ward{H4929} in the captain{H8269} of the guard's{H2876} house{H1004}, both me and the chief{H8269} baker{H644}{(H8802)}:"
Genesis,41,11,"And we dreamed{H2492}{(H8799)} a dream{H2472} in one{H259} night{H3915}, I and he; we dreamed{H2492}{(H8804)} each man{H376} according to the interpretation{H6623} of his dream{H2472}."
Genesis,41,12,"And there was there with us a young man{H5288}, an Hebrew{H5680}, servant{H5650} to the captain{H8269} of the guard{H2876}; and we told{H5608}{(H8762)} him, and he interpreted{H6622}{(H8799)} to us our dreams{H2472}; to each man{H376} according to his dream{H2472} he did interpret{H6622}{(H8804)}."
Genesis,41,13,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted{H6622}{(H8804)} to us, so it was; me he restored{H7725}{(H8689)} unto mine office{H3653}, and him he hanged{H8518}{(H8804)}."
Genesis,41,14,"Then Pharaoh{H6547} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and called{H7121}{(H8799)} Joseph{H3130}, and they brought him hastily{H7323}{(H8686)} out of the dungeon{H953}: and he shaved{H1548}{(H8762)} himself, and changed{H2498}{(H8762)} his raiment{H8071}, and came in{H935}{(H8804)} unto Pharaoh{H6547}."
Genesis,41,15,"And Pharaoh{H6547} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joseph{H3130}, I have dreamed{H2492}{(H8804)} a dream{H2472}, and there is none that can interpret{H6622}{(H8802)} it: and I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} say{H559}{(H8800)} of thee, that thou canst understand{H8085}{(H8799)} a dream{H2472} to interpret{H6622}{(H8800)} it."
Genesis,41,16,"And Joseph{H3130} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Pharaoh{H6547}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, It is not in me{H1107}: God{H430} shall give{H6030} Pharaoh{H6547} an answer{H6030}{(H8799)} of peace{H7965}."
Genesis,41,17,"And Pharaoh{H6547} said{H1696}{(H8762)} unto Joseph{H3130}, In my dream{H2472}, behold, I stood{H5975}{(H8802)} upon the bank{H8193} of the river{H2975}:"
Genesis,41,18,"And, behold, there came up{H5927}{(H8802)} out of the river{H2975} seven{H7651} kine{H6510}, fatfleshed{H1277}{H1320} and well{H3303} favoured{H8389}; and they fed{H7462}{(H8799)} in a meadow{H260}:"
Genesis,41,19,"And, behold, seven{H7651} other{H312} kine{H6510} came up{H5927}{(H8802)} after them{H310}, poor{H1803} and very{H3966} ill{H7451} favoured{H8389} and leanfleshed{H7534}{H1320}, such{H2007} as I never{H3808} saw{H7200}{(H8804)} in all the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} for badness{H7455}:"
Genesis,41,20,And the lean{H7534} and the ill favoured{H7451} kine{H6510} did eat up{H398}{(H8799)} the first{H7223} seven{H7651} fat{H1277} kine{H6510}:
Genesis,41,21,"And when they had eaten them up{H935}{(H8799)}{H7130}, it could not be known{H3045}{(H8738)} that they had eaten them{H935}{(H8804)}{H7130}; but they were still{H4758} ill favoured{H7451}, as at the beginning{H8462}. So I awoke{H3364}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,41,22,"And I saw{H7200}{(H8799)} in my dream{H2472}, and, behold, seven{H7651} ears{H7641} came up{H5927}{(H8802)} in one{H259} stalk{H7070}, full{H4392} and good{H2896}:"
Genesis,41,23,"And, behold, seven{H7651} ears{H7641}, withered{H6798}{(H8803)}, thin{H1851}, and blasted{H7710}{(H8803)} with the east wind{H6921}, sprung up{H6779}{(H8802)} after them{H310}:"
Genesis,41,24,And the thin{H1851} ears{H7641} devoured{H1104}{(H8799)} the seven{H7651} good{H2896} ears{H7641}: and I told{H559}{(H8799)} this unto the magicians{H2748}; but there was none that could declare{H5046}{(H8688)} it to me.
Genesis,41,25,"And Joseph{H3130} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Pharaoh{H6547}, The dream{H2472} of Pharaoh{H6547} is one{H259}: God{H430} hath shewed{H5046}{(H8689)} Pharaoh{H6547} what he is about to do{H6213}{(H8802)}."
Genesis,41,26,The seven{H7651} good{H2896} kine{H6510} are seven{H7651} years{H8141}; and the seven{H7651} good{H2896} ears{H7641} are seven{H7651} years{H8141}: the dream{H2472} is one{H259}.
Genesis,41,27,And the seven{H7651} thin{H7534} and ill favoured{H7451} kine{H6510} that came up{H5927}{(H8802)} after them{H310} are seven{H7651} years{H8141}; and the seven{H7651} empty{H7386} ears{H7641} blasted{H7710}{(H8803)} with the east wind{H6921} shall be seven{H7651} years{H8141} of famine{H7458}.
Genesis,41,28,This is the thing{H1697} which I have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} unto Pharaoh{H6547}: What God{H430} is about to do{H6213}{(H8802)} he sheweth{H7200}{(H8689)} unto Pharaoh{H6547}.
Genesis,41,29,"Behold, there come{H935}{(H8802)} seven{H7651} years{H8141} of great{H1419} plenty{H7647} throughout all the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}:"
Genesis,41,30,And there shall arise{H6965}{(H8804)} after them{H310} seven{H7651} years{H8141} of famine{H7458}; and all the plenty{H7647} shall be forgotten{H7911}{(H8738)} in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}; and the famine{H7458} shall consume{H3615}{(H8765)} the land{H776};
Genesis,41,31,And the plenty{H7647} shall not be known{H3045}{(H8735)} in the land{H776} by reason{H6440} of that famine{H7458} following{H310}{H3651}; for it shall be very{H3966} grievous{H3515}.
Genesis,41,32,"And for that the dream{H2472} was doubled{H8138}{(H8736)} unto Pharaoh{H6547} twice{H6471}; it is because the thing{H1697} is established{H3559}{(H8737)} by{H5973} God{H430}, and God{H430} will shortly{H4116}{(H8764)} bring it to pass{H6213}{(H8800)}."
Genesis,41,33,"Now therefore let Pharaoh{H6547} look out{H7200}{(H8799)} a man{H376} discreet{H995}{(H8737)} and wise{H2450}, and set{H7896}{(H8799)} him over the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
Genesis,41,34,"Let Pharaoh{H6547} do{H6213}{(H8799)} this, and let him appoint{H6485}{(H8686)} officers{H6496} over the land{H776}, and take up the fifth part{H2567}{(H8765)} of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} in the seven{H7651} plenteous{H7647} years{H8141}."
Genesis,41,35,"And let them gather{H6908}{(H8799)} all the food{H400} of those good{H2896} years{H8141} that come{H935}{(H8802)}, and lay up{H6651}{(H8799)} corn{H1250} under the hand{H3027} of Pharaoh{H6547}, and let them keep{H8104}{(H8804)} food{H400} in the cities{H5892}."
Genesis,41,36,"And that food{H400} shall be for store{H6487} to the land{H776} against the seven{H7651} years{H8141} of famine{H7458}, which shall be in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}; that the land{H776} perish{H3772}{(H8735)} not through the famine{H7458}."
Genesis,41,37,"And the thing{H1697} was good{H3190}{(H8799)} in the eyes{H5869} of Pharaoh{H6547}, and in the eyes{H5869} of all his servants{H5650}."
Genesis,41,38,"And Pharaoh{H6547} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his servants{H5650}, Can we find{H4672}{(H8799)} such a one as this{H2088} is, a man{H376} in whom{H834} the Spirit{H7307} of God{H430} is?"
Genesis,41,39,"And Pharaoh{H6547} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joseph{H3130}, Forasmuch{H310} as God{H430} hath shewed{H3045}{(H8687)} thee all this, there is none so discreet{H995}{(H8737)} and wise{H2450} as thou art:"
Genesis,41,40,"Thou shalt be{H1961}{(H8799)} over my house{H1004}, and according unto thy word{H6310} shall all my people{H5971} be ruled{H5401}{(H8799)}: only in the throne{H3678} will I be greater{H1431}{(H8799)} than thou."
Genesis,41,41,"And Pharaoh{H6547} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joseph{H3130}, See{H7200}{(H8798)}, I have set{H5414}{(H8804)} thee over all the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
Genesis,41,42,"And Pharaoh{H6547} took off{H5493}{(H8686)} his ring{H2885} from his hand{H3027}, and put{H5414}{(H8799)} it upon Joseph's{H3130} hand{H3027}, and arrayed{H3847}{(H8686)} him in vestures{H899} of fine linen{H8336}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} a gold{H2091} chain{H7242} about his neck{H6677};"
Genesis,41,43,"And he made him to ride{H7392}{(H8686)} in the second{H4932} chariot{H4818} which he had; and they cried{H7121}{(H8799)} before him{H6440}, Bow the knee{H86}: and he made{H5414}{(H8800)} him ruler over all the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
Genesis,41,44,"And Pharaoh{H6547} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joseph{H3130}, I am Pharaoh{H6547}, and without{H1107} thee shall no man{H376} lift up{H7311}{(H8686)} his hand{H3027} or foot{H7272} in all the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
Genesis,41,45,And Pharaoh{H6547} called{H7121}{(H8799)} Joseph's{H3130} name{H8034} Zaphnathpaaneah{H6847}; and he gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him to wife{H802} Asenath{H621} the daughter{H1323} of Potipherah{H6319} priest{H3548} of On{H204}.

And Joseph{H3130} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} from the presence{H6440} of Pharaoh{H6547}, and went throughout{H5674}{(H8799)} all the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
Genesis,41,47,And in the seven{H7651} plenteous{H7647} years{H8141} the earth{H776} brought forth{H6213}{(H8799)} by handfuls{H7062}.
Genesis,41,48,"And he gathered up{H6908}{(H8799)} all the food{H400} of the seven{H7651} years{H8141}, which were in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, and laid up{H5414}{(H8799)} the food{H400} in the cities{H5892}: the food{H400} of the field{H7704}, which was round about{H5439} every city{H5892}, laid he up{H5414}{(H8804)} in the same{H8432}."
Genesis,41,49,"And Joseph{H3130} gathered{H6651}{(H8799)} corn{H1250} as the sand{H2344} of the sea{H3220}, very{H3966} much{H7235}{(H8687)}, until he left{H2308}{(H8804)} numbering{H5608}{(H8800)}; for it was without{H369} number{H4557}."
Genesis,41,50,"And unto Joseph{H3130} were born{H3205}{(H8795)} two{H8147} sons{H1121} before the years{H8141} of famine{H7458} came{H935}{(H8799)}, which Asenath{H621} the daughter{H1323} of Potipherah{H6319} priest{H3548} of On{H204} bare{H3205}{(H8804)} unto him."
Genesis,41,51,"And Joseph{H3130} called{H7121}{(H8799)} the name{H8034} of the firstborn{H1060} Manasseh{H4519}: For God{H430}, said he, hath made me forget{H5382}{(H8765)} all my toil{H5999}, and all my father's{H1} house{H1004}."
Genesis,41,52,And the name{H8034} of the second{H8145} called{H7121}{(H8804)} he Ephraim{H669}: For God{H430} hath caused me to be fruitful{H6509}{(H8689)} in the land{H776} of my affliction{H6040}.
Genesis,41,53,"And the seven{H7651} years{H8141} of plenteousness{H7647}, that was in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, were ended{H3615}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,41,54,"And the seven{H7651} years{H8141} of dearth{H7458} began{H2490}{(H8686)} to come{H935}{(H8800)}, according as Joseph{H3130} had said{H559}{(H8804)}: and the dearth{H7458} was in all lands{H776}; but in all the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} there was bread{H3899}."
Genesis,41,55,"And when all the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} was famished{H7456}{(H8799)}, the people{H5971} cried{H6817}{(H8799)} to Pharaoh{H6547} for bread{H3899}: and Pharaoh{H6547} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto all the Egyptians{H4714}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} unto Joseph{H3130}; what he saith{H559}{(H8799)} to you, do{H6213}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,41,56,"And the famine{H7458} was over all the face{H6440} of the earth{H776}: And Joseph{H3130} opened{H6605}{(H8799)} all the storehouses, and sold{H7666}{(H8799)} unto the Egyptians{H4714}; and the famine{H7458} waxed sore{H2388}{(H8799)} in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
Genesis,41,57,And all countries{H776} came{H935}{(H8804)} into Egypt{H4714} to Joseph{H3130} for to buy{H7666}{(H8800)} corn; because that the famine{H7458} was so sore{H2388}{(H8804)} in all lands{H776}.
Genesis,42,1,"Now when Jacob{H3290} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that there was{H3426} corn{H7668} in Egypt{H4714}, Jacob{H3290} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his sons{H1121}, Why do ye look{H7200}{(H8691)} one upon another?"
Genesis,42,2,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} that there is{H3426} corn{H7668} in Egypt{H4714}: get you down{H3381}{(H8798)} thither, and buy{H7666}{(H8798)} for us from thence; that we may live{H2421}{(H8799)}, and not die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,42,3,And Joseph's{H3130} ten{H6235} brethren{H251} went down{H3381}{(H8799)} to buy{H7666}{(H8800)} corn{H1250} in Egypt{H4714}.
Genesis,42,4,"But Benjamin{H1144}, Joseph's{H3130} brother{H251}, Jacob{H3290} sent{H7971}{(H8804)} not with his brethren{H251}; for he said{H559}{(H8804)}, Lest peradventure{H6435} mischief{H611} befall him{H7122}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,42,5,And the sons{H1121} of Israel{H3478} came{H935}{(H8799)} to buy{H7666}{(H8800)} corn among{H8432} those that came{H935}{(H8802)}: for the famine{H7458} was in the land{H776} of Canaan{H3667}.
Genesis,42,6,"And Joseph{H3130} was the governor{H7989} over the land{H776}, and he it was that sold{H7666}{(H8688)} to all the people{H5971} of the land{H776}: and Joseph's{H3130} brethren{H251} came{H935}{(H8799)}, and bowed down{H7812}{(H8691)} themselves before him with their faces{H639} to the earth{H776}."
Genesis,42,7,"And Joseph{H3130} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} his brethren{H251}, and he knew{H5234}{(H8686)} them, but made himself strange{H5234}{(H8691)} unto them, and spake{H1696}{(H8762)} roughly{H7186} unto them; and he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Whence{H370} come{H935}{(H8804)} ye? And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, From the land{H776} of Canaan{H3667} to buy{H7666}{(H8800)} food{H400}."
Genesis,42,8,"And Joseph{H3130} knew{H5234}{(H8686)} his brethren{H251}, but they knew{H5234}{(H8689)} not him."
Genesis,42,9,"And Joseph{H3130} remembered{H2142}{(H8799)} the dreams{H2472} which he dreamed{H2492}{(H8804)} of them, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Ye are spies{H7270}{(H8764)}; to see{H7200}{(H8800)} the nakedness{H6172} of the land{H776} ye are come{H935}{(H8804)}."
Genesis,42,10,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Nay, my lord{H113}, but to buy{H7666}{(H8800)} food{H400} are thy servants{H5650} come{H935}{(H8804)}."
Genesis,42,11,"We{H5168} are all one{H259} man's{H376} sons{H1121}; we are true{H3651} men, thy servants{H5650} are no spies{H7270}{(H8764)}."
Genesis,42,12,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Nay, but to see{H7200}{(H8800)} the nakedness{H6172} of the land{H776} ye are come{H935}{(H8804)}."
Genesis,42,13,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thy servants{H5650} are twelve{H8147}{H6240} brethren{H251}, the sons{H1121} of one{H259} man{H376} in the land{H776} of Canaan{H3667}; and, behold, the youngest{H6996} is this day{H3117} with our father{H1}, and one{H259} is not."
Genesis,42,14,"And Joseph{H3130} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, That is it that I spake{H1696}{(H8765)} unto you, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Ye are spies{H7270}{(H8764)}:"
Genesis,42,15,"Hereby{H2063} ye shall be proved{H974}{(H8735)}: By the life{H2416} of Pharaoh{H6547} ye shall not go forth{H3318}{(H8799)} hence, except your youngest{H6996} brother{H251} come{H935}{(H8800)} hither."
Genesis,42,16,"Send{H7971}{(H8798)} one{H259} of you, and let him fetch{H3947}{(H8799)} your brother{H251}, and ye shall be kept in prison{H631}{(H8734)}, that your words{H1697} may be proved{H974}{(H8735)}, whether there be any truth{H571} in{H854} you: or else{H3808} by the life{H2416} of Pharaoh{H6547} surely ye are spies{H7270}{(H8764)}."
Genesis,42,17,And he put them all together{H622}{(H8799)} into ward{H4929} three{H7969} days{H3117}.
Genesis,42,18,"And Joseph{H3130} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them the third{H7992} day{H3117}, This do{H6213}{(H8798)}, and live{H2421}{(H8798)}; for I fear{H3373} God{H430}:"
Genesis,42,19,"If ye be true{H3651} men, let one{H259} of your brethren{H251} be bound{H631}{(H8735)} in the house{H1004} of your prison{H4929}: go{H3212}{(H8798)} ye, carry{H935}{(H8685)} corn{H7668} for the famine{H7459} of your houses{H1004}:"
Genesis,42,20,"But bring{H935}{(H8686)} your youngest{H6996} brother{H251} unto me; so shall your words{H1697} be verified{H539}{(H8735)}, and ye shall not die{H4191}{(H8799)}. And they did{H6213}{(H8799)} so."
Genesis,42,21,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} one{H376} to another{H251}, We are verily{H61} guilty{H818} concerning our brother{H251}, in that{H834} we saw{H7200}{(H8804)} the anguish{H6869} of his soul{H5315}, when he besought{H2603}{(H8692)} us, and we would not hear{H8085}{(H8804)}; therefore is this distress{H6869} come{H935}{(H8804)} upon us."
Genesis,42,22,"And Reuben{H7205} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Spake I{H559}{(H8804)} not unto you, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Do not sin{H2398}{(H8799)} against the child{H3206}; and ye would not hear{H8085}{(H8804)}? therefore, behold, also his blood{H1818} is required{H1875}{(H8738)}."
Genesis,42,23,And they knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not that Joseph{H3130} understood{H8085}{(H8802)} them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter{H3887}{(H8688)}.
Genesis,42,24,"And he turned himself about{H5437}{(H8735)} from them, and wept{H1058}{(H8799)}; and returned to them again{H7725}{(H8799)}, and communed{H1696}{(H8762)} with them, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} from them Simeon{H8095}, and bound{H631}{(H8799)} him before their eyes{H5869}."
Genesis,42,25,"Then Joseph{H3130} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} to fill{H4390}{(H8762)} their sacks{H3627} with corn{H1250}, and to restore{H7725}{(H8687)} every man's{H376} money{H3701} into his sack{H8242}, and to give{H5414}{(H8800)} them provision{H6720} for the way{H1870}: and thus{H3651} did he{H6213}{(H8799)} unto them."
Genesis,42,26,"And they laded{H5375}{(H8799)} their asses{H2543} with the corn{H7668}, and departed{H3212}{(H8799)} thence."
Genesis,42,27,"And as one{H259} of them opened{H6605}{(H8799)} his sack{H8242} to give{H5414}{(H8800)} his ass{H2543} provender{H4554} in the inn{H4411}, he espied{H7200}{(H8799)} his money{H3701}; for, behold, it was in his sack's{H572} mouth{H6310}."
Genesis,42,28,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his brethren{H251}, My money{H3701} is restored{H7725}{(H8717)}; and, lo{H2009}, it is even in my sack{H572}: and their heart{H3820} failed{H3318}{(H8799)} them, and they were afraid{H2729}{(H8799)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)} one{H376} to another{H251}, What is this that God{H430} hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} unto us?"
Genesis,42,29,"And they came{H935}{(H8799)} unto Jacob{H3290} their father{H1} unto the land{H776} of Canaan{H3667}, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} him all that befell{H7136}{(H8802)} unto them; saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Genesis,42,30,"The man{H376}, who is the lord{H113} of the land{H776}, spake{H1696}{(H8765)} roughly{H7186} to us, and took{H5414}{(H8799)} us for spies{H7270}{(H8764)} of the country{H776}."
Genesis,42,31,"And we said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, We are true{H3651} men; we are no spies{H7270}{(H8764)}:"
Genesis,42,32,"We be twelve{H6240}{H8147} brethren{H251}, sons{H1121} of our father{H1}; one{H259} is not, and the youngest{H6996} is this day{H3117} with our father{H1} in the land{H776} of Canaan{H3667}."
Genesis,42,33,"And the man{H376}, the lord{H113} of the country{H776}, said{H559}{(H8799)} unto us, Hereby shall I know{H3045}{(H8799)} that ye are true{H3651} men; leave{H3240}{(H8685)} one{H259} of your brethren{H251} here with me, and take{H3947}{(H8798)} food for the famine{H7459} of your households{H1004}, and be gone{H3212}{(H8798)}:"
Genesis,42,34,"And bring{H935}{(H8685)} your youngest{H6996} brother{H251} unto me: then shall I know{H3045}{(H8799)} that ye are no spies{H7270}{(H8764)}, but that ye are true{H3651} men: so will I deliver{H5414}{(H8799)} you your brother{H251}, and ye shall traffick{H5503}{(H8799)} in the land{H776}."
Genesis,42,35,"And it came to pass as they emptied{H7324}{(H8688)} their sacks{H8242}, that, behold, every man's{H376} bundle{H6872} of money{H3701} was in his sack{H8242}: and when both they and their father{H1} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the bundles{H6872} of money{H3701}, they were afraid{H3372}{(H8799)}."
Genesis,42,36,"And Jacob{H3290} their father{H1} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Me have ye bereaved{H7921}{(H8765)} of my children: Joseph{H3130} is not, and Simeon{H8095} is not, and ye will take{H3947}{(H8799)} Benjamin{H1144} away: all these things are against me."
Genesis,42,37,"And Reuben{H7205} spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto his father{H1}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Slay{H4191}{(H8686)} my two{H8147} sons{H1121}, if I bring{H935}{(H8686)} him not to thee: deliver{H5414}{(H8798)} him into my hand{H3027}, and I will bring him to thee again{H7725}{(H8686)}."
Genesis,42,38,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, My son{H1121} shall not go down{H3381}{(H8799)} with you; for his brother{H251} is dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, and he is left{H7604}{(H8738)} alone: if mischief{H611} befall{H7122}{(H8804)} him by the way{H1870} in the which ye go{H3212}{(H8799)}, then shall ye bring down{H3381}{(H8689)} my gray hairs{H7872} with sorrow{H3015} to the grave{H7585}."

Genesis,43,5,"But if thou wilt not send{H7971}{(H8764)} him, we will not go down{H3381}{(H8799)}: for the man{H376} said{H559}{(H8804)} unto us, Ye shall not see{H7200}{(H8799)} my face{H6440}, except your brother{H251} be with you."
Genesis,43,6,"And Israel{H3478} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Wherefore dealt ye so ill{H7489}{(H8689)} with me, as to tell{H5046}{(H8687)} the man{H376} whether ye had yet a brother{H251}?"
Genesis,43,7,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, The man{H376} asked{H7592}{(H8804)} us straitly{H7592}{(H8800)} of our state, and of our kindred{H4138}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Is your father{H1} yet alive{H2416}? have ye{H3426} another brother{H251}? and we told{H5046}{(H8686)} him according{H5921} to the tenor{H6310} of these words{H1697}: could we certainly{H3045}{(H8800)} know{H3045}{(H8799)} that he would say{H559}{(H8799)}, Bring{H3381} your brother{H251} down{H3381}{(H8685)}?"
Genesis,43,8,"And Judah{H3063} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Israel{H3478} his father{H1}, Send{H7971}{(H8798)} the lad{H5288} with me, and we will arise{H6965}{(H8799)} and go{H3212}{(H8799)}; that we may live{H2421}{(H8799)}, and not die{H4191}{(H8799)}, both we, and thou, and also our little ones{H2945}."
Genesis,43,9,"I will be surety{H6148}{(H8799)} for him; of my hand{H3027} shalt thou require{H1245}{(H8762)} him: if{H518} I bring{H935}{(H8689)} him not{H518} unto thee, and set{H3322}{(H8689)} him before thee{H6440}, then let me bear the blame{H2398}{(H8804)} for ever{H3117}:"
Genesis,43,10,"For except{H3884} we had lingered{H4102}{(H8701)}, surely now we had returned{H7725}{(H8804)} this second time{H6471}."

Genesis,43,26,"And when Joseph{H3130} came{H935}{(H8799)} home{H1004}, they brought{H935}{(H8686)} him the present{H4503} which was in their hand{H3027} into the house{H1004}, and bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} themselves to him to the earth{H776}."
Genesis,43,27,"And he asked{H7592}{(H8799)} them of their welfare{H7965}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is your father{H1} well{H7965}, the old man{H2205} of whom ye spake{H559}{(H8804)}? Is he yet alive{H2416}?"
Genesis,43,28,"And they answered{H559}{(H8799)}, Thy servant{H5650} our father{H1} is in good health{H7965}, he is yet alive{H2416}. And they bowed down their heads{H6915}{(H8799)}, and made obeisance{H7812}{(H8691)}."

Genesis,43,32,"And they set on{H7760}{(H8799)} for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians{H4713}, which did eat{H398}{(H8802)} with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians{H4713} might{H3201}{(H8799)} not eat{H398}{(H8800)} bread{H3899} with the Hebrews{H5680}; for that is an abomination{H8441} unto the Egyptians{H4714}."
Genesis,43,33,"And they sat{H3427}{(H8799)} before him{H6440}, the firstborn{H1060} according to his birthright{H1062}, and the youngest{H6810} according to his youth{H6812}: and the men{H582} marvelled{H8539}{(H8799)} one{H376} at another{H7453}."
Genesis,43,34,"And he took{H5375}{(H8799)} and sent messes{H4864} unto them from before him{H6440}: but Benjamin's{H1144} mess{H4864} was five{H2568} times{H3027} so much as{H7235}{(H8799)} any of theirs. And they drank{H8354}{(H8799)}, and were merry{H7937}{(H8799)} with him."
Genesis,44,1,"And he commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} the steward of his house{H1004}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Fill{H4390}{(H8761)} the men's{H582} sacks{H572} with food{H400}, as much as{H834} they can{H3201}{(H8799)} carry{H5375}{(H8800)}, and put{H7760}{(H8798)} every man's{H376} money{H3701} in his sack's{H572} mouth{H6310}."
Genesis,44,2,"And put{H7760}{(H8799)} my cup{H1375}, the silver{H3701} cup{H1375}, in the sack's{H572} mouth{H6310} of the youngest{H6996}, and his corn{H7668} money{H3701}. And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} according to the word{H1697} that Joseph{H3130} had spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}."
Genesis,44,3,"As soon as the morning{H1242} was light{H215}{(H8804)}, the men{H582} were sent away{H7971}{(H8795)}, they and their asses{H2543}."
Genesis,44,4,"And when they were gone out{H3318}{(H8804)} of the city{H5892}, and not yet far off{H7368}{(H8689)}, Joseph{H3130} said{H559}{(H8804)} unto his steward{H1004}, Up{H6965}{(H8798)}, follow{H7291}{(H8798)} after{H310} the men{H582}; and when thou dost overtake{H5381}{(H8689)} them, say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded{H7999}{(H8765)} evil{H7451} for good{H2896}?"

Genesis,44,7,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Wherefore saith{H1696}{(H8762)} my lord{H113} these words{H1697}? God forbid{H2486} that thy servants{H5650} should do{H6213}{(H8800)} according to this thing{H1697}:"
Genesis,44,8,"Behold, the money{H3701}, which we found{H4672}{(H8804)} in our sacks{H572}' mouths{H6310}, we brought again{H7725}{(H8689)} unto thee out of the land{H776} of Canaan{H3667}: how then should we steal{H1589}{(H8799)} out of thy lord's{H113} house{H1004} silver{H3701} or gold{H2091}?"
Genesis,44,9,"With whomsoever of thy servants{H5650} it be found{H4672}{(H8735)}, both let him die{H4191}{(H8804)}, and we also will be my lord's{H113} bondmen{H5650}."

Genesis,44,11,"Then they speedily{H4116}{(H8762)} took down{H3381}{(H8686)} every man{H376} his sack{H572} to the ground{H776}, and opened{H6605}{(H8799)} every man{H376} his sack{H572}."
Genesis,44,12,"And he searched{H2664}{(H8762)}, and began{H2490}{(H8689)} at the eldest{H1419}, and left{H3615}{(H8765)} at the youngest{H6996}: and the cup{H1375} was found{H4672}{(H8735)} in Benjamin's{H1144} sack{H572}."
Genesis,44,13,"Then they rent{H7167}{(H8799)} their clothes{H8071}, and laded{H6006}{(H8799)} every man{H376} his ass{H2543}, and returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to the city{H5892}."
Genesis,44,14,And Judah{H3063} and his brethren{H251} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Joseph's{H3130} house{H1004}; for he was yet there: and they fell{H5307}{(H8799)} before him{H6440} on the ground{H776}.
Genesis,44,15,"And Joseph{H3130} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, What deed{H4639} is this that ye have done{H6213}{(H8804)}? wot ye{H3045}{(H8804)} not that such a man{H376} as I can certainly{H5172}{(H8763)} divine{H5172}{(H8762)}?"

God{H430} hath found out{H4672}{(H8804)} the iniquity{H5771} of thy servants{H5650}: behold, we are my lord's{H113} servants{H5650}, both we, and he also{H1571} with whom{H834}{H3027} the cup{H1375} is found{H4672}{(H8738)}."
Genesis,44,17,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, God forbid{H2486} that I should do{H6213}{(H8800)} so{H2063}: but the man{H376} in whose hand{H3027} the cup{H1375} is found{H4672}{(H8738)}, he shall be my servant{H5650}; and as for you, get you up{H5927}{(H8798)} in peace{H7965} unto your father{H1}."

Genesis,47,22,"Only the land{H127} of the priests{H3548} bought he{H7069}{(H8804)} not; for the priests{H3548} had a portion{H2706} assigned them of Pharaoh{H6547}, and did eat{H398}{(H8804)} their portion{H2706} which Pharaoh{H6547} gave{H5414}{(H8804)} them: wherefore they sold{H4376}{(H8804)} not their lands{H127}."

Genesis,47,29,"And the time{H3117} drew nigh{H7126}{(H8799)} that Israel{H3478} must die{H4191}{(H8800)}: and he called{H7121}{(H8799)} his son{H1121} Joseph{H3130}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, If now I have found{H4672}{(H8804)} grace{H2580} in thy sight{H5869}, put{H7760}{(H8798)}, I pray thee, thy hand{H3027} under my thigh{H3409}, and deal{H6213}{(H8804)} kindly{H2617} and truly{H571} with me; bury{H6912}{(H8799)} me not, I pray thee, in Egypt{H4714}:"

Genesis,47,31,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Swear{H7650}{(H8734)} unto me. And he sware{H7650}{(H8735)} unto him. And Israel{H3478} bowed{H7812}{(H8691)} himself upon the bed's{H4296} head{H7218}."
Genesis,48,1,"And it came to pass after{H310} these things{H1697}, that one told{H559}{(H8799)} Joseph{H3130}, Behold, thy father{H1} is sick{H2470}{(H8802)}: and he took{H3947}{(H8799)} with him his two{H8147} sons{H1121}, Manasseh{H4519} and Ephraim{H669}."

Exodus,1,17,"But the midwives{H3205}{(H8764)} feared{H3372}{(H8799)} God{H430}, and did{H6213}{(H8804)} not as the king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714} commanded{H1696}{(H8765)} them, but saved{H2421} the men children{H3206} alive{H2421}{(H8762)}."
Exodus,1,18,"And the king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714} called{H7121}{(H8799)} for the midwives{H3205}{(H8764)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Why{H4069} have ye done{H6213}{(H8804)} this thing{H1697}, and have saved{H2421} the men children{H3206} alive{H2421}{(H8762)}?"
Exodus,1,19,"And the midwives{H3205}{(H8764)} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Pharaoh{H6547}, Because the Hebrew{H5680} women{H802} are not as the Egyptian women{H4713}; for they are lively{H2422}, and are delivered{H3205}{(H8804)} ere{H2962} the midwives{H3205}{(H8764)} come in{H935}{(H8799)} unto them."
Exodus,1,20,"Therefore God{H430} dealt well{H3190}{(H8686)} with the midwives{H3205}{(H8764)}: and the people{H5971} multiplied{H7235}{(H8799)}, and waxed very{H3966} mighty{H6105}{(H8799)}."
Exodus,1,21,"And it came to pass, because the midwives{H3205}{(H8764)} feared{H3372}{(H8804)} God{H430}, that he made{H6213}{(H8799)} them houses{H1004}."
Exodus,1,22,"And Pharaoh{H6547} charged{H6680}{(H8762)} all his people{H5971}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Every son{H1121} that is born{H3209} ye shall cast{H7993}{(H8686)} into the river{H2975}, and every daughter{H1323} ye shall save alive{H2421}{(H8762)}."
Exodus,2,1,"And there went{H3212}{(H8799)} a man{H376} of the house{H1004} of Levi{H3878}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} to wife a daughter{H1323} of Levi{H3878}."
Exodus,2,2,"And the woman{H802} conceived{H2029}{(H8799)}, and bare{H3205}{(H8799)} a son{H1121}: and when she saw{H7200}{(H8799)} him that he was a goodly{H2896} child, she hid{H6845}{(H8799)} him three{H7969} months{H3391}."
Exodus,2,3,"And when she could{H3201}{(H8804)} not longer{H5750} hide{H6845}{(H8687)} him, she took{H3947}{(H8799)} for him an ark{H8392} of bulrushes{H1573}, and daubed{H2560}{(H8799)} it with slime{H2564} and with pitch{H2203}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} the child{H3206} therein; and she laid{H7760}{(H8799)} it in the flags{H5488} by the river's{H2975} brink{H8193}."
Exodus,2,4,"And his sister{H269} stood{H3320}{(H8691)} afar off{H7350}, to wit{H3045}{(H8800)} what would be done{H6213}{(H8735)} to him."
Exodus,2,5,"And the daughter{H1323} of Pharaoh{H6547} came down{H3381}{(H8799)} to wash{H7364}{(H8800)} herself at the river{H2975}; and her maidens{H5291} walked{H1980}{(H8802)} along by the river's{H2975} side{H3027}; and when she saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the ark{H8392} among{H8432} the flags{H5488}, she sent{H7971}{(H8799)} her maid{H519} to fetch{H3947}{(H8799)} it."
Exodus,2,6,"And when she had opened{H6605}{(H8799)} it, she saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the child{H3206}: and, behold, the babe{H5288} wept{H1058}{(H8802)}. And she had compassion{H2550}{(H8799)} on him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, This is one of the Hebrews{H5680}' children{H3206}."
Exodus,2,7,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} his sister{H269} to Pharaoh's{H6547} daughter{H1323}, Shall I go{H3212}{(H8799)} and call{H7121}{(H8804)} to thee a nurse{H3243}{(H8688)} of the Hebrew{H5680} women{H802}, that she may nurse{H3243}{(H8686)} the child{H3206} for thee?"
Exodus,2,8,"And Pharaoh's{H6547} daughter{H1323} said{H559}{(H8799)} to her, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}. And the maid{H5959} went{H3212}{(H8799)} and called{H7121}{(H8799)} the child's{H3206} mother{H517}."
Exodus,2,9,"And Pharaoh's{H6547} daughter{H1323} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Take{H3212} this child{H3206} away{H3212}{(H8685)}, and nurse{H3243}{(H8685)} it for me, and I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee thy wages{H7939}. And the woman{H802} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the child{H3206}, and nursed{H5134}{(H8686)} it."
Exodus,2,10,"And the child{H3206} grew{H1431}{(H8799)}, and she brought{H935}{(H8686)} him unto Pharaoh's{H6547} daughter{H1323}, and he became her son{H1121}. And she called{H7121}{(H8799)} his name{H8034} Moses{H4872}: and she said{H559}{(H8799)}, Because I drew{H4871}{(H8804)} him out of the water{H4325}."
Exodus,2,11,"And it came to pass in those days{H3117}, when Moses{H4872} was grown{H1431}{(H8799)}, that he went out{H3318}{(H8799)} unto his brethren{H251}, and looked{H7200}{(H8799)} on their burdens{H5450}: and he spied{H7200}{(H8799)} an Egyptian{H4713}{H376} smiting{H5221}{(H8688)} an Hebrew{H5680}, one of his brethren{H251}."
Exodus,2,12,"And he looked{H6437}{(H8799)} this way{H3541} and that way{H3541}, and when he saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that there was no man{H376}, he slew{H5221}{(H8686)} the Egyptian{H4713}, and hid{H2934}{(H8799)} him in the sand{H2344}."
Exodus,2,13,"And when he went out{H3318}{(H8799)} the second{H8145} day{H3117}, behold, two{H8147} men{H582} of the Hebrews{H5680} strove{H5327}{(H8737)} together: and he said{H559}{(H8799)} to him that did the wrong{H7563}, Wherefore smitest{H5221}{(H8686)} thou thy fellow{H7453}?"
Exodus,2,14,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who made{H7760}{(H8804)} thee{H376} a prince{H8269} and a judge{H8199}{(H8802)} over us? intendest{H559}{(H8802)} thou to kill{H2026}{(H8800)} me, as thou killedst{H2026}{(H8804)} the Egyptian{H4713}? And Moses{H4872} feared{H3372}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Surely{H403} this thing{H1697} is known{H3045}{(H8738)}."
Exodus,2,15,"Now when Pharaoh{H6547} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} this thing{H1697}, he sought{H1245}{(H8762)} to slay{H2026}{(H8800)} Moses{H4872}. But Moses{H4872} fled{H1272}{(H8799)} from the face{H6440} of Pharaoh{H6547}, and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in the land{H776} of Midian{H4080}: and he sat down{H3427}{(H8799)} by a well{H875}."
Exodus,2,16,"Now the priest{H3548} of Midian{H4080} had seven{H7651} daughters{H1323}: and they came{H935}{(H8799)} and drew{H1802}{(H8799)} water, and filled{H4390}{(H8762)} the troughs{H7298} to water{H8248}{(H8687)} their father's{H1} flock{H6629}."
Exodus,2,17,"And the shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)} came{H935}{(H8799)} and drove them away{H1644}{(H8762)}: but Moses{H4872} stood up{H6965}{(H8799)} and helped{H3467}{(H8686)} them, and watered{H8248}{(H8686)} their flock{H6629}."
Exodus,2,18,"And when they came{H935}{(H8799)} to Reuel{H7467} their father{H1}, he said{H559}{(H8799)}, How{H4069} is it that ye are come{H935}{(H8800)} so soon{H4116}{(H8765)} to day{H3117}?"
Exodus,2,19,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, An Egyptian{H4713}{H376} delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} us out of the hand{H3027} of the shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)}, and also drew{H1802}{(H8804)} water enough{H1802}{(H8800)} for us, and watered{H8248}{(H8686)} the flock{H6629}."
Exodus,2,20,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto his daughters{H1323}, And where is he? why is it that ye have left{H5800}{(H8804)} the man{H376}? call{H7121}{(H8798)} him, that he may eat{H398}{(H8799)} bread{H3899}."
Exodus,2,21,And Moses{H4872} was content{H2974}{(H8686)} to dwell{H3427}{(H8800)} with the man{H376}: and he gave{H5414}{(H8799)} Moses{H4872} Zipporah{H6855} his daughter{H1323}.
Exodus,2,22,"And she bare{H3205}{(H8799)} him a son{H1121}, and he called{H7121}{(H8799)} his name{H8034} Gershom{H1647}: for he said{H559}{(H8804)}, I have been a stranger{H1616} in a strange{H5237} land{H776}."
Exodus,2,23,"And it came to pass in process{H1992}{H7227} of time{H3117}, that the king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714} died{H4191}{(H8799)}: and the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} sighed{H584}{(H8735)} by reason of{H4480} the bondage{H5656}, and they cried{H2199}{(H8799)}, and their cry{H7775} came up{H5927}{(H8799)} unto God{H430} by reason of the bondage{H5656}."
Exodus,2,24,"And God{H430} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} their groaning{H5009}, and God{H430} remembered{H2142}{(H8799)} his covenant{H1285} with Abraham{H85}, with Isaac{H3327}, and with Jacob{H3290}."
Exodus,2,25,"And God{H430} looked{H7200}{(H8799)} upon the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, and God{H430} had respect{H3045}{(H8799)} unto them."
Exodus,3,1,"Now Moses{H4872} kept{H1961}{(H8804)}{H7462}{(H8802)} the flock{H6629} of Jethro{H3503} his father in law{H2859}{(H8802)}, the priest{H3548} of Midian{H4080}: and he led{H5090}{(H8799)} the flock{H6629} to the backside{H310} of the desert{H4057}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to the mountain{H2022} of God{H430}, even to Horeb{H2722}."
Exodus,3,2,"And the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} appeared{H7200}{(H8735)} unto him in a flame{H3827} of fire{H784} out of the midst{H8432} of a bush{H5572}: and he looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, behold, the bush{H5572} burned{H1197}{(H8802)} with fire{H784}, and the bush{H5572} was not consumed{H398}{(H8794)}."
Exodus,3,3,"And Moses{H4872} said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will now turn aside{H5493}{(H8799)}, and see{H7200}{(H8799)} this great{H1419} sight{H4758}, why{H4069} the bush{H5572} is not burnt{H1197}{(H8799)}."
Exodus,3,4,"And when the LORD{H3068} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that he turned aside{H5493}{(H8804)} to see{H7200}{(H8800)}, God{H430} called{H7121}{(H8799)} unto him out of the midst{H8432} of the bush{H5572}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Moses{H4872}, Moses{H4872}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Here am I."
Exodus,3,5,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Draw not nigh{H7126}{(H8799)} hither{H1988}: put off{H5394}{(H8798)} thy shoes{H5275} from off thy feet{H7272}, for the place{H4725} whereon{H834} thou standest{H5975}{(H8802)} is holy{H6944} ground{H127}."
Exodus,3,6,"Moreover he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I am the God{H430} of thy father{H1}, the God{H430} of Abraham{H85}, the God{H430} of Isaac{H3327}, and the God{H430} of Jacob{H3290}. And Moses{H4872} hid{H5641}{(H8686)} his face{H6440}; for he was afraid{H3372}{(H8804)} to look{H5027}{(H8687)} upon God{H430}."
Exodus,3,7,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)}, I have surely{H7200}{(H8800)} seen{H7200}{(H8804)} the affliction{H6040} of my people{H5971} which are in Egypt{H4714}, and have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} their cry{H6818} by reason{H6440} of their taskmasters{H5065}{(H8802)}; for I know{H3045}{(H8804)} their sorrows{H4341};"
Exodus,3,8,"And I am come down{H3381}{(H8799)} to deliver{H5337}{(H8687)} them out of the hand{H3027} of the Egyptians{H4714}, and to bring{H5927}{(H8687)} them up out of that land{H776} unto a good{H2896} land{H776} and a large{H7342}, unto a land{H776} flowing{H2100}{(H8802)} with milk{H2461} and honey{H1706}; unto the place{H4725} of the Canaanites{H3669}, and the Hittites{H2850}, and the Amorites{H567}, and the Perizzites{H6522}, and the Hivites{H2340}, and the Jebusites{H2983}."
Exodus,3,9,"Now therefore, behold, the cry{H6818} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} is come{H935}{(H8804)} unto me: and I have also seen{H7200}{(H8804)} the oppression{H3906} wherewith the Egyptians{H4714} oppress{H3905}{(H8801)} them."
Exodus,3,10,"Come{H3212}{(H8798)} now therefore, and I will send{H7971}{(H8799)} thee unto Pharaoh{H6547}, that thou mayest bring forth{H3318}{(H8685)} my people{H5971} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} out of Egypt{H4714}."

Exodus,4,2,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, What is that in thine hand{H3027}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, A rod{H4294}."
Exodus,4,3,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Cast{H7993}{(H8685)} it on the ground{H776}. And he cast{H7993}{(H8686)} it on the ground{H776}, and it became a serpent{H5175}; and Moses{H4872} fled{H5127}{(H8799)} from before{H6440} it."
Exodus,4,4,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Moses{H4872}, Put forth{H7971}{(H8798)} thine hand{H3027}, and take{H270}{(H8798)} it by the tail{H2180}. And he put forth{H7971}{(H8799)} his hand{H3027}, and caught{H2388}{(H8686)} it, and it became a rod{H4294} in his hand{H3709}:"
Exodus,4,5,"That they may believe{H539}{(H8686)} that the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of their fathers{H1}, the God{H430} of Abraham{H85}, the God{H430} of Isaac{H3327}, and the God{H430} of Jacob{H3290}, hath appeared{H7200}{(H8738)} unto thee."

Exodus,8,16,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Moses{H4872}, Say{H559}{(H8798)} unto Aaron{H175}, Stretch out{H5186}{(H8798)} thy rod{H4294}, and smite{H5221}{(H8685)} the dust{H6083} of the land{H776}, that it may become lice{H3654} throughout all the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
Exodus,8,17,"And they did{H6213}{(H8799)} so; for Aaron{H175} stretched out{H5186}{(H8799)} his hand{H3027} with his rod{H4294}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the dust{H6083} of the earth{H776}, and it became lice{H3654} in man{H120}, and in beast{H929}; all the dust{H6083} of the land{H776} became lice{H3654} throughout all the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
Exodus,8,18,"And the magicians{H2748} did{H6213}{(H8799)} so with their enchantments{H3909} to bring forth{H3318}{(H8687)} lice{H3654}, but they could{H3201}{(H8804)} not: so there were lice{H3654} upon man{H120}, and upon beast{H929}."
Exodus,8,19,"Then the magicians{H2748} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Pharaoh{H6547}, This is the finger{H676} of God{H430}: and Pharaoh's{H6547} heart{H3820} was hardened{H2388}{(H8799)}, and he hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not unto them; as the LORD{H3068} had said{H1696}{(H8765)}."
Exodus,8,20,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Moses{H4872}, Rise up early{H7925}{(H8685)} in the morning{H1242}, and stand{H3320}{(H8690)} before{H6440} Pharaoh{H6547}; lo, he cometh forth{H3318}{(H8802)} to the water{H4325}; and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto him, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Let my people{H5971} go{H7971}{(H8761)}, that they may serve{H5647}{(H8799)} me."

Exodus,8,23,And I will put{H7760}{(H8804)} a division{H6304} between my people{H5971} and thy people{H5971}: to morrow{H4279} shall this sign{H226} be.

Exodus,10,7,"And Pharaoh's{H6547} servants{H5650} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, How long shall this man be a snare{H4170} unto us? let the men{H582} go{H7971}{(H8761)}, that they may serve{H5647}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}: knowest{H3045}{(H8799)} thou not yet{H2962} that Egypt{H4714} is destroyed{H6}{(H8804)}?"
Exodus,10,8,"And Moses{H4872} and Aaron{H175} were brought again{H7725}{(H8714)} unto Pharaoh{H6547}: and he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, serve{H5647}{(H8798)} the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}: but who are they that shall go{H1980}{(H8802)}?"

Exodus,10,22,And Moses{H4872} stretched forth{H5186}{(H8799)} his hand{H3027} toward heaven{H8064}; and there was a thick{H653} darkness{H2822} in all the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} three{H7969} days{H3117}:

Exodus,10,24,"And Pharaoh{H6547} called{H7121}{(H8799)} unto Moses{H4872}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} ye, serve{H5647}{(H8798)} the LORD{H3068}; only let your flocks{H6629} and your herds{H1241} be stayed{H3322}{(H8714)}: let your little ones{H2945} also go{H3212}{(H8799)} with you."
Exodus,10,25,"And Moses{H4872} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou must give{H5414}{(H8799)} us{H3027} also sacrifices{H2077} and burnt offerings{H5930}, that we may sacrifice{H6213}{(H8804)} unto the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}."
Exodus,10,26,"Our cattle{H4735} also shall go{H3212}{(H8799)} with us; there shall not an hoof{H6541} be left behind{H7604}{(H8735)}; for thereof must we take{H3947}{(H8799)} to serve{H5647}{(H8800)} the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}; and we know{H3045}{(H8799)} not with what we must serve{H5647}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}, until we come{H935}{(H8800)} thither."
Exodus,10,27,"But the LORD{H3068} hardened{H2388}{(H8762)} Pharaoh's{H6547} heart{H3820}, and he would{H14}{(H8804)} not let them go{H7971}{(H8763)}."

Exodus,16,10,"And it came to pass, as Aaron{H175} spake{H1696}{(H8763)} unto the whole congregation{H5712} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, that they looked{H6437}{(H8799)} toward the wilderness{H4057}, and, behold, the glory{H3519} of the LORD{H3068} appeared{H7200}{(H8738)} in the cloud{H6051}."
Exodus,16,11,"And the LORD{H3068} spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto Moses{H4872}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Exodus,16,12,"I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} the murmurings{H8519} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}: speak{H1696}{(H8761)} unto them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, At even{H996}{H6153} ye shall eat{H398}{(H8799)} flesh{H1320}, and in the morning{H1242} ye shall be filled{H7646}{(H8799)} with bread{H3899}; and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}."
Exodus,16,13,"And it came to pass, that at even{H6153} the quails{H7958} came up{H5927}{(H8799)}, and covered{H3680}{(H8762)} the camp{H4264}: and in the morning{H1242} the dew{H2919} lay{H7902} round about{H5439} the host{H4264}."
Exodus,16,14,"And when the dew{H2919} that lay{H7902} was gone up{H5927}{(H8799)}, behold, upon the face{H6440} of the wilderness{H4057} there lay a small{H1851} round thing{H2636}{(H8794)}, as small{H1851} as the hoar frost{H3713} on the ground{H776}."
Exodus,16,15,"And when the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} it, they said{H559}{(H8799)} one{H376} to another{H251}, It is manna{H4478}: for they wist{H3045}{(H8804)} not what it was. And Moses{H4872} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, This is the bread{H3899} which the LORD{H3068} hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} you to eat{H402}."
Exodus,16,16,"This is the thing{H1697} which{H834} the LORD{H3068} hath commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}, Gather{H3950}{(H8798)} of it every man{H376} according{H6310} to his eating{H400}, an omer{H6016} for every man{H1538}, according to the number{H4557} of your persons{H5315}; take{H3947}{(H8799)} ye every man{H376} for them which are in his tents{H168}."
Exodus,16,17,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} did{H6213}{(H8799)} so, and gathered{H3950}{(H8799)}, some more{H7235}{(H8688)}, some less{H4591}{(H8688)}."
Exodus,16,18,"And when they did mete{H4058}{(H8799)} it with an omer{H6016}, he that gathered much{H7235}{(H8688)} had nothing over{H5736}{(H8689)}, and he that gathered little{H4591}{(H8688)} had no lack{H2637}{(H8689)}; they gathered{H3950}{(H8804)} every man{H376} according{H6310} to his eating{H400}."
Exodus,16,19,"And Moses{H4872} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let no man{H376} leave{H3498}{(H8686)} of it till the morning{H1242}."
Exodus,16,20,"Notwithstanding they hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not unto Moses{H4872}; but some{H582} of them left{H3498}{(H8686)} of it until the morning{H1242}, and it bred{H7311}{(H8799)} worms{H8438}, and stank{H887}{(H8799)}: and Moses{H4872} was wroth{H7107}{(H8799)} with them."
Exodus,16,21,"And they gathered{H3950}{(H8799)} it every morning{H1242}, every man{H376} according{H6310} to his eating{H400}: and when the sun{H8121} waxed hot{H2552}{(H8804)}, it melted{H4549}{(H8738)}."
Exodus,16,22,"And it came to pass, that on the sixth{H8345} day{H3117} they gathered{H3950}{(H8804)} twice{H4932} as much bread{H3899}, two{H8147} omers{H6016} for one{H259} man: and all the rulers{H5387} of the congregation{H5712} came{H935}{(H8799)} and told{H5046}{(H8686)} Moses{H4872}."
Exodus,16,23,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, This is that which the LORD{H3068} hath said{H1696}{(H8765)}, To morrow{H4279} is the rest{H7677} of the holy{H6944} sabbath{H7676} unto the LORD{H3068}: bake{H644}{(H8798)} that which ye will bake{H644}{(H8799)} to day, and seethe{H1310}{(H8761)} that ye will seethe{H1310}{(H8762)}; and that which{H3605} remaineth over{H5736}{(H8802)} lay up{H3240}{(H8685)} for you to be kept{H4931} until the morning{H1242}."
Exodus,16,24,"And they laid it up{H3240}{(H8686)} till the morning{H1242}, as Moses{H4872} bade{H6680}{(H8765)}: and it did not stink{H887}{(H8689)}, neither was there any worm{H7415} therein."
Exodus,16,25,"And Moses{H4872} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Eat{H398}{(H8798)} that to day{H3117}; for to day{H3117} is a sabbath{H7676} unto the LORD{H3068}: to day{H3117} ye shall not find{H4672}{(H8799)} it in the field{H7704}."
Exodus,16,26,"Six{H8337} days{H3117} ye shall gather{H3950}{(H8799)} it; but on the seventh{H7637} day{H3117}, which is the sabbath{H7676}, in it there shall be none."
Exodus,16,27,"And it came to pass, that there went out{H3318}{(H8804)} some of the people{H5971} on the seventh{H7637} day{H3117} for to gather{H3950}{(H8800)}, and they found{H4672}{(H8804)} none."
Exodus,16,28,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Moses{H4872}, How long refuse{H3985}{(H8765)} ye to keep{H8104}{(H8800)} my commandments{H4687} and my laws{H8451}?"
Exodus,16,29,"See{H7200}{(H8798)}, for that the LORD{H3068} hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} you the sabbath{H7676}, therefore he giveth{H5414}{(H8802)} you on the sixth{H8345} day{H3117} the bread{H3899} of two days{H3117}; abide{H3427}{(H8798)} ye every man{H376} in his place, let no man{H376} go out{H3318}{(H8799)} of his place{H4725} on the seventh{H7637} day{H3117}."
Exodus,16,30,So the people{H5971} rested{H7673}{(H8799)} on the seventh{H7637} day{H3117}.
Exodus,16,31,"And the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} called{H7121}{(H8799)} the name{H8034} thereof Manna{H4478}: and it was like coriander{H1407} seed{H2233}, white{H3836}; and the taste{H2940} of it was like wafers{H6838} made with honey{H1706}."
Exodus,16,32,"And Moses{H4872} said{H559}{(H8799)}, This is the thing{H1697} which the LORD{H3068} commandeth{H6680}{(H8765)}, Fill{H4393} an omer{H6016} of it to be kept{H4931} for your generations{H1755}; that they may see{H7200}{(H8799)} the bread{H3899} wherewith I have fed{H398}{(H8689)} you in the wilderness{H4057}, when I brought you forth{H3318}{(H8687)} from the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
Exodus,16,33,"And Moses{H4872} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Aaron{H175}, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} a{H259} pot{H6803}, and put{H5414}{(H8798)} an omer{H6016} full{H4393} of manna{H4478} therein, and lay it up{H3240}{(H8685)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, to be kept{H4931} for your generations{H1755}."
Exodus,16,34,"As the LORD{H3068} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} Moses{H4872}, so Aaron{H175} laid it up{H3240}{(H8686)} before{H6440} the Testimony{H5715}, to be kept{H4931}."
Exodus,16,35,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} did eat{H398}{(H8804)} manna{H4478} forty{H705} years{H8141}, until they came{H935}{(H8800)} to a land{H776} inhabited{H3427}{(H8737)}; they did eat{H398}{(H8804)} manna{H4478}, until they came{H935}{(H8800)} unto the borders{H7097} of the land{H776} of Canaan{H3667}."
Exodus,16,36,Now an omer{H6016} is the tenth{H6224} part of an ephah{H374}.
Exodus,17,1,"And all the congregation{H5712} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} journeyed{H5265}{(H8799)} from the wilderness{H4057} of Sin{H5512}, after their journeys{H4550}, according to the commandment{H6310} of the LORD{H3068}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} in Rephidim{H7508}: and there was no water{H4325} for the people{H5971} to drink{H8354}{(H8800)}."
Exodus,17,2,"Wherefore the people{H5971} did chide{H7378}{(H8799)} with Moses{H4872}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} us water{H4325} that we may drink{H8354}{(H8799)}. And Moses{H4872} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Why chide{H7378}{(H8799)} ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt{H5254}{(H8762)} the LORD{H3068}?"
Exodus,17,3,"And the people{H5971} thirsted{H6770}{(H8799)} there for water{H4325}; and the people{H5971} murmured{H3885}{(H8686)} against Moses{H4872}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought{H5927}{(H8689)} us up out of Egypt{H4714}, to kill{H4191}{(H8687)} us and our children{H1121} and our cattle{H4735} with thirst{H6772}?"
Exodus,17,4,"And Moses{H4872} cried{H6817}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, What shall I do{H6213}{(H8799)} unto this people{H5971}? they be almost{H4592} ready to stone{H5619}{(H8804)} me."
Exodus,17,5,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Moses{H4872}, Go on{H5674}{(H8798)} before{H6440} the people{H5971}, and take{H3947}{(H8798)} with thee of the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478}; and thy rod{H4294}, wherewith thou smotest{H5221}{(H8689)} the river{H2975}, take{H3947}{(H8798)} in thine hand{H3027}, and go{H1980}{(H8804)}."
Exodus,17,6,"Behold, I will stand{H5975}{(H8802)} before{H6440} thee there upon the rock{H6697} in Horeb{H2722}; and thou shalt smite{H5221}{(H8689)} the rock{H6697}, and there shall come{H3318}{(H8804)} water{H4325} out of it, that the people{H5971} may drink{H8354}{(H8804)}. And Moses{H4872} did{H6213}{(H8799)} so in the sight{H5869} of the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478}."
Exodus,17,7,"And he called{H7121}{(H8799)} the name{H8034} of the place{H4725} Massah{H4532}, and Meribah{H4809}, because of the chiding{H7379} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, and because they tempted{H5254}{(H8763)} the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Is{H3426} the LORD{H3068} among{H7130} us, or not?"
Exodus,17,8,"Then came{H935}{(H8799)} Amalek{H6002}, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} with Israel{H3478} in Rephidim{H7508}."
Exodus,17,9,"And Moses{H4872} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Joshua{H3091}, Choose us out{H977}{(H8798)} men{H582}, and go out{H3318}{(H8798)}, fight{H3898}{(H8734)} with Amalek{H6002}: to morrow{H4279} I will stand{H5324}{(H8737)} on the top{H7218} of the hill{H1389} with the rod{H4294} of God{H430} in mine hand{H3027}."
Exodus,17,10,"So Joshua{H3091} did{H6213}{(H8799)} as Moses{H4872} had said{H559}{(H8804)} to him, and fought{H3898}{(H8736)} with Amalek{H6002}: and Moses{H4872}, Aaron{H175}, and Hur{H2354} went up{H5927}{(H8804)} to the top{H7218} of the hill{H1389}."
Exodus,17,11,"And it came to pass, when Moses{H4872} held up{H7311}{(H8686)} his hand{H3027}, that Israel{H3478} prevailed{H1396}{(H8804)}: and when he let down{H5117}{(H8686)} his hand{H3027}, Amalek{H6002} prevailed{H1396}{(H8804)}."
Exodus,17,12,"But Moses{H4872}' hands{H3027} were heavy{H3515}; and they took{H3947}{(H8799)} a stone{H68}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} it under him, and he sat{H3427}{(H8799)} thereon; and Aaron{H175} and Hur{H2354} stayed up{H8551}{(H8804)} his hands{H3027}, the one on the one side{H259}, and the other on the other side{H259}; and his hands{H3027} were steady{H530} until the going down{H935}{(H8800)} of the sun{H8121}."
Exodus,17,13,And Joshua{H3091} discomfited{H2522}{(H8799)} Amalek{H6002} and his people{H5971} with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}.
Exodus,17,14,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Moses{H4872}, Write{H3789}{(H8798)} this for a memorial{H2146} in a book{H5612}, and rehearse{H7760}{(H8798)} it in the ears{H241} of Joshua{H3091}: for I will utterly{H4229}{(H8800)} put out{H4229}{(H8799)} the remembrance{H2143} of Amalek{H6002} from under heaven{H8064}."
Exodus,17,15,"And Moses{H4872} built{H1129}{(H8799)} an altar{H4196}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} the name{H8034} of it Jehovahnissi{H3071}:"
Exodus,17,16,"For he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Because the LORD{H3050} hath sworn{H3027}{H3676} that the LORD{H3068} will have war{H4421} with Amalek{H6002} from generation{H1755} to generation{H1755}."
Exodus,18,1,"When Jethro{H3503}, the priest{H3548} of Midian{H4080}, Moses{H4872}' father in law{H2859}{(H8802)}, heard{H8085}{(H8799)} of all that God{H430} had done{H6213}{(H8804)} for Moses{H4872}, and for Israel{H3478} his people{H5971}, and that the LORD{H3068} had brought{H3318}{(H8689)} Israel{H3478} out of Egypt{H4714};"
Exodus,18,2,"Then Jethro{H3503}, Moses{H4872}' father in law{H2859}{(H8802)}, took{H3947}{(H8799)} Zipporah{H6855}, Moses{H4872}' wife{H802}, after{H310} he had sent her back{H7964},"
Exodus,18,3,"And her two{H8147} sons{H1121}; of which the name{H8034} of the one{H259} was Gershom{H1647}; for he said{H559}{(H8804)}, I have been an alien{H1616} in a strange{H5237} land{H776}:"
Exodus,18,4,"And the name{H8034} of the other{H259} was Eliezer{H461}; for the God{H430} of my father{H1}, said he, was mine help{H5828}, and delivered{H5337}{(H8686)} me from the sword{H2719} of Pharaoh{H6547}:"
Exodus,18,5,"And Jethro{H3503}, Moses{H4872}' father in law{H2859}{(H8802)}, came{H935}{(H8799)} with his sons{H1121} and his wife{H802} unto Moses{H4872} into the wilderness{H4057}, where he encamped{H2583}{(H8802)} at the mount{H2022} of God{H430}:"
Exodus,18,6,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Moses{H4872}, I thy father in law{H2859}{(H8802)} Jethro{H3503} am come{H935}{(H8802)} unto thee, and thy wife{H802}, and her two{H8147} sons{H1121} with her."
Exodus,18,7,"And Moses{H4872} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} his father in law{H2859}{(H8802)}, and did obeisance{H7812}{(H8691)}, and kissed{H5401}{(H8799)} him; and they asked{H7592}{(H8799)} each{H376} other{H7453} of their welfare{H7965}; and they came{H935}{(H8799)} into the tent{H168}."
Exodus,18,8,"And Moses{H4872} told{H5608}{(H8762)} his father in law{H2859}{(H8802)} all that the LORD{H3068} had done{H6213}{(H8804)} unto Pharaoh{H6547} and to the Egyptians{H4714} for Israel's{H3478} sake{H182}, and all the travail{H8513} that had come{H4672}{(H8804)} upon them by the way{H1870}, and how the LORD{H3068} delivered{H5337}{(H8686)} them."
Exodus,18,9,"And Jethro{H3503} rejoiced{H2302}{(H8799)} for all the goodness{H2896} which the LORD{H3068} had done{H6213}{(H8804)} to Israel{H3478}, whom he had delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} out of the hand{H3027} of the Egyptians{H4714}."
Exodus,18,10,"And Jethro{H3503} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be the LORD{H3068}, who hath delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} you out of the hand{H3027} of the Egyptians{H4714}, and out of the hand{H3027} of Pharaoh{H6547}, who hath delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} the people{H5971} from under the hand{H3027} of the Egyptians{H4714}."
Exodus,18,11,Now I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that the LORD{H3068} is greater{H1419} than all gods{H430}: for in the thing{H1697} wherein they dealt proudly{H2102}{(H8804)} he was above them.
Exodus,18,12,"And Jethro{H3503}, Moses{H4872}' father in law{H2859}{(H8802)}, took{H3947}{(H8799)} a burnt offering{H5930} and sacrifices{H2077} for God{H430}: and Aaron{H175} came{H935}{(H8799)}, and all the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478}, to eat{H398}{(H8800)} bread{H3899} with Moses{H4872}' father in law{H2859}{(H8802)} before{H6440} God{H430}."
Exodus,18,13,"And it came to pass on the morrow{H4283}, that Moses{H4872} sat{H3427}{(H8799)} to judge{H8199}{(H8800)} the people{H5971}: and the people{H5971} stood{H5975}{(H8799)} by Moses{H4872} from the morning{H1242} unto the evening{H6153}."
Exodus,18,14,"And when Moses{H4872}' father in law{H2859}{(H8802)} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} all that he did{H6213}{(H8802)} to the people{H5971}, he said{H559}{(H8799)}, What is this thing{H1697} that thou doest{H6213}{(H8802)} to the people{H5971}? why sittest{H3427}{(H8802)} thou thyself alone, and all the people{H5971} stand{H5324}{(H8737)} by thee from morning{H1242} unto even{H6153}?"

Leviticus,25,26,"And if the man{H376} have none to redeem{H1350}{(H8802)} it, and himself{H3027} be able{H1767}{H5381}{(H8689)} to redeem{H4672}{(H8804)}{H1353} it;"
Leviticus,25,27,"Then let him count{H2803}{(H8765)} the years{H8141} of the sale{H4465} thereof, and restore{H7725}{(H8689)} the overplus{H5736}{(H8802)} unto the man{H376} to whom he sold{H4376}{(H8804)} it; that he may return{H7725}{(H8804)} unto his possession{H272}."
Leviticus,25,28,"But if he{H3027} be not able{H1767} to restore{H4672}{(H8804)}{H7725}{(H8687)} it to him, then that which is sold{H4465} shall remain in the hand{H3027} of him that hath bought{H7069}{(H8802)} it until the year{H8141} of jubile{H3104}: and in the jubile{H3104} it shall go out{H3318}{(H8804)}, and he shall return{H7725}{(H8804)} unto his possession{H272}."
Leviticus,25,29,"And if a man{H376} sell{H4376}{(H8799)} a dwelling{H4186} house{H1004} in a walled{H2346} city{H5892}, then he may redeem{H1353} it within a whole{H8552}{(H8800)} year{H8141} after it is sold{H4465}; within a full year{H3117} may he redeem{H1353} it."
Leviticus,25,30,"And if it be not redeemed{H1350}{(H8735)} within the space{H4390}{(H8800)} of a full{H8549} year{H8141}, then the house{H1004} that is in the walled{H2346} city{H5892} shall be established{H6965}{(H8804)} for ever{H6783} to him that bought{H7069}{(H8802)} it throughout his generations{H1755}: it shall not go out{H3318}{(H8799)} in the jubile{H3104}."
Leviticus,25,31,"But the houses{H1004} of the villages{H2691} which have no wall{H2346} round about{H5439} them shall be counted{H2803}{(H8735)} as the fields{H7704} of the country{H776}: they may be redeemed{H1353}, and they shall go out{H3318}{(H8799)} in the jubile{H3104}."
Leviticus,25,32,"Notwithstanding the cities{H5892} of the Levites{H3881}, and the houses{H1004} of the cities{H5892} of their possession{H272}, may the Levites{H3881} redeem{H1353} at any time{H5769}."
Leviticus,25,33,"And if a man purchase{H1350}{(H8799)} of the Levites{H3881}, then the house{H1004} that was sold{H4465}, and the city{H5892} of his possession{H272}, shall go out{H3318}{(H8804)} in the year of jubile{H3104}: for the houses{H1004} of the cities{H5892} of the Levites{H3881} are their possession{H272} among{H8432} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}."
Leviticus,25,34,But the field{H7704} of the suburbs{H4054} of their cities{H5892} may not be sold{H4376}{(H8735)}; for it is their perpetual{H5769} possession{H272}.
Leviticus,25,35,"And if thy brother{H251} be waxen poor{H4134}{(H8799)}, and fallen in decay{H4131}{(H8804)} with thee{H3027}; then thou shalt relieve{H2388}{(H8689)} him: yea, though he be a stranger{H1616}, or a sojourner{H8453}; that he may live{H2416} with thee."
Leviticus,25,36,"Take{H3947}{(H8799)} thou no usury{H5392} of him, or increase{H8636}: but fear{H3372}{(H8804)} thy God{H430}; that thy brother{H251} may live{H2416} with thee."
Leviticus,25,37,"Thou shalt not give{H5414}{(H8799)} him thy money{H3701} upon usury{H5392}, nor lend{H5414}{(H8799)} him thy victuals{H400} for increase{H4768}."
Leviticus,25,38,"I am the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, which brought you forth{H3318}{(H8689)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, to give{H5414}{(H8800)} you the land{H776} of Canaan{H3667}, and to be your God{H430}."
Leviticus,25,39,"And if thy brother{H251} that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor{H4134}{(H8799)}, and be sold{H4376}{(H8738)} unto thee; thou shalt not compel{H5647}{(H8799)} him to serve{H5656} as a bondservant{H5650}:"
Leviticus,25,40,"But as an hired servant{H7916}, and as a sojourner{H8453}, he shall be with thee, and shall serve{H5647}{(H8799)} thee unto the year{H8141} of jubile{H3104}:"
Leviticus,25,41,"And then shall he depart{H3318}{(H8804)} from thee, both he and his children{H1121} with him, and shall return{H7725}{(H8804)} unto his own family{H4940}, and unto the possession{H272} of his fathers{H1} shall he return{H7725}{(H8799)}."
Leviticus,25,42,"For they are my servants{H5650}, which I brought forth{H3318}{(H8689)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}: they shall not be sold{H4376}{(H8735)} as{H4466} bondmen{H5650}."
Leviticus,25,43,Thou shalt not rule{H7287}{(H8799)} over him with rigour{H6531}; but shalt fear{H3372}{(H8804)} thy God{H430}.
Leviticus,25,44,"Both thy bondmen{H5650}, and thy bondmaids{H519}, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen{H1471} that are round about{H5439} you; of them shall ye buy{H7069}{(H8799)} bondmen{H5650} and bondmaids{H519}."
Leviticus,25,45,"Moreover of the children{H1121} of the strangers{H8453} that do sojourn{H1481}{(H8802)} among you, of them shall ye buy{H7069}{(H8799)}, and of their families{H4940} that are with you, which they begat{H3205}{(H8689)} in your land{H776}: and they shall be your possession{H272}."
Leviticus,25,46,"And ye shall take them as an inheritance{H5157}{(H8694)} for your children{H1121} after{H310} you, to inherit{H3423}{(H8800)} them for a possession{H272}; they shall be your bondmen{H5647}{(H8799)} for ever{H5769}: but over your brethren{H251} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, ye shall not rule{H7287}{(H8799)} one{H376} over another{H251} with rigour{H6531}."
Leviticus,25,47,"And if a sojourner{H1616} or stranger{H8453} wax rich{H5381}{(H8686)} by thee{H3027}, and thy brother{H251} that dwelleth by him wax poor{H4134}{(H8802)}, and sell{H4376}{(H8738)} himself unto the stranger{H1616} or sojourner{H8453} by thee, or to the stock{H6133} of the stranger's{H1616} family{H4940}:"
Leviticus,25,48,After{H310} that he is sold{H4376}{(H8738)} he may be redeemed again{H1353}; one{H259} of his brethren{H251} may redeem{H1350}{(H8799)} him:
Leviticus,25,49,"Either his uncle{H1730}, or his uncle's{H1730} son{H1121}, may redeem{H1350}{(H8799)} him, or any that is nigh{H7607} of kin{H1320} unto him of his family{H4940} may redeem{H1350}{(H8799)} him; or if he be able{H5381}{(H8689)}, he may redeem{H1350}{(H8738)} himself{H3027}."
Leviticus,25,50,"And he shall reckon{H2803}{(H8765)} with him that bought{H7069}{(H8802)} him from the year{H8141} that he was sold{H4376}{(H8736)} to him unto the year{H8141} of jubile{H3104}: and the price{H3701} of his sale{H4465} shall be according unto the number{H4557} of years{H8141}, according to the time{H3117} of an hired servant{H7916} shall it be with him."
Leviticus,25,51,"If there be yet many{H7227} years{H8141} behind, according{H6310} unto them he shall give again{H7725}{(H8686)} the price of his redemption{H1353} out of the money{H3701} that he was bought{H4736} for."
Leviticus,25,52,"And if there remain{H7604}{(H8738)} but few{H4592} years{H8141} unto the year{H8141} of jubile{H3104}, then he shall count{H2803}{(H8765)} with him, and according{H6310} unto his years{H8141} shall he give him again{H7725}{(H8686)} the price of his redemption{H1353}."
Leviticus,25,53,And as a yearly{H8141}{H8141} hired servant{H7916} shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule{H7287}{(H8799)} with rigour{H6531} over him in thy sight{H5869}.
Leviticus,25,54,"And if he be not redeemed{H1350}{(H8735)} in these years, then he shall go out{H3318}{(H8804)} in the year{H8141} of jubile{H3104}, both he, and his children{H1121} with him."
Leviticus,25,55,For unto me the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} are servants{H5650}; they are my servants{H5650} whom I brought forth{H3318}{(H8689)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}: I am the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}.
Leviticus,26,1,"Ye shall make{H6213}{(H8799)} you no idols{H457} nor graven image{H6459}, neither rear you up{H6965}{(H8686)} a standing image{H4676}, neither shall ye set up{H5414}{(H8799)} any image{H4906} of stone{H68} in your land{H776}, to bow down{H7812}{(H8692)} unto it: for I am the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}."
Leviticus,26,2,"Ye shall keep{H8104}{(H8799)} my sabbaths{H7676}, and reverence{H3372}{(H8799)} my sanctuary{H4720}: I am the LORD{H3068}."
Leviticus,26,3,"If ye walk{H3212}{(H8799)} in my statutes{H2708}, and keep{H8104}{(H8799)} my commandments{H4687}, and do{H6213}{(H8804)} them;"
Leviticus,26,4,"Then I will give{H5414}{(H8804)} you rain{H1653} in due season{H6256}, and the land{H776} shall yield{H5414}{(H8804)} her increase{H2981}, and the trees{H6086} of the field{H7704} shall yield{H5414}{(H8799)} their fruit{H6529}."
Leviticus,26,5,"And your threshing{H1786} shall reach{H5381}{(H8689)} unto the vintage{H1210}, and the vintage{H1210} shall reach{H5381}{(H8686)} unto the sowing time{H2233}: and ye shall eat{H398}{(H8804)} your bread{H3899} to the full{H7648}, and dwell{H3427}{(H8804)} in your land{H776} safely{H983}."
Leviticus,26,6,"And I will give{H5414}{(H8804)} peace{H7965} in the land{H776}, and ye shall lie down{H7901}{(H8804)}, and none shall make you afraid{H2729}{(H8688)}: and I will rid{H7673}{(H8689)} evil{H7451} beasts{H2416} out of the land{H776}, neither shall the sword{H2719} go{H5674}{(H8799)} through your land{H776}."
Leviticus,26,7,"And ye shall chase{H7291}{(H8804)} your enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, and they shall fall{H5307}{(H8804)} before{H6440} you by the sword{H2719}."
Leviticus,26,8,"And five{H2568} of you shall chase{H7291}{(H8804)} an hundred{H3967}, and an hundred{H3967} of you shall put ten thousand{H7233} to flight{H7291}{(H8799)}: and your enemies{H341}{(H8802)} shall fall{H5307}{(H8804)} before{H6440} you by the sword{H2719}."
Leviticus,26,9,"For I will have respect{H6437}{(H8804)} unto you, and make you fruitful{H6509}{(H8689)}, and multiply{H7235}{(H8689)} you, and establish{H6965}{(H8689)} my covenant{H1285} with you."
Leviticus,26,10,"And ye shall eat{H398}{(H8804)} old store{H3462}{(H8737)}, and bring forth{H3318}{(H8686)} the old{H3465} because{H6440} of the new{H2319}."
Leviticus,26,11,And I will set{H5414}{(H8804)} my tabernacle{H4908} among{H8432} you: and my soul{H5315} shall not abhor{H1602}{(H8799)} you.
Leviticus,26,12,"And I will walk{H1980}{(H8694)} among{H8432} you, and will be{H1961}{(H8799)} your God{H430}, and ye shall be{H1961}{(H8799)} my people{H5971}."
Leviticus,26,13,"I am the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, which brought you forth{H3318}{(H8689)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, that ye should not be their bondmen{H5650}; and I have broken{H7665}{(H8799)} the bands{H4133} of your yoke{H5923}, and made you go{H3212}{(H8686)} upright{H6968}."
Leviticus,26,14,"But if ye will not hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} unto me, and will not do{H6213}{(H8799)} all these commandments{H4687};"
Leviticus,26,15,"And if ye shall despise{H3988}{(H8799)} my statutes{H2708}, or if your soul{H5315} abhor{H1602}{(H8799)} my judgments{H4941}, so that ye will not do{H6213}{(H8800)} all my commandments{H4687}, but that ye break{H6565}{(H8687)} my covenant{H1285}:"
Leviticus,26,16,"I also will do{H6213}{(H8799)} this unto you; I will even appoint{H6485}{(H8689)} over you terror{H928}, consumption{H7829}, and the burning ague{H6920}, that shall consume{H3615}{(H8764)} the eyes{H5869}, and cause sorrow{H1727}{(H8688)} of heart{H5315}: and ye shall sow{H2232}{(H8804)} your seed{H2233} in vain{H7385}, for your enemies{H341}{(H8802)} shall eat{H398}{(H8804)} it."
Leviticus,26,17,"And I will set{H5414}{(H8804)} my face{H6440} against you, and ye shall be slain{H5062}{(H8738)} before{H6440} your enemies{H341}{(H8802)}: they that hate{H8130}{(H8802)} you shall reign{H7287}{(H8804)} over you; and ye shall flee{H5127}{(H8804)} when none pursueth{H7291}{(H8802)} you."
Leviticus,26,18,"And if ye will not yet{H5704} for all this hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} unto me, then I will punish{H3256}{(H8763)} you seven times{H7651} more{H3254}{(H8804)} for your sins{H2403}."
Leviticus,26,19,"And I will break{H7665}{(H8804)} the pride{H1347} of your power{H5797}; and I will make{H5414}{(H8804)} your heaven{H8064} as iron{H1270}, and your earth{H776} as brass{H5154}:"
Leviticus,26,20,"And your strength{H3581} shall be spent{H8552}{(H8804)} in vain{H7385}: for your land{H776} shall not yield{H5414}{(H8799)} her increase{H2981}, neither shall the trees{H6086} of the land{H776} yield{H5414}{(H8799)} their fruits{H6529}."
Leviticus,26,21,"And if ye walk{H3212}{(H8799)} contrary{H7147} unto me, and will{H14}{(H8799)} not hearken{H8085}{(H8800)} unto me; I will bring{H3254} seven times{H7651} more{H3254}{(H8804)} plagues{H4347} upon you according to your sins{H2403}."
Leviticus,26,22,"I will also send{H7971}{(H8689)} wild{H7704} beasts{H2416} among you, which shall rob you of your children{H7921}{(H8765)}, and destroy{H3772}{(H8689)} your cattle{H929}, and make you few in number{H4591}{(H8689)}; and your high ways{H1870} shall be desolate{H8074}{(H8738)}."
Leviticus,26,23,"And if ye will not be reformed{H3256}{(H8735)} by me by these things, but will walk{H1980}{(H8804)} contrary{H7147} unto me;"
Leviticus,26,24,"Then will I also walk{H1980}{(H8804)} contrary{H7147} unto you, and will punish{H5221}{(H8689)} you yet{H1571} seven times{H7651} for your sins{H2403}."
Leviticus,26,25,"And I will bring{H935}{(H8689)} a sword{H2719} upon you, that shall avenge{H5358}{(H8802)} the quarrel{H5359} of my covenant{H1285}: and when ye are gathered together{H622}{(H8738)} within{H413} your cities{H5892}, I will send{H7971}{(H8765)} the pestilence{H1698} among{H8432} you; and ye shall be delivered{H5414}{(H8738)} into the hand{H3027} of the enemy{H341}{(H8802)}."
Leviticus,26,26,"And when I have broken{H7665}{(H8800)} the staff{H4294} of your bread{H3899}, ten{H6235} women{H802} shall bake{H644}{(H8804)} your bread{H3899} in one{H259} oven{H8574}, and they shall deliver{H7725} you your bread{H3899} again{H7725}{(H8689)} by weight{H4948}: and ye shall eat{H398}{(H8804)}, and not be satisfied{H7646}{(H8799)}."
Leviticus,26,27,"And if ye will not for all this{H2063} hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} unto me, but walk{H1980}{(H8804)} contrary{H7147} unto me;"
Leviticus,26,28,"Then I will walk{H1980}{(H8804)} contrary{H7147} unto you also in fury{H2534}; and I, even{H637} I, will chastise{H3256}{(H8765)} you seven times{H7651} for your sins{H2403}."
Leviticus,26,29,"And ye shall eat{H398}{(H8804)} the flesh{H1320} of your sons{H1121}, and the flesh{H1320} of your daughters{H1323} shall ye eat{H398}{(H8799)}."
Leviticus,26,30,"And I will destroy{H8045}{(H8689)} your high places{H1116}, and cut down{H3772}{(H8689)} your images{H2553}, and cast{H5414}{(H8804)} your carcases{H6297} upon the carcases{H6297} of your idols{H1544}, and my soul{H5315} shall abhor{H1602}{(H8804)} you."
Leviticus,26,31,"And I will make{H5414}{(H8804)} your cities{H5892} waste{H2723}, and bring{H8074} your sanctuaries{H4720} unto desolation{H8074}{(H8689)}, and I will not smell{H7306}{(H8686)} the savour{H7381} of your sweet odours{H5207}."
Leviticus,26,32,And I will bring{H8074} the land{H776} into desolation{H8074}{(H8689)}: and your enemies{H341}{(H8802)} which dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} therein shall be astonished{H8074}{(H8804)} at it.
Leviticus,26,33,"And I will scatter{H2219}{(H8762)} you among the heathen{H1471}, and will draw out{H7324}{(H8689)} a sword{H2719} after{H310} you: and your land{H776} shall be desolate{H8077}, and your cities{H5892} waste{H2723}."
Leviticus,26,34,"Then shall the land{H776} enjoy{H7521}{(H8799)} her sabbaths{H7676}, as long{H3117} as it lieth desolate{H8074}{(H8715)}, and ye be in your enemies{H341}{(H8802)}' land{H776}; even then shall the land{H776} rest{H7673}{(H8799)}, and enjoy{H7521}{(H8689)} her sabbaths{H7676}."
Leviticus,26,35,"As long as{H3117} it lieth desolate{H8074}{(H8715)} it shall rest{H7673}{(H8799)}; because it did not rest{H7673}{(H8804)} in your sabbaths{H7676}, when ye dwelt{H3427}{(H8800)} upon it."
Leviticus,26,36,"And upon them that are left{H7604}{(H8737)} alive of you I will send{H935}{(H8689)} a faintness{H4816} into their hearts{H3824} in the lands{H776} of their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}; and the sound{H6963} of a shaken{H5086}{(H8737)} leaf{H5929} shall chase{H7291}{(H8804)} them; and they shall flee{H5127}{(H8804)}, as fleeing{H4499} from a sword{H2719}; and they shall fall{H5307}{(H8804)} when none pursueth{H7291}{(H8802)}."
Leviticus,26,37,"And they shall fall{H3782}{(H8804)} one{H376} upon another{H251}, as it were before{H6440} a sword{H2719}, when none pursueth{H7291}{(H8802)}: and ye shall have no power to stand{H8617} before{H6440} your enemies{H341}{(H8802)}."
Leviticus,26,38,"And ye shall perish{H6}{(H8804)} among the heathen{H1471}, and the land{H776} of your enemies{H341}{(H8802)} shall eat you up{H398}{(H8804)}."
Leviticus,26,39,And they that are left{H7604}{(H8737)} of you shall pine away{H4743}{(H8735)} in their iniquity{H5771} in your enemies{H341}{(H8802)}' lands{H776}; and also in the iniquities{H5771} of their fathers{H1} shall they pine away{H4743}{(H8735)} with them.
Leviticus,26,40,"If they shall confess{H3034}{(H8694)} their iniquity{H5771}, and the iniquity{H5771} of their fathers{H1}, with their trespass{H4604} which they trespassed{H4603}{(H8804)} against me, and that also they have walked{H1980}{(H8804)} contrary{H7147} unto me;"

Numbers,11,12,"Have I conceived{H2029}{(H8804)} all this people{H5971}? have I begotten{H3205}{(H8804)} them, that thou shouldest say{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Carry{H5375}{(H8798)} them in thy bosom{H2436}, as a nursing father{H539}{(H8802)} beareth{H5375}{(H8799)} the sucking child{H3243}{(H8802)}, unto the land{H127} which thou swarest{H7650}{(H8738)} unto their fathers{H1}?"
Numbers,11,13,"Whence{H370} should I have flesh{H1320} to give{H5414}{(H8800)} unto all this people{H5971}? for they weep{H1058}{(H8799)} unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} us flesh{H1320}, that we may eat{H398}{(H8799)}."
Numbers,11,14,"I am not able{H3201}{(H8799)} to bear{H5375}{(H8800)} all this people{H5971} alone{H905}, because it is too heavy{H3515} for me."
Numbers,11,15,"And if thou deal{H6213}{(H8802)} thus with me, kill{H2026}{(H8798)} me, I pray thee, out of hand{H2026}{(H8800)}, if I have found{H4672}{(H8804)} favour{H2580} in thy sight{H5869}; and let me not see{H7200}{(H8799)} my wretchedness{H7451}."
Numbers,11,16,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Moses{H4872}, Gather{H622}{(H8798)} unto me seventy{H7657} men{H376} of the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478}, whom thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} to be the elders{H2205} of the people{H5971}, and officers{H7860}{(H8802)} over them; and bring{H3947}{(H8804)} them unto the tabernacle{H168} of the congregation{H4150}, that they may stand{H3320}{(H8694)} there with thee."
Numbers,11,17,"And I will come down{H3381}{(H8804)} and talk{H1696}{(H8765)} with thee there: and I will take{H680}{(H8804)} of the spirit{H7307} which is upon thee, and will put{H7760}{(H8804)} it upon them; and they shall bear{H5375}{(H8804)} the burden{H4853} of the people{H5971} with thee, that thou bear{H5375}{(H8799)} it not thyself alone."
Numbers,11,18,"And say{H559}{(H8799)} thou unto the people{H5971}, Sanctify{H6942}{(H8690)} yourselves against to morrow{H4279}, and ye shall eat{H398}{(H8804)} flesh{H1320}: for ye have wept{H1058}{(H8804)} in the ears{H241} of the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Who shall give us flesh{H1320} to eat{H398}{(H8686)}? for it was well{H2895}{(H8804)} with us in Egypt{H4714}: therefore the LORD{H3068} will give{H5414}{(H8804)} you flesh{H1320}, and ye shall eat{H398}{(H8804)}."

Numbers,11,21,"And Moses{H4872} said{H559}{(H8799)}, The people{H5971}, among{H7130} whom I am, are six{H8337} hundred{H3967} thousand{H505} footmen{H7273}; and thou hast said{H559}{(H8804)}, I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} them flesh{H1320}, that they may eat{H398}{(H8804)} a whole{H3117} month{H2320}."
Numbers,11,22,"Shall the flocks{H6629} and the herds{H1241} be slain{H7819}{(H8735)} for them, to suffice{H4672}{(H8804)} them? or shall all the fish{H1709} of the sea{H3220} be gathered together{H622}{(H8735)} for them, to suffice{H4672}{(H8804)} them?"
Numbers,11,23,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Moses{H4872}, Is the LORD'S{H3068} hand{H3027} waxed short{H7114}{(H8799)}? thou shalt see{H7200}{(H8799)} now whether my word{H1697} shall come to pass{H7136}{(H8799)} unto thee or not."
Numbers,11,24,"And Moses{H4872} went out{H3318}{(H8799)}, and told{H1696}{(H8762)} the people{H5971} the words{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, and gathered{H622}{(H8799)} the seventy{H7657} men{H376} of the elders{H2205} of the people{H5971}, and set{H5975}{(H8686)} them round about{H5439} the tabernacle{H168}."
Numbers,11,25,"And the LORD{H3068} came down{H3381}{(H8799)} in a cloud{H6051}, and spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto him, and took{H680}{(H8686)} of the spirit{H7307} that was upon him, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} it unto the seventy{H7657} elders{H2205}{H376}: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit{H7307} rested{H5117}{(H8800)} upon them, they prophesied{H5012}{(H8691)}, and did not cease{H3254}{(H8804)}."
Numbers,11,26,"But there remained{H7604}{(H8735)} two{H8147} of the men{H582} in the camp{H4264}, the name{H8034} of the one{H259} was Eldad{H419}, and the name{H8034} of the other{H8145} Medad{H4312}: and the spirit{H7307} rested{H5117}{(H8799)} upon them; and they were of them that were written{H3789}{(H8803)}, but went not out{H3318}{(H8804)} unto the tabernacle{H168}: and they prophesied{H5012}{(H8691)} in the camp{H4264}."
Numbers,11,27,"And there ran{H7323}{(H8799)} a young man{H5288}, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} Moses{H4872}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Eldad{H419} and Medad{H4312} do prophesy{H5012}{(H8693)} in the camp{H4264}."
Numbers,11,28,"And Joshua{H3091} the son{H1121} of Nun{H5126}, the servant{H8334}{(H8764)} of Moses{H4872}, one of his young men{H979}, answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, My lord{H113} Moses{H4872}, forbid{H3607}{(H8798)} them."
Numbers,11,29,"And Moses{H4872} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Enviest{H7065}{(H8764)} thou for my sake? would God that all the{H5414}{(H8799)} LORD'S{H3068} people{H5971} were prophets{H5030}, and that the LORD{H3068} would put{H5414}{(H8799)} his spirit{H7307} upon them!"
Numbers,11,30,"And Moses{H4872} gat{H622}{(H8735)} him into the camp{H4264}, he and the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478}."
Numbers,11,31,"And there went forth{H5265}{(H8804)} a wind{H7307} from the LORD{H3068}, and brought{H1468}{(H8799)} quails{H7958} from the sea{H3220}, and let them fall{H5203}{(H8799)} by the camp{H4264}, as it were a day's{H3117} journey{H1870} on this side{H3541}, and as it were a day's{H3117} journey{H1870} on the other side{H3541}, round about{H5439} the camp{H4264}, and as it were two cubits{H520} high upon the face{H6440} of the earth{H776}."
Numbers,11,32,"And the people{H5971} stood up{H6965}{(H8799)} all that day{H3117}, and all that night{H3915}, and all the next{H4283} day{H3117}, and they gathered{H622}{(H8799)} the quails{H7958}: he that gathered least{H4591}{(H8688)} gathered{H622}{(H8804)} ten{H6235} homers{H2563}: and they spread{H7849}{(H8799)} them all abroad{H7849}{(H8800)} for themselves round about{H5439} the camp{H4264}."
Numbers,11,33,"And while the flesh{H1320} was yet{H2962} between their teeth{H8127}, ere it was chewed{H3772}{(H8735)}, the wrath{H639} of the LORD{H3068} was kindled{H2734}{(H8804)} against the people{H5971}, and the LORD{H3068} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the people{H5971} with a very{H3966} great{H7227} plague{H4347}."
Numbers,11,34,And he called{H7121}{(H8799)} the name{H8034} of that place{H4725} Kibrothhattaavah{H6914}: because there they buried{H6912}{(H8804)} the people{H5971} that lusted{H183}{(H8693)}.
Numbers,11,35,And the people{H5971} journeyed{H5265}{(H8804)} from Kibrothhattaavah{H6914} unto Hazeroth{H2698}; and abode at Hazeroth{H2698}.
Numbers,12,1,And Miriam{H4813} and Aaron{H175} spake{H1696}{(H8762)} against Moses{H4872} because of{H182} the Ethiopian{H3571} woman{H802} whom he had married{H3947}{(H8804)}: for he had married{H3947}{(H8804)} an Ethiopian{H3571} woman{H802}.
Numbers,12,2,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Hath the LORD{H3068} indeed spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} only by Moses{H4872}? hath he not spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} also by us? And the LORD{H3068} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} it."
Numbers,12,3,"(Now the man{H376} Moses{H4872} was very{H3966} meek{H6035}{(H8675)}{H6035}, above all the men{H120} which were upon the face{H6440} of the earth{H127}.)"
Numbers,12,4,"And the LORD{H3068} spake{H559}{(H8799)} suddenly{H6597} unto Moses{H4872}, and unto Aaron{H175}, and unto Miriam{H4813}, Come out{H3318}{(H8798)} ye three{H7969} unto the tabernacle{H168} of the congregation{H4150}. And they three{H7969} came out{H3318}{(H8799)}."
Numbers,12,5,"And the LORD{H3068} came down{H3381}{(H8799)} in the pillar{H5982} of the cloud{H6051}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} in the door{H6607} of the tabernacle{H168}, and called{H7121}{(H8799)} Aaron{H175} and Miriam{H4813}: and they both{H8147} came forth{H3318}{(H8799)}."
Numbers,12,6,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} now my words{H1697}: If there be a prophet{H5030} among you, I the LORD{H3068} will make myself known{H3045}{(H8691)} unto him in a vision{H4759}, and will speak{H1696}{(H8762)} unto him in a dream{H2472}."
Numbers,12,7,"My servant{H5650} Moses{H4872} is not so, who is faithful{H539}{(H8737)} in all mine house{H1004}."
Numbers,12,8,"With him will I speak{H1696}{(H8762)} mouth{H6310} to mouth{H6310}, even apparently{H4758}, and not in dark speeches{H2420}; and the similitude{H8544} of the LORD{H3068} shall he behold{H5027}{(H8686)}: wherefore then were ye not afraid{H3372}{(H8804)} to speak{H1696}{(H8763)} against my servant{H5650} Moses{H4872}?"
Numbers,12,9,And the anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} was kindled{H2734}{(H8799)} against them; and he departed{H3212}{(H8799)}.
Numbers,12,10,"And the cloud{H6051} departed{H5493}{(H8804)} from off the tabernacle{H168}; and, behold, Miriam{H4813} became leprous{H6879}{(H8794)}, white as snow{H7950}: and Aaron{H175} looked{H6437}{(H8799)} upon Miriam{H4813}, and, behold, she was leprous{H6879}{(H8794)}."
Numbers,12,11,"And Aaron{H175} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Moses{H4872}, Alas{H994}, my lord{H113}, I beseech thee, lay{H7896}{(H8799)} not the sin{H2403} upon us, wherein we have done foolishly{H2973}{(H8738)}, and wherein we have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}."

Numbers,13,24,"The place{H4725} was called{H7121}{(H8804)} the brook{H5158} Eshcol{H812}, because of{H182} the cluster of grapes{H811} which the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} cut down{H3772}{(H8804)} from thence."
Numbers,13,25,And they returned{H7725}{(H8799)} from searching{H8446}{(H8800)} of the land{H776} after{H7093} forty{H705} days{H3117}.
Numbers,13,26,"And they went{H3212}{(H8799)} and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Moses{H4872}, and to Aaron{H175}, and to all the congregation{H5712} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, unto the wilderness{H4057} of Paran{H6290}, to Kadesh{H6946}; and brought back{H7725}{(H8686)} word{H1697} unto them, and unto all the congregation{H5712}, and shewed{H7200}{(H8686)} them the fruit{H6529} of the land{H776}."
Numbers,13,27,"And they told{H5608}{(H8762)} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, We came{H935}{(H8804)} unto the land{H776} whither thou sentest{H7971}{(H8804)} us, and surely it floweth{H2100}{(H8802)} with milk{H2461} and honey{H1706}; and this is the fruit{H6529} of it."
Numbers,13,28,"Nevertheless{H657} the people{H5971} be strong{H5794} that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} in the land{H776}, and the cities{H5892} are walled{H1219}{(H8803)}, and very{H3966} great{H1419}: and moreover we saw{H7200}{(H8804)} the children{H3211} of Anak{H6061} there."
Numbers,13,29,"The Amalekites{H6002} dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} in the land{H776} of the south{H5045}: and the Hittites{H2850}, and the Jebusites{H2983}, and the Amorites{H567}, dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} in the mountains{H2022}: and the Canaanites{H3669} dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} by the sea{H3220}, and by the coast{H3027} of Jordan{H3383}."
Numbers,13,30,"And Caleb{H3612} stilled{H2013}{(H8686)} the people{H5971} before Moses{H4872}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let us go up{H5927}{(H8799)} at once{H5927}{(H8800)}, and possess{H3423}{(H8804)} it; for we are well able{H3201}{(H8799)} to overcome{H3201}{(H8800)} it."
Numbers,13,31,"But the men{H582} that went up{H5927}{(H8804)} with him said{H559}{(H8804)}, We be not able{H3201}{(H8799)} to go up{H5927}{(H8800)} against the people{H5971}; for they are stronger{H2389} than we."
Numbers,13,32,"And they brought up{H3318}{(H8686)} an evil report{H1681} of the land{H776} which they had searched{H8446}{(H8804)} unto the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The land{H776}, through which we have gone{H5674}{(H8804)} to search{H8446}{(H8800)} it, is a land{H776} that eateth up{H398}{(H8802)} the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} thereof; and all the people{H5971} that we saw{H7200}{(H8804)} in it{H8432} are men{H582} of a great stature{H4060}."
Numbers,13,33,"And there we saw{H7200}{(H8804)} the giants{H5303}, the sons{H1121} of Anak{H6061}, which come of the giants{H5303}: and we were in our own sight{H5869} as grasshoppers{H2284}, and so we were in their sight{H5869}."
Numbers,14,1,"And all the congregation{H5712} lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} their voice{H6963}, and cried{H5414}{(H8799)}; and the people{H5971} wept{H1058}{(H8799)} that night{H3915}."
Numbers,14,2,"And all the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} murmured{H3885}{(H8735)} against Moses{H4872} and against Aaron{H175}: and the whole congregation{H5712} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Would God{H3863} that we had died{H4191}{(H8804)} in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}! or would God{H3863} we had died{H4191}{(H8804)} in this wilderness{H4057}!"
Numbers,14,3,"And wherefore hath the LORD{H3068} brought{H935}{(H8688)} us unto this land{H776}, to fall{H5307}{(H8800)} by the sword{H2719}, that our wives{H802} and our children{H2945} should be a prey{H957}? were it not better{H2896} for us to return{H7725}{(H8800)} into Egypt{H4714}?"
Numbers,14,4,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} one{H376} to another{H251}, Let us make{H5414}{(H8799)} a captain{H7218}, and let us return{H7725}{(H8799)} into Egypt{H4714}."
Numbers,14,5,Then Moses{H4872} and Aaron{H175} fell{H5307}{(H8799)} on their faces{H6440} before{H6440} all the assembly{H6951} of the congregation{H5712} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}.
Numbers,14,6,"And Joshua{H3091} the son{H1121} of Nun{H5126}, and Caleb{H3612} the son{H1121} of Jephunneh{H3312}, which were of them that searched{H8446}{(H8802)} the land{H776}, rent{H7167}{(H8804)} their clothes{H899}:"
Numbers,14,7,"And they spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto all the company{H5712} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The land{H776}, which we passed{H5674}{(H8804)} through to search{H8446}{(H8800)} it, is an exceeding{H3966}{H3966} good{H2896} land{H776}."
Numbers,14,8,"If the LORD{H3068} delight{H2654}{(H8804)} in us, then he will bring{H935}{(H8689)} us into this land{H776}, and give{H5414}{(H8804)} it us; a land{H776} which floweth{H2100}{(H8802)} with milk{H2461} and honey{H1706}."
Numbers,14,9,"Only rebel{H4775}{(H8799)} not ye against the LORD{H3068}, neither fear{H3372}{(H8799)} ye the people{H5971} of the land{H776}; for they are bread{H3899} for us: their defence{H6738} is departed{H5493}{(H8804)} from them, and the LORD{H3068} is with us: fear{H3372}{(H8799)} them not."
Numbers,14,10,But all the congregation{H5712} bade{H559}{(H8799)} stone{H7275}{(H8800)} them with stones{H68}. And the glory{H3519} of the LORD{H3068} appeared{H7200}{(H8738)} in the tabernacle{H168} of the congregation{H4150} before all the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}.
Numbers,14,11,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Moses{H4872}, How long will this people{H5971} provoke{H5006}{(H8762)} me? and how long will it be ere{H3808} they believe{H539}{(H8686)} me, for all the signs{H226} which I have shewed{H6213}{(H8804)} among{H7130} them?"
Numbers,14,12,"I will smite{H5221}{(H8686)} them with the pestilence{H1698}, and disinherit{H3423}{(H8686)} them, and will make{H6213}{(H8799)} of thee a greater{H1419} nation{H1471} and mightier{H6099} than they."
Numbers,14,13,"And Moses{H4872} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}, Then the Egyptians{H4714} shall hear{H8085}{(H8804)} it,(for thou broughtest up{H5927}{(H8689)} this people{H5971} in thy might{H3581} from among{H7130} them;)"
Numbers,14,14,"And they will tell{H559}{(H8804)} it to the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of this land{H776}: for they have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} that thou LORD{H3068} art among{H7130} this people{H5971}, that thou LORD{H3068} art seen{H7200}{(H8738)} face{H5869} to face{H5869}, and that thy cloud{H6051} standeth{H5975}{(H8802)} over them, and that thou goest{H1980}{(H8802)} before{H6440} them, by day time{H3119} in a pillar{H5982} of a cloud{H6051}, and in a pillar{H5982} of fire{H784} by night{H3915}."
Numbers,14,15,"Now if thou shalt kill{H4191}{(H8689)} all this people{H5971} as one{H259} man{H376}, then the nations{H1471} which have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} the fame{H8088} of thee will speak{H559}{(H8804)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Numbers,14,16,"Because the LORD{H3068} was not{H1115} able{H3201}{(H8800)} to bring{H935}{(H8687)} this people{H5971} into the land{H776} which he sware{H7650}{(H8738)} unto them, therefore he hath slain{H7819}{(H8799)} them in the wilderness{H4057}."
Numbers,14,17,"And now, I beseech thee, let the power{H3581} of my Lord{H136} be great{H1431}{(H8799)}, according{H834} as thou hast spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"

Numbers,20,17,"Let us pass{H5674}{(H8799)}, I pray thee, through thy country{H776}: we will not pass{H5674}{(H8799)} through the fields{H7704}, or through the vineyards{H3754}, neither will we drink{H8354}{(H8799)} of the water{H4325} of the wells{H875}: we will go{H3212}{(H8799)} by the king's{H4428} high way{H1870}, we will not turn{H5186}{(H8799)} to the right hand{H3225} nor to the left{H8040}, until we have passed{H5674}{(H8799)} thy borders{H1366}."

Numbers,21,5,"And the people{H5971} spake{H1696}{(H8762)} against God{H430}, and against Moses{H4872}, Wherefore have ye brought us up{H5927}{(H8689)} out of Egypt{H4714} to die{H4191}{(H8800)} in the wilderness{H4057}? for there is no bread{H3899}, neither is there any water{H4325}; and our soul{H5315} loatheth{H6973}{(H8804)} this light{H7052} bread{H3899}."
Numbers,21,6,"And the LORD{H3068} sent{H7971}{(H8762)} fiery{H8314} serpents{H5175} among the people{H5971}, and they bit{H5391}{(H8762)} the people{H5971}; and much{H7227} people{H5971} of Israel{H3478} died{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Numbers,21,7,"Therefore the people{H5971} came{H935}{(H8799)} to Moses{H4872}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, We have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}, for we have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} against the LORD{H3068}, and against thee; pray{H6419}{(H8690)} unto the LORD{H3068}, that he take away{H5493}{(H8686)} the serpents{H5175} from us. And Moses{H4872} prayed{H6419}{(H8691)} for the people{H5971}."
Numbers,21,8,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Moses{H4872}, Make{H6213}{(H8798)} thee a fiery serpent{H8314}, and set{H7760}{(H8798)} it upon a pole{H5251}: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten{H5391}{(H8803)}, when he looketh{H7200}{(H8804)} upon it, shall live{H2425}{(H8804)}."
Numbers,21,9,"And Moses{H4872} made{H6213}{(H8799)} a serpent{H5175} of brass{H5178}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} it upon a pole{H5251}, and it came to pass, that if a serpent{H5175} had bitten{H5391}{(H8804)} any man{H376}, when he beheld{H5027}{(H8689)} the serpent{H5175} of brass{H5178}, he lived{H2425}{(H8804)}."
Numbers,21,10,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} set forward{H5265}{(H8799)}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} in Oboth{H88}."
Numbers,21,11,"And they journeyed{H5265}{(H8799)} from Oboth{H88}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} at Ijeabarim{H5863}, in the wilderness{H4057} which is before{H6440} Moab{H4124}, toward the sunrising{H4217}{H8121}."
Numbers,21,12,"From thence they removed{H5265}{(H8804)}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} in the valley{H5158} of Zared{H2218}."
Numbers,21,13,"From thence they removed{H5265}{(H8804)}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} on the other side{H5676} of Arnon{H769}, which is in the wilderness{H4057} that cometh out{H3318}{(H8802)} of the coasts{H1366} of the Amorites{H567}: for Arnon{H769} is the border{H1366} of Moab{H4124}, between Moab{H4124} and the Amorites{H567}."
Numbers,21,14,"Wherefore it is said{H559}{(H8735)} in the book{H5612} of the wars{H4421} of the LORD{H3068}, What he did{H2052} in the Red sea{H5492}, and in the brooks{H5158} of Arnon{H769},"
Numbers,21,15,"And at the stream{H793} of the brooks{H5158} that goeth down{H5186}{(H8804)} to the dwelling{H3427}{(H8800)} of Ar{H6144}, and lieth{H8172}{(H8738)} upon the border{H1366} of Moab{H4124}."
Numbers,21,16,"And from thence they went to Beer{H876}: that is the well{H875} whereof the LORD{H3068} spake{H559}{(H8804)} unto Moses{H4872}, Gather{H622} the people{H5971} together{H622}{(H8798)}, and I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} them water{H4325}."
Numbers,21,17,"Then Israel{H3478} sang{H7891}{(H8799)} this song{H7892}, Spring up{H5927}{(H8798)}, O well{H875}; sing{H6030}{(H8798)} ye unto it:"
Numbers,21,18,"The princes{H8269} digged{H2658}{(H8804)} the well{H875}, the nobles{H5081} of the people{H5971} digged{H3738}{(H8804)} it, by the direction of the lawgiver{H2710}{(H8781)}, with their staves{H4938}. And from the wilderness{H4057} they went to Mattanah{H4980}:"
Numbers,21,19,And from Mattanah{H4980} to Nahaliel{H5160}: and from Nahaliel{H5160} to Bamoth{H1120}:
Numbers,21,20,"And from Bamoth{H1120} in the valley{H1516}, that is in the country{H7704} of Moab{H4124}, to the top{H7218} of Pisgah{H6449}, which looketh{H8259}{(H8738)} toward{H6440} Jeshimon{H3452}."
Numbers,21,21,"And Israel{H3478} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} unto Sihon{H5511} king{H4428} of the Amorites{H567}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Numbers,21,22,"Let me pass{H5674}{(H8799)} through thy land{H776}: we will not turn{H5186}{(H8799)} into the fields{H7704}, or into the vineyards{H3754}; we will not drink{H8354}{(H8799)} of the waters{H4325} of the well{H875}: but we will go along{H3212}{(H8799)} by the king's{H4428} high way{H1870}, until we be past{H5674}{(H8799)} thy borders{H1366}."
Numbers,21,23,"And Sihon{H5511} would not suffer{H5414}{(H8804)} Israel{H3478} to pass{H5674}{(H8800)} through his border{H1366}: but Sihon{H5511} gathered{H622} all his people{H5971} together{H622}{(H8799)}, and went out{H3318}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} Israel{H3478} into the wilderness{H4057}: and he came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jahaz{H3096}, and fought{H3898}{(H8735)} against Israel{H3478}."
Numbers,21,24,"And Israel{H3478} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} him with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}, and possessed{H3423}{(H8799)} his land{H776} from Arnon{H769} unto Jabbok{H2999}, even unto the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}: for the border{H1366} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} was strong{H5794}."
Numbers,21,25,"And Israel{H3478} took{H3947}{(H8799)} all these cities{H5892}: and Israel{H3478} dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in all the cities{H5892} of the Amorites{H567}, in Heshbon{H2809}, and in all the villages{H1323} thereof."
Numbers,21,26,"For Heshbon{H2809} was the city{H5892} of Sihon{H5511} the king{H4428} of the Amorites{H567}, who had fought{H3898}{(H8738)} against the former{H7223} king{H4428} of Moab{H4124}, and taken{H3947}{(H8799)} all his land{H776} out of his hand{H3027}, even unto Arnon{H769}."
Numbers,21,27,"Wherefore they that speak in proverbs{H4911}{(H8802)} say{H559}{(H8799)}, Come{H935}{(H8798)} into Heshbon{H2809}, let the city{H5892} of Sihon{H5511} be built{H1129}{(H8735)} and prepared{H3559}{(H8709)}:"
Numbers,21,28,"For there is a fire{H784} gone out{H3318}{(H8804)} of Heshbon{H2809}, a flame{H3852} from the city{H7151} of Sihon{H5511}: it hath consumed{H398}{(H8804)} Ar{H6144} of Moab{H4124}, and the lords of the high places{H1181} of Arnon{H769}."
Numbers,21,29,"Woe{H188} to thee, Moab{H4124}! thou art undone{H6}{(H8804)}, O people{H5971} of Chemosh{H3645}: he hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} his sons{H1121} that escaped{H6412}, and his daughters{H1323}, into captivity{H7622} unto Sihon{H5511} king{H4428} of the Amorites{H567}."
Numbers,21,30,"We have shot{H3384}{(H8799)} at them; Heshbon{H2809} is perished{H6}{(H8804)} even unto Dibon{H1769}, and we have laid them waste{H8074}{(H8686)} even unto Nophah{H5302}, which reacheth unto Medeba{H4311}."
Numbers,21,31,Thus Israel{H3478} dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in the land{H776} of the Amorites{H567}.
Numbers,21,32,"And Moses{H4872} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to spy out{H7270}{(H8763)} Jaazer{H3270}, and they took{H3920}{(H8799)} the villages{H1323} thereof, and drove out{H3423}{(H8686)}{(H8675)}{H3423}{(H8799)} the Amorites{H567} that were there."
Numbers,21,33,"And they turned{H6437}{(H8799)} and went up{H5927}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870} of Bashan{H1316}: and Og{H5747} the king{H4428} of Bashan{H1316} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} them, he, and all his people{H5971}, to the battle{H4421} at Edrei{H154}."
Numbers,21,34,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Moses{H4872}, Fear{H3372}{(H8799)} him not: for I have delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} him into thy hand{H3027}, and all his people{H5971}, and his land{H776}; and thou shalt do{H6213}{(H8804)} to him as thou didst{H6213}{(H8804)} unto Sihon{H5511} king{H4428} of the Amorites{H567}, which dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} at Heshbon{H2809}."
Numbers,21,35,"So they smote{H5221}{(H8686)} him, and his sons{H1121}, and all his people{H5971}, until there was none{H1115} left{H7604}{(H8689)} him alive{H8300}: and they possessed{H3423}{(H8799)} his land{H776}."
Numbers,22,1,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} set forward{H5265}{(H8799)}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} in the plains{H6160} of Moab{H4124} on this side{H5676} Jordan{H3383} by Jericho{H3405}."
Numbers,22,2,And Balak{H1111} the son{H1121} of Zippor{H6834} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} all that Israel{H3478} had done{H6213}{(H8804)} to the Amorites{H567}.
Numbers,22,3,"And Moab{H4124} was sore{H3966} afraid{H1481}{(H8799)} of{H6440} the people{H5971}, because they were many{H7227}: and Moab{H4124} was distressed{H6973}{(H8799)} because of{H6440} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}."
Numbers,22,4,"And Moab{H4124} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the elders{H2205} of Midian{H4080}, Now shall this company{H6951} lick up{H3897}{(H8762)} all that are round about{H5439} us, as the ox{H7794} licketh up{H3897}{(H8800)} the grass{H3418} of the field{H7704}. And Balak{H1111} the son{H1121} of Zippor{H6834} was king{H4428} of the Moabites{H4124} at that time{H6256}."
Numbers,22,5,"He sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} therefore unto Balaam{H1109} the son{H1121} of Beor{H1160} to Pethor{H6604}, which is by the river{H5104} of the land{H776} of the children{H1121} of his people{H5971}, to call{H7121}{(H8800)} him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold, there is a people{H5971} come out{H3318}{(H8804)} from Egypt{H4714}: behold, they cover{H3680}{(H8765)} the face{H5869} of the earth{H776}, and they abide{H3427}{(H8802)} over against{H4136} me:"
Numbers,22,6,"Come{H3212}{(H8798)} now therefore, I pray thee, curse{H779}{(H8798)} me this people{H5971}; for they are too mighty{H6099} for me: peradventure I shall prevail{H3201}{(H8799)}, that we may smite{H5221}{(H8686)} them, and that I may drive them out{H1644}{(H8762)} of the land{H776}: for I wot{H3045}{(H8804)} that he whom thou blessest{H1288}{(H8762)} is blessed{H1288}{(H8794)}, and he whom thou cursest{H779}{(H8799)} is cursed{H779}{(H8714)}."
Numbers,22,7,"And the elders{H2205} of Moab{H4124} and the elders{H2205} of Midian{H4080} departed{H3212}{(H8799)} with the rewards of divination{H7081} in their hand{H3027}; and they came{H935}{(H8799)} unto Balaam{H1109}, and spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto him the words{H1697} of Balak{H1111}."
Numbers,22,8,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Lodge{H3885}{(H8798)} here this night{H3915}, and I will bring{H7725} you word{H1697} again{H7725}{(H8689)}, as the LORD{H3068} shall speak{H1696}{(H8762)} unto me: and the princes{H8269} of Moab{H4124} abode{H3427}{(H8799)} with Balaam{H1109}."
Numbers,22,9,"And God{H430} came{H935}{(H8799)} unto Balaam{H1109}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, What men{H582} are these with thee?"
Numbers,22,10,"And Balaam{H1109} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto God{H430}, Balak{H1111} the son{H1121} of Zippor{H6834}, king{H4428} of Moab{H4124}, hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} unto me, saying,"
Numbers,22,11,"Behold, there is a people{H5971} come out{H3318}{(H8802)} of Egypt{H4714}, which covereth{H3680}{(H8762)} the face{H5869} of the earth{H776}: come{H3212}{(H8798)} now, curse{H6895}{(H8798)} me them; peradventure I shall be able{H3201}{(H8799)} to overcome{H3898}{(H8736)} them, and drive them out{H1644}{(H8765)}."
Numbers,22,12,"And God{H430} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Balaam{H1109}, Thou shalt not go{H3212}{(H8799)} with them; thou shalt not curse{H779}{(H8799)} the people{H5971}: for they are blessed{H1288}{(H8803)}."
Numbers,22,13,"And Balaam{H1109} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} in the morning{H1242}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the princes{H8269} of Balak{H1111}, Get{H3212}{(H8798)} you into your land{H776}: for the LORD{H3068} refuseth{H3985}{(H8765)} to give me leave{H5414}{(H8800)} to go{H1980}{(H8800)} with you."
Numbers,22,14,"And the princes{H8269} of Moab{H4124} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)}, and they went{H935}{(H8799)} unto Balak{H1111}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Balaam{H1109} refuseth{H3985}{(H8765)} to come{H1980}{(H8800)} with us."
Numbers,22,15,"And Balak{H1111} sent{H7971}{(H8800)} yet again{H3254}{(H8686)} princes{H8269}, more{H7227}, and more honourable{H3513}{(H8737)} than they."
Numbers,22,16,"And they came{H935}{(H8799)} to Balaam{H1109}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} to him, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} Balak{H1111} the son{H1121} of Zippor{H6834}, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder{H4513}{(H8735)} thee from coming{H1980}{(H8800)} unto me:"
Numbers,22,17,"For I will promote{H3513} thee unto very{H3966} great{H3513}{(H8763)} honour{H3513}{(H8762)}, and I will do{H6213}{(H8799)} whatsoever thou sayest{H559}{(H8799)} unto me: come{H3212}{(H8798)} therefore, I pray thee, curse{H6895}{(H8798)} me this people{H5971}."

Numbers,22,19,"Now therefore, I pray you, tarry{H3427}{(H8798)} ye also here this night{H3915}, that I may know{H3045}{(H8799)} what the LORD{H3068} will say{H1696}{(H8763)} unto me more{H3254}{(H8686)}."
Numbers,22,20,"And God{H430} came{H935}{(H8799)} unto Balaam{H1109} at night{H3915}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, If the men{H582} come{H935}{(H8804)} to call{H7121}{(H8800)} thee, rise up{H6965}{(H8798)}, and go{H3212}{(H8798)} with them; but yet{H389} the word{H1697} which I shall say{H1696}{(H8762)} unto thee, that shalt thou do{H6213}{(H8799)}."

Numbers,22,22,"And God's{H430} anger{H639} was kindled{H2734}{(H8799)} because he went{H1980}{(H8802)}: and the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} stood{H3320}{(H8691)} in the way{H1870} for an adversary{H7854} against him. Now he was riding{H7392}{(H8802)} upon his ass{H860}, and his two{H8147} servants{H5288} were with him."
Numbers,22,23,"And the ass{H860} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} standing{H5324}{(H8737)} in the way{H1870}, and his sword{H2719} drawn{H8025}{(H8803)} in his hand{H3027}: and the ass{H860} turned aside{H5186}{(H8799)} out of the way{H1870}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} into the field{H7704}: and Balaam{H1109} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the ass{H860}, to turn{H5186}{(H8687)} her into the way{H1870}."

Numbers,22,27,"And when the ass{H860} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068}, she fell down{H7257}{(H8799)} under Balaam{H1109}: and Balaam's{H1109} anger{H639} was kindled{H2734}{(H8799)}, and he smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the ass{H860} with a staff{H4731}."
Numbers,22,28,"And the LORD{H3068} opened{H6605}{(H8799)} the mouth{H6310} of the ass{H860}, and she said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Balaam{H1109}, What have I done{H6213}{(H8804)} unto thee, that thou hast smitten{H5221}{(H8689)} me these three{H7969} times{H7272}?"
Numbers,22,29,"And Balaam{H1109} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the ass{H860}, Because thou hast mocked{H5953}{(H8694)} me: I would{H3863} there were{H3426} a sword{H2719} in mine hand{H3027}, for now would I kill{H2026}{(H8804)} thee."
Numbers,22,30,"And the ass{H860} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Balaam{H1109}, Am not I thine ass{H860}, upon which thou hast ridden{H7392}{(H8804)} ever since I was thine unto this day{H3117}? was I ever{H5532}{(H8687)} wont{H5532}{(H8689)} to do so{H6213}{(H8800)} unto thee? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Nay."
Numbers,22,31,"Then the LORD{H3068} opened{H1540}{(H8762)} the eyes{H5869} of Balaam{H1109}, and he saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} standing{H5324}{(H8737)} in the way{H1870}, and his sword{H2719} drawn{H8025}{(H8803)} in his hand{H3027}: and he bowed down{H6915}{(H8799)} his head, and fell flat{H7812}{(H8691)} on his face{H639}."
Numbers,22,32,"And the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten{H5221}{(H8689)} thine ass{H860} these three{H7969} times{H7272}? behold, I went out{H3318}{(H8804)} to withstand{H7854} thee, because thy way{H1870} is perverse{H3399}{(H8804)} before me:"
Numbers,22,33,"And the ass{H860} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} me, and turned{H5186}{(H8799)} from me{H6440} these three{H7969} times{H7272}: unless{H194} she had turned{H5186}{(H8804)} from me{H6440}, surely now also I had slain{H2026}{(H8804)} thee, and saved her alive{H2421}{(H8689)}."
Numbers,22,34,"And Balaam{H1109} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068}, I have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}; for I knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not that thou stoodest{H5324}{(H8737)} in the way{H1870} against{H7125}{(H8800)} me: now therefore, if it displease thee{H7489}{(H8804)}{H5869}, I will get me back again{H7725}{(H8799)}."
Numbers,22,35,"And the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Balaam{H1109}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} with the men{H582}: but only{H657} the word{H1697} that I shall speak{H1696}{(H8762)} unto thee, that thou shalt speak{H1696}{(H8762)}.

Numbers,22,36,"And when Balak{H1111} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that Balaam{H1109} was come{H935}{(H8802)}, he went out{H3318}{(H8799)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} him unto a city{H5892} of Moab{H4124}, which is in the border{H1366} of Arnon{H769}, which is in the utmost{H7097} coast{H1366}."
Numbers,22,37,"And Balak{H1111} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Balaam{H1109}, Did I not earnestly{H7971}{(H8800)} send{H7971}{(H8804)} unto thee to call{H7121}{(H8800)} thee? wherefore camest{H1980}{(H8804)} thou not unto me? am I not able{H3201}{(H8799)} indeed{H552} to promote thee to honour{H3513}{(H8763)}?"
Numbers,22,38,"And Balaam{H1109} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Balak{H1111}, Lo, I am come{H935}{(H8804)} unto thee: have I now any power{H3201}{(H8799)} at all{H3201}{(H8800)} to say{H1696}{(H8763)} any thing{H3972}? the word{H1697} that God{H430} putteth{H7760}{(H8799)} in my mouth{H6310}, that shall I speak{H1696}{(H8762)}."

Numbers,23,2,And Balak{H1111} did{H6213}{(H8799)} as Balaam{H1109} had spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}; and Balak{H1111} and Balaam{H1109} offered{H5927}{(H8686)} on every altar{H4196} a bullock{H6499} and a ram{H352}.
Numbers,23,3,"And Balaam{H1109} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Balak{H1111}, Stand{H3320}{(H8690)} by thy burnt offering{H5930}, and I will go{H3212}{(H8799)}: peradventure the LORD{H3068} will come{H7136}{(H8735)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} me: and whatsoever{H1697} he sheweth{H7200}{(H8686)} me I will tell{H5046}{(H8689)} thee.

Deuteronomy,9,19,"For I was afraid{H3025}{(H8804)} of{H6440} the anger{H639} and hot displeasure{H2534}, wherewith the LORD{H3068} was wroth{H7107}{(H8804)} against you to destroy{H8045}{(H8687)} you. But the LORD{H3068} hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} unto me at that time{H6471} also."
Deuteronomy,9,20,And the LORD{H3068} was very{H3966} angry{H599}{(H8694)} with Aaron{H175} to have destroyed{H8045}{(H8687)} him: and I prayed{H6419}{(H8691)} for Aaron{H175} also the same time{H6256}.
Deuteronomy,9,21,"And I took{H3947}{(H8804)} your sin{H2403}, the calf{H5695} which ye had made{H6213}{(H8804)}, and burnt{H8313}{(H8799)} it with fire{H784}, and stamped{H3807}{(H8799)} it, and ground{H2912}{(H8800)} it very small{H3190}{(H8687)}, even until it was as small{H1854}{(H8804)} as dust{H6083}: and I cast{H7993}{(H8686)} the dust{H6083} thereof into the brook{H5158} that descended out{H3381}{(H8802)} of the mount{H2022}."
Deuteronomy,9,22,"And at Taberah{H8404}, and at Massah{H4532}, and at Kibrothhattaavah{H6914}, ye provoked the LORD{H3068} to wrath{H7107}{(H8688)}."
Deuteronomy,9,23,"Likewise when the LORD{H3068} sent{H7971}{(H8800)} you from Kadeshbarnea{H6947}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Go up{H5927}{(H8798)} and possess{H3423}{(H8798)} the land{H776} which I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} you; then ye rebelled{H4784}{(H8686)} against the commandment{H6310} of the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, and ye believed{H539}{(H8689)} him not, nor hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} to his voice{H6963}."
Deuteronomy,9,24,Ye have been rebellious{H4784}{(H8688)} against the LORD{H3068} from the day{H3117} that I knew{H3045}{(H8800)} you.
Deuteronomy,9,25,"Thus I fell down{H5307}{(H8691)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} forty{H705} days{H3117} and forty{H705} nights{H3915}, as I fell down{H5307}{(H8694)} at the first; because the LORD{H3068} had said{H559}{(H8804)} he would destroy{H8045}{(H8687)} you."
Deuteronomy,9,26,"I prayed{H6419}{(H8691)} therefore unto the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, O Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, destroy{H7843}{(H8686)} not thy people{H5971} and thine inheritance{H5159}, which thou hast redeemed{H6299}{(H8804)} through thy greatness{H1433}, which thou hast brought forth{H3318}{(H8689)} out of Egypt{H4714} with a mighty{H2389} hand{H3027}."
